Growth sometimes gets this reputation that it's just pure metrics hacking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:08):\nYou've worked at three of the most successful consumer subscription products in the world. What do you think is the biggest missing piece that people don't get about building a successful consumer subscription product?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:18):\nUser retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don't retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nNoam Levinsky, he said that I need to ask you about the biggest monetization win that you found at Grammarly.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:31):\nThe lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions. What if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing? All of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nWhat's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building teams?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:00:54):\nI saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy, but they didn't necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. Sometimes experience could be a crutch, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI. A lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:13):\nToday my guest is Albert Cheng. Albert is known as one of the top consumer growth minds in the world. He led growth and monetization at three of the most successful and beloved consumer products in the world, Duolingo, Grammarly, and now Chess.com. Earlier in his career at YouTube, he worked on streaming and gaming features used by over 20 million people.\n\n(00:01:32):\nHis unique approach to growth blends marketing, data, strategy, and product management, and in our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including his explore and exploit framework to find growth opportunities. His biggest and most interesting growth wins at Duolingo, Grammarly and Chess.com, how he uses AI to accelerate his growth work, what he's come to realize about the power of brand and community in your growth work, his top experimentation, best practices, why his goal at every company is to run 1,000 experiments a year and so much more.\n\n(00:02:02):\nA huge thank you to Erik Allebest, Noam Levinsky, and Jorge Mazal for suggesting topics for this conversation.

Albert, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:04:33):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nI'm even more excited to have you here. So as I do for every podcast conversation, I reached out to a bunch of people that you've worked with that know you well to find out what to ask you about and what topics to spend time on. Jorge Mazal, who is famous in my world for writing, what was for the longest time, the most popular newsletter post on my newsletter, it's actually people have usurped it now, but it was stuck there for a long time. So here's what he wrote. \"It is a mystery to me how Albert is able to do what he does. I am actually eager to listen to this episode and learn from him.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:05:10):\nThat is super nice. Thank you, Jorge. I've learned so much from him. I'm the type of weird person that likes to wake up before their kids and pull up a bunch of browser tabs and look at experiments. So it was perfect that Jorge brought me into the growth world at Duolingo, learned a ton of best practices, and he's just a great guy. Thanks, Jorge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):\nWe're already getting into these tactics. I love it. Let me just give a little framing on what I want to do with this conversation. What I want to try to do is to help people learn tools and mental models for finding growth opportunities for their own products and essentially learn the growth mentality that you bring into the companies and products that you work on.\n\n(00:05:48):\nWhat I want to start with is to give us a little insight into how you became what you became. There's an interesting pattern I found across a bunch of recent guests, which is many people were very good at piano when they were younger and were very serious piano players. For example, Head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley was almost going to become professional jazz pianist. You were very serious as a piano player earlier in your career. How did you go from pianist to one of the top growth minds in the world briefly?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:06:18):\nWell, that's very flattering, but I appreciate it. Yeah, I grew up playing a lot of piano. My parents were immigrants from Taiwan and I was the oldest kid that they had, and so I definitely felt that strong encouragement, if you will, to learn a bunch of things, take them seriously, study hard, and so I did. And my parents, even though they weren't musically proficient, they had a deep love for classical music.\n\n(00:06:45):\nSo I was the stereotypical baby that would listen to Mozart, I guess when I was sleeping type of thing. And I still vividly remember we had this upright Yamaha piano, and at the very top of the piano we had this countdown clock from 90 minutes. Literally every single day of my childhood, just practice really, really consistently.\n\n(00:07:04):\nAt first, I really was irritated by that thing, but as I grew older, I started to appreciate music quite a bit more. But anyway, I think what really accelerated my interest and abilities in piano was I feel like I hit the lottery. I had perfect pitch, and so I was able to quickly understand whether I was playing the right stuff or the wrong stuff and just pick up music pretty rapidly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):\nWhat does perfect pitch even mean? Does that mean which note is playing?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:29):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:29):\nOkay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:34):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:34):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:35):\nSo I could listen to a song and then just a very, very clear understanding of which note I'm supposed to start with and if I'm playing something wrong. So it's very helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:35):\nUnfair.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:07:44):\nIt's unfair. Definitely. So anyway, yeah, I got quite good as a teenager in high school and even considered studying at a music conservatory. My intrinsic motivation for music wasn't necessarily as strong at that point, and so I decided to go to engineering school instead, but that would've been an incredibly different career. And to your original point around the relationship between music and growth, I didn't really reflect on this until recently.\n\n(00:08:12):\nI have a four-year-old and I'm starting to teach him how to bang on the keys a little bit, but a couple things stand out. One is that I think music and growth, they both rely on this just consistent repetition. You're constantly making mistakes. You have this super tight feedback loop. You have to get really resilient to just making mistakes all the time. And you know that the way of learning is through those mistakes. So that's a thing that I learned very early, and the second thing that occurred to me is that they both have this structural underpinning to them.\n\n(00:08:45):\nWith growth, you have a growth model, you have metrics, you have experiments, you have channels, things like that. But you also need on a day-to-day basis to have creativity, you got to come up with interesting solutions or hypotheses to test. And the same is true on the music side. You have music theory of scales and stuff, but to create beautiful music, you need that passion, that emotion, that flow. So I think that's the beautiful combination between the two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:09):\nFun fact, my wife bought me piano/singing lessons for Father's Day recently, and I've gotten really into this stuff. So I'm learning how to play very basic piano now and learning to identify notes and hit notes with my voice.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:24):\nNice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:25):\nWhat a weird new thing.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:25):\nCould be your next act.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:26):\nIt could be. I could go the reverse, I could become a professional piano player. Oh man. No, it's so fun, so hard though. I'm just like, my fingers are like, how do you do four freaking keys at once? I'm just like \"What is going on here?\" Okay, so let's get into the meat of it. I want to talk about growth.\n\n(00:09:42):\nThere's a very specific framework that as we were chatting that I think would be really helpful for people to hear and learn from you. You call it explore and exploit. I think there's a bunch of different ways to think about this. Talk about this framework and how that informs the way you think about growth.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:09:56):\nYeah, I initially came up or heard with, heard about explore and exploit through my engineering partner at Grammarly, Nermal, and I think he actually had taken some reforged classes. So maybe the original inventor of it might be Brian Balfour, who I know has been on your pod. But anyway, it's a great concept.\n\n(00:10:13):\nThe gist of it is that when you're in exploratory mode, think of it as finding the right mountain to climb. And then when you're in exploitation mode, it's like focusing your resources on climbing that mountain effectively. And certain companies, I think the warning is to basically spend too much of your time on one end of the spectrum. If you do too much exploration, you can have your team feel a little bit too scattershot, just trying a hundred different random ideas.\n\n(00:10:40):\nWhat's the through line? What's the strategy? How do you pattern match successes across them? And if you do too much in exploitation, which is often the MO of growth teams, it can lead to this saturation and stagnation where you're just locally maximizing a thing. And even though this principle of explore and exploit, it's typically thought of as a macro thing. I like to work with my teams more on the insight level. So I'll give you a concrete example.\n\n(00:11:07):\nSo I work at chess.com and one of our priorities is to encourage chess players to improve, to learn and improve. So one of the PMs that we have, Dylan, he works on all the learning features. The most used learning feature in our product is called game review. So you play a game of chess, after the game is over, we have this virtual coach that teaches you about your worst moves, best moves, et cetera. And his job is to improve user engagement and retention.\n\n(00:11:34):\nAnd so he's in this exploratory phase trying to figure out how do I drive more of that type of activity? And what he observes is that 80% of people that review their games actually do so after a win. And that's really counterintuitive to when we initially built the feature. We thought that people would want to use it after losses or to see their mistakes such they could work on their mistakes. That turned out not to be the truth when it came to the human psychology and the actual data of it. And so we made some changes in the product experience.\n\n(00:12:04):\nWhen you lose a game now as opposed to surfacing your blunders and your horrible stuff that you did, we flip it on its head and so we show you your brilliant moves, your best moves, and we have coach say something encouraging, \"Losing, just part of learning, keep it up.\" That type of thing. That change alone was pretty dramatic for us.\n\n(00:12:22):\nIt grew game reviews by 25%, subscriptions by 20%, user retention by a lot as well. So that was fantastic, but the point is that it doesn't just stop there. You have to take that insight, share it broadly across the company. Now, adjacent product managers like the PM working on puzzles can now think about, \"Okay, how do I audit these cold patterns in my product and think about making them more positive?\"\n\n(00:12:48):\nI can change the success rating, I could tweak some copy, change the color of some buttons, and so you now can take this experiment win and expand it out 10X across your organization and that's the kind of exploitation phase of it. So when done right, you can oscillate between the two until you saturate out of exploitation mode and then you encourage the teams to brainstorm and get more creative again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):\nAmazing. Okay, so there's a lot here to follow up on. One is the core piece of advice when you find something that works really well, find ways to build on that learning. One is here's an insight, it can apply to other parts of the product. \"Hey teams, here's something we learned unexpected. Maybe this can help you. Also, just keep find more, run more experiments in the same zone.\" I imagine is a part of that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:13:34):\nYeah, exactly right. In my experience, the typical win rate, and I hate to use that term for experiments, is often something like 30 to 50%. Usually you're trying a bunch of things, a lot of hypotheses turn out not to be true, consumer products are very unpredictable like that, but when you do find a thing that breaks through the noise, and it could actually be a hugely losing experiment too, those are also super valuable.\n\n(00:13:58):\nSurfacing those across the company, the original PM running that experiment doesn't necessarily need to be the person that figures out what you should do for all the other parts of your product experience, but the onus is on them to clearly articulate what their hypothesis is, what they found such that then as a growth leader, I can encourage people to swarm around that and try a bunch of different ideas such that the success rate is up and the impact is up. So it's just oscillating back and forth between the two. That is the magic bullet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:30):\nI think another takeaway here/something that I think about when I hear what you're saying is there's often a lot more wins in an area than people expect that you can continue to find wins and growth in something for a long time.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:14:46):\nExactly right. Yes. At the end of the day, users, I think within a company sometimes you can have this siloed approach where you break apart the product experience in 50 different ways and distribute them across different teams, and you assume that users interact with each of the different features with a different mentality, but oftentimes that's actually not necessarily the case. And so sometimes, you can surface an insight that's more human psychology based that can resonate across the entire product experience. And so I think when you can find that, you can double down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:19):\nPeople hearing this might feel like, \"Okay, yes, find big wins and then find more.\" Is there something you find that helps you figure out when to explore versus when to exploit when you've exploited too far? Just like any heuristics or I don't know, ways of helping people guide them along this process of exploring and exploiting?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:15:41):\nOne thing that I try to focus on at a company of our scale of a chess.com, right? We're running roughly 250 experiments a year. So we're not the highest in the industry, but we run a decent volume. And so when that happens, I invest in these experiment explorer tools and we can talk about AI as well as another way to uncover and pick out these nuggets of wisdom, but basically, these explorer tools can allow me to look across the spectrum of experiments that are going on.\n\n(00:16:08):\nTry to figure out if there are patterns between the hypotheses and the learnings that are happening. And if I'm starting to see more and more experiments that are not statistically significant, that may be a signal to me to say, \"Okay, we might've tried to exploit a little bit too far. There might not be as much juice to squeeze. Hey guys, let's get back to the table and brainstorm and be a little bit more divergent with our thinking.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:34):\nWell, let me follow this thread on AI and how you're using AI to help you figure this out. That is very cool. Talk about that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:16:40):\nI think one of the latest things that we've been tinkering around with is this text to SQL capability. It's actually pretty powerful. We have this data request Slack channel where for the longest time, and this is still true today, people will toss in all sorts of just one-off questions. How many subscribers do we have in South Africa? Or how long did somebody play puzzles last month or something?\n\n(00:17:07):\nAnd these ad hoc questions, they often take a lot of human time to just go in and a data analyst needs to prioritize it and find time to go run the query. And yes, you can invest in self-serve tooling to improve at this, but also I found that AI is quite good at doing that first pass answer as well. And so we're working on training some of these Slack bots to essentially be the first party provider of a lot of these answers, which makes the company as a whole lot more data informed, I guess.\n\n(00:17:39):\nAnd I think what's also kind of interesting is that just human nature is that if you have a question that you feel like you might be a bit embarrassed to ask or you don't want to bother someone, you just don't ask the question. And so by the nature of having these tools, you get actually a pretty large explosion of questions being asked. And I think you see this in ChatGPT too, right? It's like just having a thing that you can converse with that you feel comfortable in makes a huge difference.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:03):\nOkay, this is extremely cool. So is this something you build basically it's a Slack bot that gives you the SQL query or does it actually do the analysis for you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:18:12):\nNo, it does the analysis. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:13):\nWhoa, so cool. Okay. Is this something you guys are going to release or is this just like somebody, you guys should just build this at every company?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:18:20):\nWe should. It's a good idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:21):\nOkay. Okay. Well, there's an episode where everyone in the comments is like, \"Open source this.\" So we'll see if that happens again. That is very cool. Are there other examples of that kind of stuff that you've done or seen?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:18:32):\nAn adjacent example is a lot of the product managers, we're tinkering around with all sorts of different prototyping tools right now. It's just like go from an idea to a representative solution. Today, there's a lot of humans involved in taking an idea, writing up a spec, doing a review, doing design, et cetera. I'm sure you've interviewed plenty of people that have talked about this specific problem.\n\n(00:18:52):\nAnd so for us, we've invested a bit in at least carving out the main screens of our product experience, things like our onboarding flow, our home screen, our chessboard as an example, and building essentially AI prototypes of those using tools like a V0 or a Lovable. And when you have those foundational pieces, you can then share them with the rest of the company and they can use that as a starting point and then they can try to put their ideas on top of that and then they become a lot more discussable and hopefully testable relatively soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:25):\nWhat's in your AI stack along those lines?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:19:27):\nThe PMs are mostly using V0. The designers love Figmas, they're using Figma Make. The engineers are using a combination of tools right now. So Cursor, Cloud Code, GitHub, Copilot. Marketing teams use all sorts of tools for translation, subtitles, content adaptations, et cetera. Customers support uses Intercom then. So there's quite a lot of tools that are used across the company.\n\n(00:19:50):\nI would say though that something that is annoying to me is that we haven't yet figured out the bridging from the tinkering to the workflow quite as seamlessly as I would like. And so each sub-function, even though the common I guess wisdom now is that AI is going to strip away these functional titles. It is true that based on your experience, you may gravitate to using a type of tool more. And if that tool isn't as interoperable with some of the other tools that you need to pass down the chain to actually ship it into production, at least at our scale.\n\n(00:20:24):\nI think for smaller startups, sure, PMs should just go ship it, but for us, we are still doing some handoffs between functions. I expect that to change over time and we are investing in some of design system components and MCPs and stuff to make it a little bit easier. But yeah, it's an investment and it takes time to smooth things out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:42):\nI want to come back to this topic of how things have changed and how you work as a product person, as a growth person across the companies you've been at. But first of all, I want to talk about another example of finding growth wins and monetization wins. Noam Levinsky, who is Chief Product Officer at Grammarly, you worked with him for a while while you were at Grammarly. He said that I need to ask you about the biggest monetization win that you found at Grammarly and how you discovered the opportunity.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:10):\nI had the pleasure of working with Noam and his product team at Grammarly. Some context first for those that don't use Grammarly. So Grammarly is an AI-powered writing assistant. And so typically, people will use it as a Chrome extension or a downloadable desktop client. And basically what it does is it overlays your writing with a bunch of different-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:28):\nI use it. I'm a big fan. I use it-\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:30):\nCorrection, so you're a big fan.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):\n... And it saves my life.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:21:32):\nFantastic. Glad to hear that. Grammarly is a freemium business model, which means that over 90% of our users are on the free service and the rest of it pay for subscriptions essentially, right? And so one of the teams, they work on subscriber conversion, PM there is Kayla, that team is great and their job is to figure out the free to paid subscription path.\n\n(00:21:54):\nAnd so one of the realizations, one, is that we weren't actually tracking the events that well for the types of essentially suggestions that people were getting and how often were users seeing paywalls and stuff like that. That's kind of step number one. We have to put that instrumentation in. Step number two is that, \"Hey, we noticed, actually first let me explain some of the logic.\"\n\n(00:22:18):\nSo as a free user, you basically get these underlines across your writing and if you accept all of them, then you see the paywall and that encourages you to subscribe for more nuanced features. As a free user, the main things you get are spelling, grammar, they're basically correctness things. And as a paid user you get that, how do you improve your tone to be more empathetic? How do you improve your writing to be more clear?\n\n(00:22:40):\nHow can you rewrite entire sentences, that type of thing. And so the observed behavior from all that tracking and data was that actually a very small percentage of our free users was deciding to accept all of their suggestions. They were more picking and choosing as they go, and I wonder if your experience is kind of similar too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:59):\nDefinitely, yeah. I'm always like, \"Wait, stop rewriting everything.\" Just like this part is wrong. I will fix it. Yeah, I'm very much a pick and choose.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:23:07):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:07):\nCorrection person.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:23:08):\nAnd then the second thing, which is I think equally if not more interesting is that I was at this company during this generative AI transformation, which is obviously still going on. And quite frankly, both the company brand as well as the lived product experience for most of the free users was that Grammarly was just a product to fix your spelling and grammar because those were the free suggestions we were showing people.\n\n(00:23:34):\nAnd so we decided to flip that on its head entirely and we said, \"Okay, what if we actually sampled a number of different paid suggestions and interspersed them to free users across their writing?\" Such that they were intermingled and we would provide a limited taste of what the paid offering had to provide. And on the surface, even though it's rational, the concern is that if we give too much of this away, then will people want to subscribe?\n\n(00:23:58):\nAnd we found completely that was not the case all of a sudden, people were seeing Grammarly as a much more powerful tool than they were before and our upgrade rates nearly doubled just through this change. And so I think this is interesting, just modernization learning that especially if you work on a freemium product, try to have your free product be a reflection of everything that your product can offer you. Obviously to an extent there's some costs involved with some of the paid features and things like that, but it generally will pay for itself if you're able to put your best foot forward and go do that. So that really worked well for us there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):\nI think this is what converted me to being a paid Grammarly subscriber. Wow, what a genius move. So essentially, it's here's a bunch of improvements, but you get three, I think max, and then it's like, \"Okay, now you get upgrade.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:24:51):\nIt's basically a reverse free trial but in real time while you're writing as opposed to a time-based one. So we adopted some patterns that are in the industry, but molded it to Grammarly's specific use case.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):\nRight. I was going to ask, so it's not like a full trial, it's like a capped trial where you get a certain number of things and then you run out and then they get refreshed. I think once a day or something like that is what I found.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:25:16):\nYeah, you got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:18):\nYeah. Grammarly is the best/most devious at their upsells. I'm always just like, \"God damn it, I'm so close to seeing an improvement, I just have to upgrade.\" And it's right there, it's right there where my mouse is.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:25:32):\nYeah, well, I'm not proud of being devious, but.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:33):\nIn really getting me to buy the thing. Good job. What was it? Kayla? Okay, nice job Kayla. It's very effective. I love that. Okay, so in terms of the free trial, I don't know, is there anything there of just, there's always this question of freemium, give things away and then there's pro account, there's like trial versus time. Some features are limited. I don't know, do you have for consumer subscription products like here's the way to go?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:26:00):\nYeah, I think first of all, why do freemium subscription in the first place is a common question that I've joined all these companies that are freemium subscription. What do I like about it I guess? Well one, I think it ties really nicely to mission orientation of a lot of these companies. It's often like you want to spread the product as wide as possible because that's why the founders built the thing, right?\n\n(00:26:22):\nYou're trying to improve education with Duolingo or Grammarly or Chess.com, these are meant to be widespread products with a really wide value proposition that fits globally. And so obviously, the lowest friction to that is going to be a free product. So that alone is part of it. Another part of it is that a lot of these products primarily grow through word of mouth and especially if you can build network effects in the product, like Duolingo has a bunch of social features or with Grammarly, they have a bit of a B2C2B play as well.\n\n(00:26:54):\nSo you see Grammarly being used by teams and by companies and whatnot, and even if users are on the free plan, they still provide quite a lot of value in making sure that Grammarly can be purchased by a coworker or by a team member or whatever. So I think these things are usually why I lean toward make sure that the core value proposition that you're providing users is free and is permanently free and then you layer on a sampling or a taste of some of the premium features that are on top of it. That's usually the sweet spot that I've seen.\n\n(00:27:26):\nAs to the trials, reverse trials type of thing, I think it largely depends. I think if you have especially a B2B feature where you may have some lock-in, reverse trials can be super powerful. You just want to get people in there. You don't need to ask for their credit card because they're using your CRM or they're investing quite a lot of time in building out material and content. And so by the time that window drops, you actually feel, \"Oh man, I probably should keep this and start paying.\" I think for a lot of consumer products it's a little bit harder for that to work. And so I've typically seen more just normal free trials be the norm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):\nLet me follow this thread of just consumer subscription products. I feel like this is the category that every indie developer dreams of building a product in because it's easy to build. Cool, I'll build an app, I add a paywall, and then they realize this is a lot harder than I thought. From a perspective of distribution and CAx and growth like that, is that the biggest missing piece that people don't get about building a successful consumer subscription product?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:28:31):\nYeah, user retention is gold for consumer subscription companies. If you don't retain your users, then a lot of the onus is on getting them to pay on day one, that's super hard. Then you're dealing with totally different business models where you're paying for users, you're trying to aggressively upsell them before they hit any habitual usage patterns with your product.\n\n(00:28:53):\nA lot of apps naturally do that because that's how they break the mold and get their first users to do it, but I don't know, I've been fortunate to join companies after that initial phase, but especially take Duolingo and Chess.com, these are organic word of mouth driven businesses and in both ways, they grew the market from a much smaller market and as opposed to it being a very competitive space where you're competing and taking market share from others and bidding for higher terms and stuff like that. So I don't know, there's something to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:26):\nSo what I'm hearing here is you need to find a way to grow through word of mouth for this to have any chance of success and also retention needs to be very high. Do you have a heuristic of what retention needs to be for you to have a chance building a successful consumer subscription business?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:29:42):\nI think consumer companies tend to track essentially two main types of user retention. There's more of the new user, one, D1, D7, et cetera. I think when you have your D one retention somewhere around the 30 or 40% mark, that's quite solid I think for a consumer app. If it's much lower than that, then sometimes I might question the intent of the user or the ability for that, you to I guess acquire just mathematically acquire enough users such that you can grow a big enough daily active user base.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):\nThat's surprisingly low.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:16):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:17):\nSo it feels achievable in theory.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:18):\nIt's achievable. It's achievable in theory, but there are so many options out there in the market and people are feeling a lot of app and product bloat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:26):\nAnd so just to be clear, you're saying 20 to 30% of people come back the next day?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:30):\nYeah, 30 to 40.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):\n30 to 40.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:30:32):\n40%. I think you're an okay place. I think even more importantly, and you mentioned Jorge to kick this off, but he wrote that very, very popular article about the growth model and how current user retention rate was the biggest thing for them. And I think especially if you have a product that has daily frequency, that's actually the retention that matters the most is that of your existing user base that has developed a habitual pattern, how sticky is your product? And it's that retention rate that really compounds and builds that daily habit.\n\n(00:31:04):\nSo over time, especially when companies mature a little bit, you actually focus most of your energy on the existing user retention mechanics. You find that that's a much, much bigger lever. One exception is that Grammarly was a different type of product and that you install it and you don't proactively open it every day. So that was interesting to me because I assumed that you should always just focus on existing user retention, but for a product like Grammarly, it's actually the activation installation aha moment that's really, really critical and will carry the user for a very, very long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:37):\nThat makes sense. Yeah, the stats would show someone's a daily active user because they're typing things and that's not an accurate step for Grammarly. The other interesting trend I've noticed across successful consumer subscription products is they always start very scrappy and very cost-efficient and spend efficient because I think it's because it takes them a long time to find something that's working and they're surviving on that margin of retention to growth cost essentially.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:31:37):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:06):\nYeah, and the retention piece, that's such a good point. My newsletter is very much along these lines. It's just like how many people are joining every day, how many people are leaving? And it's a difficult treadmill to be on because people, they want to save money, they want to spend on Netflix and things like that. So as amazing as you are, people are always going to leave. So the trick is how do you find more people coming than going?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:32:26):\nYeah, and I think just to take Chess.com example, I think probably 80% of our daily or weekly active users, I'll check the numbers, but something like that would be a current user or an existing user and then a new and a reactivated or resurrected user. Those are actually about similar size for a company of our sale. So even though there's a lot of attention on that new user experience, it's actually pretty interesting that the components of your active user base are actually not heavily weighed in the new user set after you mature to a certain degree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:00):\nCan you explain that a little bit more?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:33:01):\nYes. So after some period of time, you stack up a lot of inactive users in your product and you also stack up sporadic users, people that may not have a daily habit, but they will use it once or twice a week or once or twice a month type of thing. And so eventually that math adds up where you have, let's say hundreds of millions of dormant users that are coming back and it's actually worth spending some time making sure that that resurrected, for lack of a better word, experience inside the product is really excellent and that you find novel ways to try to bring them back.\n\n(00:33:38):\nDuolingo as an example, they did a good job of using social notifications. And so if people would use contact sync or something, you might get a push notification that one of your best friends just started using Duolingo and that might encourage you to come back and resurrect into the product. And whether you resurrected in the product, it might be the case that your proficiency of the language you were learning, you were learning French three years ago, but now you for forgot most of it. And so when you open the app again, it encourages you to essentially replace yourself, do another placement test and put you in the right spot. And so some of these types of mechanics for a more mature company can lead to pretty good ROI guess is what I'm trying to say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):\nGot it. Essentially, so many people have already tried in the past that to grow, you need to resurrect people that have been there. And so thinking through, it's almost like a user experience for resurrected users.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:34:34):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:35):\nOkay. Let's zoom out a little bit. You've worked at three of the most successful consumer subscription products in the world. What is the difference between how these three operate? I think there's many ways to be successful. It feels like these companies are very different. What's the gist of each of these, how they operate?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:34:53):\nWell, first of all, there's obviously a lot of similarities, but I'll just focus my answer on the differences. So I think Duolingo, what struck me most working there is they're very particular, they have an approach of product development that is infused across everyone in the company. And they actually wrote a playbook about this. It's called the Green Machine if you look it up. That was one of my most successful tweets ever really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):\nI just tweeted something about Duolingo just released their playbook and I screenshotted the owl's butt and screened like a page and it was like 5,000 likes.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:35:26):\nThat's hilarious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:26):\nYeah. So yeah, keep going. Sorry.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:35:29):\nBut yeah, the ethos of the company. They hire a lot of intelligent, energetic people out of college basically, and they give them a lot of amazing experimentation, tooling, and they care a lot about the clock speed of the company. So it's a lot of creativity, a lot of ideation.\n\n(00:35:46):\nThe product experience of dual legal actually changes multiple times per day for each user, which is pretty shocking. And so I'd never worked in a place like that before, but it really struck me about how consistently the company operated and they had specs and processes for doing each of those steps in their product development cycle and they were really, really tight about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:08):\nOkay, so that's still lingo.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:36:09):\nYeah, that's still lingo. Grammarly. This is an interesting company because they started as a paid product oriented at students. Then they expanded into more of a freemium model tailored to everyone gradually focusing more on the professional base. And then as they accumulate a lot more professionals, they realize, \"Hey, there's patterns.\" We're seeing that a bunch of marketing teams or a bunch of sales teams or a bunch of customer support teams or whatever, particular functions within particular companies were really adopting Grammarly at scale.\n\n(00:36:41):\nAnd so they were able to then layer on much more of a managed enterprisey motion. And while I was there, I was focused on the consumer self-serve motion, but they weren't siloed. They were intermixed with each other. And so a big part of my job was not just to grow the self-serve revenue and self-serve active users, but it was also how do you uncover the right teams, the right functions, the right companies for demand gen and sales to go reach out to?\n\n(00:37:12):\nSo that was a very interesting, it's a product-led sales work, and it's really fascinating thing for me to learn. And then on top of that, with all the transformation going on with generative AI, and even recently with them acquiring CODA and Superhuman and becoming more of a productivity suite, the company is just evolving pretty rapidly. It's a really exciting thing for me to be a part of and to see from the sidelines, but that just made it at its core of a different growth job than Duolingo for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nEssentially a B2B business versus a very consumer business?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:37:43):\nYeah, and a lot more meaningful strategic decisions as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:44):\nMm-hmm.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:37:47):\nAnd then the core product team also, I'm used to in growth, laying out the entire user journey that a user go through acquisition, activation, engagement, so on and so forth. And typically, growth teams, if they're well-resourced, they can do enough to move each one of these various levers. And it's just a matter of the sequencing of them and what you want to prioritize first. But Grammarly was unique in that the core product experience itself was what drove repeated activity.\n\n(00:38:18):\nIt's that I previously mentioned that current user retention thing, what most drives that is the frequency and the quality of the suggestions that you get every day. And so it was an interesting learning in that I staffed up a growth team, tried to work on this metric, and then I realized actually I'm just getting in the way. This is really a thing that the core product team most influences. Let me have a conversation with the core product leader and then shift that over to them. So yeah, just a super interesting experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:45):\nAnd then Chess.com.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:38:47):\nThe thing that's most unique about chess.com is that they're super fanatical about chess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:54):\nMakes sense.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:38:55):\nCrazy. You shouldn't be surprised. Obviously the name of the company is like this, but they've always hired people from around the world. The company's always been globally remote. They just hire people that love chess. They play all day, they watch the streams. Our Slack is always blowing up with people's chess moves and games and whatnot. I think I want to say this a little bit delicately, like Duolingo, even though the product they're providing is around language learning, I think the original ethos of how to start the company was really around motivation.\n\n(00:39:29):\nThe hardest thing to its habits, it's how do you build that daily habit? And I actually in many ways see language learning as their first vehicle. And what they have a superpower in is that, again, the motivation, the habits, et cetera. So that's Duolingo, and Grammarly actually similarly. People know them for the spelling and grammar corrections, but what's really unique about them is they're integrated across tons and tons and tons of applications.\n\n(00:39:55):\nThere's not many products that work like that, that's really unique. And so now if you hear Shishir, their new CEO talk about the AI super highway and all that type of stuff, they can now use that technology to provide a lot more than just grammar writing. And so my point is just that Chess is about chess 100%. It's in the ethos. People are crazy passionate. That just means we're always dogfooding the product. There's just an amazing energy in the company to just use the product all the time, come up with ideas, and I love that environment. I think that's fun for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:28):\nThat is so cool. What I love about what you're saying is there's no right or wrong answer. All of these companies are killing it. I think Duolingo is worth like $10 billion, something like that, and keeps growing. I'll look it up in a second. And Grammarly is worth a ton, and then Chess.com is doing super well. So I think that's a really interesting takeaway here is you can succeed in a lot of different ways.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:40:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:52):\nWhat's really cool about Duolingo, I was just thinking as you were talking, is yeah, it's just interesting that this very structured, methodical way of building is working so well because you could listen to that and be like, \"Oh, I don't want to work.\" This is rigid way. But the fact that it is killing, it tells us this actually works really well. If you find something that works, lead into it.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:41:11):\nYeah, that's right. Yeah, the structure is rigid, but the ideas are the farthest away from rigid as possible. You have seen their, I don't know, Superbowl commercials, they're memes, gamification, tactics. It's a super fun creative environment. So rigid is the farthest possible word to use, but what I just mean is they're consistent. They have for everything, and their product reviews are 10 or 15 minutes. It's just people go in and out. So it's just this kind of a surreal environment about how rapidly and consistently they work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nAwesome. They're worth $12 billion, and they were much higher actually, not too long ago. They're coming down a little bit. So speaking of Duolingo, when people think Duolingo, they think of the brand and the owl and the success they had on TikTok and things like that. I'm curious to get your take on as a very growth-oriented person watching that work and your take on growth, experimentation data versus marketing, viral TikTok videos, mascots, things like that.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:42:09):\nYeah, I used to think it was versus, but now I realize that they combine really well. It could be rocket fuel for your growth. Yeah, being a product person. I joined a lot of these companies literally on the home screen on my phone, and I like using them. And I consider myself someone that's not easily swayed by ads or TV commercials telling me what to buy.\n\n(00:42:28):\nSo I always had an element of skepticism on the marketing side for much of my career. But then, yeah, you join a place like Duolingo and you see how Duo the owl has developed a personality through the push notifications and the product experience, and then seeing the marketing team leverage that personality in their TikTok and in their YouTube and all throughout social media and just feed into those memes. And then we would track back in the product experience, how did you hear about us?\n\n(00:42:58):\nAnd put all those channels in there. And some days, it would be like, holy, it's bringing in 20, 30% of our new users and any given day. So those two things really go hand in hand, and that feeling has only been reinforced by Chess.com over the last five years. The first 15-ish years of this company was really under the radar. 800 million people play chess around the world, but most of that is over the board.\n\n(00:43:25):\nUntil recently, there wasn't actually that much online, but five years ago, everything changed. You had the pandemic, you had Queen's Gambit, you had a lot of YouTube and Twitch streamers, you had a bunch of kids playing it in school, et cetera. And so it's really the combination of those two things that make it take off. And it's like the growth experimentation is more the slow and steady or fast and steady, I should say, approach where you're just continually iterating, you're making the product experience better, but then every so often, there's a big wave that comes in. You can quadruple your registrations overnight and you'd be a fool not to take advantage of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):\nI was actually speaking at Chess.com and playing chess. I was at a coffee shop this weekend. There's a family, a dad and mom and a daughter ordering, and the dad's sitting at the table and he's just on his phone, just opened up Chess.com secretly and just plain while he is waiting. Oh man.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:44:18):\nI will not admit or deny that I've done that before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:22):\nBut if I can think of anything more wholesome, I can't. That's an amazing thing to be doing while you're just sitting.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:44:32):\nMy 4-year-old can actually set up the pieces, which is pretty great. So he enjoys the game quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:36):\nOh man, this 4-year-old already a pianist, playing chess.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:44:39):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:40):\nWhat a stud. This episode is brought to you by Miro. Every day, new headlines are scaring us about all the ways that AI is coming for our jobs, creating a lot of anxiety and fear, but a recent survey for Miro tells a different story. 76% of people believe that AI can benefit their role, but over 50% of people struggle to know when to use it. Enter Miro's Innovation Workspace, an intelligent platform that brings people and AI together in a shared space to get great work done.\n\n(00:45:08):\nMiro has been empowering teams to transform bold ideas into the next big thing for over a decade. Today, they're at the forefront of bringing products to market even faster by unleashing the combined power of AI and human potential. Just of this podcast often share Miro templates. I use it all the time to brainstorm ideas with my team. Teams especially can work with Miro AI to turn to unstructured data, like sticky notes or screenshots into usable diagrams, product briefs, data tables, and prototypes in minutes.\n\n(00:45:37):\nYou don't have to be an AI master or to toggle yet another tool. The work you're already doing in Miro's canvas is the prompt. Help your teams get great work done with Miro. Check it out at miro.com/lenny, that's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. Okay, you talked about AI a little bit here and there.\n\n(00:45:55):\nI want to follow that thread. As a growth person, imagine AI informs chess.com in a lot of ways, so there's kind of two buckets here. How is AI changing the product, say chess and other places you've worked? And then how is AI impacting your work as a growth person? So pick one or both buckets and share there.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:46:13):\nYeah, I'll tackle them in sequence. I'll start with the chess one just because I have maybe a slightly unique take on that one. So chess and AI, they've been intertwined for almost a century. Some of the early computing pioneers, they just figured, \"Yeah, chess is an interesting game. We can test machine intelligence and write some algorithms or not.\" And then fast-forward to 1997, and you had IBM, they had their DeepBlue application who actually beat the world champion back then, which was Garry Kasparov.\n\n(00:46:43):\nAnd that was a huge moment of shock and reckoning of like, \"Oh man, is AI going to take over? Humans are, we're going to have jobs and all this stuff.\" And this is 30 years ago, and thankfully we're all still here and more people are playing chess than ever. And so the game of chess and chess.com specifically have learned how to augment, I guess the human playing experience with the power of chess engines, which are definitely a powerful form of AI. It's not LLMs to be clear, but there's engines like Stockfish these days that are just dramatically better than the top grand masters in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:22):\nIs that where we're at? I remember when it beat humans and now it's just dramatically better.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:26):\nIt's dramatically better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:28):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:28):\nYeah, I think there's a rating system that compares relative skill level and an average chess player somewhere like a thousand, maybe 1,500 on the high end, a top grandmaster like Magnus Carlsen, it's like a 2,800 and then Stockfish and similar engines are like 3,600.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:45):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:45):\nAnd so to put that in comparison, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:48):\nAt least it's not 10,000 or a million. I don't even know if that's possible.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:47:51):\nNo, it's not 10,000. But it's similar to if the chess engine was playing without a major piece like a rook or something, they would still be competitive against the best players.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:59):\nAnd this is the Elo score? Is that the term?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:48:00):\nYeah, the Elo score, Elo rating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):\nMagnus is what you said about 2,800, and then the Stockfish is would you say 3,600?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:48:04):\nYeah, and really it's because computing power is so amazing and there's so many techniques for how to do deep evaluation on specific chess lines. They can calculate tens of millions per second. So it's not realistic for a human to compete against that. But yet, watching some of these chess engines played has opened up a lot of creativity, new strategies, new lines, new appreciation for the game. And our chess.com approach is that we can bring this technology for every user.\n\n(00:48:36):\nEven people that have never moved a piece before. I talked earlier about that game review product, that's exactly what this does. So behind the scenes, we're running chess engines to basically spit out evaluations for every move that you make. And then we translate that and make that approachable to the user using their native language and plain approachable style, and even with audio and things like that as well. And that part of it, the personality, the speech back to the user, that part is LLMs.\n\n(00:49:07):\nAnd so I guess my point is that, again, chess and AI have been intertwined forever, but for us, what's most important is that we keep the customer at the North Star of it. We're not just applying LLMs just because the new hot thing, you've got to apply the right technology for the right feature to provide value to the user. And so we try not to ever lose sight of that and let hype get us too carried away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):\nIt's just really surprising. I think people would not have expected AI and cannot beat every human alive ever. And chess is at an all-time high. People want to keep playing and are playing more and more than ever played, not unexpected.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:49:46):\nInterestingly, LLMs themselves are quite bad at playing chess. They hallucinate moves, they look at patterns. They're very good at pattern recognition, but not so good at going super, super, super deep on a specific chest thing. And if you've even tried to create or look at chessboard images on ChatGPT, a lot of them have the wrong number of squares. They're not set up properly, and so I don't want to be too dismissive.\n\n(00:50:09):\nI'm sure it's going to get much stronger at reasoning. And actually, Google recently sponsored a tournament where all the top LLMs played a tournament against each other. So that was pretty fun to watch. They're improving, but chess is specifically a game that having a trained deep, deep computing engine is just going to be much, much, much more powerful than LLMs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:30):\nAnd not to go down this track too far, but AlphaZero famous for beating the Top Go player. Was that trained specifically for Go? Obviously not in LLM, but that was a Go specific model.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:50:42):\nYeah. My understanding is that the one, that documentary is incredible, by the way. I don't know if you've watched AlphaGo, it's amazing how they took something so technically deep and made it so emotional and human. But I think that's the crux of how we feel, I guess, about AIs and the products that we build, actually. But to your point, my understanding is that the way AlphaZero is primarily trained is that it just plays a bunch of games against itself. And so through the neural network, it just gets smarter every time. And because it can have that repetition times a billion or a trillion, I don't know exactly what number, but it's going to get pretty damn good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:19):\nOkay. Let's go back on track to where we were going. So this was how AI is impacting chess.com. How is AI changing just the work of a growth person?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:51:30):\nI like to describe growth as the job is to connect users to the value of your product. And in order to do that, what I like to do is think about that user journey again, and essentially, staff teams that are oriented around each element of that user journey. And those teams have specific metric goals, they have roadmaps, et cetera. And then they go run against them.\n\n(00:51:52):\nSo that's how it's structured. AI, I think can be applied to speed up some elements of that essentially experiment cycle that you get through. So one example is in product discovery. As opposed to core product, which tends to have longer timeframes, and you might do thorough user research or market research. It's more foundational, more for first principles, et cetera. Growth is a little bit less like that.\n\n(00:52:18):\nIt's like you're running a lot of experiments and the output of any given experiment is the input to your next idea. And so historically, I don't even mean historically, but just a few months ago, we were operating in a, that's history, I suppose, but there would be a lot of manual writing of these analysis docs. You'd have to read them, you'd have to understand what insight you want to grab from them and then write another spec to translate that idea. That's still happening to some degree, but I think that's a spot where even tools like ChatGPT are super helpful.\n\n(00:52:56):\nYou can just plug in like an analysis that another person wrote and just have it summarized for you and give you advice on ideas to go try. And so that ideation, that research cycle was much, much faster. I talked a little bit about prototyping also just becoming much, much faster than before. We have not yet gotten to the point where product managers themselves are actually shipping the code into production, but it's dramatically shortened the amount of time it takes to conceive of especially a bolder idea that you might have.\n\n(00:53:27):\nAnd so when I talked earlier about explore and exploit, a lot of the explore was harder to do, but now it's a little bit easier to do. You can take a broader concept and visualize it, and when you can visualize it, send it around the team, get people to click around it, that makes a world of difference. So those are just a couple examples that come to mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:47):\nAwesome. I want to go back to this phrase right at the beginning of this answer that you shared that I think is really helpful that you see growth as simply your job is to connect users to the value of your product.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:53:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):\nCan you speak more to that? Because I think that's such a nice way clarifying what is growth's role?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:54:03):\nYeah, it resonates deeply with me because I feel like growth sometimes gets this reputation I guess that it's just pure metrics hacking, like we're cold people that just are trying to move a particular metric up and we're going to do whatever it can to throw walls and pay walls and add friction in all these spots. And even though that could theoretically work at a micro level on a specific feature or a specific metric, I think what's most healthy for a company, and I want to work at durable companies is to think about the user holistically.\n\n(00:54:42):\nAnd when you take that framing of connecting users to the value of your product, that value can change for a user over time, and that also lines up really nicely to the journey. What someone that's not even a user yet needs to understand about the value proposition is super different than what a habitual user of three plus years might need. And so the teams working on them should think from that perspective and then from there, then ladder into specific problems to solve hypotheses, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:15):\nFollowing that thread a little bit more, people listening to this are imagining, \"How do I get better at experimentation? How do I run more experiments? How do we do this better?\" What are two or three tips and best practices that you think people need to hear maybe are not totally aware of when they think about getting better at experimentation on our teams?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:55:36):\nI think the first thing is just start somewhere. I just read this Atlassian state of product report and it was like 40% of product teams basically don't run experimentation at all. And there may be some good reasons for it. It could be philosophical or maybe you're more B2B oriented or whatever. So I get it, but I think for a lot of, especially if you work on a consumer product that has some degree of scale, some degree of frequency with your product, you can collect enough data.\n\n(00:56:05):\nAnd also I have found I can pattern match all day long. I've worked a lot of companies, right? But I'm wrong all the time. And I think consumer behavior can be very fickle and especially when you work at a company, you become a power user naturally. So sometimes you may forget what the actual user experience is for a brand new user, and so you leave a lot of opportunities on the table if you don't even try to experiment.\n\n(00:56:27):\nSo I just encourage taking that first step, just run an A/B test, find a third-party tool or something that you can integrate quickly or even just work with your engineers to spin something up. Just get in the practice of crawl then walk then run type of thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:40):\nDo you have a favorite tool, by the way? Just to throw out? Is there a go-to tool for you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:56:44):\nWe used Statsig at Grammarly and I saw that they recently got acquired, so that was exciting news. Duolingo and Chess.com both have an in-house experimentation approach.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:54):\nSweet.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:56:55):\nPros and cons to either. Obviously Duolingo is an experimentation machine, and so it's been a huge accelerant to have our own thing specifically tailored to be excellent at that. But no, I typically don't encourage companies to build experimentation in-house from day one. At a certain scale it can make sense. And some of these companies, they were started 15 years ago when these tools weren't out. So it was just something they had to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):\nSomething that you mentioned to me at Chess.com, your goal is to run a thousand experiments a year. You said you were at 250. Talk about just that as a North Star.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:57:32):\nYeah, so part of having team members that are fanatical about Chess is that the company can get pretty far just building for themselves, building for the community, and not actually being very experimentation and data oriented. The problem with that is that you can have relatively lumpy growth. And so part of the excitement of me joining the company was to help smooth that out and bring in that experimentation mindset.\n\n(00:57:56):\nSo prior to 2023, the company practically didn't experiment at all. Last year they did about 50, this year they're on pace for about 250. And then next year we have that ambitious target of a thousand. Did I make it up? Yes, absolutely, I made it up, but it's still a target and a thing for the teams to think about and a thousand experiments by itself. If you just did that but you didn't learn, you didn't make an impact, that's kind of a waste of time.\n\n(00:58:25):\nThe whole point of setting a goal is that you can have conversations about what would need to be true to actually hit that goal, and so that leads to insights. Actually we need not just product management or engineering to be running these experiments. We can experiment with lifecycle marketing, changing copy of push notifications and emails. We can experiment with app store screenshots and keywords and stuff like that. We have all sorts of content marketing teams, et cetera. We could have engineering enable no code for specific screens.\n\n(00:58:58):\nThink about our home screen or our pricing screen where we might want to do a lot of just tests that are configurable without engineering support. We might want to just track our progress and look at it from time to time and make sure that we have the right observability around this. So anyway, that's the stuff that really matters as opposed to the hitting that goal itself. So don't tell the team, but I don't actually care that much if we actually hit a thousand, but I think if we get pretty close and we accomplish some of these things, we'll be in really good shape.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:27):\nOkay, we'll make sure none of them watch this. I think chess.com is in, this is just such a cool example of a culture shifting dramatically from zero experiments to sounds like two years later, a thousand, which is three a day. There's many teams running experiments in parallel, but that's a lot. What has helped you most shift that culture? Is it just the CEO being like, \"This is the way we're going to go.\" What have you learned about helping shift to culture from No, we're not doing experiments to a thousand experiments a year.\n\nAlbert Cheng (00:59:58):\nYeah, definitely a lot of credit to the CEO and co-founders like Erik and Danny, they're amazing. It's not their intuitive way of thinking about growing companies, but their mental flexibility and encouragement to evolve and add this as a tool for the company has been awesome, and they've been on the front lines preaching product-led growth and experimentation just as much as I have.\n\n(01:00:20):\nSo I'm glad that you brought that up because I think that is critically important for me, joining a company to not be at odds with the co-founders and the existing approach of the company. I think that's absolutely, absolutely critical. I think I started this podcast with the example of the game review and the positivity and how that was shared. I think those types of things are really what motivate people. They need to see this working in practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:45):\nWins.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:00:46):\nYeah, you need wins, you got to celebrate them. People feel good about the learning. It's applied across the board. Who's not going to be energized by that, I think, right? So you can't just set goals in a vacuum and create it from top, right? People have to see it working and when it works, the metrics move and you learn faster and you ship faster, and that's a great environment to be part of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:07):\nWhat was the first experiment you guys ran? Do you remember?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:10):\nI don't know, before my time actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:13):\nOkay. Okay. Got it. So they're already going down this track before they brought you in?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:17):\nThey had run some.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:19):\nOkay, sweet. Are there any other key lessons that you think people need to know to be successful running experiments at scale?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:01:30):\nThe system matters just as much as any given experiment, probably even more, right? I think starting with a growth model, so you have an understanding of how your company grows in the first place and which channels you're going to leverage is critical. You need to make sure that you are instrumenting your product in and out. Otherwise, you're going to run experiments and have wonky results.\n\n(01:01:53):\nI won't name which company, but I was part of a company that had an in-house experimentation tool. It's about three months into the company, we're running some experiments and we realized that user retention was actually configured backwards. So all positive results were negative results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:09):\nGeez.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:10):\nSo that was kind of embarrassing and that will never happen again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:13):\nYou just go through and undo all those experiments and just drive up retention.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:17):\nIt's kind of weird. We're seeing people use the features a lot more. Why is user retention going negative? So I have plenty of horror stories around that type of stuff, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):\nOh my God. On the flip side of horror stories, you've shared a bunch of cool examples of experiment wins. Is there another that comes to mind of one you're really proud of or that was really trajectory changing either at Duolingo or Grammarly or Chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:38):\nSo I already shared one of Chess.com and one of Grammarly. I could talk a bit about Duolingo as well. Duolingo and you had Jackson on the podcast, right? Where you talked about the streaks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:38):\nYes, talked about the streaks.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:02:52):\nSo I also don't want to steal his thunder because I was going to think about that, but the amount of learning through commitment and putting streaks on a calendar and just getting people started as opposed to achieving some large milestone, that was huge. I think we did something interesting. We spun up a virality team and virality is this really amorphous thing to me.\n\n(01:03:16):\nI think it's really hard to generate virality in your product, but Duolingo is a product that is shared quite a bit. And so we invested actually in some time to essentially add screenshot tracking for a brief period of time in the app just so we could find out the hotspots of where users were doing screenshots. And you see this in other apps too, it's not necessarily some horrible thing, but we did this for some period of time and we were able to basically articulate and say, \"Okay, streak milestones is the obvious one.\"\n\n(01:03:46):\nReally funny challenges that you get in the Duolingo experience is also super highly shared. Advancing in the top three of a leaderboard is another thing. Anyway, so you can find these different moments where that's the case. And then we staffed those moments with illustrators and animators and created these really delightful experiences around them, and that worked amazingly well.\n\n(01:04:06):\nSo as opposed to going against I guess human intuition and trying to get them to share stuff that they otherwise wouldn't on the margins want to share, lean into it more, actually grab the moments where users are already organically screenshotting and make those much, much, much better. And you can 5X or 10X and drive a lot of growth that way too. So that's not so much an experiment, it's more a core product thing, but it just resonated with me that that was interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:33):\nWell, it connects to your explore and exploit methodology. Just find or explore where things are happening and then try to exploit in a nice positive way.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:04:41):\nYou got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:42):\nSpeaking of that, you mentioned this with Duolingo is just very good at habit formation and motivation behavior. It feels like chess is good at this too. You've worked at both these companies. What have you learned about how to motivate people? How to create habits?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:04:57):\nAgain, Duolingo would not have started without this insight from day one. They aim to focus on motivation and build a lot of these tactics. Jorge actually had this model of gamification patterns having essentially three pillars to it. You have the core loop, you have the metagame, and then you have the profile. And so we actually thought about it that way too, where your core loop is your lesson that you go through. You do a lesson, you get some rewards, you extend your streak, and then the next day you get a push notification.\n\n(01:05:29):\nIt's the core loop of the product and making that really tight is super important because people need a habit to stick to. Then you need a metagame, which for Duolingo is the path, but it's also the leaderboard achievements. It's long-term things that you're going to strive to such that you have long-term, I guess, motivation to continue doing the thing. And then the profile is also critical because you build up a profile over time.\n\n(01:05:51):\nIt's a reflection of your investment inside the product experience. And so when you nail those three things, you can end up with a long-term learning journey that can be quite successful. And then to flip over to the Chess.com side, what we see is that over 75% of our new users, they classify themselves as like, \"I'm completely new to chess.\" Or, \"I'm a beginner.\" And unfortunately, if you're new to chess and you're a beginner, you're not going to have that fun of a time playing live games, and we see this in the data. It's like less than a third of those users actually win their first game. And when you lose a game, user retention is 10% worse than when you win a game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nThat's not so bad, but at scale, that's bad.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:06:31):\nYeah, and it could be worse. That's true. And so typically what a lot of mobile games will do is they'll just create a super simplified version of the game. It's harder for us to do at chess, and so without changing the rules of that, I think that's, I don't know, it's just very eye-opening to me when you're trying to learn something, whether that be language learning or chess or whatever, usually those first steps are fraught with a lot of self-doubt and reinforcement that you're not good at the thing. And so it pays to be very intentional to craft experiences that guide the user around that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:09):\nWell, I can't help but ask, is there anything that helped that along?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:12):\nYeah, so something we're experimenting right now is just like purely if you say that you're new to chess, we're going to craft a more delightful learn how to play experience as opposed to dropping into a live game, that's an example. Another is hiding your ratings for the first five times such that you're not seeing your rating plummet. So there's a lot of tips and tricks you can do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):\nI'm just imagining a little guide that's like, \"Here's how you win.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:32):\nYeah, or play against a coach, play against a friend, play against a bot. There's a bunch of different avenues you could take.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nWell, what I'd love is play against someone real and here's where you should move. Just like, \"Hey, here's we're going to help you win.\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:45):\nLike a hint in real-time?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:46):\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:07:47):\nI don't want to be playing with you then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:50):\nOkay. Let me ask you a couple more questions. One is just zooming out a little bit, what's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products or building teams across the many companies you've worked at?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:08:03):\nYeah, I've talked a lot about products. So maybe I'll flip to the team side for a bit. I think the standard way to hire and build a team is you fill out a JD, it's got a whole bunch of different characteristics that you're looking for. You typically will find a short list of companies that are kind of similar to yours, and then you try to hire for that, right? I think that's the typical default path that a lot of companies take.\n\n(01:08:27):\nAnd I was really struck by my experience working at some smaller startups or take Duolingo as an example, where over and over and over, I saw some of the highest performers just being people that had very high agency, had that clock speed, had that energy. Yes, they cared about the mission, but they didn't necessarily need to have deep experience on that matter. And in fact, sometimes that experience could be a crutch in certain ways, especially in this world where the grounds are shifting so fast with AI, a lot of your learned habits actually need to be intentionally discarded.\n\n(01:09:01):\nYou need to have a beginner's mind on this type of stuff. So I think this is more true than ever, looking for people that respond and move quickly and think just faster and move faster. I think the fastest speed of learning, those types of companies are the ones that I want to bet on. I think those will end up surviving and thriving.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:25):\nSo just to double click on this idea of high agency is very trending these days of just higher high agency people. To unpack that a little bit, you mentioned a few of these traits, so let's just help people see what you see. So one is clock speed, just they think fast, they move fast, they learn fast. What else? What else do you look for that helps you see that there are high agency people?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:09:49):\nYeah, a lot of it actually happens outside of the interview process interestingly. So a lot of it is the types of questions they asked, \"Have they actually tried your product and gone deep into it?\" A lot of it is, it's the references, it's the communication that they have to even set up your interview, it's the energy they bring into the conversation.\n\n(01:10:09):\nYou can actually pick up a lot of soft signals on some of these traits over time. You've got to pick up on some of these patterns. I don't know that I'm perfect at it, but I've learned to balance those things quite a bit more than I did in the past when I would just purely read from my questions and my rubric and not care about anything else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:27):\nYeah, there's like a vibes component to it. This is also support for the work trial way of interviewing versus just a talk interview where you have them actually work with you for a week or whatever.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:36):\nThat's a great point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:38):\nOkay. One other question I wanted to ask you. You've worked at a bunch of different sizes of companies from startup to Grammarly, I don't know, you call it a big company, bigger company. Duolingo, I don't know how big is Duolingo?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:50):\nThere are about a thousand people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:50):\nOkay, cool.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:10:53):\nBut I worked at Google too to start my career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):\nOh, right, okay. What have you learned about just the size of company that makes you happy? What have you learned about just helping other people that you talk to decide what size of company is good for them?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:11:05):\nI definitely believe that everyone has a company stage that they shine best at. I've personally gone through this journey of big tech to tiny, tiny, tiny startup, then landed in the middle, which I consider my own goal lock zone. I talked earlier about what actually gives me personally a lot of energy is seeing across a company's efforts, but also the company being small enough that I can get into the details, I can work with the specific teams.\n\n(01:11:33):\nI can read experiment results, I can look at the pixels. And so I find that the balance of those two things tends to fit best with medium-sized companies, but that's me, right? I think at big companies like a Google, you're dealing with immense scale, which is interesting by itself. You learn a lot of best practices from your peers. They have all the tools and functions that you would possibly want to go learn from, but they can tend to move slower and it's harder to ship things and get them out the door, which eventually drove me nuts a little bit.\n\n(01:12:06):\nOn the flip end of the spectrum, these tiny startups, they move incredibly fast, but I grew all my gray hair from those tiny startups because no one knows about your company, and so you're recruiting people one by one. You're trying to get users one by one. So yeah, you can learn fast and ship a lot of things, but if you're trying to make a big impact on the world, it can be actually pretty grueling to do so at really, really, really small startups.\n\n(01:12:29):\nNow, some of them do hyperscale and make it out, and obviously, I am not one to trash that because the path that I tried for quite a while. But for me, I really like the zone where I can contribute at scale, but also execute at a pace that's more on the daily and weekly scale as opposed to monthly and quarterly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:50):\nAnd when you say medium, what size of company is that roughly?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:12:53):\nYeah, so these companies that we've talked about in the podcast are about 500 to a thousand people. Typically, these companies who have been around let's say 10 to 20 years. They're durable, ideally profitable, have a good leadership team, but there's still a lot of dimensions to go figure out. A lot of them are in key inflection points, so they're certainly not stagnant. You need to find a place that's dynamic too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:17):\nInteresting, 10 to 20 years old, I don't know if that's a, not many people would feel like that's where I want to be. I love that you found a number of companies like that that you enjoyed working at. The last question, and this is going to be taking us to a recurring segment on the podcast that I call Failed Corner.\n\n(01:13:35):\nPeople hear all these stories of all these experiments and all these companies that worked at, they're all killing it up into the right. In reality, you've touched on this, a lot of things don't work out great. So can you share a story when something went wrong, when you failed and what that taught you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:13:50):\nFirst of all, in the growth world, you're failing all the time. So I'm not going to pick a specific growth story because those don't actually hit my ego too much. But earlier in my career I did a lot of core product work. I worked for this startup called Chariot. I don't know if you ever lived in San Francisco, but.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):\nYes, it was like the bus super thing.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:14:06):\nThe blue commuter shuttles, like 15-person shuttles, they would essentially drive from various neighborhoods into downtown San Francisco. It's a commuting use case across between the public bus system and an Uber and Lyft. So I was there for some time. I led product there and the core service was really loved by its users. It was reliable and fast and affordable enough, but we got pretty interested in this idea that maybe we can improve utilization, maybe we can make the service a little bit more innovative if we offer dynamic routes more similar to Uber and Lyft.\n\n(01:14:46):\nHow could the drivers are driving these fixed routes? But if they have spare time, they can go out of their way, go pick up somebody at their house or something and keep going. So we tried this, we called the chair direct, really interesting attempt, but I learned a lot of lessons there because ultimately it didn't work out. One lesson is like this was kind of a solution searching for a problem. You never just purely want to chase A, it wouldn't it be nice if we did this as opposed to this is our user and this is the problem that we're solving, this is why it's going to delight them, et cetera, that's one.\n\n(01:15:20):\nSecond is you got to consider, especially in these more marketplace type businesses, there's more than just one end user and we focus so much of our attention on the writer app without realizing, oh yeah, the drivers are carrying a lot of the brunt of this experience and our operations team is as well. And so when the drivers are confused or disgruntled, that can lead to a challenging overall experience for the product. So that's definitely another one.\n\n(01:15:50):\nAnd the third one is we did a lot of actually PR, prior to the service going out just to get the word out. And PR has its time in place, but I think doing it before you have validation that customers definitely want, the thing is quite risky and it can lead to a lot of sun cost once you get it out because you need to see it through, you want to see it succeed. So yeah, this is a decade ago, honestly, I had a great time at that company, but I still remember that vividly because it contained three or more key lessons that carried forward as I have built many products since then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:28):\nYeah, it feels like you went to the complete other end run experiments of everything before you tell anyone about it.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:33):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):\nYeah, I remember the chariot bus showing up at the Airbnb office and people getting, I'm like, \"What the hell is this?\"\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:39):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):\nVery cool. I didn't know you worked there. Albert, we've covered so much ground everything I was hoping we'd cover. Is there anything else that you wanted to cover, anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:16:56):\nNo, this is great. I hope it was useful for your listeners. I will say over the last few days, as I was prepping for this, I was honestly a little bit anxious about do I have enough deep independent frameworks that I need to come up with? But just being authentic to my actual experience at these companies, a lot of my lessons learned have been off of the backs of other people that have tried similar things and have succeeded or failed.\n\n(01:17:21):\nAnd I think what's important is that you have that your mental sponge. You can try a bunch of different things, you can absorb them and then put them in practice right away, discard the things that don't work and evolve them for yourself and for the company's needs. And so I don't know, I think that was just a realization that I had as I was thinking through this podcast, and I think that's partly why I haven't done too much public speaking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):\nI know exactly what you mean. When I left Airbnb, I was just like, and that was the first time I ever took a break in my career of 30 years of just working straight in school. I was just like, what have I actually learned? I've never just sat down and thought about, here's the thing I've learned. And that led me to writing this medium post that did really well what I learned at Airbnb, and then that basically led to what I do now. So there's a lot of power and I love that this is the excuse to make you think through what have I learned concretely that I can share.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:17):\nThat's right. Thank you for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:18):\nYeah, and so at the beginning of this podcast, before I started recording, I always like to ask guests, what is your goal? What do you want to get out of this conversation? And usually, it's like we're hiring. We want to make sure people know about our company or we want to get the users. And your answer is just, I just want to give back things I've learned, which I love.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:36):\nThat's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:37):\nAnd you've done that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:44):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:45):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:18:51):\nYeah, so the truth of it is I have a, not just the four-year-old, but I also have a one-year-old. So most of the books that I'm reading these days are kids' books, trying to make them laugh in all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nWait, any favorite kids books? Because I have three or two year olds already.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:03):\nWell, you said that you started singing. There's a book called Snuggle Puppy that has a song in it that just makes my daughter crack up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:11):\nOh my God.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:11):\nThat is heartwarming for me. But no, a book that I recommended recently at work is Ogilvy on Advertising. Do you know this book?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nI don't know the book. I've seen these tenants of marketing or whatever.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:19:23):\nYeah, it's interesting. So it's 40 years old, but it's just packed with a bunch of different practical examples about copy and creative that work in, these are old school ads, but he took a very experimentation-oriented approach to just try a lot of things.\n\n(01:19:38):\nI think in the book, it makes a good reminder that what ultimately matters is to compel your users to some action for him as buying a product, right? It's not about just creating clever ads or sexy creatives, it's to do things that compel that action. I think that's very true for many of our product and life cycle teams. And so I shared that around as an interesting recommendation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:02):\nIs there a movie or TV show? Sorry, were you going to share another book?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:08):\nYeah, actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:10):\nOh yes, please.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:11):\nOur co-founder at Chess.com, his name's Danny Rensch, and he is quite well known in the chess circles. He's releasing a memoir called Dark Squares, and it is super fascinating. He grew up in an abusive cult and was a chess prodigy. And so it is just this unbelievable story and I'm about halfway through it, it's a reminder that sometimes the people that you work with, you don't realize how deep their pasts go, but this is something else, and I think it should be out by the time this podcast releases.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nAnd it's called Dark Squares?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:46):\nDark Squares.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:47):\nWhich is a reference to the chess board and also I imagine the difficult past.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:20:52):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):\nWow. How cool. Okay. Are there movie or TV shows you really enjoyed that you've recently watched?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:00):\nThese days it's football season, so I'm consumed by all the hot takes of my favorite teams that I love and the teams I love to hate as well, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:11):\nWho's your team?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:13):\nThe 49ers. I have season tickets and I go all the time. We had a rough season last year, so hoping to turn around.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:20):\nOkay, very cool. Okay. Is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:21:25):\nYeah, so last 20 years of my life roughly, I've moved around a lot, but I've always been within walking distance of a coffee shop. It's just like a ritual that I go and get coffee and it starts my day, right? Two years ago, I bought a house and for the first time ever in my life I'm like not buy a coffee shop, and I was so depressed about this for a little while.\n\n(01:21:45):\nSo my favorite product is the bread bowl barista, and it just starts my day off. I like making horrible latte art with it, and I think it's just a reminder. I don't know. The products that most impact me, I guess are the ones that I use all the time, and it's a daily habit-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):\nAnd have the most caffeine.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:22:06):\nThen the most caffeine. You got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):\nAmazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself using in work or in life?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:22:14):\nAs I was thinking about my piano stories, I also remember that my mom used to have a quote. She just said, \"Nothing is more important than your reputation.\" And she used to say this, and I think the charitable understanding of this is that a lot of the small decisions that you make each day, how do you treat people? How do you show up? What's your character, et cetera. They can compound and they open doors for you in many surprising and amazing ways.\n\n(01:22:41):\nA lot of these companies that have actually joined have come through relatively light connections. And even just being on this podcast, I think I've seen a number of folks that I've worked with before beyond the show. And so I think doing the right thing, building a good reputation, they can carry you a long way. And the flip side of that is reputations are fragile too, right? So if you do the wrong thing, take a long time to repair that. So I don't know, it just stuck with me my entire life. I thought that was an interesting life motto.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:13):\nLast question. You work at Chess.com, how's your chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:16):\nTerrible compared to serious, serious players, but quite compared to the casual ones, yeah. My yellow rating is about 1,800 for a rabbit games.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:25):\nIt sounds really-\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:27):\nAnd about 1,500 for blitz. Yeah, but I play many times every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:31):\nBlitz is like fast chess?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:32):\nBlitz is like faster chess, three minute games. Rapid is more like a 10-minute game, which is still pretty fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:38):\nAnd you say you play multiple times a day? Do they make time? Is this like-\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:42):\nThey do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:44):\nOkay. At Patagonia, there's a famous book, the founder wrote called Let My People Go Surfing, and the rule at Patagonia is you can go surfing if the waves are great. Is that how it works at Chess.com?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:53):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):\nOkay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:23:55):\nChess is always fun. So we play all the time and they even have chess coaches on staff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nStaff, just like you can book to do?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:01):\nYou can book. So I get bi-weekly lessons and it's helping me improve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:04):\nWow. Okay. This is going to drive a lot of hiring for you guys. Saved it for the end. Albert, this was awesome. Thank you so much for doing this. Thanks so much for giving back and sharing all these stories. Two final questions, work and folks find you if they want to follow up on some of this stuff, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:22):\nYeah, thanks for having me. This was great. You can find me on LinkedIn or Twitter. Not a super active poster, but I read it all the time. If there's something that I said today that resonates with you and you just want to get in touch, trade notes, feel free to reach out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nAnd can they play with you on, can they find you on Chess.com to play?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:39):\nThey can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):\nOkay. Do you want to share your username or you don't want that?\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:44):\nI am happy to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:45):\nNo. Okay.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:45):\nI just mentioned that I'm a 49ers fan, so my username is Go9ers, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:49):\nWow.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:50):\nI'm sure I'll get a lot of game requests now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:52):\nHere we go. Here we go. 1,800. Okay. Albert, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAlbert Cheng (01:24:56):\nYeah, thank you so much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:58):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

What it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy at a time when people are struggling to understand basic facts and struggling to understand each other. That means that impact for us is growing subscribers, but it's also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:00:40):\nWhen you're a product manager, you're involved again in driving specific metrics like engagement or subscribers, but you're also trying to help stories find their real audience in ways that trigger just this whole different side of mission and purpose driven impact. I didn't feel that when I was at a place like Facebook.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Alex Hardiman. Alex is Chief Product Officer at the New York Times where she leads teams that build the company's news, cooking, games, audio, and advertising products. Prior to this role, she was Chief Product Officer at The Atlantic, and before that, she spent two years at Facebook where she led their news product amongst other things. As you'll hear in our conversation, Alex has been at the center of the storm so many times, including at Facebook right after the 2016 election.\n\nLenny (00:01:33):\nThen, at the New York Times right as COVID hit. She hears so many stories and insights about how the New York Times builds product, what it's like for product teams to work with journalists, what's good and bad about working at a company like the New York Times versus FAANG tech type company, and also how they went about acquiring and integrating world. I had such a blast doing this interview and I hope that you enjoy it as much as I did. With that, I bring you Alex Hardiman. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly.\n\nLenny (00:02:19):\nThat's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I actually use Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, slide reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with pen tool or put their own images or mockups right into the Miro board. With one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovery and research, to product roadmaps, to customer journey flows, to final mocks.\n\nLenny (00:02:57):\nWant to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferriss and Lex Fridman. I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens.\n\nLenny (00:03:48):\nI like to think of it as a little safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently, they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies, and internal testing that they do. Three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day, and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health.\n\nLenny (00:04:25):\nTo make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one-year supply of immune supporting Vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Alex, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:04:52):\nThanks so much, Lenny. It's really awesome to be here with you.\n\nLenny (00:04:55):\nWhat's interesting is I think you may be the first product leader on this podcast who doesn't work at a big tech FAANG startup, and so I'm really excited to just dig into see what it's like to build product at a company like the New York Times.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:05:08):\nThank you. No, no, that sounds awesome. Let's dive right in.\n\nLenny (00:05:12):\nOkay, before we dive in, I'd love to get a little bit of background on just your career. I'm curious, what was your career path to becoming the chief product officer at the New York Times?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:05:23):\nThanks for asking. I've definitely spent most of my career right at the intersection of journalism and tech. I think in hindsight, if you were to ask my family, they probably wouldn't be that surprised, even though for me I was just rolling with it and following what felt like a really interesting set of problems to solve. But when I just look at my family, there is a ton of journalism in our DNA. My grandfather was a news anchor on the West Coast and I really revered him. My great-grandmother, she was pretty amazing. She actually started one of the first TV stations in the Midwest back in the '50s when it was still pioneering territory.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:06:01):\nFor me, one of my first, the dream for me was to try to find a way to build things in the new space. That's how I first ended up at The New York Times. I've had two stints at The New York Times. My first stint was for a decade, from 2000 to 2016, and it was during a really interesting time of pretty big transformation. There's so much to talk about within that decade, but I would say there are two really big things that happened in that moment. The first was really trying to work with the company to shift from being a print first product into a mobile first product. If you go back to 2006 and you think about it, the Times had no mobile presence whatsoever.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:06:40):\nEven the iPhone 2G and the App Store didn't come out I think until like 2008. We just really started investing in small mobile use cases, first on the margins and then more and more aggressively until we were just leading with mobile in everything that we did. New journalism formats, new product features, new revenue opportunities, that type of thing. Then, the second big thing that marked my journey at The New York Times was the shift to a direct to consumer subscription model. This was back in 2011, and there was just a lot of skepticism, including from people at The New York Times, about whether or not people would pay for quality journalism.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:07:17):\nWe brought in consultants and they said, \"Maybe over the course of history it'll get to one million subscribers, if you're lucky.\" It felt like a really big nervous [inaudible 00:07:27] at the time. But thank goodness it helped make a market for paid journalism, that has really helped a lot of news organizations find new ways to support quality coverage. But after a decade I did what I think a lot of people did, was you look around and you say, \"I love what I do, but I would love to go learn how to do product in the context of a product led digital first company.\" That's when I went to Facebook and I left in 2016.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:07:52):\nThe timing is actually pretty important in terms of my experience at Facebook, because when I first joined Facebook, I totally left the media space. I was focused on building out a team that was really trying to help micro sellers in markets like India and other parts of APAC, who were coming online for the first time in really low bandwidth areas, and just wanted to sell their goods through social commerce. Really looking at what WhatsApp and Line and other regional competitors were doing. We were focused on business messaging and the interoperability of the Facebook apps from more of a small business perspective. It was really awesome work.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:08:28):\nThen, the 2016 presidential election happened. I had only been there for a couple of months and as has been discussed very widely and reported widely, it was a wild time where there was just so much reckoning around misinformation, disinformation, election integrity, platform responsibility. I went over very quickly to help out on the news front where I led the product and engineering teams and it was really hard, really interesting work. I did that for a couple of years, decided-\n\nLenny (00:08:58):\nBefore we move on.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:00):\nI'm curious. Okay. Wait, you were leading the news product at Facebook during the election?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:03):\nRight after the election.\n\nLenny (00:09:05):\nRight after the election, after everyone was coming after Facebook trying to tear it down?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:09):\nWow. What year was that?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:13):\nI joined in early 2017 on that effort. The election was November, 2016.\n\nLenny (00:09:19):\nOh, my God. Before you move on, just what was that like? I don't know how one can describe that experience, but what do you think about when you think back to that time?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:09:28):\nI think about wartime product management, right? You're coming in, and I think there was ... What I appreciated about that time inside of Facebook was that there was just this incredible humility that was needed to really understand and first diagnose what was actually happening on the platform, and the approach to content on Facebook historically it was very binary. You basically had content from friends and family and then you had public contents. Public content could come from anywhere. It could come from a reputable news organization or it could come from my younger brother posting something and declaring it to be true.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:10:06):\nWhat we really tried to do very quickly was try to unpack the categories of public content to say that there actually is something that is factually accurate information, and that requires a certain craft from the journalistic trade. There are ways to really look at what is trusted information, how you make that a little bit more essential and visible to people on the platform, while then reducing things that are at best dubious or at worse truly misleading propaganda. It was really fascinating and really hard just because the platform hadn't been built to think about classification of coverage in that way.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:10:44):\nLet alone to have the right goals and responsibilities and incentives. There was just a ton of work to figure out how to make the platform far safer and far more informative after, I would say, a pretty intense election cycle.\n\nLenny (00:10:58):\nYeah. I was going to ask you about this later, but I feel like you're drawn towards just crazy, wild and crazy center of the storm roles. I guess that one you didn't expect necessarily to become that. I imagine The New York Times has a lot of that, but maybe a quick question there. What have you learned about just living in a world of just constant chaos and stress and urgency, endless urgency?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:11:21):\nI would say, if you did ask my family and my husband, he would say that I'm always attracted to the more chaotic problems. I just actually think that that's where product people thrive. The idea of being able to take all of these crazy inputs, trying to create a very structured model to figure out, \"Okay, what is true? Where do we have conviction? Where do we have questions? What are the most important problems to solve? How do you prioritize? How do you get a team rallied around a shared context in one single goal? These are actually the conditions where product manager, I think, thrive.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:11:55):\nFor me, just having been in the journalism space for about two decades now, it's just been or the tech space around news, it's just been a constant set of upheaval and transformation. Some things within our control, some things entirely outside of our control, and so I love it. For me, there's nothing else I'd rather be doing than trying to solve these problems in the world at scale. But it does take a certain amount of just grit and resilience, and the ability to really focus on the most important problems in a given moment. Also, the ability to let other things slide when you have to.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:12:32):\nBut again, I feel like these are core product skills that we look for in terms of leadership and grit, and the ability to drive through really, really tough problems that there's no playbook for, nobody has ever really done before.\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nYeah. You said PMs thrive in this. I think some do. Some are like, \"No, leave me out of that.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:12:48):\nI guess that's true.\n\nLenny (00:12:50):\nThere's a metaphor I like to use when I give PM's advice on where to work within a company, which is there's like the Eye of Sauron, which is the number one most important thing to the CEO at that time. My advice is often don't avoid that thing, usually, but work maybe to the side of that because you don't want to work on something that doesn't matter, that's like over in the shire land. You want to be something that matters but not maybe the most important thing. I feel like you're the opposite. You're like, \"Where's the Eye of Sauron focused? I'm going to go there and build stuff.\" That's pretty awesome.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:20):\nAwesome, sometimes, I'm sure there are moments too where it would be nice to chill, but I am drawn to those types of problems for sure. This feels like therapy, Lenny. I'm into it.\n\nLenny (00:13:31):\nTell me about your mother.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:34):\nShe's wonderful.\n\nLenny (00:13:37):\nOkay, great. That's the end of that one. I'll let you finish your career overview and then-\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:13:42):\nI feel like we're almost at present, which is I found that there was so much incredible experience that I was able to soak up and lean at a place like Facebook. For me, I really wanted to figure out how to apply that back into organizations that just had more of a classic journalistic mission and purpose, so I went to the Atlantic for a year. They had just been purchased by the Emerson Collective, so it was a really fun moment of just investment and expansion and ambition. We launched their consumer business. Then, I came back to The New York Times in late 2019, right before the pandemic, and I've been there ever since.\n\nLenny (00:14:19):\nOh my, just your timing is impeccable every time.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:14:22):\nIt really is.\n\nLenny (00:14:24):\nI was doing some research on you before this chat and when you came back to The New York Times, there's all these stories about how big of a deal it was. Returns to The New York Times. That must have been something coming back, because you're there for 10 years initially, and then you came back. What was that experience like just coming back to something like that after being away?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:14:43):\nI felt really lucky. When I left The New York Times back in 2016, it was on really, really good terms. It almost felt as like, I'm going on an externship and I really hope that one day I'll be able to come back and just do my job better. Because I do think there's real value in being able to do product in a bunch of different contexts. You're just so much better at pattern recognition, learning how to solve a diversity of problems, learning to work through things. I had a lot of great support when I left, which was really important. I don't think everyone necessarily has the privilege of that support when they exit a company. When I came back, it was just a real moment of excitement. My interview process, I joked with my boss at the time. But it did actually feel more like therapy.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:15:30):\nWhen you've worked with people for a decade before and you go in, the conversation isn't the normal list of interview questions. It's like, \"Okay, here's what type of leader you were a couple of years ago. Here are the conditions on the ground now, how do you feel about X? How do you feel about Y? Are you still passionate about solving this? What else have you learned that's going to make you better?\" It was wonderful. It was one of the best interview processes because you're talking to a bunch of people who knew what you were like when you were leading as a person at a different point in your career and they're pushing you to be better. I felt like I got the best chance of a lifetime to come back and try to do my job better than I had been able to do it before, and that's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (00:16:12):\nYou've been there three years at this point?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:16:14):\nYeah, three years on Halloween, so coming up very soon.\n\nLenny (00:16:18):\nOh, wow. That's three days from now when we're recording. I wonder when this comes out. I'm curious, at a company like New York Times, which is, I imagine people think when they think product, they think it's the newspaper. At Airbnb we have this challenge where when we talk to hosts, \"Here's the product.\" You're like, \"What is your product? Is it our homes?\" You have to help people understand, \"Okay, when we talk product, we mean the website and app.\" What do you think of the product at The New York Times? Then, is it a challenge to help people understand, here's what the product team does?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:16:46):\nIt's a really good question. At the most basic level, I would say that our product is our journalism, which we then marry with a really compelling and useful user experience, in a way that helps people really act on our journalism so that they can understand and engage with the world around them. For about 150 years, our product was pretty simple. It was a printed newspaper, which is still very beloved today, but the UX of the newspaper was, it was a predictable structure. It was a very finite amount of news. It was time bound, which I think is a really lovely thing in terms of setting expectation. It also has the packaging of the newspaper just such serendipity, where you can move across news, opinion, culture, games.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:17:31):\nIt's a really great bounded product in and of itself. But about 25 years ago, when we started shifting over to digital, the web, and mobile, the world just fully opened up in a way. We just saw this really tremendous disaggregation and distribution of our journalism. We really tried to meet the moment by building a wide array of products in the news space to extend our reach. Our products then, our digital products were our website, our apps, newsletters, we dabbled with a lot in the VR/AR space early on. That was, I would say, the first big extension of our products. When we then pivoted though to a subscription model, it was a really interesting moment where we actually had to take more of a destination first approach.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:18:15):\nIt was almost like the beginning of us rebundling all of what we did, but on our own destination again, in digital destination. Because in order to build a really thriving subscription business, you really need a direct relationship with your customer as opposed to just relying on platforms to really distribute your coverage. That's where, again, we really started rebundling the breadth and depth of value that people once found in the Sunday newspaper at digital scale. Now, today, our product bundle includes even so much more than news, which I hope we'll talk about a little bit more later. We've really scaled our products in a bunch of different categories where we feel like we can really help people understand and engage with the world.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:18:57):\nWe have cooking, we have games, we have sports, we have Wirecutter, which is a great innovation surface. We're playing with a new audio app all around audio journalism. We have now six fully fledged different product destinations. The next thing for us to do is to really figure out how to put those together into a bundle that really becomes the essential subscription for any curious English speaking person around the world, who really wants to know what's happening and wants to be able to, again, act and engage and make great decisions based on the products that we build.\n\nLenny (00:19:36):\nGot it. It sounds like the strategy is a subscription bundle where you just keep bundling awesome stuff into this bundle. It's an obvious thing everyone has, whether you want cooking or games or The New York Times online.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:19:48):\nI think that's right. We did this pretty great exercise and strategy projects over the last year. We took a look and we said, \"What is the largest addressable market where The New York Times can be truly valuable every single day to a group of people?\" What we found was that there are about 135 million people around the world we believe are willing to pay for the type of high quality journalism based products that the New York Times produces, in the categories of news, gameplay, cooking and recipes, sports, which is why we acquired the athletic shopping recommendations and audio. In order for us to really capture as much of that audience and really serve them well, there are really three things that we need to do to make that essential subscription work.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:20:37):\nThe first is we absolutely need to have the best news destination in the world. When you think about the New York Times, we actually have the solar system metaphor where for us news is the sun in the sense that it's why we exist. It is what gives us our brand heritage and reputation. It's what instills trust. It's also where we just have the largest audience when you think about a funnel for our portfolio, and it's also where we just have the most amount of high quality coverage. But then that sun helps you give birth to other satellite planets or products that have a lot of the same DNA. Again, like great trusted journalism, great journalists who just have real expertise.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:21:16):\nA great product experience that allows you to really unlock that value distribution reach, and the other ingredients that you would need for successful products to work. We're really focused on building out beyond news products that really help people engage with their passions and life needs that go beyond news. Then, the third thing is what you're describing as the bundle, how do we create a connected family of products that puts all of those things together so that wherever you come into the New York Times, to news or maybe through Wordle, you know that you're having the best experience within that category.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:21:49):\nBut then you also can quickly experience and discover everything else that we offer. That's the strategy and the vision, and it's a huge ambition. We want to get to 15 million subscribers by 2027. We're just over 9 million today, and I really think we can do it.\n\nLenny (00:22:06):\nAwesome. I actually wanted to chat about goals and how you think about success as a product team. I imagine the north star metric is what you just said, which is subscribers. If that's true, what other goals do you have across teams? Maybe even further, I'm packing a lot of questions into one question, but I'm curious just how your product team looks. How many PMs do you have? Roughly, how do you structure the teams? Then, roughly, what kind of goals do they all have to try and imagine the product team at New York Times?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:22:34):\nLet's start with structure. First, I love this question talking about my team because I love hyping them. They're amazing, and our success is truly only as good as our people. Yeah, it is so true. For us, when we think about our org structure, the way to set that up so that our people can really do their best work is that we have two axis. We have functions and then we have missions. I oversee two functions, which is the functions of product and design. The functions themselves, it's normal of what you would find in terms of functional responsibilities. We focus on standards of craft and excellence, career growth, career frameworks, equitable promotion processes, community of practices, skill development, all of that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:23:21):\nBut missions is where a lot of the work happens. These are cross-functional teams, very similar to what we had at a place like Facebook. These cross-functional teams are led by usually a general manager, a product leader, or an engineering leader. They're all pursuing the same high level goals and objectives. Cross-functional missions at the Times, it can include a lot of the same skill sets that you would find at a tech company, PMs, engineers, designers, data scientists, researchers, product marketers. But the big difference is we also have editors, if it's a product space that directly shapes our journalism. I can talk more about that because it's a pretty interesting differentiating factor.\n\nLenny (00:24:02):\nYeah, that's super interesting. There's a journalist within cross-functional product teams?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:24:05):\nExactly. But we have three different types of missions. We have consumer missions, we have monetization missions, and we have platform missions. Editors are embedded within consumer missions. Those are the missions that I oversee, where we're focused on creating really great products, again, in categories like news, cooking, games, audio, et cetera. That is where having editors involved, particularly like editors who are very product minded, it brings in the best of their expertise and marries it with a lot of the normal signal that you look for in terms of data research and other insights. When you're trying to make sure that you understand a consumer problem and that you're really finding the best creative solution for it.\n\nLenny (00:24:48):\nCool.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:24:49):\nIt is really cool. It's one of the, I think, most gratifying parts of working at a news organization like the Times. But if you work on a different mission, like a monetization mission, we have two really big ones. One is subscriber growth, the other one that's also really important is digital advertising. They build centralized commercial products that we can then scale across all of the products in our bundle. The subscriber growth team, for instance, they look at making sure that we have really great account ID management for subscribers. If you're buying a subscription through games or through news. Or, if you're on the digital advertising team, you're trying to make sure that we have a first party data program that's really privacy safe, that works as well in cooking as it does in the news space.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:25:33):\nThen, there's a totally different third bucket of mission that we have, which is all of our platform teams. This is everything from monetization platforms like our commerce engine, which is so important, because we're a subscription business, to data platforms where you might have our ML platform or experimentation tooling, to just basic infrastructure. Those are shared across the bundle, which just really helps make it so much easier, more efficient for really engineers to ship code and do their best work. A lot of this actually, I think, probably is pretty familiar to how you might organize at a tech company minus the editors.\n\nLenny (00:26:14):\nAwesome. On that info piece, that reminds me of something I definitely wanted to talk about, which is something New York Times is really known for is the visualizations and these immersive stories that you all put out. I'm so curious just how that gets done. I feel like if I was on a product team at a regular, like a big tech FAANG company, I'd be like, \"Shit, all these ad hoc things I got to do for all these stories, such a pain in the butt.\" That's so important to the New York Times and the online experience. I'm curious just like what is it like to build these things, say the election widgets, and all of that stuff?\n\nLenny (00:26:47):\nThen, I don't know, I was just reading a story about climate change and it's this really beautiful immersive story of just what is happening with the world. There's a bunch of questions there, but I guess roughly just how does that get done, something like that?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:27:01):\nWell, first, thanks for saying that. I really appreciate it. I do think there's something really special about some of the ways that we marry the journalism and the presentation. I want to start just by giving credit where credit's due, which is I think some of the most interesting and inventive and compelling formats, they actually do start off as one-off experiments that are spun up in the newsroom by embedded teams that we have within graphics, visual journalism, interactive news teams. This is where we have editors, journalists, engineers, data scientists, designers, literally all hunkered down together focusing on how to make one story come to life in the best possible way.\n\nLenny (00:27:37):\nWho has the idea usually? Is it like the journalists working on that, they're like, \"Hey, I think we should make something really great.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:27:42):\nExactly. Yeah, one of the things ... We have a newsroom of over 2000 people. You basically have people who've been experts on certain beats like climate, for instance, for decades. They have the nugget of the idea. They start to do reporting and then they really pull in others from visuals, from interactive just to say, \"How can I really make sure that I can tell this story with as much impact and weight as possible?\" That's where the magic starts to happen, when you pull in all of those other skill sets together to help dream up how that story might be told.\n\nLenny (00:28:18):\nThey're like, \"Alex, we need one of these for our story. Can you get us on the list?\" How does that process go?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:28:26):\nNo, no, no. These are teams that are really autonomous in the newsroom. For one-off, truly special features, I'll give you an example of one that I found to be particularly powerful. I don't know if you read Jodi Kantor, who is one of our ... a really incredible investigative reporter. You might know for some of her work that she did around MeToo and Harvey Weinstein, in that investigation.\n\nLenny (00:28:46):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:28:47):\nShe recently did a piece on how employers are tracking and monitoring remote workers with tools like productivity scores. The story itself was designed to show a person's own productivity score in the moment as they read the article.\n\nLenny (00:29:02):\nOh, shit.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:29:02):\nIt was super visceral, really creepy in the most effective way. In my mind, that's the type of magical experience that only happens when you actually have dedicated designers, engineers, and others who can really sit down with a reporter to say, \"Let's figure out how to shape that story in the most magical way.\" The speed of news is so fast that you don't have time to mess with roadmaps. We really have teams who are freed up from some of the normal processes around that, so they can really just focus on storytelling for really big stories and pieces. But on top of that, what we do have is a storytelling product team. What they do is they really take notice of things that are starting to work in more of the experimental phase, some of these one-offs.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:29:50):\nThen, they work closely with editors to test and find product market fit for new formats that can actually scale across many parts of the report, so that over time when you open the app, the app is more accessible, more engaging, because we still have the traditional story based article, but we're also shifting more of the distribution of stories into video, into visuals, into live. If you even look at live, we've broken out of the tyranny of the article in many ways, where you have live reporter updates that are the size of length of tweets. People filing from the ground in Ukraine, trying to give you a sense of what's happening in a very immediate and real way.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:30:31):\nThat's where we do have teams, product teams who have to think in two modes. First, they have to be able to think in the moment with editors, where you might not always have all the right data at your fingertips and you just have to make a call, like, \"What is the best experience to tell this story in a really truthful, accurate, accessible way?\" Then, the other mode is when they're not shipping at the speed of news, they're trying to build end to end systems so that we're building the tooling to actually create the stories at the same time as the consumer experience, which is a totally different mode of system level thinking.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:04):\nIt's a very cool space. That product team is, they're pulling off some pretty incredible work because they can operate in those two modes. It's like, in the moment, in the moment of the story, but also trying to build the systems that allow you to reshape the composition of storytelling formats that we have across our products over time.\n\nLenny (00:31:23):\nThat is super cool. What percentage of these fancy stories are using that platform and building on something that already exists versus a one-off experiment would you say roughly?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:32):\nThe majority are on our platforms hands down. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:36):\nOkay. That makes sense. Then, just so I understand, so you said Jodi was the journalist?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nYou mentioned. Does she has a product team dedicated to her work?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:31:45):\nNo, what we have is we have a centralized interactive news team, graphics team, data journalism team. Those editors partner with different journalists when they have really big stories to help bring their story to life.\n\nLenny (00:32:00):\nI see. Do they have to come to this team and be like, \"Hey, I'd love your time.\" How does that prioritization ... Because I imagine a lot of journalists are coming to them like, \"Hey, my story is going to be awesome. We need you.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:10):\nYou know what? To be totally honest, I'm not involved. Somehow it works.\n\nLenny (00:32:19):\nThat's a great leadership sign. It just works and you set it up and it's working, so that's great.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:25):\nWell, and the newsroom has set it up and something that is just, again, very interesting about the way that we are set up is that we have our newsroom and then we have our business side. The business side is where you have all of the product teams and there is intense collaboration between the two, but they do have different leadership structures because that's how we maintain the independence of our coverage. Our product teams sit within the newsroom if they're focused on storytelling, live, anything related to the coverage.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:32:54):\nThe only distinction really that I think I'm trying to make is that product teams really help stories find their widest audience and be as engaging and as impactful as can be. But product teams don't have any influence over the selection of the stories. That is what the newsroom retains as editorial.\n\nLenny (00:33:14):\nOkay. You mentioned Wordle and you all acquired Wordle recently. I'm just curious what that was all like. I imagine it's still being integrated. Were you involved in the exploration and purchase process and what went on there?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:33:28):\nWordle has been such a fun ride. Maybe I'll first just bring you behind the scenes on how the deal came to be, and then we can talk a little bit more about what the integration process has been like.\n\nLenny (00:33:37):\nYeah, sounds great.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:33:37):\nI first heard about Wordle in early January because a New York Times reporter, Daniel Victor, actually wrote a piece about Josh Wardle, who's a software engineer in Brooklyn, and how he had created the game. It really is this gesture of love for his partner, and I certainly wasn't the only person to read through that column. Everyone inside the New York Times perked up. I remember reaching out to Jonathan Knight, who's the general manager of games, he's on my team. He had already taken notice well before the piece was published, and he had already reached out to Josh to see if he would be interested in having games join our portfolio.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:34:16):\nWe just all loved Wordle immediately because if you've played it, it shares a lot of the DNA of other really successful word games that we have at the New York Times, like Spelling Bee or the Crossword Mini. If anything, Josh was really forthright that he created it because he was inspired by those games. Then, in the context of just our subscription strategy, games is such an important category for us. We really see games and demand for games as this, basically, it's a counterpoint to the news. It gives people a chance to actually take a break. It's fun. It doesn't feel like empty calories. It's really time well spent.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:34:54):\nWe were just thinking of Wordle as such a wonderful addition to our games franchise to really give people more reasons to feel like they had a relationship with the New York Times every day. The whole thesis of the acquisition just made so much sense. Our team just very quickly engaged with Josh and the acquisition talks were incredibly fast. The whole thing took place in a matter of weeks, which is way faster than any other acquisition I've been a part of. It was a very amicable process. We were just super delighted to bring Wordle on board, but it happened in record speed.\n\nLenny (00:35:27):\nWell, yeah, it felt fast from the outside too. It became a huge deal. Then, \"Okay, New York Times buys them.\" Yeah, it's impressive. You said you acquired Athletic. How often are you acquiring companies?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:35:37):\nWe also acquired The Athletic, and that was back in around the same time. I think for now we feel like we actually ... we have all of the major categories to make the essential subscription work. For us to get to 15 million subscribers we really feel like news, sports, games, cooking, audio and shopping, those are the categories, and we just have to make them the best possible versions of themselves, those products, so that we can really provide just tremendous value every day to people. That doesn't mean that we won't make some other acquisitions. The next Wordle would absolutely love to hear about it.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:36:14):\nBut I do think there's also a real lesson for a lot of companies, not only about when you acquire what's the opportunity, but also are you ready to actually integrate an acquisition? We learned a lot just around Wordle in terms of what that process is like. I just want to say I'm really proud of how thoughtful and considerate our games team was about the integration process, because Wordle players feel such connection to the game. We really wanted to make sure not to interfere with the core magic of the experience. If you are an eight-year old kid or an 88-year old adult, there's real resonance with Wordle and people just have such a connection to it. We really wanted to make sure we didn't mess it up. Do you want to go a little bit deeper, just almost what that looks like?\n\nLenny (00:37:00):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:37:01):\nBecause we definitely learned a lot. When we acquired Wordle, it was a simple web game with no backend. That meant that people's stats and streaks, which was that was the value in terms of social currency that people were sharing after playing, those stats and streaks were stored in local browsers. It was really important for us to make sure that the game board experience in the core loop of the game remained unchanged. But we also found that because everything was stored locally and people care so much about their stats and streaks, if they got a new iPhone, if they switched browsers, all of a sudden they lost all of that history that they had with the game.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:37:39):\nWhat we decided to do was undertake a project to connect Wordle to a New York Times account, which was free, because Wordle is a free game, just so that it knows who you are and so that your stats and streaks can be protected. Then, we could also bring Wordle to more surfaces because we wanted ... if you go to the homepage of the news app or if you go to the games app, we wanted to make it easier to find because people would come for Spelling Bee or Crosswords and they also wanted their Wordle. It was a pretty big effort to rewrite Wordle in our tech stack, give people the ability to store their stats and streaks, bring games to all of our major surfaces.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:38:16):\nWe just tried to do it in a thoughtful way, where we didn't break anything. The experience was hopefully seamless, and that the only thing you would notice that's changed is that the New York Times knows enough about who you are so that your stats carry over and you can play anywhere. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some surprises along the way, especially when you're doing backend work. We had this pretty crazy moment a couple months ago, right when the Supreme Court's draft ruling on Roe v. Wade leaked. An engineer on the games team happened to notice that the Wordle solution the next day was fetus. Which is just an extraordinarily bad coincidence, because the word had been loaded into the game by the game founder months beforehand.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:39:02):\nIt was so important for us that we didn't have ... this lovely diversion from the news feel almost like it was commentary on a very contentious story that was happening. I don't know if you caught wind of that, but you'd think that you could easily change the word on the backend, but because we were midstream on the migration process and some users were on the original Wordle game, others had migrated to the new version. It meant that we actually couldn't change the word on the backend for everyone, only for some people. This was a moment where we just had to come out and really tell the world, \"We're mid integration. We're really not trying to communicate more than Wordle being a fun diversion from the news. Here's what happened, and why.\"\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:39:50):\nEveryone understood. This is where coming out being really transparent about the facts and in some cases just exposing more about the product development process really helps demystify some of the rumors that people might otherwise think. It was one of those like, \"Oh, man, I couldn't have imagined that that type of terrible coincidence would happen.\" But you just have to be prepared for everything, even when you're integrating what should just be a fun game.\n\nLenny (00:40:16):\nImagine, no matter what you tell people, some folks are just not going to believe a very simple explanation of what was going on.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:40:23):\nIt's true. All you can do is be as honest and transparent. What I will say is a lot of people still think we try to make Wordle harder, we don't, I promise. It's not a thing.\n\nLenny (00:40:33):\nYeah, it's not like the crossword puzzle where it gets harder every day of the week.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:40:38):\nNo, no. It's not, it's not.\n\nLenny (00:40:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.\n\nLenny (00:41:17):\nIf you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta, over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.

Get started today. Are there any other stories that come to mind that reflect just how interesting/wild it is to work at the New York Times as a product leader?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:42:12):\nIf we could of go back to when I started at the New York Times, because I started in late 2019, it was just right before the pandemic. It was pretty wild to come back to the company and to get shifted into this moment of needing to build products that really were trying to help people through the moment. At a time when our journalists were covering the story and all of New York Times' employees were trying to live through it. It was COVID 24/7 in terms of work and life. For me, I remember in the earliest days when we were first really reporting on COVID and learning about it, we had reporters on the ground in Wuhan even before we knew how COVID was transmitted.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:42:52):\nThen, when the world shut down, for the Times, we went fully remote in March, 2020, and I remember the day so well because it was the beginning of spring break, of course, all plans were canceled. My kids, I had no idea what to do with them. My husband and I panic packed, put them in a car, drove to go see some friends in Vermont, and we decided we were going to do a kid daycare pool share just to figure out how to keep working with someone overseeing the kids. We got there late at night and I literally just went into a laundry closet and I didn't emerge for two weeks because my Slack was blowing up about all of the work that we needed to do to make our products as useful as possible.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:43:32):\nThe kids were being crazy and we just had to get to work. What was really stunning about this moment in time was that as people were getting sick and we were reporting about all of the trends that we were seeing, we saw that other institutions, especially the government, were not actually stepping up to help people understand the basic facts about what was happening. This is a product leader, it's a real wartime moment where you just need to blow up roadmaps, share context with everyone and say, \"Okay, everyone, we have a totally different mandate than what we did a couple weeks ago.\" Given the needs in the world and the mission of the New York Times and our purpose, which is to help people access information to make informed decision about their lives, we're going to do a whole bunch of these things.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:44:17):\nWe're going to build a comprehensive public data set of COVID cases. Nobody else is doing it. We really just started scraping and pulling this together, and what was a single spreadsheet at the time. We pulled a bunch of engineers from other teams to go help build out that database. We launched entirely new formats and data tools to make our journalism a lot more easier to follow. Things like tools to be able to look up infection rates and eventually vaccination rates down at your local zip code level. We made our most important COVID coverage free to everybody. It was really important that if it was something related to public safety, we didn't put it behind a paywall.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:44:53):\nOur mission is to do better than that. We really made sure that we had that information available to everyone. We also just found that for journalists who hadn't actually been in Wuhan, they just needed tips to an internal safety guidance for reporting, and so we made that publicly available. It was just one of those really interesting moments where everything felt so crazy in this moment of crisis. But building purposeful products that made a really difficult moment feel not only possible but promising, was one of the most unifying moments, I would say, for our teams.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:45:29):\nBecause even though people were working so hard and balancing work life and personal life, no one doubted for a second that the work they were doing was of greater good for the world. There's real privilege in being able to spend your time doing those things. But it's one of the biggest news stories of our lifetime and to be at the forefront of that, I think for all of us, was a pretty incredible and humbling experience.\n\nLenny (00:45:55):\nWow. People talk about having impact and driving impact and it's usually like, move this metric some percentage, but that is some incredible impact. Helping people avoid COVID, avoid dying, keeping their families safe. It's got to be some of the most fulfilling work that you and your team has done and ideally it wouldn't have happened, but it was also probably incredibly fulfilling.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:46:20):\nThank you for saying that. One of the most validating tricks that we did look at was we realized that at the height of the pandemic, when there was just so much confusion about literally what to do, how to live each day in March, 2020, we saw that half of the country came to the New York Times. There is something again that is just so powerful about very straightforward data journalism, deep reporting, service guidance on how to make a mask if you don't have one. Just like all of these basics. Just seeing the whole organization pivot from their normal job into this mode and was pretty incredible, and the world responded, which was really validating too.\n\nLenny (00:47:00):\nI imagine there's also a bit of burnout that happens working, where it goes on and on and on. You're like, \"Oh, my God, when is this going to slow down?\" How do you help people avoid burnout? How do you catch burnout as a leader on a product team?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:47:15):\nThis is one of the most honestly, hard and important topics that I think we're always still grappling with. As a company, we really did try to lead originally with giving people more time off, more support, like financial support and other assistance with daycare, health benefits, all of the basics. I think now what we're really trying to do beyond that is be so much more focused on the things that we need to do and all of the things that we're really happy to stop doing. Because part of, I think, context switching is one of the things that is really, really difficult. It's hard to context switch in your job.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:47:53):\nIt's really hard to context switch across your job and your life. There are a lot of things that we as a company can't necessarily control in people's lives, but within the job, the places where we can be so much more focused and thoughtful about the small number of important things that we must do at a given point in time, that's really the place where we're really trying to come in and be as empathetic and as honest about what we need to do and what we don't need to do. A lot of it really comes down to, I think, making hard calls. We're not always perfect at it. I'm sure that there are things that we could be more diligent about.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:48:27):\nBut I would say over on balance, we've seen a lot of people stay at the company because they're figuring out they work remotely, maybe they come back to the office. They're figuring out how to live their life in a very different way from a couple of years ago. We're really here to try to meet them and make that as possible as possible. We need incredible people across a bunch of different skill sets, a bunch of different backgrounds. The only way to do that is to really be very flexible and accommodating in terms of trying to meet people where they are in their lives, but it's tricky.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:49:03):\nThere is no perfect answer for this, but we're really trying because the success of the company only works when we have people who feel valued and they can do their best work and live really rich lives on top of that. I think we're all still figuring out what that looks like now that we're starting to come out of the official pandemic and really just learning how to live with COVID.\n\nLenny (00:49:23):\nRight, absolutely. You mentioned that you're all remote now. Is that the policy going forward?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:49:29):\nWe actually just started going back into the office a couple of days per week, which is very encouraged. We're still finding our groove. We do have a good number of people though who are fully remote as well. It's more of an evolution in terms of trying to find the right balance of taking advantage of in-person work, because there are some moments where it really does make such a difference when you have people together working through hard problems in real life. That camaraderie, those relationships really, really do matter. Also, being realistic about the fact that there are a lot of people who would love to work at the New York Times, but might not be able to live in the New York City area.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:50:11):\nSo, how do we make sure that we can be a remote friendly company for them too? Yeah, so we're very hybrid, we're still testing our way through it. But by and large, we're shipping so much tremendous work, which I think is a reflection of us being able to do the hybrid thing and just try to get better and better at it each day, each week.\n\nLenny (00:50:30):\nYeah, it's hard. As an outsider, I can't imagine a New York Times being all remote. It feels like that kind of company just, it's all happening in a building somewhere probably. I'm also a big fan of in-person, it feels like as a company, it feels like you have an advantage if you're working in-person generally.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:50:46):\nWe certainly see that, and so the center of gravity is in New York and is in the office, but again, with a lot of flexibility for people's lives. We're really trying to figure out that balance.\n\nLenny (00:50:58):\nJust a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Where's the New York Times in the next five, 10 years as a product specifically different from other folks? Then, broadly, I don't know, if you have any insights or opinions on just what is the future of news, do share.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:51:13):\nI think the New York Times is in a pretty unique spot compared to other news organizations right now. I have tremendous respect for other high quality organizations like The Journal and The Post and The FT and The Guardian. They're just doing such incredible work. But when I go back to what differentiates us, it's this idea of becoming an essential subscription that really helps people. It meets their most important news and life needs across all of the categories that we've been talking about, like news, games, audio, cooking, et cetera.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:51:44):\nUp until, I would say, this year we were more of a news brand with a collection of adjacent lifestyle products, but with the acquisition of Wordle and the Athletic, along with just the continued growth of cooking and Wirecutter and some of our other offerings, I really do think that has transformed us into a brand capable of really being that essential subscription that helps every single day people with news and life needs in a way that doesn't just associate the New York Times with [inaudible 00:52:12] categories. Imagine that you open the New York Times app and you are starting with a great breaking news story. Then, you skip over to the latest coverage in China.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:25):\nThen, you decide that you want to take a small break to play Spelling Bee, and then you want to plan a Korean dinner party with Eric Kim, who I don't know if you know has some of the best Korean recipes. He's amazing. Then, you're like, \"Wow, I need a rice cooker to be able to make that recipe, so I need to go get the best recommendation from Wirecutter.\"\n\nLenny (00:52:43):\nI just did exactly that, actually.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:45):\nDid you?\n\nLenny (00:52:45):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:52:47):\nThen, I would love to go watch the Britney Spears documentary, which is also part of the New York Times franchise, which is amazing. Or, I want to go listen to Kevin Roose and Casey Newton's Hard Fork podcast, which is wildly fun and just launched a couple weeks ago, if you haven't heard that. This is, I think, the future for us of being a connected family of products, where we can meet so many different needs that are first anchored in news, but then stretched into other facets of your lives. I don't really see other news organizations really operating at that scale and that ambition, and that's the future for us.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:53:24):\nWe really just think that the New York Times can mean so much more to so many more people. We're a journalism company, but we're building just tremendous software, and so the product ambitions are only getting bigger and bigger, and that's why I feel like I've got the luckiest job in the world right now.\n\nLenny (00:53:42):\nThat is a compelling vision. I feel like you can build your own metaverse in the New York Times where you just spend all of your days inside the New York Times' suite of products.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:53:52):\nCan I say though, there is a big difference. I think that for us our software actually helps people with real world outcomes in a very different way. We basically help you get access to information, decide how you're going to go to the ballot box. We give you information to go cook. Actually, there's something that I think is even more of a connection to the physical world, and it is very different from what the Metaverse is doing, but that's where we feel like we can drive as much impact as possible.\n\nLenny (00:54:20):\nYou can have your own competing metaverse. Here's a quick Wirecutter suggest idea for you, while we're chatting. I feel like Wirecutter, I use it all the time, everything I buy is based on Wirecutter recommendations, but I feel like there's an opportunity for design oriented version of Wirecutter. I don't know if anyone's thinking about that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:54:37):\nTell me more.\n\nLenny (00:54:38):\nJust Wirecutter's functional stuff. It's like, \"Here's the best, I don't know, rice cooker.\" But like, what's the cutest but also the best? What's the cross section of looks good in my house and is the best. I'll be okay not the best best if it looks nicer, so a design lens to Wirecutter.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:54:54):\nIf it's Wirecutter meets high taste, basically. I like that. I like that. Okay.\n\nLenny (00:55:02):\nI think there's a market there.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:04):\nI'll definitely bring that back to the team. That's a good one.\n\nLenny (00:55:06):\nThere you go. Well, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you, I have six questions, I'll get through them pretty quick. Whatever comes to mind, fire off. We'll go through it fast and fun. Sound good?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:21):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (00:55:21):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:55:27):\nI love Stripe Press, and so I think a lot of the books that they have are just such good references, like Elad Gill's High Growth Handbook, or Will Larson's An Elegant Puzzle. Then, some of the more topical ones like Revolt of the Public. I just find that they're evergreen in terms of their utility. Anyone can find value in them. I just loved the craft of the books themselves. They are amazing products in terms of the content and the form, so those are, in the product context and work context, those are hands down I would say the places where I go first.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:56:01):\nBut I do think, and I know this is this humanities major in me, I also always try to balance books and my own reading time and recommendations with fiction. I just think it's actually like, sometimes some of the best ideas and inspiration come when you go one or two steps away from the core books that are related to your practice. Right now, I'm actually rereading Giovanni's Room by James Baldwin. It's just so beautiful and so lyrical and it gets at more components of the human soul that, I know it sounds crazy, but I find like those are little sparks of ideas that ultimately come back into making products, and particularly news products where they're so creative in the way that they tell stories.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:56:46):\nI always try to give people one pragmatic recommendation and then one slightly more field recommendation over in the world of fiction. If you haven't read Giovanni's Room, it is incredible and devastating, and I absolutely recommend it.\n\nLenny (00:57:00):\nWow. I feel like I just keep buying books after doing these podcasts. I have so many books I got to read. I'm also feeling like the combination of books you recommended is exactly what I would imagine someone leading product at New York Times would recommend, something product tactical and then just a beautiful piece of fiction.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:57:18):\nI'm the cliché. I love it.\n\nLenny (00:57:21):\nGreat. No, no, no. I wouldn't put it that way. Okay. What's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to? You mentioned one already, is that the one?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:57:28):\nEveryone should listen to Hard Fork. It's great. But I just think The Daily continues to be, and again, I know it sounds self-serving, but being able to just listen to Michael Barbaro and Sabrina Tavernise once a day, just bring in journalists to talk and unpack a meaningful story, it's so visceral. I just find it to be one of the daily miracles that the New York Times is able to produce.\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nYeah, that's wild. I can't imagine a daily thing like that doing that. Impressive. What's a recent favorite movie or TV show that you've seen that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:01):\nI am pretty old school. I am actually rewatching The Wire for the third time.\n\nLenny (00:58:06):\nWow. That's a lot of time commitment.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:09):\nIt is. I have very little time, but every five years my husband and I, we just can't get over the characters, the storylines. It's just one of the best made series for television ever. It's a work of art, and so I am that person, that is another cliché, who is rewatching The Wire right now.\n\nLenny (00:58:27):\nWhat's your favorite season?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:28):\nI would probably say it's season three, but when Stringer Bell passes away, it's the culmination of just so much. I probably shouldn't say that for anyone who hasn't seen The Wire. Oh, that's like the worst thing ever.\n\nLenny (00:58:43):\nSpoiler alert in reverse.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:45):\nSpoiler alert. I'm so sorry.\n\nLenny (00:58:46):\nBut that's not the character name, that's the actor, right?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:49):\nNo, no, I really just totally spoiled that.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nOkay, that's cool. If you haven't seen it at this point, it's over, your loss.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:58:56):\nOh, boy. How awful. That's like a cardinals sin. But I do think season four, when it starts to get into the school system is also just, the actors are incredible. It's some of the best acting that I think has existed over the last couple of decades. Again, if you haven't seen it, please do yourself a favor and watch it. It's worth every episode.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nWould you agree season two is the worst?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:19):\nI thought that until I re-watched it.\n\nLenny (00:59:22):\nInteresting.\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:22):\nI actually came around and it's not at the top of my list, but there's more to it than I think I originally gave it credit for.\n\nLenny (00:59:30):\nWow. I like this. Okay, great. What are four to five SaaS products that you or company uses most that you find really useful?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:39):\nProbably pretty classic, we use G-Suite, Slack, Figma, Mode, GitHub. Those are the ones that I think just get hands down the most amount of usage across our teams.\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nThe fourth one was Mode?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:53):\nIs there any interesting new recent one that's like top of mind while we're on this topic?\n\nAlex Hardiman (00:59:58):\nNot really. No.\n\nLenny (01:00:02):\nOkay, great. The winners keep winning, huh? These products?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:07):\nYeah. If anything, it's like when you don't talk about the SaaS products you use, I feel like that's more of a success because it's just, it works behind the scenes, it blends in and it just makes everyone so much more productive.\n\nLenny (01:00:19):\nYeah. Imagine all these companies have the New York Times logo on their site of people using that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:24):\nMaybe.\n\nLenny (01:00:24):\nThat would be a big deal when you guys adopt a product. Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader and thinker?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:00:32):\nThis is a hard question, but I would say one of the people who I find to just be a really tremendous product thinker, leader, and ally for women is Fidji Simo. I was lucky enough to work with her and for her when I was at Facebook and just watching the way that she ... what she did with Facebook, what she then is doing at Instacart and the way that she really just helps so many other women in the field figure out how to be better at their craft, how to have more opportunity. I don't know how she has these many hours in her day, but she's pretty incredible, so I would love to give a shout out to her.\n\nLenny (01:01:10):\nAwesome. I will try to get her on this podcast.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:13):\nOh, that would be amazing. All right. She's really-\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nThat's what I need to do. Awesome. Good recommendation. Alex, this was amazing. I learned so much. This is such a fun conversation. Thank you, again, for doing this. Two last questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? Maybe think about working at the New York Times and otherwise, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:32):\nThanks. You can find me on Twitter, LinkedIn, all the usual channels. I would love to hear from anyone and would be delighted to also talk about what it's like to do product at the Times. Then, the thing that would be really useful is what is the one feature that would make the New York Times more essential and more valuable to you in your daily life? I would love to hear from people on that front.\n\nLenny (01:01:53):\nAll right. I shared mine, a design-oriented Wirecutter. I will be looking for that.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:01:59):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:01:59):\nAwesome. Thank you, Alex.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:00):\nNo, of course. There's just one other whole theme, and I don't know if you want to chat through it, which is, what are some of the similarities and differences between product management in news organization?\n\nLenny (01:02:14):\nLet's do it.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:14):\nIt's totally up to you. But if that's something that you'd be interested in talking through.\n\nLenny (01:02:20):\nAbsolutely.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:21):\nI'm going to just focus on two themes that I think are pretty interesting. The first is just how we work at the New York Times, and we talked a little bit about working with journalism, and there are some really interesting differences. The second is just on the idea of impact. I think how the definition and the understanding of impact can be pretty different. First, just on the idea of how we work, there are a lot of similarities. I would say that product managers at the Times and at tech companies, they have a lot of the same skills. Like, we look for a great product sense, great execution, great leadership and drive.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:02:59):\nAny good PM needs to know their industry, their customers, their market, their business, et cetera. We actually do see a lot of crossover between product managers from tech companies who come to the New York Times or tech PMs at the Times who go over to tech companies. I think that that's wonderful, but a key difference of when you're a product manager working at the New York Times is that you work across the full stack of the product. Meaning, we own our journalism and our content. We own our distribution and we own our products. That's really different from working at a big tech platform. When I was at Facebook, we controlled the software and the distribution, but we didn't control the content.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:03:39):\nWe had real limitations on understanding what was passing through. Was it high quality content, low quality content? It just led to, again, a lot of challenges that we already talked about. At the Times, when I think about how our best products are born, it's when you bring journalism and product lovers together. That means that PMs at the Times really need to understand the blend of art and science. They really need to value expert editorial judgment as they're also looking at individual KPIs, customer research and insights, et cetera. An interesting example, as I was trying to think about what would feel really different doing product at the Times compared to say Facebook is like, let's say you're at the product team and you're working on the home screen.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:04:25):\nWe always start with expert editorial judgment to curate the most important and interesting stories. But on top of that, we're training algorithms on specific data sets, like editorial important scores that actually come from our journalists. What that allows us to do is actually scale editorial judgment to a large group of readers. Those algorithms, what I think is just really great is they're trained on editorial signal and then they can still work towards driving towards outcomes like reach, engagement, conversion, et cetera. That's just such a different way of thinking. When I was at Facebook and we were focused on news ranking and feed, all we could do was train pieces of in information based on an engagement outcome.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:05:12):\nWe couldn't actually train it based on the quality of that piece of information itself. At the Times you get all, you have 2000 plus journalists and you're actually trying to structure their expertise into things that can actually translate into really great algorithmic decisioning, and that's just so different. No one else is really doing something in that space. Product managers are becoming very editorially minded and we're also getting editors to become more product minded. I just think that how we work there is so different and so unique. It's just a pretty fascinating part of, I think, how the sausage is made, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny (01:05:46):\nYeah. Thanks for sharing that. I think that's really important topic of just how it's different and why it's worth considering trying something like the New York Times as a place to work. What's interesting about what you're talking about, this also reminds me ironically of Substack, where they also are anti-algorithms and are also very focused on people and people recommending other people and just like individuals. I don't know if we want to get into this, but I guess do you have a opinion of Substack as a medium? Because folks leave New York Times to work on Substack, they come back. My whole living is on Substack. Any thoughts on the world of Substack?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:06:25):\nWell, a couple of things. First, it's not that we're anti-algorithm on the New York Times front, it's just that we want our algorithms to reflect editorial judgment. That's really different. When it comes to Substack, actually, I think a lot of what Substack is doing is great. The idea of writers being able to make a living individually off of their craft, I think, is fantastic. The thing that I get excited about for Substack, but also for a company like the New York Times is trust right now with institutions has been declining, with governments, with religious institutions, with news organizations.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:07:00):\nBut trust with individual experts, where you have a real relationship, that really matters. That I think is one of the big unlocks in terms of helping the next generation of readers really start to create more of a relationship with high quality journalists and writers who have really important things to say about the world. I think whatever is happening in the world that helps great writers find their audiences, make a living, is wonderful. At the New York Times, a lot of what we're trying to do is, it's not the Substack model, but we have a lot more that we're doing to actually help get individual journalists out there.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:07:39):\nThey have their own subscribe only newsletters, podcasts. We're really trying to help them find a way to create a mini platform within the means and the scale of the New York Times. It's not quite the Substack model, but I do think that there's some interesting similarities, and the more that artists and creatives can help make a living, I think, it's just fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:08:00):\nI'm here for it. I love this two-part encore bonus we just did. Anything else that you want to share before we wrap up?\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:08:10):\nI think the only other thing that I have come to learn when you're doing product management at a news organization compared to a place like Facebook is just how different the definition of impact can be. When I was at Facebook, we were incredibly focused on scale, engagement, and revenue, which is very appropriate. At a company like the New York Times, we also have a huge ambition to grow our subscriber base. But one thing that's really interesting is that our impact and our business goals are in service of our mission, which is to seek the truth and help people understand the world, not the other way around.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:08:51):\nWhat it means is that the way that we think about impact is growing a giant subscription business. That business exists to strengthen an informed democracy at a time when people are struggling to understand basic facts and struggling to understand each other. That means that impact for us is growing subscribers, but it's also when a deeply reported story triggers an important policy change or a new law. When you're a product manager you're involved, again, in driving specific metrics like engagement or subscribers.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:09:26):\nBut you're also trying to help stories find their real audience in ways that trigger just this whole different side of mission and purpose driven impact. I didn't feel that when I was at a place like Facebook, but at the Times, I think it just gives product managers a bit of a broader aperture in the ways that they think about the relationship between business goals and mission impact goals, and it's pretty cool.\n\nLenny (01:09:50):\nIt does feel like it would be hard to find more meaningful, impactful work, and so that really resonates.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:09:57):\nOh, thanks. There are so many other important purposeful products and problems out there to solve in the world. We've talked about this, Lenny, but I just think that product managers and product thinking in so many contexts inside and outside of tech has never been more important in the world than right now. We need product managers everywhere diagnosing key problems and issues, coming up with radically novel solutions. This is the moment. It's really great to have your podcast and so many other resources out there to help new and other PMs just do their best craft. Thank you for having all of us in here.\n\nLenny (01:10:33):\nI love that as a closing thought. Alex, thank you again so much for doing this.\n\nAlex Hardiman (01:10:37):\nThank you so much, Lenny. This was really fun.\n\nLenny (01:10:40):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Thinking like a gardener, slime mold, the adjacent possible: Product advice from Alex Komoroske\n\n## Transcript\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:00:00):\nSo much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like I have a plan. I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen. And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. What I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. If you do this properly, it looks like magic. I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get, including products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nToday, my guest is Alex Komoroske. Alex is one of the most original, articulate, and first principle thinkers on the future of product and tech that I've ever come across. This conversation will get your brain buzzing in all kinds of ways. Alex spent 13 years at Google where he worked on Search, DoubleClick. He led Chrome's Open Web Platform team for eight years, led augmented reality within Google Maps, and developed a new toolkit to align company-wide strategy from the bottom up. After a stint at Stripe as head of corporate strategy, he's currently founding a startup that aims to reimagine the web for the AI era.\n\n(00:01:13):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, we cover how LLMs and gen AI will impact how we build product in the coming years, what skills will matter most as AI becomes a bigger part of our lives, what companies can learn from slime mold, organizational kayfabe, the adjacent possible, strategy salons, why you should be thinking more like a gardener than a builder, plus a bunch of productivity tips, life advice, and so much more. This was such a fun episode, and I'm sure this is going to get your mind thinking in completely new ways.\n\n(00:01:42):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Alex Komoroske.\n\n(00:01:57):\nAlex, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:02:01):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:02):\nI love the way your brain works. My brain immediately starts buzzing anytime I start reading some of your stuff. And one of the more interesting things that you write and do and a really interesting habit you have is you actually have this doc that you keep called Bits and Bobs that I love, and we're going to be touching on a lot of the things that you share in this doc, Bits and Bobs, and we'll link to it. First of all, can you just explain this doc, Bits and Bobs, what's it about?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:02:27):\nYeah. I think it's like 600 pages now. It's this one Google Doc. Every so often, almost every day, someone will accidentally add a suggestion like add a space or something because it takes so long to load that while they're waiting, they'll tap on the screen and then it'll turn into taps on adding a comment or something. And I take a lot of notes. And people, I tell people when I'm in meetings with them of like, \"If you see me on my phone or typing, that means I think you said something very interesting and I'm writing it down. It's not that I'm just that I'm disengaged. I try to collect all these ideas.\" And then once a week, I go through, I take a few hours and I just reflect to myself and try to find patterns and unpack and find meaning and things. And I write those down and I started sometime in the past sharing those publicly, and it's now become a thing I literally can't stop doing.\n\n(00:03:17):\nI just find someone who was like, \"Oh, if you get more exposure for this, if you broke these up into tweets that you sent out once throughout the day,\" it's like, I did this for me. I'm happy to let other people see and peek into my weird mental process if they want, but this is 100% about my own self-reflection. And it's not designed. I don't want anyone to feel compelled to read it or... In fact, it's designed a little bit to be, I allow myself to be a little bit illegible. I want people to have to work a little bit with it. And it's not going to lay it out on a platter. It's going to jump between different things. I'll use terminology sometimes that is, what are you talking about? And I do that specifically. I don't want anyone to read and be like, \"Oh, it sucks. It wasn't worth my time.\" It's like, \"Cool.\" It's a 600-page Google Doc of my just unspooled insights.

I have a thing called The Compendium, which is an open source tool. If you look at it currently, it looks like I haven't touched it in years, but that's actually incorrect. I built this about five years ago. I use it every day. And so I have, I think let's see, I currently have 17,248 unpublished working notes. And so what I do during the week is I'm taking notes very quickly in meetings, and then every day or two, I go through and I process them and put them in as working notes in The Compendium, and this is where I correct misspellings. I add just a little bit more context so that it will make sense to me if I were to read it in a year.\n\n(00:06:58):\nAnd also, I built a feature into it that uses embeddings to find similar cards. I find similar ideas from the past. And then what I do on Friday afternoons is I sit down and I go through all the notes I added that week and I just click and check the ones that still resonate with me, they still seem interesting in some way. And then I have a little export thing. I put it into a Google Doc, and while the kids are napping on the weekends, I just go through them and try to distill them a little bit more in a more long-term format. And then on Monday mornings, I publish them. And again, it's a deep... For me, it's like I can't imagine not doing this. It is the place where I find most of my most interesting insights is by reflecting on interesting conversations from the week before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:39):\nAs we get into the conversation, people get to see how deeply you think about stuff. Part of the reason you're able to think so deeply about stuff is you have this practice where you take time to reflect and share and crystallize. There's so much power in just forcing yourself to write it out, I imagine versus, just not.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:07:54):\n100%. I find that when you're busy, you're constantly just go, go, go, go. There's no time to do any deep thinking. Deep thinking takes time and space, and you got to create that space. The mundane, pointless bullshit will take every square inch you give it. So you got to make that space to sit back and reflect and luxuriate in these ideas. And when you do, you're often like, \"Oh my God. Oh wow, that's one I'll keep.\"\n\n(00:08:18):\nAnd I told people, back at the very beginning of my career, I used to work from home on Fridays. And people gave me so much shit for this and they'd say, \"Oh, you're working from home on Fridays.\" First of all, I will line up my output any day of the week. I'm very proud of the impact I've had. Second of all, Monday through Thursday, I'm in meetings from 8:00 to 6:00 or whatever. I'm just running between. I'm singing, pinging people and scheduling things and flinging action items. And the one day I don't take meetings is on Friday, and that's the day I read documents carefully that people had sent me or reflect. And I think to myself, what is the thing that if I had done it before the week started would've saved me tons of time and effort that week?\n\n(00:08:58):\nSo for example, maybe in 10 different one-on-ones with people on the team, I had to explain to them a strategic thing that we were doing or a change that we were making. And the idea and the way I framed it worked for everybody. Well, you know what? That should probably be a document, right? If the same idea worked for 10 different people and now in the future there's probably 10 other people that need to hear it, and now I'll write that document in 30 minutes and now I have it as a memorialized thing that other people can read on their own time without having to involve me.\n\n(00:09:24):\nAnd you also find these interesting ideas sometimes where you look at this problem that you're banging your head against, you go, \"Oh wait, if I will like that, that would've a wildly different dynamic.\" And you can only find those when you take a step back. And I find that people, I told someone, I mentored someone, I've mentored hundreds of PMs over the years and I told someone that at one point and they go, \"Oh, I wish I had the time.\" And it's like, you got to make the time. All of us are busy and we will always be busy. And so this to me is not something I do to just for the enjoyment of all. I do deeply enjoy it intrinsically. It's something I do because I think it makes me more productive and effective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:01):\nI'm very tempted to go down a whole direction of just how you structure your time and your productivity calendar and all this stuff, but I'm not going to do that. That could be another episode if I do.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:10:09):\nI do for that for hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:10):\nWhat I want to do instead is pick on some of the Bits and Bobs that you've been focusing on noodling on that I think are going to be really helpful to listeners in how they think about product and the future of AI and all these things that I think are emerging. And the first one is actually that I want to get your thoughts on how AI and LLMs are likely to impact product development. A lot of the listeners of this podcast are PMs, engineers, founders, people building software, and you're spending a lot of time thinking about AI and product development. A lot of your Bits and Bobs have been just like, \"Here's what's happening. Holy shit. This is how things are going to be.\" So let me just ask you this how do you anticipate LLMs and gen AI are going to change how products are built in the next three to five years?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:10:56):\nI think they change a lot. I think LLMs are truly a disruptive technology. In fact, I would argue that what we're seeing in the industry is us trying to use mature playbooks from the end stage of the last tech era in one that doesn't really fit yet. To me, LLMs are magical duct tape. They're formed principally by the distilled intuition of all of society into a thing that operates between, a cost structure between human and plain old computing. So much of how the industry is built presupposes the idea that software is expensive to write and cheap to run, and LLMs undermine both of these. So it makes it LLMs allow writing shitty software to be significantly cheaper, not necessarily good software, but good enough in certain contexts. And also it means that there's certain software now that isn't plain old computing that can be run cheaply. It's relatively expensive marginal cost.\n\n(00:11:49):\nAnd so if you're going to do a consumer startup, it can't be based on advertising. It's just too expensive. Advertising cannot clear the inference costs even with inference costs declining. So I think the way to me, a disruptive technology changes tons of stuff, all these assumptions you didn't even realize you were making because you didn't realize it could be any different.\n\n(00:12:07):\nImagine if you were locked in a room for your entire career, no windows, and you have all these experiences. You're going all this know how. You're getting this sense of how things work, what will happen. And then imagine that room tilts on its axis by five degrees. Everything looks roughly the same, and yet now the dynamics of the force of gravity is pulling in a different direction than it was before. You didn't even think about the force of gravity before because it was so omnipresent. It never changed that it's just a blank in your head. And now gravity has changed effectively for your perspective and all kinds of intuition is now wrong. I put this thing on the table, it's going to stay there, and then it slides off and falls into the wall. All kinds of weird stuff will happen.\n\n(00:12:44):\nAnd I think LLMs to me feel like that. I can't tell you the number of people who are... At some point at a year or two, someone came to me, they're like, \"I just built a prototype, product that would've taken me three months. And I can believe it's going to start up.\" I was like, \"How differentiated do you think that is?\" Everybody can do that now. It changes the basis of competition. I think today I see a lot of folks using LLMs, and LLMs are like a squishy computer. We're used to computers doing exactly what we told them to do, which is not necessarily what we meant. And only some people have learned the skill of programming, the arcane magical incantations to make computers do exactly what you meant.\n\n(00:13:24):\nNow, LLMs can do all kinds of stuff. And they don't do exactly what you told them, but they do typically do roughly what you meant. I see all these places where people will build products and they'll say 80% of the time, 90% percent of the time, it's great. 5% of the time it punches the user in the face and they're like, \"Oh, we're going to reduce the number of times it punches us in the face.\" It's like even if you get it down to 99% of the time, it's fine. If it punches in the face, that's not a viable product. And so how do you design your products assuming that this thing will be squishy and not fully accurate and fully work?\n\n(00:13:53):\nPeople use these things a lot as oracles. \"I'm going to have it. I'm going to formulate the answer and it's going to be a fully fledged answer.\" And of course, strawberry has been really stabbed at. Gotten a chance to play with it. They are getting better at some of these kinds of behaviors at great expense. But in a lot of cases, I instead would rather say, \"How can you take LLMs for granted? How can you assume that you now have this magical duct tape? Don't assume it's going to solve all your problems. Don't assume it's going to do autonomously be able to give high quality results of every case. But what can you now build now that you have magical duct tape?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:24):\nYou're a product manager for most of your career. Now, you're a founder. I'm curious what your advice would be to product managers and people building products in terms of what skills they should lean into, what you think is going to be matter most. There's hard skills. There's soft skills. There's getting more technical. There's getting more product business-oriented. Just what do you think people should work on more and becomes more valuable and what do you think becomes less valuable from a product builder perspective?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:14:52):\nI think in this early stage, we're in the community gardening phase, not the factory farming phase of this technology. And so I think what people need most is curiosity and play. You should be playing with these things and trying out different things and seeing what weird things are possible now. One of my favorite things, to be honest, right now, it's using AI is WebSim. WebSim is so weird. What a weird idea, like why? And then you play with it and you realize, \"Oh, this is a thing that could only exist in a world where LLMs exist.\" And I think these kinds of odd, interesting, weird, provocative, generative things will be where a lot of the interesting patterns are found because right now we're so used to... If the playbook, if the cost structures have changed, the kinds of things are now possible, the playbook is wrong and we should throw it out or at least ignore it to some degree. So it will feel like we are navigating through a whole new industry that it has in the past.\n\n(00:15:47):\nAnytime that an industry gets really, really, really, really, really good at like vertical SaaS, we know how to execute the crap out of that. We know exactly what to do. It doesn't require that much. It requires consumption and execution velocity and all this. But vertical SaaS, I think, is not the right model of how you would attack a problem that is an AI native style problem. And I think that those are where all the interesting things will be. And again, I think a lot of the tactics that we're trying out at the beginning, they won't work. It'll turn out that they only work 95% of the time, and 5% of the time they punch you in the face or something. And that means that you have to be more adaptable and you have to assume that a scrappy thing will be more important.\n\n(00:16:28):\nOne of the ways I put this is we've seen a vast reduction in the cost of distribution of information, and now we're seeing a reduction in the cost of information production. And most of it is slop. And so in this cacophony, how do you stand out? You stand out by having good taste. I think taste is the most important thing. You have a perspective that is different from the background noise, different from the average and that people find compelling. How do you find your own taste and how do you lean into that taste is, I think, much more important than just generically executing in the way that everybody else could do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:01):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here, but maybe on just this last one, when you say taste, what do you mean by that? What should people think when they're like, \"Okay, I got to work in my taste\"?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:17:09):\nTaste, one way of looking at this is differentiate from what the LLM would've written if given the same prompt. How different, how distinctive is what you have to say. And I think so much in large industry, in large organizations is about fitting into the role. How can you be a better and more efficient cog in that particular kind of machine? And I think in this new world, what you want to do is how can I become the best version of myself? How can I lean into the things that I have an interesting perspective on that make me different? Those are the kinds of things. And now of course, if you lean into something and you're doing something out there and nobody resonates with it, then it doesn't count. Good taste is something that is individual and also compelling to others. And so find what things you say that resonate with other people and lean into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):\nI love that. Back to the WebSim example, we're going to link to this, but definitely play with WebSim. I was interviewing Dylan Field at Figma Config and this was his... Asked him like, \"What's the number one thing you think people are going to get more excited about in the future that you're playing with now?\" Because he's really good at identifying things that are going to be bigger in the future, and that was his choice. And it's very hard to understand exactly what it is if you just go there. But basically it's like you type a URL and it invents what that website is using just AI LLMs.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:18:22):\nThat's insane, as in. And you can get it to do, you realize as you play with it more, you can get it to do all kinds of specific things and you can steer it based on the way it uses the context of the last few pages. It creates a coherent world that's coherent with the things that you have recently seen, because you can steer it directly and you can watch fascinating people. They'll cover all kinds of wacky little techniques to get to generate, like generate a game for your kid that's on a specific type. You can do all kinds of stuff. And I'm not saying necessarily WebSim to me is a disruptive thing. Things that look alien and weird and yet are compelling, those are what we should be paying more attention to as opposed to take an existing playbook and slap something on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nI love that. Another point that I saw you make about AI and the way it's different from other things we've done is most of the tools that we adopt in the workplace are collaborative where it helps your team be better, helps you collaborate better, and AI is the opposite. It makes you individually better. Can you talk about that insight?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:19:18):\n100%. I think this is one of the reasons is that the question right now of, okay, everyone's talking about AI and yet nobody's doing... There's no interesting breakout success obviously other than OpenAI and Anthropic obviously. So is there any value being created? I think it's entirely possible. And Ethan Malik who's a good friend, who has an amazing blog who's absolutely worth reading, has pointed out, too, that this is a thing that make individuals better in a way they might not want to tell their manager about. I can now do my job twice as fast. And if the organization sees that, they might go, \"Wait a second. We should pay you half this much.\" They're like, \"What if we get rid of some extra people or something?\"\n\n(00:19:56):\nAnd so if this stuff is magical duct tape, it's very hard to make scaled, repeatable, large scale things out of it. It's very easy to do rig the shit out of anything. And so you'll see it being used in the small in a way that's almost entirely below the level of awareness of the seeing at the organization. The organization almost won't see it or sense it, and yet it could be adding significant value or just being used quite heavily. And I think this is one of the things that makes it if everything is happening in the long tail of usage, then you could conclude, \"Oh, it's not being used for anything in the industry,\" but it's being used all over the place. I talked to Claude 20 times a day. I just have long conversations with it. I have tons of projects loaded up with all kinds of contexts on different topics, and I literally could not do the job I do now without having a conversation partner like Claude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:48):\nLet me follow that thread real quick because a lot of people are like, \"Okay,\" people keep telling me, \"Play with AI. Use ChatGPT.\" Sometimes it's hard to see exactly what they can do with it. Can you give one example of how you found it really helpful or how you use Claude or another tool in your day-to-day?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:21:02):\nI use it to think through problems. And so like when I'm trying to name a concept or get a handle on a few different ways of looking at something, just saying, \"Here's what's in my brain about this topic right now. Here's some relevant context.\" I have a number of projects that just stuff as much of the Bits and Bobs into the context as I can, which is very helpful. And I just say, \"Just play with it. Just give me 10 examples of that thing,\" or then, \"Critique these ones,\" or, \"It feels like this one's the best one for me. What works about this? Why is this one the best?\" Or, \"I want to work at an angle now that has something about know Helen Nissenbaum's concept of contextual integrity. How would I layer that in?\" It's just think of it as having a extremely well-read but slightly naive friend who is will never make you feel dumb and is willing to engage you in any particular topic you want to go down.\n\n(00:21:49):\nSo when you talk to an expert like a lawyer or a doctor or something, you know that that time is extremely valuable. You have a very small slice of time, and so there's tons of questions you don't even bother to ask. \"That's a dumb question. I'm not going to spend $1,000 to answer that question.\" Whereas if you can have that conversation, now this is not saying use it for legal advice, but it can allow you to explore through a problem domain and then later check it with experts and say, \"I believe this is a coherent outcome or a thing that should happen.\" And they can go, \"Oh yeah, that works.\" So I use LLMs to help me. It's like getting a, it's like an electric bike for idea spaces. You can just cover so much more ground so much more quickly in them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:26):\nI love that metaphor because it builds on Steve Jobs's that computers are a bicycle for the mind. And that's really a beautiful way of thinking about it, that LLMs are like the electric bicycle for the mind.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:22:37):\nI don't think if that's someone else's, the...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):\nOh, okay.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:22:39):\nI don't know where it came from. Part of my job is a collector of ideas, and so I try to put myself in the most interesting information streams with interesting people that I've found to have taste, have a perspective on something. Maybe I disagree with it, but they definitely have a coherent idea. And then I just allow myself to like, \"Oh, that's a really good idea and let me build on that or let me...\" I don't even know where that particular one came, but I'm 95% sure that somebody else said that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):\nI want to get to this idea of gardening versus building that is central to a lot of the way you think about it. But before we get there, I want to touch on another bit and bob that I love that you come back to occasionally, which is this idea of organizational kayfabe. Talk about what this idea of kayfabe is on its own and then how this applies to organizations in your experience.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:23:26):\nOne thing I should flag before I dive into any this stuff, sometimes when people hear me talk about how organizations work and systems, they think I'm being cynical. And I want to be very clear, I'm hyper-optimistic and I also believe that one of the moral precepts is how do you maximize the agency of real humans as ends in and of themselves? And so sometimes when I get excited about this, people go, \"Wow, that is so cynical.\" No, I'm just trying to describe the system as it actually exists. Once we know how it exists, we can figure out how to make it do great things and how we as members of this system can tweak and nudge it.\n\n(00:23:56):\nSo I just want to flag that before I dive into this. I have this slime mold deck which has gotten a ton of traction over the years, and part of the reason for that is because it feels like people tell me it feels like they think they're crazy and it feels like giving a big hug saying, \"You are not crazy. Here's why this thing shows up.\" And once you acknowledge it, it feels like a bummer to acknowledge it, but once you do, now there's all kinds of options that pop up. \"Oh, given that this thing is way more expensive than it looks, I can now do this instead. That one's 10 times cheaper. These two options, this one is way cheaper, way more likely to succeed.\" So once you see these forces, you see them more clearly.\n\n(00:24:28):\nSo kayfabe is I think a lens that's useful to understand how organizations actually work. Kayfabe is a word that comes, I believe is a carny word that is used and applied to professional wrestling and it means a thing that everybody knows is fake and yet everybody acts like is real. And I think it's one of the defining forces within an organization, any organization. So kayfabe in the small is optimism, enthusiasm. When someone says, \"We're going to do this thing,\" you say, \"Yeah, we're going to do that,\" even if I think this isn't going to work. If you say, \"I don't think this think is going to work,\" everyone loses hope and it definitely doesn't work. So having a little bit of this is extremely valuable. It's the lubricant that allows organizations to believe they can do something and to attempt to do it.\n\n(00:25:09):\nThe problem that you get is as organizations get larger, imagine you are five levels down or something and you have this project you're working on and you're trying to give a status update to be rolled up to leadership. And it's currently a yellow, and your manager asks it and you know it's not going to be presented to leadership and enrolled up until next week. \"It's yellow, but I've got my arms around the problem. I know how to fix it. I'm going to go talk to Sarah. I think we have a solution. By the time this is reported up the chain, it's going to be green.\" So if I make it yellow, there's a non-trivial chance that someone's going to swoop down and say, \"Well, what's going on? We have a review,\" and it will be way harder to fix, so I'm just going to... A little white lie.\n\n(00:25:46):\nThis is a totally reasonable thing to do. It's a self-defensive thing to do. And it's probably the right thing for the organization too. The problem is this happens up multiple layers and it compounds. So then your layer above you does the same, and the same, and the same, and levels up you can be many orders of magnitude off of the ground truth. And so the kayfabe, the thing that everyone pretends to believe is true, is obviously incorrect. And the dangerous part about this is it can lead you to make very bad decisions. And if you as someone who sees this can see that wait a second, the official strategy is definitely not going to work, you're like, \"I got to tell somebody. We're doing work that's going in a bad direction. It's not going to work.\" And you go and say, \"I think that it's actually not going to work for these reasons.\"\n\n(00:26:27):\nAnd what someone will say to you, this happens by the way, I'm not substituting any particular organization, this happens literally in all organizations to some degree, is the senior person will say, \"Alex, I agree with you. It's not perfect, but if you hit the ground truth button, if you share that and everybody, the whole thing will shatter and we can't do anything. And so help me fix it. Don't say the ground truth. Just help nudge it and fix it.\" That's a good point. Okay, so you help working on it and then you realize a month later, wait a second, it's getting worse. We're doing things that's not good for the company. It's not creating user value. It's not good for the employees. They're burning out. It's just not good for anybody and it's getting worse. And so if you think you're going to go and hit the ground truth button, before you do, you'll be flying tackled to the ground by somebody and stabbed in the dark because you will destroy everything.\n\n(00:27:13):\nAnd so it becomes correct to hold onto this idea of if you acknowledge the kayfabe is false, then you are in danger of getting knocked out of the game. And so how do you do good things despite the fact that you're pulled in two different directions? And this increasingly in the limit, it can be good to a point where the easiest way is if I do, if I hold on this idea, we might create significant value for the company. If I let go of this idea, I die. So the easiest way to maintain this split-brain thing is to just turn this part off and just earnestly believe the kayfabe. This has been organizations become zombies, and anyone individually you talk to behind the scenes will agree yes, it could not possibly work. That turns out that these things work this way, and yet the entire organization lumbers on.\n\n(00:27:56):\nAnd this is a death state for large organizations. It happens all over the place in any number of different conditions, and this is one of the reasons it shows up. And I think acknowledging that is an important way to help navigate and still make good grounded things happen. How can you allow disconfirming evidence to show up that doesn't kill you, that helps make you stronger? And if it all has to come in one massive moment that could ruin everything, then you aren't going to hear it. And then it will build up and build up and build up and build up into a super critical state that could shatter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:27):\nI was just listening to a couple podcasts, and a thread that came up in a number of them is some of the most successful leaders, their instruction to their reports is, \"As soon as there's bad news, I need to know as soon as possible. Do not shield me. I just want to know all the bad news as soon as possible.\" Feels like that's one solution to what you're describing.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:28:44):\nDisconfirming evidence hurts, and so you won't realize it because it hurts at any given moment. It's like, \"Ugh, it's a distraction. We're just trying to get this thing done.\" And so it comes from a good place to not get it, but if you're busy, that's one of the reason you need to take a step back. We take a step back, you're a little bit calmer. You can absorb this as confirming evidence. It doesn't feel like an existential threat. It's really easy to get surrounded. If you are very powerful, you will find all the confirming evidence you need. And if it doesn't exist, it will be created for you without your knowledge.\n\n(00:29:12):\nAnd so this is one of the reasons that large companies are radically different than smaller companies. And one of the traps that you can get into of not realizing this dynamic is happening, and you can make very bad decisions if you don't understand that it's inherently what's happening because they're all, \"Oh, we'll have some bad actors.\" No, no, no. If people don't play this game, this game is emergent. It shows up even though everybody hates it. And if you don't play the game, you are knocked out of the game. The underlying dynamic that must be true in any organization on a fundamental basis is you can't make your boss look dumb because if you do, they're the person who decides, \"Oh, this person's not performing,\" or whatever. And that one little asymmetry, that one little fact, in most cases it does not matter. That one little asymmetry is what leads to the systemic compounding thing where you get these really weird dysfunctional emergent things that everybody hates, nobody wants, and yet nobody is in the position to change per se.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:05):\nI love your caveat at the beginning that continues to resonate in my head as you say this. You're not cynical about, \"This sucks.\" It's more, \"Here's what I'm observing. We need to think about ways to get around this.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:30:16):\nYeah. Because I think so much pain and misery is caused by us being not acknowledging these fundamental, inescapable things. It's almost impossible. Entropy is one of those things. Entropy emerges because there's more ways to go away from a point than towards a point. It fundamentally must be true in really any universe you can possibly imagine. And so if you're going to fight entropy, you're going to lose at a certain point. It's like if you are aware of these things, you can find subsets of ideas that do work despite these challenges. And that's some of the stuff, the tactics I advise are often things that look playful. They look unserious. They look like, \"Oh, you're saying you don't know the answer?\" No, I'm admitting I don't know the answer.\n\n(00:30:55):\nAnd I'm saying it doesn't matter if I don't know the answer because this thing, this very small seed I am planting is so cheap that yes, I can't tell you for sure this will work, but I could tell you there is a chance that it'll work. And the downside of this is basically the opportunity cost of planting the seed in this one moment, and the person who's planting it enjoys planting it so that an opportunity cost really isn't that much because they get energy from doing it. So who cares? Plant a bunch of these suckers. If one of these grows into an oak tree, that's great. Don't try to analyze beforehand which seed is going to turn into an oak tree. If it's super simple to plant the seeds, then plant the seeds. And if it starts growing, then keep watering it. That's it. That's the thing.\n\n(00:31:30):\nAnd people sometimes will see this as like, I've been called in my list before because they said, \"Well, you're saying that you don't know the answer to the thing.\" It's like no, I'm saying I don't have to know the answer to the thing. If on a systemic basis I let these ideas and then you respond to the ones that are working that are viable, it doesn't really matter if you didn't know ahead of time which ones were going to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\nIt's a great segue to talking about this core idea that again informs a lot of the way you think, which is this idea of building versus gardening, the magic of acorns. Talk about this general idea and then I want to follow some threads.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:32:02):\nSo much of the way that we tackle problems and build products is this builder mindset. It's like, \"I have a plan, I then manipulate things to match my plan and make it happen.\" And this is a way you can create tons of value. Part of the problem though is it can't possibly create more value than the effort that you put into it. And so what I look for instead are things that can be gardened, things that can grow on their own and that you can direct or maybe give a little bit of extra energy to or curate over, and is a totally different mindset for it. So it's like a lead by gardening vibe. I don't try to pick the things in the system. I try to work with what I've actually got and I try to lean in on the ones that turn, I think are going in the direction that I believe is valuable based on constantly seeking disconfirming evidence.\n\n(00:32:44):\nAnd if you do this properly, it looks like magic. It looks like a thing. It looks like getting lucky because what you're doing is you're farming for miracles. And so on a systemic basis, I can't tell you which of these things will work, but I can tell you there's a very high likelihood that one of these will work in a way that is interesting and transformative. And so if you're looking and finding these seeds that have the compounding potential of if they work, they would start working at an accelerating rate, then you don't have to know ahead of time. To me this is, I've been told that this is completely against all the advice that people get building products nowadays, but I think it's a very powerful approach that works in a lot of different contexts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:26):\nIs there an example that you can give from either from something you worked on or something someone worked on that came or true miss? Because I think people hearing this might be like, \"But I got to ship stuff. I got to hit some goals. I don't have time to sit around and garden and plant seeds. I got to actually build.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:33:41):\nIf there's an ecosystem approach, if there's something that if it works, it'll be self-accelerating. So okay, what you're going to do this thing, we aren't entirely sure what's going to work, but if a developer writes a thing and somebody uses it, it'll attract more developers, more users, and then this would grow on its own. Then and it's cheap to do the little example of the thing. It's cheap to build a little open source, tinker the little thing and just put it there. And if nobody uses it, it's fine. It was fun to build. It took you three hours. It's fine. If someone does use it, then you just invest in incremental bit of unit each time that you find a signal that somebody is finding it useful and then you stop if you ever cease getting that information.\n\n(00:34:16):\nSo I would use this. Anything that is shaped like an ecosystem that has some kind of network effect, and many things have network effects, have some kind of compounding loop. Compounding loops are not rare. They are, \"Look.\" It's like truffle hunting. You have to know what you're looking for and find the dynamics of a thing that if it worked would work at an accelerating rate. Lots and lots and lots of things intrinsically have this shape. Anything with a network effect, anything where the power goes up with a number of users, but it shows up in all kinds of problems that we don't normally apply it to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:47):\nAlong the same lines, you also advise people to think more emergence-oriented versus top-down, kind of what you were just saying. But I think that's another really interesting way of thinking about the same idea, create opportunities for emergence, bottom-up versus top-down control. You just chat about that.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:35:03):\n100%. I think the emergence is one of the most powerful forces if you know how to marshal it and you know how to work with it. And the only thing that's hard about it in my opinion is you're going to look like you aren't very serious. You're going to look like a weirdo. You're going to look like a cook. And one of the downsides, if you're working on something and you're doing the normal top-down approach where you make the plan, you execute the plan, even if the plan turns out to not be useful, you produce a thing and nothing interesting happens, no one can say you didn't work hard. But if you try doing this designing for emergence and something amazing happens, even once it happens, people go, \"Ah, it's luck. Where was the miraculous moment, the heroic moment where you made that happen? So therefore you had nothing to do with it.\"\n\n(00:35:42):\nAnd this was the biggest unlock in my career actually was when I stopped my guts. I was promoted to director at Google. I was like, \"Cool, I never want to be promoted inside of a large organization ever again.\" And the freedom to now do the highest impact work, even if I can't make it legible to the organization, was so powerful and I was able to 10X my impact for the organization because I didn't have to worry about making it measurable specifically in a way that would show individual work effort. And I think that's the hardest part. And you have to have, typically what I would advise for PMs, my approach at Google was 70% of my effort and my team's effort should go on things that everybody acknowledges are important and useful and create value. Maybe it's boring, linear value, but some kind of value. You're trying to minimize the chance that any other person in a company will say, \"What does that team do anyway?\"\n\n(00:36:32):\nThis, if someone says this about your team, your team is on the verge of death. And so you're trying to minimize the chance that anybody wants to say that or thinks that it's appropriate to say that by clearly and unambiguously adding value. You're not saying this is the best team in the entire world, but clearly they're doing something useful. They're executing well. They're working hard. And of course that team should exist. Think about it, of course they should. But now once you do this, you have 30% of your extra time that you can plant all these seeds.\n\n(00:36:55):\nYou can find interesting little things where maybe a junior PM on the team has an idea you think it's kind of silly, but they're really into it. And the there is this thing, it could work out great actually. If you tweak it like this, there is a potential. I could see how that could work. If that PM is going to work on that anyway, they want to do it anyway. Instead of saying, \"No, no, no, we don't have time for that. Be a little bit more productive over here,\" say, \"Go for it. Here's my concerns. I imagine this part might not work, but this part is really cool right here.\" And then if it doesn't work, then they've stretched their agency. They've executed. They've exercised their agency. They've learned. They've gotten stronger. They've grown. It has the upside if it turns out to actually work. And worst case scenario, the opportunity cost to doing the thing that helped them grow and they learn and they liked. So I don't know. Don't try to force it. Don't try to stop it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nThat's a really good example of actually how to go about doing that on your team. The way I've always thought about this is the visual I share with people is like, you want to create cover fire for your team where your team's just hitting goals, moving metrics, and then while with that cover fire, you're building the doomsday bomb inside, protected where no one's going to come and stop you.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:37:58):\nYeah, because one of the hardest parts about an acorn when you plant it is making sure a squirrel doesn't dig that fucker up. There's so many things that can destroy it, and just keeping it, allowing it some space and allowing it some time is the most important thing. And it's challenging to do, but that's why it's important as a leader to have enough credibility in the organization that people can see that you are doing useful work to give you the space, to give your team the space to do this truly great work. If you want to get your team to do good work, there's a million different paths to do that. If you want to get your team to do great work, there's no shortcut other than to have an extremely high-trust environment where people lean into their superpowers in a way that adds up to something greater than some of its parts. That takes time. It takes effort. It's very difficult to make legible up to the rest of the organization, but that is where great things come from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:46):\nIt reminds me of something Ed Catmull shared in Creativity, Inc., this idea of the ugly baby, that every new idea is an ugly baby and nobody wants this ugly baby. Everyone's just like, \"Get this out of here,\" because every new idea is bad initially.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:39:00):\nYeah, it sucks. They're just like this ugly thing that barely works or... But this is why what I try to do is I try to see the greatness, the seeds of greatness in everything. Everyone and everything around me, I look for, I try to find and see, man, what is the most compelling part of this? And let me lean into that. And so one of the things I try to do when I meet with people, when I mentor them, I try with it within the first session or two, whenever I can get a hypothesis, I say, \"I think your superpower is...\" And I describe to them what I think I can see them being truly exceptional at.\n\n(00:39:31):\nAnd sometimes I get it wrong, especially if I try to do it earlier, but when people feel very seen and they feel acknowledged for that, they now are willing, they're going to stretch farther and they're going to respond to nudging feedback even better because they know that you're not trying to tell them be different. You're trying to tell them be more, and you now the nudges will feel less like a stop energy and more like someone who gets me and can help me grow even more. And you can get some amazing things out of people when you just treat them with the respect. I assume that everyone I talk to, everyone I talk to is interesting, has seeds of greatness in them, even if they don't recognize necessarily where they are.\n\n(00:40:08):\nSomeone described to me actually this morning in one of my little dirt clubs I run about they help facilitate about treat everybody like the Buddha. I think is I'm messing this up, but this notion of imagine everyone you talk to is the Buddha, in a Buddhist mindset, and how do you see and find those seeds of greatness and treat everyone with respect intrinsically as an end of themselves. This is one of those things that you do to be a compassionate human. It's also, I believe, a way to maximize the amount of value, direct and indirect value, that's created. So it's one of those win-win-win-win-wins where just it's the right thing to do as a person and a member of society, and it's also the thing that can create a lot of business value and create real value in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda.

So interestingly enough, the first time I heard about you and what got me interested in your stuff is I did a newsletter post with the company Perplexity about how they build product. And as they were describing how they organized their team, the co-founders described they organized like slime mold, and he linked to your deck about slime molds and I was like, \"What the heck is this?\" Can you just briefly describe what you mean when you talk about slime molds and how slime molds are related to the way companies are organized and how they should think of the organization?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:42:32):\nYeah. The main thesis of the slime mold deck is that the core dynamic that makes organizations hard to navigate as they get larger, even if you assume everyone is actively good at what they do, actively collaborative and actively hardworking, is this emergent force or coordination of finding the subset of projects to work on when everyone's super busy that everyone agrees and commits to and actually works on together. And finding this coordination cost grows with the square of the number of people who are working on that thing. And so what companies typically try to do is fight this or ignore that it exists.\n\n(00:43:06):\nIf you're going to fight it, the one way to look at this is think of a company like a vehicle. When the company is very small, you can drive it, you can steer it like a sports car. As a founder, you are allowed to steer. Everyone acknowledges you are allowed to steer. They're never, \"Why is he steering it that way?\" So you, a founder, can help navigate an organization around an obstacle the organization cannot see or comprehend itself. The problem is as you steer, as you grow into the size, your organization goes from a sports car and you grow into the size of a big rig, if you drive a big rig like a sports car, you're going to be a danger to yourself and others on the road and you're going to grind the engine. And so you got to drive the car that you actually have.\n\n(00:43:41):\nSo what I see a lot of things happen in large organizations, that people are just trying to ignore this fact. And when you drive, by the way, a car, your vehicle, like a big rig, when it is a big rig, people go, \"Oh, it means to go slow.\" No, no, no. It means pivot less. It means have a little bit more... Be more intentional about the times that you adjust the steering, invest more in program management, invest more in processes, give a little bit more slack in the planning process to absorb any kind of surprising things that you can still all reach the product launch at the same time.\n\n(00:44:13):\nThe other option you can do is you can split your thing up into a series a swarm of sports cars, individual sports cars. And the downside of this, you'll get the autonomy and strengths of the bottom-up, the downside is other people will externally will look at it and go, \"Well, that team and that team clearly didn't talk.\" You'll say, \"Yep, yep.\" You have to decide how bad that is for you. Apple has chosen the former. It's very important to them to have the illusion of perfect coherence in their products. It worked very well for them. They executed marvelously. And if you also picked the exact opposite thing, everyone else is like, \"Yeah. There are like 15 different ways of doing everything. They clearly don't talk to each other.\" But it allows the overall swarm of the AWS product suite to be very powerful and anti-fragile or whatever you want to say.\n\n(00:44:52):\nAnd so slime molds, I think, is acknowledging that organizations are, especially ones that focus on autonomy and agency of their individual employees, which is a lot of tech companies, they are more like slime molds than we realize. And if you fight that fact, you're going to have a bad time. And if you embrace it, then you can start realizing slime molds are actually kind of amazing. They can find solutions to problems you didn't even know you were searching for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:15):\nAlex, you have the best metaphors. I don't know how you do this, but they're so evocative and correct.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:45:21):\nI can tell you that the process I do if you're into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):\nPlease. That would be incredible.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:45:25):\nI think by talking, I'm an external processor, I literally can't think if I'm not talking. And so I make sure I have as many interesting meetings as I can, and that's where I discover what I think, by talking to people. And the test is if I say a frame, something that the person goes, \"Ooh,\" or like, \"Ooh,\" they go, \"Aha,\" that's a win. That's a mark that's a good one. You're just randomly casting about. I find one. And then if a different person also has a similar response, if a person in sales and a person in engineering both find the same idea interesting, that's a very good sign that lots of people will find it interesting, how diverse in terms of background skill sets, perspectives are the people who resonate with the thing you're saying.\n\n(00:46:08):\nThe intuition of this is if you find in a social network, you want to see what's going to go viral, if something is shared and it's shared within, so the people who are at the beginning are all highly densely interconnected in the social graph, then the implied ceiling is relatively small. You only know it works with that audience. But if it's people that are very different subclass and very little overlap, they both find it interesting, that implies a much larger max audience. So you're looking for ideas that resonate with the diversity of people. And then once you find them, each time you get something like that, you invest a little more time in it and you think a little bit more about framing it the next time.\n\n(00:46:42):\nI haven't done this during this chat, but in most conversations, you'll see me as I'm talking writing down stuff like, \"Ooh, that was the best formulation of that one so far.\" And so you keep on coming back to it. You keep on tightening it and seeing how, watching how it's responding and referring with different people through like, \"Where do you get these from?\" It's like I got thousands and thousands and thousands of little examples or metaphors or whatever that's sick.\n\n(00:47:03):\nOne of the benefits of metaphorical thinking is you connect nine of the 10 dots and you invite the listener to engage with the argument to connect that last dot. This allows you by the way to say very controversial things, because if you say connect all the 10 dots and it's like, \"Oh, that's the official strategy,\" then you are instantly a dangerous thing. Whereas if you leave one dot unconnected, people can go connect the dot and go, \"Oh my god, I think that applies to us.\" You're like, \"Oh my god, what?\" \"Yes, that's why I picked that.\" But to counteract this because now it's less obvious to people that's correct, you have to make the metaphor evocative and interesting.\n\n(00:47:39):\nOne of the reasons that slime mold deck got so much traction is partially because slime is gross, it's bad, and yet it's talking about why slime is good. And so that has this instantly subversive thing. I only know this after the fact of trying to figure out why did that deck get so much attention of all the things I've written.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:56):\nIt also is all emojis basically, which is not how you often read a deck. It's very beautifully made. I love that you've been talking about the way you think and come up with ideas is by talking to people and having conversations. We also talked about how you write in this Bits and Bobs approach. I asked someone that you worked with at Stripe what to ask you, and she said to ask you about strategy salons, which feels like a good avenue for this sort of thing. Can you talk about what these are and how you set these up?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:48:26):\nSo these I also call now nerd clubs, and these are my secret weapon. And I have a blog post. I started writing right before my second kid was born, and then he was born three weeks early and I just lost the plot and now it's like a 40-page draft of a thing that I'll probably never finish. But I've used this tactic. I discovered it many years ago as they strengthen some of the techniques I'd used in open source community organizing. And the situation was I was just joining a new team at Google. I've been there for many years, and there was at the time 12 different groups working in different aspects of this overall problem domain. And in classic Google fashion, they added up to significantly less than the sum of their parts, as in not like, \"Oh, we'll see which one works,\" but, \"These two things directly undermine each other. If you execute both of these strategies, neither can work.\" And I knew that if you try to do pairwise executive reviews on this very complex, ambiguous, open-ended problem, you would get really expensive pageantry that would obscure more than clarified.\n\n(00:49:17):\nSo what I did was I created a secret group that I called Navel Gazers was the original one, and I wanted people when they hear about it, I want people to go, \"That will be a club for nerds.\" They're like, \"Yeah, do you want in?\" And so this means that only people who intrinsically want to be in it for its own sake come in. So you get only a positive \"yes, and\" kind of energy. So then within these groups, you say, you set the norms very explicitly and say, \"This is a collaborative debate environment. This is only 'yes, and'.\" If somebody says a thing in this group that is optional and secret and completely off the side of anything that matters, if they say something that you think is an actively dumb idea, you are free to not engage. Just leave it. That's fine. Because nothing's going to happen. We're deciding anything interesting or important here.\n\n(00:49:57):\nAnd if you want to engage and you don't like it, a productive way of doing that is saying, \"Oh, that's so interesting. I would never would've thought to apply that lens. I typically would apply this lens to that kind of problem. I wonder if that applies here.\" And by saying, \"I wonder,\" you make it about you, not them. And so that person can choose if that's an interesting thing to build on or not. This sounds by the way very non-rigorous feel like, \"Ah, how can you possibly get rigorous thinking in the 'yes, and'?\" It turns out there's limited amounts of time and so people will choose to build on the things they find most interesting. This is interesting things are surprising and potentially valuable. And so if lots of different people in the group are building on the same idea, that's a good sign there is something very interesting going on.\n\n(00:50:35):\nThe third thing you do is you dribble in new perspectives. Every one to three a week, if you put in lots of new perspectives, once the norms can all scramble, if you have one in five people who all have a very particular kind of personality can mess up the norms, and so you're trying to minimize the chance you add a jerk. It takes one person to poop a party and go, \"What are we even doing here?\" You want to minimize the chance that happens. But second or thirdly and more importantly, you want to have as people with as different perspective as possible added into the group. And so this is what Ken Stanley might call, for example, novelty search. You're novelty-searching through the different perspectives in the overall thing.\n\n(00:51:10):\nWhen you do this properly, you get something magical. You get a group that people find intrinsically valuable for its own sake and just enjoy participating in and find meaning in, that also stochastically spins off changing insights for the surrounding context because you're searching through these ideas in a low stakes environment where the ideas that lots people build on, they go, \"Oh, you should write that down.\" And this is like an idea lab, what everyone will call an idea lab. And this creates amazingly interesting insights. You just can't force it to do anything. It has to be a bottom-up and emergent, which means if you try to steer it towards an outcome, it won't go. But if you do these, they are amazing places to riff and to share ideas and half-formed ideas. And this is anywhere I go, I terraform the culture around me and create these, because I need it as a place to experiment and try out different half-formed ideas and build on them and be inspired by other people.\n\n(00:52:03):\nAnd that is one of my secrets, strategy secrets that I've been doing now for probably 10 years ago is when the first one started. And there's now I can count eight or nine of I've started over the years. Some of them emerged. So many of them are still at Google. And I think it's like they're just wondrous environments that I think create a lot of value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:21):\nAnd I love it's a perfect example of your approach of emergent properties, letting things emerge versus a top-down, \"Here's what we're doing and here's what we're talking about here.\" If someone wanted to set this up within their company or within friends, any advice? What are some constraints and ways of setting it up for success?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:52:37):\nCommunities are all about momentum. You want to have a space too small, a time too short. If you have a big cabinet space of a lot of people in it and no one's talking, people go, \"I guess this is the place where we don't talk,\" for whatever reason. So what you're doing is you want the smallest seed of people that you know are going to be actively engaged. So maybe there's four of you that already talk over lunch and you talk about whatever topic and it's always really interesting and generative. Cool, get that group together and do a thing. And then incrementally add people who you think are going to like that already as it currently exists. And then you need to feed it so you want to make sure that it never dies.\n\n(00:53:09):\nAnd a community with no people talking is definitely dead. A community with one person talking is already dead. You don't realize it yet. And so you're trying to maximize the chance that there's an interesting conversation even when you as the facilitator are not there. This takes some active policing by the... Like a garden has a gardener, there's somebody pruning back and saying, \"Hey Jeff, just so you know, I think that came out a little bit strong to Sarah's idea and maybe next time add 'I wonder' to the front of that statement,\" or whatever.\n\n(00:53:35):\nThe other thing that you do is when people reach out to you and ping you, they go, \"Hey, let's think about this thing,\" and you go, \"That's a really interesting idea. You should share that in the group.\" And then they do. And then you engage in the group and say, \"That was really interesting,\" little emoji response. And people who didn't watch the interaction assume that Sarah just decided proactively to stick her neck out and share that and that it worked. And so this becomes a self-sustaining norm in the community. And it's not a secret. It's not if someone asks, \"Yeah, I told Sarah to share that,\" but people watching don't realize that. And so it becomes a place that people do take risks and feel comfortable sharing.\n\n(00:54:07):\nThe other thing you do is once a week or so, you want to make sure that you never propose something in the group that people go, \"Eh.\" You always want to do a thing people go, \"Yeah.\" So what you do is you see that if you're talking to other people, you say, \"I wonder if we should have a live conversation every so often, right?\" The chats were so fun, but it goes, \"Would you come if I did one?\" \"Oh yeah, I would.\" \"Okay, great.\" So now I say, \"Hey, a few of us are talking. We're just going to do an experiment. We're going to have an hour-long conversation over lunch on Wednesday. Anyone in the group is free to come.\"\n\n(00:54:33):\n And then what you do is you make sure it always has quorum because if it doesn't have quorum, then the thing, it looks like the community's dead. And then what you do is you send FOMO stuff afterwards. So you say, \"Here's my notes from the thing,\" or, \"Thanks Sarah, Jeff,\" blah, blah, blah, blah, \"or an amazing conversation. I thought the insight about,\" blah blah blah, \"was so ridiculously amazing.\" So you want people who were in the group who didn't come to feel like they missed out and to come to the next one.\n\n(00:54:57):\nAnd so you're constantly creating these kinds of vibes to how to do it. You can't do it if you don't have somebody with a lot of energy. I'm typically the seed crystal for a lot of the groups I'm in to start them off because I have a lot of energy, and I like, anything that people have to say that I think is open-minded or interesting, I like building on and \"yes, and\"-ing and that kind of gives the foundation that it can grow. But look for the people who already roughly want it. Don't try to convince somebody who doesn't want it to want it. They will not. They will ruin the whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:30):\nI just love this playbook for starting to build a little bit of community within a company. Have you written about this by the way? And if not, you should write a whole post about this.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:55:37):\nI have. It's a long essay and it's just not, you can see it in Bits and Bobs. If you gave the Bits and Bobs to Claude and said, \"Please write a thing about nerd clubs and essay and the style,\" it would do it because there's a lot of the pieces are in there, it's just not factored out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:52):\nI see you writing something down right now, which tells me you just articulated something in a new way that you want to say.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:55:52):\nYeah, that's right. That's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:59):\nYou mentioned this idea of constraints of time, and it reminds me of something that you shared in one of your Bits and Bobs around productivity. You say that if you have two hours to do a five-minute task, the effort to do that is impossible and instead you should flip that. Can you talk about this insight and how to be a little more productive?\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:56:15):\nYeah, I think a lot of the trick to productivity is to play yourself like a fiddle and figure out how you work and what gives you energy and set up your day to structure it that way. So I find every time you start a task, there's an activation energy, especially a task you don't really want to do. And then when you complete it, there's a boop. There's a little burst of energy. So if you do this properly, you can get small things that are extremely easy to knock out in 10 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes 30 seconds of effort, and then you do one that takes a longer bit of effort. But if you give it too much space, it's harder to do. So you almost want to find, \"Okay, listen, I got 10 minutes. I got to do this thing where I figure out how to add, do this thing in gusto that I've been putting off. Ten minutes should be enough time to do it and structure it. So okay, right now is the only time I have to do this, to do it.\"\n\n(00:57:01):\nAnd another trick is I use one of my original media messages actually, one of the original public ones is about always rules are better than sometimes rules for self-control. And so if you're going to diet, \"I'm going to skip lunch every day.\" Like holy, you haven't full thought on that at some point like a day with a big executive review, \"I really need to make sure I'm well-fed before I go into this review,\" or something. And now you've broken the streak and now it's over. Whereas if you say a thing you know can do, \"I will not have a dessert unless it would be socially awkward for me to not eat it. For example, in a small environment where somebody made homemade dessert and all of us are eating it, I'm going to...\" So very clear black and white rule that you can hold on forever.\n\n(00:57:50):\nSo for example, since the pandemic started, I've done a Peloton workout every single day since the pandemic started.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:56):\nWow.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:57:56):\nAnd now once I do start going back into the office, if I had to commute into the office, I would sometimes do a meditation to check the box for that. But if I'm not commuting and I'm not deathly sick, I've done a full workout since then. And the idea each day of is today the day of all the hundreds of days in this streak that is the worst or the hardest for me to do this thing? Is this the day? No, of course it's not. I will do it. And so that keeps you in this streak that makes it harder and harder to get out of it. And in some ways, of course you can torture yourself in an unproductive way like at a certain point maybe you should stop that streak, but I think those kinds of structuring help you get the things done you want to get done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):\nIt's like the Seinfeld trick of productivity where you just keep track of how many days in where you've done something essentially.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:58:45):\nYeah, exactly. And I think people don't give those kinds of tactics enough credit because there's lots of little social tricks to yourself and others. This is when you have other people who are depending on you for something and will know that you didn't do the thing, that were so much better. So just little tricks like this help you be wildly more productive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:02):\nActually, I want to go back a little bit. I'm curious what you wrote down when we were chatting earlier that you thought was a good articulation if you're able to share, if it's interesting,\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:59:11):\nI wrote down, and the reason I wrote it down is I've never... And by the way, I collect everything even once I think are maybe onto something. So I wrote down, \"A community with zero people speaking is dead and a community with one person speaking doesn't yet realize it's dead,\" is what I wrote down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):\nSo fun. I love this practice that you have.\n\nAlex Komoroske (00:59:28):\nBy the way, the reason I can do it, I can type insanely quickly. And in undergrad, I wrote my thesis on the emergent power dynamics in Wikipedia's user community and I did 150 hours of interviews with different editors in Wikipedia, and I transcribed them myself. And so I got really, really, really good at I can just pipe an idea straight into my fingertips and still listen to other stuff. So that's another superpower is I've just constantly, I'm able to capture it very, very quickly. I've written notes that are at least good enough for me to clean up within the next day or two into something that's more stable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):\nIs there a way you built this other than... Was it just you did it and you had to do it and you just figured out how to move fast?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:08):\nI just realized later that I could type really good, really fast. I could just pipe it straight through to my fingers and it worked. And, I don't know, I don't know if I hadn't written my thesis, would I have discovered that? I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nI feel like everything you do is on super speed, the way you think, the write and get stuff done. There's a lot.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:30):\nI just realized when-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):\n... a lot of compute.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:00:32):\n... when you're feeling productive, you're unstoppable. And so just how can you be in your flow state as much as possible? And there's things that absolutely completely grind me to a halt, and I just make sure I invest my time in situations that don't have that characteristic. So when I work on something that I believe could work and have a big impact, I can't stop. Sometimes I'll wake up at 4:00 in the morning as I'm typically an early riser and I'm just like, \"I'll write this thing.\" The meeting starts at 7:00 and I just think there's an idea that's really cool here and I let myself lean into those kinds of when I have the moment.\n\n(01:01:05):\nI also find that often if I have an idea and I just have itching to write it down, if I can write down 30 minutes and get a very rough of it in one place, now it's easier to clean it up later. But that first act of creation, I do it whenever the muse hits because it's 10 million times if it's like, \"Oh, write that idea down later,\" you keep on delaying it, delaying it, now it's a month later. \"What was the idea? How did that work again?\" It's gone. And so I just try to capture the interesting insights. It's like a butterfly collector. The butterflies are going by, I try to collect them and put them in my collection as quickly as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:38):\nOr garden as one might describe it.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:01:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:43):\nThis touches on a quote I wanted to talk to you about. I think you described it as your life philosophy. \"Do things that give you energy that you are proud of.\" Talk about that.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:01:54):\nSo to me, it's the combination of when you're doing something you believe in and that gives you energy, you are 10 times more productive. And you also, the effort that you are doing is its own reward. And so you are indefatigable on that topic and you go for much longer. So finding the substance of things that align with you that give you energy, then just it's like infinite energy. It's like they give an opportunity cost because it energizes you more than the opportunity cost of the time to go spend to other things.\n\n(01:02:21):\nAnd two, there are ways to give yourself energy, like for example, playing a video game, or there's any kind of mind-altering substance that might give you that like, \"This gives me energy.\" Those are not things that I'm not saying do those. I'm saying what are the things that you'll look back and say, \"I'm glad I did that. I'm proud that I did that.\" And if you take the perspective of a 10 years on looking back on each decision and thing that you're doing, and imagine seeing this decision played in front of 1,000 people whose opinion you care about, your family, your friends, your role models, would you be proud is a good sign of life that you're taking a broad enough perspective.\n\n(01:02:55):\nWhen you're busy and in the moment, it's so easy to say, \"I just got to do this one thing that's probably not great to get this thing done. And once I do it, it's going to suck. But once I do it, it'll be fine.\" And then you find yourself doing it again and again and again and again and before you know it, you've lost who you want to be and you're now a husk of yourself. And so I think those two pieces lean into where you find energy, where you specifically find energy, your superpower, the thing that you intrinsically enjoy doing, and just make sure it's something that you are actively proud of and that helped make sure you don't take a bunch of shortcuts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):\nAlong those same lines, I think a lot of people have heard a version of this quote, which is, \"New things that give you energy.\" So one, I love the additional piece of it is, \"and that you're proud of.\" Two, you have another quote that I love that makes you think deeply about stuff, which is, \"The secrets of life is things you've heard a million times already, you just weren't ready to hear them.\" Talk about that insight.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:03:53):\nSo this I call the Hallmark card fallacy, which is you discover at great effort some deep insight that resonates with you and makes you see the world differently, and you want to share it. Insights are naturally viral. You want to share them and you go tell someone, it's like, \"Guys, guys, the point of life is the friends we made along the way.\" And people go, \"That's from a Hallmark card, man.\" And to you, it is you now possess the knowledge, the emotional intelligence to understand why that phrase has been shared so many times. Before, you heard it when you weren't ready and now it becomes a trite, \"Duh, everyone says that. That can't possibly be a meaningful statement.\"\n\n(01:04:30):\nThe reason people keep on saying it is because it's meaningful. And so I think that having that space of recognizing it, that when you have these epiphanies that come from different leaps in vertical development or the ability to, when you stare into the abyss and make it through the other side, you realize and learn a bunch of amazing things that you want to pass on others, and it's just really hard to get them to find it.\n\n(01:04:53):\nI find that that's one of the reasons I try to write things that are or share ideas that are like little seeds that you can shoot into someone's brain even if the soil's not ready for it, it's rocky or craggy, at some point in the future, if something goes through there and opens up a crack, that's sitting there to grow into an idea. One of the things that makes me the happiest is when someone I've mentored years and the years in the past, they go search me out years later and say, \"Alex, I just want to let you know, you probably don't even remember talking to me, but that Tuesday at the building, the no-name cafe or whatever, on Google campus, you said something I was frustrated to hear in the moment I didn't understand it. And I just want to tell you, thank you because I finally understand what you were trying to tell me. And I realized that that influenced me in the decisions.\" That to me is one of those meaningful things I can hear.\n\n(01:05:41):\nAnd so I just find that you can't force it before people are ready to hear certain topics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:48):\nMan, that must feel so good to hear those sorts of closing the loop on something long ago. The point you make about cliches that you've heard a million times actually finally feeling right and profound, I had this very experience. I did a psychedelic trip with some friends a while ago, and at the end of it I was just like, \"Man, love is all you need. Love is all you need.\" I felt that so deeply through the experience and I was telling people, they're like, \"Shut up.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:06:16):\nYou telling, oh, do you just do psychedelics? Yeah, it's funny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):\nYeah.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:06:19):\nI have a lot of folks in my broader space who obviously have used it. So I never personally have myself, but I find there's various ways. The transcendent mindset is this feeling of being part of something much, much, much larger than yourself and losing your ego in this thing. There's different ways of doing it. Some people will find it in hiking and being out in the wilderness alone. Some people find it being at a concert and thousands of people perfectly in sync to this thing. Some people find it in religious experience. Some people find it using psychedelics and others to help get there. But a lot of it, it's that same just being willing to be in awe.\n\n(01:06:53):\nThere's so many times that people feel the feeling of awe or wonder or curiosity is treated as a not very serious or childlike thing. And I just don't get that because that is how you are open to disconfirming evidence. It's how you see beyond the current limits of what you... Your ego gets hurt when you get disconfirming evidence. You don't want to hear it. And so you'll construct the world around yourself to not get that disconfirming evidence. But disconfirming evidence is what makes systems strong. It's what makes you strong. And so how do you put yourself in the situation to get that information and really receive it?\n\n(01:07:28):\nAnd part of it is just coming in terms of the fact of early in my career, someone called me kooky a bit. Oh, man. I must be embarrassed. I'm like, \"Okay, fine. Yeah, I'm kooky, whatever.\" I'm totally at peace with the idea that some people track me as kooky and not particularly serious. I think people who watch the work that I do and the indirect impact it has realize that I'm doing something that is working even if they don't fully understand how it works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:53):\nTo start to close our conversation, I want to throw out one more seed that might land with someone in the right time. You have this concept of the adjacent possible, which I think is a really powerful concept. And it's basically argues that a lot of people jump to big bold ideas, and instead the better approach is think about what's a constraint you have and lean into the constraints and use that as a guide. Can you just talk about this and how this might inform how people think about product and strategy?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:08:20):\nSure, yeah. The frame is the adjacent possible, which is I believe comes from design thinking. I've found it from designers in my life who are the ones who would just speak to it. And the adjacent possible is a set of actions that you do, that you can do. They are right in front of you that if you do them, they would work, almost certainly work. And in the tech industry in particular, we default assume that the adjacent possible is like this and then flying leap to something. And in reality, the adjacent possible is quite small. It's within arm's reach. And people will say, \"Oh, you're being nihilist. You're limiting your potential. You're saying don't do big things.\" But when you recognize that your adjacent possible is relatively small, you realize that you actually have full agency to pick within the subset that is within your reach, and your actions matter because you take an action and now the world reconfigures and now you get a next set of actions and it's based partially on the action you just took.\n\n(01:09:11):\nAnd so if you slice this thing up and you have a coherent worldview and you have a principled approach, you can arc to wildly different outcomes than look like they were possible while at each point, each individual action is safe and reasonable. And so you can combine both of these things. I think so many times we try to jump and we jump to the end state of the thing. And actually you don't need to make that decision. If you can slice up your decisions into smaller and smaller decisions, I'm like, \"This next step definitely makes sense.\" It will almost certainly pay for itself or the very least won't be too expensive. And then it might allow these other things to happen and you take it. And if those other things don't happen, okay, don't take another step on that path. That's fine. Go in other directions for a while. If it does, then take another step and another and another and another.\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd this allows you to get rid of a lot of the risk and still be exposed to all the upside. And so the risk comes from trying to jump too far ahead in an unknown environment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):\nIs the general advice if someone's working on trying to figure out the roadmap, trying to think about what products to build is the advice, don't be scared to go a little incremental versus what people are always pushed, to do bigger.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:10:13):\nYou need both. So if you only do incremental, you will follow the shortest, the steepest gradient in front of you. So UXR says a user wants to do this and you'll do exactly that and you'll end up random walking through the thing. So you need coherence about where you're going and the way you get that is by creating a North Star for yourself. It should be in three to five years in the future, it should be very low resolution. It should describe a thing that every single person who reads it who has any kind of knowledge that might be useful or relevant agrees that it is plausible. If this happens, I would not say, \"Well, a miracle happened.\" It'd say, \"I could see how that could work.\" And lawyers say, \"I could see how that could work.\" And someone who's worked on this 30 years ago at a similar product that Microsoft says, \"I can see how that could work.\"\n\n(01:10:51):\nAnd that if you got to the end point, everyone would high five because if it's going to be a thing, they're like, \"I guess that could work.\" At the end we'd be like, \"Oh yeah, neat.\" That's not worth it. You want another story would be like, \"Yeah, great. Wow, we kick off. We changed the way this entire industry works,\" or whatever. And now this is your North Star. North Star should update, but it's because it's far off in the distance. It will update. It will slide up across the sky a little bit. It won't be jerking around. You'll be arcing slightly differently. And then what you do is you look in your adjacent possible and you look for the thing that has the steepest gradient that pulls you towards your North Star. So you just want to go in that direction and you want to go in this direction. This one is second most in demand from what you think, but it's pulling you the direction that you believe will pull you there. Go in that one.\n\n(01:11:31):\nAnd then they keep on repeating. That's it. But you need both. Because if you only do incremental, then you'll end up random walking into a corner. And if you only do the long-term, you end up dreaming big and designing castles in the sky that are impossible to actually manifest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):\nTo give you a metaphor from an experience I had, I did this silent meditation retreat once, and a big part of Buddhism is to not cling to a specific outcome and not have a plan in mind and be sad if it doesn't work out. And so I asked them just how do you achieve success and want to be successful while not doing that? And their metaphor is point your card in a specific direction that you want to go. Just point your card in that direction, essentially in your example of North Star, and just start walking. Don't figure out this is exactly the path I'm going to take to get to this end destination.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:12:19):\nYeah. And you'll know after the fact, you'll say, \"Oh, I curved a little bit or I had this little jog than there.\" And you'll say, \"Ah, it would've been more efficient.\" But we're so focused on efficiency of not wasting effort that we ended up doing nothing at all or doing very dangerous things that don't work. So I'm much sure that I have a path that's slightly inefficient because we're navigating unknowns and we couldn't know no point. I think I've seen the number of times I find where people say, \"I need to know for this strategy,\" that someone was trying to get me to look at and then say, \"is this number in five years, is it going to be 93 or 95?\" And it's like, I don't know. And it doesn't matter either if it's going to be that order of magnitude.\n\n(01:12:56):\nIt doesn't matter, and we don't have to do that analysis if we believe that the order of magnitude is of that thing. It'd actually be we had spent all the time to get the illusion of precision, which at great expense, and then it's the people say, \"Oh, I'm data-driven. I want to really run the analysis to ground.\" There's tons of stuff you can't know ahead of time. So if you're getting a false precision at the beginner, that's a comfort blanket. That's just helping you feel like there isn't uncertainty. There's uncertainty everywhere all the time. And trying to ignore it by trying to pin it down with fake numbers that you just made up for yourself at great expense is a really bad idea. And that's why if the ideas are strong enough, things that have a compounding return don't give you, \"Oh, we'll either get 93 or 95.\" It's like, \"We'll either get zero or we'll get 1,000.\" Great. It doesn't really matter if it's 1,000 or 1,001, who cares? It orders a magnitude larger than the alternative, and so it is better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:48):\nThat's really freeing. I noticed again, you were writing something. I'm again curious which you wrote down that you thought was insightful.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:13:54):\nI actually this time I was not writing did something down. I was checking a thing I thought you might say that was going to reference was Tim Urban's, \"Happiness is the reality minus expectations.\" I always get that backwards, but have you heard this frame, that happiness-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:07):\nLet's get into it. Yeah, we're not going to get this. This is great.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:14:09):\n\"Happiness is reality minus expectations,\" and this is Tim Urban. It was from Wait But Why. And I think it's a very simple distillation of it, of if you set your expectations super high and it comes in and it's amazing, but it's below it, then it's a net negative. So the easiest thing, reality is hard to change. It's not impossible. It's hard to change. Your expectations are super easy. So just change your expectations. Hold it lightly and don't say, \"Oh my gosh, this is going to be my kid's birthday. She's going to remember it. It's going to be the best birthday that she ever had and we're all it's going to be perfect.\" Because then when it doesn't go perfect and it starts raining that day, you're like, \"Gosh.\" You get all worked up. Just say, \"No, I want spend this day in a way that I can look back on and remember fondly.\" And that will include, yeah, it changed.\n\n(01:14:54):\nOne other piece of advice someone gave me that I really like is try to feel the emotion about the story that'll make you feel in 10 years. So if it's funny in 10 years, try to see the humor in it now. And this one in particular was a friend, their newborn would, every time you changed her diaper, would poop. That was only... And when they did it, it would often be projectile. And so it was like a trap. You change the diaper. And it was like, what are you going to do in that situation? And then they're just like, \"It's going to be a funny story in a few years, so let's see the humor in it now.\" Even though, God, I really wish this year-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nThat's funny.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:15:29):\n... you're not spraying poop on her. And I think that that kind of perspective is really, people sometimes hear this as, \"Oh, you're saying don't dream big. Don't set high expectations. Don't expect more and be okay with mediocrity.\" That is not what I'm saying. I'm saying hold those expectations lightly. Allow them to change. Be willing to be convinced by different things, and seek something great. Seek something that you can be truly proud of and that feel very authentic to yourself if you achieved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):\nAlex, I feel like I could talk to you for hours. I can't believe it's already been almost an hour and a half. So just to wrap things up, is there anything else that you thought would be fun to share or maybe a piece of wisdom you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:13):\nI think we covered it. I think we covered a lot of that. And again, we could go on for hours and hours and hours and hours. I could just do a random... I can feature The Compendium where I can pull up a random idea, and let's not do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):\nOkay, amazing. Well, Alex, with that, we've reached the very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:28):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):\nFirst question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:16:33):\nOrigin of Wealth by Eric Beinhocker, which is great. It's about a complexity economics, why the traditional economic model doesn't work, and also why it takes an evolutionary lens on what kinds of business plans work and how companies execute them. That I found my entree into a lot of the systems thinking and I thought it was just absolutely brilliant. And the other one is The Elements of Thinking in Systems, which is short, easy to read, very approachable. In fact, if anything, people think of it as not serious enough because it's too easy to read. It's one of those books that when you read at the beginning you'll say, \"This sounds right.\" And then later, years later, if you read it again you'll go, \"Oh my God, that was so... I wasn't ready for that yet, but that is totally the way.\" So she's one of the people who talks about dancing the systems. Let go and dance with the system is one of her lines, and I think it's just a phenomenal book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:17:24):\nFor me, I was thinking about this, it's The Green Knight, which I watched I think a few years old. It's about the Arthurian legend. It's a challenging movie. In fact, when I watched it, I was like, \"I dislike this. I do not find this interesting.\" And then I couldn't stop thinking about it and it helped me. I think this is one of the reasons I like to write in parable is a parable is open-ended. It encourages and requires the listener to engage into the idea and play with it and see how it affects them and how they affect it. And so for me, The Green Knight, again, I'm not excited to watch it again, but I found it to be the most impactful movie I've seen in the last couple of years in terms of amount of thinking that it caused me to do afterwards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):\nWow, that says a lot. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:18:10):\nTo me, I think the answer for me is WebSim. It's the one that I like playing around with a lot. And I've said it before, I use Claude 20 times a day. I find that it's almost impossible for me to imagine doing work. I mean of course now I've got to use Strawberry and see how that feels, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):\nOne use case of WebSim that I found really fun that I used with Dylan is if you do Gmail, if you give it gmail.com/someone's name, it just comes up with what their email looks like. And could do it for famous people, like for Patrick Allison or whoever, and it's like, \"Wow, that's really good.\"\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:18:45):\nThe elements are really good. One of the things we played around with is having a thing that generates fake data of arbitrary schemas, and I just write a short backstory of a person and then have it generate data that fits in this fictional user person's world. And it's just amazing the kinds of stuff, the coherence it has with, it's weird and it's very specific to that story, but elements are just so, they're like these little holograms of all this information of humanity is interesting informational package, this little thing. And all kinds, it's like a mirror that different things reflect back out of it at you. And it's shocking sometimes to see humanity reflected back at you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:29):\nIt's like a zip file of all human knowledge.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:19:31):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:32):\nAmazing. And it's because it's trained on all the things we've written, right?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:19:35):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:36):\nAll right, two more questions. You have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful in work or in life?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:19:43):\nI guess I've said too, this is cheating, but I said too, the do things that give you energy that you're proud of, and the happiness is reality minus expectations I think are really simple clarifying words to look like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:56):\nAll right. Final question. You can go in one of two directions. One is what's something that you are going to add to this week's Bits and Bobs that you're thinking about right now that we haven't talked about? Or just go to your Compendium and pick a random thing and see what comes up and share.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:20:11):\nOkay, so this is the... I'll just read this off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):\nGreat.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:20:16):\nThis is written a year ago.\n\n(01:20:18):\n\"We've forgotten a world without aggregators. Non-aggregator ecosystems make it so participants don't have to fear empowering their overlord, where that you have to worry about each bit of action you're doing, the aggregator is getting it more and more powerful. MySpace was the Wild West. Facebook made it so you can't change the CSS, which was better for users, containing some freedom. Aggregators make sense in the late stage of an era. At the beginning, they curtail too much exploration.\"\n\n(01:20:42):\nThat's just my random reflections. I don't even remember what conversation that came from originally, but of the power of... I am just so obsessed with the idea that we are in the late stage of this current technical paradigm that we're in and so many things we feel like we figured them all out and nothing can be any different, and I don't love this outcome that we're in, the idea of you're... Just one quick framing. To me, if you ask somebody on the street to tell you what the canonical piece of software is, the answer they'll give you is something like Instagram, which is to say an app, which I think is a shame because an app is monolithic. It's one size fits all. It's not decomposable. It doesn't meaningfully interact with anything else in the broader ecosystem. And it's also only allowed to exist if some of the largest companies in the world say it may exist, which is insane to me.\n\n(01:21:26):\nTo me, software is alchemy. It's the ability to extend human agency beyond ourselves to create something that can then combine with what others have created in unexpected and unforeseen ways to create this commentary of possibility of human agency. And somehow in the past decade, we've become convinced that all of this potential should be squeezed into about a dozen little boxes on your phone. And now with the power of AI, everyone just is default assuming that what's going to happen is we're all going to be locked inside of a box with a super God AI Clippy. And the only thing that people disagree about is which Clippy is it going to be? Whose Clippy is it going to be?\n\n(01:21:57):\nThat to me is bonkers. I don't want that world at all. I want a world where we use this magical duct tape to escape the box, to allow software and humans using it to lean into their agency. And I think aggregators are amazing in an environment where you have a safe environment to have all kinds of interesting stuff that can't be fully open-ended because the aggregator can't allow it to escape the possibility of that ecosystem. And so for me, one of the reasons I'm excited about LLMs being a disruptive technology is I think that it allows us to get out of this monolithic sense of whatever. We're all just beholden to a decreasing number, very powerful organizations, and lean into everybody being able to be creative and collaborative and exercise their agency in a pro-social way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):\nWow. Well, you blew our mind as a final element of this conversation. Alex, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online? Where do they find stuff you're working on if they want to read more and follow the stuff you're thinking about? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:22:58):\nKomoroske.com is where. My husband gives me so much shit for it because it looks like it was designed in the early 2000s, which it was. I link to all the different posts there. If you click, there's a Google group, but now where you can subscribe to my updates whenever I post in the Bits and Bobs or any medium article, that's a good way of taking touch as I publish stuff.\n\n(01:23:16):\nAnd then the way that Google can be useful to me is I have office hours on my site that are open to anybody to join in. I am continually, they're booked off in a few weeks in advance, but if you find something that resonated with you or that didn't, or you think is interesting or, \"Oh, here's a parallel. I don't know if you've thought of it before,\" just reach out to me. And I love, love, love talking to people, interesting people especially who have life experiences and backgrounds that are different from mine. At one point, a magician showed up in my office hours and described and said, \"Hey, this tactic you're talking about in your Bits and Bobs, that's actually cold reading. That's what psychics use.\" And I would find all these crazy connections they'd never occurred to me before. And so people just reaching out and sharing ideas and I love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nAlex, you're awesome. This conversation was exactly what I was hoping it'd be. My brain is buzzing as I expected. Thank you so much for being here. I'm excited for folks to listen to this and to learn from you.\n\nAlex Komoroske (01:24:10):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:12):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:24:15):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to drive word of mouth | Nilan Peiris (CPO of Wise)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou lead work on Codex.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:00:01):\nCodex is OpenAI's coding agent. We think of Codex as just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. It's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack, doesn't check Datadog unless you ask it to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nI remember Karpathy tweeted the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:00:21):\nStarting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex be on call for its own training. Codex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training run, the key infrastructure. So we have a Codex code review that's catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually caught some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. One of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, the Sora Android app, like a fully new app, we built it in 18 days and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to the public.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nHow do you think you win in this space?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:00:47):\nOne of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity. If we're going to build a super system, has to be able to do things. One of the learnings over the past year is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer. It turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. And so we're kind of getting to this idea where if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:04):\nWhen you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:01:10):\nA few of us are constantly on Reddit. There's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints. What we can do is as a product team just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:24):\nBeing at OpenAI, I can't not ask about how far you think we are from AGI.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:01:28):\nThe current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nToday, my guest is Alexander Embiricos, product lead for Codex, OpenAI's incredibly popular and powerful coding agent. In the words of Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT and former podcast guest, \"Alex is one of my all time favorite humans I've ever worked with, and bringing him and his company into OpenAI ended up being one of the best decisions we've ever made.\" Similarly, Kevin Weil, OpenAI's CPO, said, \"Alex is simply the best.\"\n\n(00:01:59):\nIn our conversation, we chat about what it's truly like to build product at OpenAI, how Codex allowed the Sora team to ship the Sora app, which became the number one app in the app store in under one month. Also, the 20x growth Codex is seeing right now and what they did to make it so good at coding, why his team is now focused on making it easier to review code, not just write code, his AGI timelines, his thoughts on when AI agents will actually be really useful, and so much more. A huge thank you to Ed Bayes, Nick Turley, and Dennis Yang for suggesting topics for this conversation.

I've been following for ages and I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):\nI'm even more excited. I really appreciate that. I want to start with your time at OpenAI. So you joined OpenAI about a year ago. Before that, you had your own startup for about five years. Before that, you were a product manager at Dropbox. I imagine OpenAI is very different from every other place you've worked. Let me just ask you this, what is most different about how OpenAI operates and what's something that you've learned there that you think you're going to take with you wherever you go, assuming you ever leave?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:05:49):\nBy far, I would say the speed and ambition of working at OpenAI are just dramatically more than what I can imagine. And I guess it's kind of an embarrassing thing to say because everyone who's a startup founder thinks like, \"Oh yeah, my startup moves super fast and the talent bar is super high and we're super ambitious.\" But I have to say, working in OpenAI just made me reimagine what that even means.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):\nWe hear this a lot about feels like every AI company is just like, \"Oh my God, I can't believe how fast they're moving.\" Is there an example of just like, \"Wow, that wouldn't have happened this quickly anywhere else\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:06:20):\nThe most obvious thing that comes to mind is just the explosive growth of Codex itself. I think it's a while since we bumped our external number, but it's like the 10x-ing of Codex's scale was just super fast in a matter of months and it's well more since then. And once you've lived through that, or at least speaking for myself, having lived through that now, I feel like anytime I'm going to spend my time on building tech product, there's that speed and scale that I now need to meet.\n\n(00:06:52):\nIf I think of what I was doing in my startup, it moved way slower and there's always this balance with startups of how much do you commit to an idea that you have versus find out that it's not working and then pivot. But I think one thing I've realized at OpenAI is the amount of impact that we can have and, in fact, need to have to do a good job is so high that I have to be way more ruthless with how I spend my time now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):\nBefore we get to Codex, is there a way that they've structured the org or, I don't know, the way that OpenAI operates that allows the team to move this quickly? Because everyone wants to move super fast. I imagine there's a structural approach to allowing this to happen.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:07:29):\nI mean, so one thing is just the technology that we're building with has just transformed so many things from both how we build, but also what kinds of things we can enable for users. And we spend most of our time talking about the sort of improvements within the foundation models, but I believe that even if we had no more progress today with models, which is absolutely not the case, but even if we had no more progress, we are way behind on product. There's so much more product to build. So I think just the moment is ripe, if that makes sense.\n\n(00:08:01):\nBut I think there's a lot of counterintuitive things that surprised me when I arrived as far as how things are structured. One example that comes to mind is when I was working on my startup and before that, when I was at Dropbox, it was very important, especially as a PM to always rally the ship and it was like make sure you're pointed in the right direction and then you can accelerate in that direction. But here, I think because we don't exactly know what capabilities will even come up soon and we don't know what's going to work technically, and then we also don't know what's going to land even if it works technically, it's much more important for us to be very humble and learn a lot more empirically and just try things quickly. And the org is set up in that way to be incredibly bottoms up.\n\n(00:08:45):\nThis is, again, one of those things that, as you were saying, everyone wants to move fast. I think everyone likes to say that they're bottoms up, or at least a lot of people do, but OpenAI is truly, truly bottoms up. And that's been a learning experience for me that now it'll be interesting if I ever work at... I don't think it'll even make sense to work at a non-AI company in the future. I don't even know what that means. But if I were to imagine it or go back in time, I think I would run things totally new.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:10):\nWhat I'm hearing is this ready, fire, aim is the approach more than ready, aim, fire. And there's something, and as you process that, because that may not come across well, but I actually have heard this a lot at AI companies is because you don't know, and Nick Turley shared I think the same sentiment, because you don't know how people will use it it doesn't make sense to spend a lot of time making it perfect. It's better to just get it out there in a primordial way, see how people use it, and then go big on that use case.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:09:39):\nYeah. Okay, to use this analogy a little bit, I feel like there is an aim component, but the aim component is much fuzzier. It's kind of like, roughly what do we think can happen? Someone I've learned a ton from working here is a research lead, and he likes to say that at OpenAI, we can have really good conversations about something that's a year plus from now, and there's a lot of ambiguity in what will happen, but that's a right sort of timeline. And then we can have really good conversations about what's happening in low months or weeks. But there's this awkward middle ground, which was as you start approaching a year, but you're not at a year where it's very difficult to reason about, right?\n\n(00:10:18):\nAnd so as far as aiming, I think we want to know, \"Okay, what are some of the futures that we're trying to build towards?\" And a lot of the problems we're dealing with in AI, such as alignment are problems you need to be thinking out really far out into the future. So we're kind of aiming fuzzily there, but when it comes down to the more tactically like, \"Oh yeah, what product will we build and therefore how will people use that product?\" That's the place where we're much more like, \"Let's find out empirically.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):\nThat's a good way of putting it. Something else that when people hear this, people sometimes hear companies like yours saying, \"Okay, we're going to be bottoms up. We're going to try a bunch of stuff. We're not going to have exactly a plan of where it's going in the next few months.\" The key is you all hire the best people in the world. And so that feels like a really key ingredient in order to be this successful at bottoms up work.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:11:02):\nIt just super resonates with me. I was just, again, surprised or even shocked when I arrived at the level of individual drive and autonomy that everyone here has. So I think the way that OpenAI runs, you can't read this or listen to a podcast and be like, \"I'm just going to deploy this to my company.\" Maybe this is a harsh thing to say, but I think very few companies have the talent caliber to be able to do that. So it might need to be adjusted if you were going to implement this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):\nOkay. So let's talk Codex. You lead work on Codex. How's Codex going? What numbers can you share? Is there anything you can share there? Also, just not everyone knows exactly what Codex is, explain what Codex is.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:11:45):\nTotally, yeah. So I had the very lucky job of living in the future and leading products on Codex. And Codex is OpenAI's coding agent. So super concretely, that means it's an IDE extension, a VS code extension that you can install or a terminal tool that you can install. And when you do so, you can then basically pair with Codex to answer questions about code, write code, run tests, execute code, and do a bunch of the work in that thick middle section of the software development lifecycle, which is all about writing code that you're going to get into production.\n\n(00:12:21):\nMore broadly, we think of Codex as what it currently is just the beginning of a software engineering teammate. So when we use a big word like teammate, some of the things we're imagining are that it's not only able to write code, but actually it participates early on in the ideation and planning phases of writing software and then further downstream in terms of validation, deploying and maintaining code.\n\n(00:12:46):\nTo make that a little more fun, one thing I like to imagine is if you think of what Codex is today, it's a bit like this really smart intern that refuses to read Slack and doesn't check Datadog or Century unless you ask it to. And so no matter how smart it is, how much are you going to trust it to write code without you also working with it? So that's how people use it mostly today is they pair with it. But we want to get to the point where it can work just like a new intern that you hire, you don't only ask them to write code, but you ask them to participate across the cycle. So you know that even if they don't get something right the first try, they're eventually going to be able to iterate their rate there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:21):\nI thought the point about not reading Slack and Datadog was it's just not distracted, it's just constantly focused and is always in flow. But I get what you're saying there is it doesn't have all the context on everything that's going on.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:13:31):\nYeah. And that's not only true when it's performing a task, but again, if you think of the best team and teammates, you don't tell them what to do. Maybe when you first hire them, you have a couple meetings and you're like, \"Hey,\" you learn, \"Okay, these prompts work for this teammate, these prompts don't. This is how to communicate with this person.\" Then eventually you give them some starter tasks, you delegate a few tasks. But then eventually you just say like, \"Hey, great. Okay, you're working with this set of people in this area of the code base. Feel free to work with other people on other parts of the code base too, even. And yeah, you tell me what you think makes sense to be done.\" And so we think of this as proactivity and one of our major goals with Codex is to get to proactivity.\n\n(00:14:09):\nI think this is critically important to achieve the mission of OpenAI, which is to deliver the benefits of AGI to all humanity. I like to joke today that AI products, and it's a half joke, they're actually really hard to use because you have to be very thoughtful about when it could help you. And if you're not prompting a model to help you, it's probably not helping you at that time. And if you think of how many times the average user is prompting AI today, it's probably tens of times. But if you think of how many times people could actually get benefit from a really intelligent entity, it's thousands of times per day. And so a large part of our goal with Codex is to figure out what is the shape of an actual teammate agent that is helpful by default.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:54):\nWhen people think about Cursor and even Cloud Code, it's like a IDE that helps you code and auto completes code and maybe does some agentic work. What I'm hearing here is the vision is different, which is it's a teammate. It's like a remote teammate, a building code for you that you talk to and ask to do things. And that also does IDE, auto complete and things like that. Is that a kind of a differentiator in the way you think about Codex?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:15:18):\nIt's basically this idea that if you're a developer and you're trying to get something done, we want you to just feel like you have superpowers and you're able to move much, much faster. But we don't think that in order for you to reap those benefits, you need to be sitting there constantly thinking about, \"How can I invoke AI at this point to do this thing?\" We want you to be able to plug it in to the way that you work and have it just start to do stuff without you having to think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):\nOkay. I have a lot of questions along those lines, but just how's it going? Is there any stats, any numbers you can share about how Codex is doing?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:15:49):\nYeah, Codex has been growing absolutely explosively since the launch of GPT-5 back in August. There's definitely some interesting product insights to talk about as to how we unlock that growth, if you're interested. But again, the last stat we shared there was we were well over 10x since August. In fact, it's been 20x since then. Also, the Codex models are serving many trillions of tokens a week now, and it's basically our most served coding model. One of the really cool things that we've seen is that the way that we decided to set up the Codex team was to build a really tightly integrated product and research team that are iterating on the model and the harness together. And it turns out that lets you just do a lot more and try many more experiments as to how these things will work together.\n\n(00:16:35):\nAnd so we were just training these models for use in our first party harness that we were very opinionated about. And then what we've started to see more recently actually is that other major API coding customers are now starting to adopt these models as well. And so we've reached a point where actually the Codex model is the most served coding model in the API as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:55):\nYou hinted at this, what unlocked this growth, I'm extremely interested in hearing that. It felt like before, I don't know, maybe this was before you joined the team, it just felt like Cloud Code was killing it. Just everyone was sitting on top of Cloud Code. It was by far the best way to code. And then all of a sudden Codex comes around. I remember Karpathy tweeted that he just has never seen a model like this. I think the tweet was the gnarliest bugs that he runs into that he just spends hours trying to figure out nothing else has solved, he gives it to Codex, lets it run for an hour and it solves it. What'd you guys do?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:17:30):\nWe have this strong sort of mission here at OpenAI basically to build AGI. And so we think a lot about how can we shape the product so that it can scale. Earlier I was mentioning like, \"Hey, if you're an engineer, you should be getting help from AI thousands of times per day,\" and so we thought a lot about the primitives for that when we launched our first version of Codex, which was Codex Cloud. And that was basically a product that had its own computer, lived in the cloud, you could delegate to it. And the coolest part about that is you could run many, many tasks in parallel. But some of the challenges that we saw are that it's a little bit harder to set that up, both in terms of environment configuration, like giving the model the tools it needs to validate its changes and to learn how to prompt in that way.\n\n(00:18:20):\nMy analogy for this is, going back to this teammate analogy, it's like if you hired a teammate, but you're never allowed to get on a call with them and you can only go back and forth asynchronously over time. That works for some teammates and eventually that's actually how you want to spend most of your time. So that's still the future, but it's hard to initially adopt. And so we still have that vision of like, that's what we're trying to get you to, a teammate that you delegate to and then is proactive, and we're seeing that growing. But the key unlock is actually first you need to land with users in a way that's much more intuitive and trivial to get value from.\n\n(00:18:54):\nSo the way that most people discover, the vast majority of users discover Codex today is either they download an IDE extension or they run it in their CLI and the agent works there with you on your computer interactively. And it works within a sandbox, which is actually a really cool piece of tech to help that be safe and secure, but it has access to all those dependencies. So if the agent needs to do something, it needs to run a command, it can do so within the sandbox. We don't have to set up any environment. And if it's a command that doesn't work in the sandbox, it can just ask you. And so you can get into this really strong feedback loop using the model. And then over time, our team's job is to help turn that feedback loop into you as a byproduct of using the product, configuring it so that you can then be delegating to it down the line.\n\n(00:19:38):\nAnd again, analogy, keep coming back to it, but if you hire a teammate and you ask them to do work, but you just give them a fresh computer from the store, it's going to be hard for them to do their job. But if as you work with them side by side, you could be like, \"Oh, you don't have a password for this service we use, here's the password for this service. Yeah, don't worry, feel free to run this command,\" then it's much easier for them to then go off and do work for hours without you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):\nSo what I'm hearing is the initial version of Codex was almost too far in the future. It's like a remote in the cloud agent that's coding for you asynchronously. And what you did is, \"Okay, let's actually come back a little bit, let's integrate into the way engineers already integrate into IDs and locally and help them on ramp to this new world,\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:20:21):\nTotally. And it was quite interesting because we dogfood product a ton at OpenAI. So dogfood as in we use our own product. And so Codex has been accelerating OpenAI over the course of the entire year, and the cloud product was a massive accelerant to the company as well. It just turns out that this was one of those places where the signal we got from dogfooding is a little bit different from the signal you get from the general market because at OpenAI, we train reasoning models all day and so we're very used to this kind of prompting and think upfront, run things massively in parallel and it would take some time and then come back to it later asynchronously. And so now when we build, we still get a ton of signal from dogfooding internally, but we're also very cognizant of the different ways that different audiences use the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):\nThat's really funny. It's like live in the future, but maybe not too far in the future. And I could see how everyone at OpenAI is living very far in the future, and sometimes that won't work for everyone.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:21:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):\nWhat about just intelligence training data? I don't know, is there something else that helped Codex accelerate its ability to actually code? Is it better, cleaner data? Is it more just models advancing? Is there anything else that really helped accelerate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:21:38):\nYeah, so there's a few components here. I guess you were mentioning models and the models have improved a ton. In fact, just last Wednesday, we shipped GPT-5.1-Codex-Max, a very accurately named model, that is awesome. It is awesome both because it is for any given task that you were using GPT-5.1-Codex for, it's roughly 30% faster at accomplishing that task. But also it unlocks a ton of intelligence. So if you use it at our higher reasoning levels, it's just even smarter. And that tweet you were saying Karpathy made about, \"Hey, give this your gnarliest bugs,\" obviously there's a ton going on in the market right now, but Codex-Max is definitely carrying that mantle of us tackling the hardest bugs. So that is super cool.\n\n(00:22:28):\nBut I will say it's like some of how we're thinking about this is evolving a little bit from being like, \"Yeah, we're just going to think about the model and let's just train the best model,\" to really thinking about what is an agent actually overall? And I'm not going to try to define agent exactly, but at least the stack that we think of it as having is it's like you have this model, really smart reasoning model that knows how to do a specific kind of task really well, so we can talk about how we make that possible. But then actually we need to serve that model through an API into a harness, and both of those things also have a really big role here.\n\n(00:23:02):\nSo for instance, one of the things that we're really proud of is you can have GPT-5.1-Codex-Max work for really long periods of time. That's not normal, but you can set it up to do that or that might happen. But now routinely we'll hear about people saying, \"Yeah, it ran overnight or it ran for 24 hours.\" And so for a model to work continuously for that amount of time, it's going to exceed its context window. And so we have a solution for that, which we call compaction.\n\n(00:23:28):\nBut compaction is actually a feature that uses all three layers of that stack. So you need to have a model that has a concept of compaction and knows like, \"Okay, as I start to approach this context window, I might be asked to prepare to be run in a new context window.\" And then at the API layer, you need an API that understands this concept and has an endpoint that you can hit to do this change. And at the harness layer, you need a harness that can prepare the payload for this to be done. So shipping this compaction feature that now just made this behavior possible to anyone using Codex actually meant working across all three things. And I think that's increasingly going to be true.\n\n(00:24:02):\nAnother maybe underappreciated version of this is if you think about all the different coding products out there, they all have very different tool harnesses with very different opinions on how the model should work. So if you want to train a model to be good at all the different ways it could work, maybe you have a strong opinion that it should work using semantic search. Maybe you have a strong opinion that it should call bespoke tools or maybe you have, in our case, a strong opinion that it should just use the shell and work in the terminal, you can move much faster if you're just optimizing for one of those worlds. So the way that we built Codex is that it just uses the shell, but in order to make that safer and secure, we have a sandbox that the model is used to operating in.\n\n(00:24:45):\nSo I think one of the biggest accelerants, to go all the way back to answer to your question, is just we're building all three things in parallel and tuning each one and constantly experimenting with how those things work with a tightly integrated product and research team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):\nDo you think you win in this space? Do you think it'll always be this kind of race with other models constantly leapfrogging each other? Do you think there's a world where someone just runs away with it and no one else can ever catch up? Is there a path to just, \"We win\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:25:15):\nAgain, comes back to this idea of building a teammate, and not just a teammate that participates in team planning and prioritization, not just a teammate that really tests its code and helps you maintain and deploy it. But even a teammate... If you think, again, an engineering teammate, they can also schedule a calendar invite or move standup or do whatever, right? And so in my mind, if we just imagine that every day or every week some crazy new capability is just going to be deployed by a research lab, it's just impossible for us as humans to keep up and use all this technology. So I think we need to get to this world where you kind of just have an AI teammate or super assistant that you just talk to and it just knows how to be helpful on its own. So you don't have to be reading the latest tips for how to use it, you've plugged it in and it just provides help.\n\n(00:26:10):\nSo that's kind of the shape of what I think we're building. And I think that will be a very sticky winning product if we can do so. So the shape that in my head, at least I have, is that we build... Maybe a fun topic is like, \"Is Chat the right interface for AI?\" I actually think Chat is a very good interface when you don't know what you're supposed to use it for. In the same way that if I think of I'm on MS Teams or in Slack with a teammate, Chat is pretty good. I can ask for whatever I want. It's kind of the common denominator for everything. So you can chat with a super assistant about whatever topic you want, whether it be coding or not. And then if you are a functional expert in a specific domain such as coding, there's a GUI that you can pull up to go really deep and look at the code and work with the code.\n\n(00:26:54):\nSo I think what we need to build as OpenAI is basically this idea of you have Chat, ChatGPT and not as a tool that's ubiquitously available to everyone, you start using it even outside of work to just help you. You become very comfortable with the idea of being accelerated with AI. So then you get to work and you just can naturally just, \"Yeah, I'm just going to ask it for this and I don't need to know about all the connectors or all the different features. I'm just going to ask it for help and it'll surface to me the best way that it can help at this point in time and maybe even chime in when I didn't ask it for help.\" So in my mind, if we can get to that, I think that's how we really build the winning product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):\nThis is so interesting because with my chat with Nick Turley, the head of ChatGPT, I think he shared that the original name for ChatGPT was Super Assistant or something like that. And it's interesting that there's that approach to the super assistant and then there's this Codex approach. It's almost like the B2C version and the B2B version. And what I'm hearing is the idea here is, okay, you start with coding and building and then it's doing all this other stuff for you, scheduling meetings, I don't know, probably posting in Slack, I don't know, shipping designs. I don't know, is the idea that this is the business version of ChatGPT in a sense, or is there something else there?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:28:08):\nYeah. So we're getting to the one-year time horizon conversation. A lot of this might happen sooner, but in terms of fuzziness, I think we're at the one year. So I'll give you a contention and a plausible way we get there, but as for how it happens, who knows? So basically, if we're going to build a super assistant, it has to be able to do things. So we're going to have a model and it's going to be able to do stuff affecting your world. And one of the learnings I think we've seen over the past year or so is that for models to do stuff, they're much more effective when they can use a computer.\n\n(00:28:41):\nRight, okay, so now we're like, okay, we need the super assistant that can use a computer, or many computers. And now the question is, okay, well, how should it use the computer? And there's lots of ways to use a computer. You could try to hack the OS and use accessibility APIs, maybe a bit easier as you could point and click. That's a little slow and unpredictable sometimes. And another way, it turns out the best way for models to use computers is simply to write code. So we're kind of getting to this idea where, well, if you want to build any agent, maybe you should be building a coding agent and maybe to the user, a non-technical user, they won't even know they're using a coding agent, the same way that no one thinks about are they using the internet or not, which is they're more just like, \"Is WiFi on?\"\n\n(00:29:23):\nSo I think that what we're doing with Codex is we're building a software engineering teammate, and as part of that, we're kind of building an agent that can use a computer by writing code. And so we're already seeing some pull for this. It's quite early, but we're starting to see people who are using Codex for coding adjacent product purposes. And so as that develops, I think we'll just naturally see that, oh, it turns out we should just always have the agent write code if there is a coding way to solve a problem instead of... Even if you're doing a financial analysis, maybe write some code for that.\n\n(00:29:55):\nSo basically like you were like, \"Hey, is this the two ends of this product for the super assistant of ChatGPT?\" In my mind, just coding is a core competency of any agent including ChatGPT. And so really what we think we're building is that competency. So here's the really cool thing about agents writing code is that you can import code. Code is composable, interoperable. Because one very reductive view we could have for an agent is it's just going to be given a computer and it's just going to point and click and go around. But that is the future. And then how we get there is difficult to chart a path because a lot of the questions around building agents aren't like, \"Can the agent do it?\" But it's more about, \"Well, how can we help the agent understand the context that it's working in?\" And the team that's using it probably has a way that they like to do things. They have guidelines. They probably want certain deterministic guarantees about what the agent can or cannot do. Or they want to know that the agent understands this detail.\n\n(00:30:57):\nAn example would be if we're looking at a crash reporting tool, hitting a connector for it, every sub-team probably has a different meta prompt for how they want the crashes to be analyzed. And so we start to get to this thing where, yeah, we have this agent sitting in front of a computer, but we need to make that configurable for the team or for the user and let them... Stuff that the agent does often, we probably just want to build in as a competency that this agent has that it can do.\n\n(00:31:24):\nSo I think we end up with this generalizable thing, that you were saying, of an agent that can just write its own scripts for whatever it wants to do. But I think that the really key part here is can we make it so that everything that the agent has to do often or that it does well, we can just remember and store so that the agent doesn't have to write a script for that again? Or maybe if I just joined a team and you are already on the same team as me, I can just use all those scripts that the agents had written already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:53):\nYeah, it's like if this is our teammate, they can share things that it's learned from working with other people at the company. It just makes sense as a metaphor.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:01):\nRight. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):\nIt feels like you're in the Karpathy camp of, \"Agents today are not that great and mostly slop and maybe in the future they'll be awesome.\" Does that resonate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:11):\nSo I think coding agents are pretty great. I think we're seeing a ton of value there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:11):\nYeah, that feels right. That feels right, yeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:32:17):\nAnd then I think agents outside of coding, it's still very early. And this is just my opinion, but I think they're going to get a whole lot better once they can use coding too in a composable way. It's kind of the fun part of when you're building for software engineers, at my startup, we were building for software engineers too for a lot of that journey, and they're just such a fun audience to build for because they also like building for themselves and are often even more creative than we are in thinking about how to use the technology. So by building for software engineers, you get to just observe a ton of emergent behaviors and things that you should do and build into the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:54):\nI love how you say that because a lot of people building for engineers get really annoyed because the engineers they're just always complaining about stuff. They're like, \"Ah, that sucks. Why'd you build it this way?\" I love that you enjoy it, but I think it's probably because you're building such an amazing tool for engineers that can actually solve problems and just code for them.\n\n(00:33:12):\nKind of along those lines, there's always this talk of what will happen with jobs, engineers, coding, do you have to learn coding? All these things. Clearly the way you're describing it is it's a teammate, it's going to work with you, make you more superhuman, it's not going to replace you. What's the way you just think about the impact on the field of engineering, having this super intelligent engineering teammate?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:33:33):\nI think there's two sides to it, but the one we were just talking about is this idea that maybe every agent should actually use code and be a coding agent. And in my mind, that's just a small part of this broader idea that, hey, as we make code even more ubiquitous... I mean, you could probably claim it's ubiquitous today, even pre AI, right? But as we make code even more ubiquitous, it's actually just going to be used for many more purposes. And so there's just going to be a ton more need for humans with this competency.\n\n(00:34:01):\nSo that's my view. I think this is quite a complex topic. So it's something we talk about a lot and we have to see how it pans out. But I think what we can do basically as a product team building in the space is just try to always think about how are we building a tool so that it feels like we're maximally accelerating people rather than building a tool that makes it more unclear what you should do as the human?\n\n(00:34:27):\nI think, to give an example right now, nowadays when you work with a coding agent, it writes a ton of code, but it turns out writing code is actually one of the most fun parts of software engineering for many software engineers. So then you end up reviewing AI code. And that's often a less fun part of the job for many software engineers. So I actually think we see that this plays out all the time in a ton of micro decisions. So we as a product team, we're always thinking about, \"Okay, how do we make this more fun? How do we make you feel more empowered? Where is this not working?\" And I would argue that reviewing agent written code is a place that today is less fun.\n\n(00:35:04):\nSo then I think, \"Okay, what can we do about that?\" Well, we can ship a code review feature that helps you build confidence in the AI written code. Okay, cool. Another thing we could do is we can make it so that the agent's better able to validate its work. And it gets all the way down into micro decisions. If you're going to have an agent capability to validate work, and let's say you have... I'm thinking of Codex Web right now, you have a pain that sort of reflects the work the agent did, what do you see first? Do you see the diff or do you see the image preview of the code it wrote? And I think if you're thinking about this from perspective, \"How do I empower the human? How do I make them feel as accelerated as possible?\" You obviously see the image first. You shouldn't be reviewing the code unless first you've seen the image, unless maybe it's been reviewed by an AI and now it's time for you to take a look.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:49):\nWhen I had Michael Truell, the CEO of Cursor on the podcast, he had this kind of vision of us moving to something beyond code. And I've seen this rise of something called spec-driven development where you just write the spec and then the AI writes code for you. So you start working at this higher abstraction level. Is that something you see where we're going, just like engineers not having to actually write code or look at code and there's going to be this higher level of abstraction that we focus on?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:36:16):\nYeah. I mean, I think there's constantly these levels of abstraction and they're actually already played out today. Today, coding agents, mostly it's prompt to patch. We're starting to see people doing spec-driven development or planned and driven development. That's actually one of the ways when people ask, \"Hey, how do you run Codex on a really long task?\" Well, it's like often collaborate with it first to write a plan.md, like a markdown file that's your plan. And once you're happy with that, then you ask it to go off and do work. And if that plan has verifiable steps, it'll work for much longer. So we're totally seeing that.\n\n(00:36:50):\nI think spec-driven development is an interesting idea. It's not clear to me that it'll work out that way because a lot of people don't like writing specs either, but it seems plausible that some people will work that way. A bit of a joke idea though is if you think of the way that many teams work today, they often don't necessarily have specs, but the team is just really self-driven and so stuff just gets done. And so almost that it's like, I'm coming up with this on the spot, so it's not a good name, but chatter-driven development where it's just like stuff is happening on social media and in your team communications tools. And then as a result, code gets written and deployed.\n\n(00:37:29):\nSo yeah, I think I'm a little bit more oriented in that way of I don't even necessarily want to have to write a spec. Sometimes I want to, only if I like writing specs. Other times I might just want to say like, \"Hey, here's the customer service channel and tell me what's interesting to know, but if it's a small bug, just fix it.\" I don't want to have to write a spec for that, right?\n\n(00:37:51):\nI have this sort of hypothetical future that I like to share sometimes with people as a provocation, which is in a world where we have truly amazing agents, what does it look like to be a solopreneur? And one terrible idea for how it could look is that actually there's a mobile app and every idea that the agent has to do is just vertical video on your phone and then you can swipe left if you think it's a bad idea and you can swipe right if it's a good idea. And you can press and hold and speak to your phone if you want to give feedback on the idea before you swipe. And in this world, basically what your job is is just to plug in this app into every single signal system or system of record, and then you just sit back and swipe. I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):\nI love this. So this is like Tinder meets TikTok meets Codex.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:38:42):\nIt's pretty terrible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:43):\nNo, this is great. So the idea here is this agent is watching and listening to you, paying attention to the market, your users, and it's like, \"Cool, here's something I should do.\" It's like a proactive engineer just like, \"Here, we should build this feature, fix this thing.\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:38:56):\nExactly. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nI think it's a really good idea.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:39:00):\nCommunicating with you in the lowest effort way for your consumers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:02):\nYeah, yeah, the modern way we communicate, swipe left to right and vertical feed. And then the Sora video, okay, so I see how this all connects now. I see.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:39:11):\nYeah. To be clear, we're not building that, but it's a fun idea. I mean, in this example though, one of the things that it's doing is it's consuming external signals, right? I think the other really interesting thing is if we think about what is the most successful AI product to date, I would argue, it's funny actually not to confuse things at all, but the first time we used the brand Codex at OpenAI was actually the model powering GitHub Copilot. This is way back in the day, years ago. And so we decided to reuse that brand recently because it's just so good, Codex, code execution.\n\n(00:39:46):\nBut I think actually auto completion and IDEs is one of the most successful AI products today. And part of what's so magical about it is that when it can surface ideas for helping you really rapidly, when it's right, you're accelerated. When it's wrong, it's not that annoying. It can be annoying, but it's not that annoying. So you can create this mixed initiative system that's contextually responding to what you're attempting to do.So in my mind, this is a really interesting thing for us as OpenAI as we're building.\n\n(00:40:22):\nSo for instance, when I think about launching a browser, which we did with Atlas, in my mind, one of the really interesting things we can then do is we can then contextually surface ways that we can help you as you're going about your day. And so we break out of this, we're just looking at code or we're just in your terminal into this idea that, \"Hey, a real teammate is dealing with a lot more than just code. They're dealing with a lot of things that are web content. So how can we help you with that?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:51):\nMan, there's so much there. I love this. Okay, so auto complete on web with the browser. That's so interesting. Just like, \"Here's all the things that we can help you with as you're browsing and going about your day.\"\n\n(00:41:01):\nI want to talk about Atlas. I'll come back to that. Codex, code execution, did not know that. That's really clever. I get it now. Okay, and then this chatter, what is a chatter-driven development? No, this is a really good idea, but it reminds me, I had Dhanji on the podcast, CTO of Block, and they have this product called Goose, which is their own internal agent thing. And he talked about an engineer at Block just has Goose watch him with his screen and listens to every meeting and proactively does work that he should probably want to do. So ships to PR, sends an email, drafts a Slack message. So he's doing exactly what you're describing in kind of a very early way.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:41:45):\nYeah, that's super interesting. And I bet you, so if we went and asked them what the bottleneck to that productivity is, did they share what it is?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:54):\nProbably looking at it and just making sure this is the right thing to do, yeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:41:58):\nYeah. So we see this now. We have a Slack integration for Codex. People love if there's something that you need to do quickly, people will just @ mention Codex, \"Why do you think this bug is happening?\" It doesn't have to be an engineer. Even maybe data scientists often here are using Codex a ton to just answer questions like, \"Why do you think this metric moved? What happened?\" So questions, you get the answer right back in Slack. It's amazing, super useful. But as for when it's writing code, then you have to go back and look at the code.\n\n(00:42:25):\nSo the real, I think, bottleneck right now is validating that the code worked and writing code review. So in my mind, if we wanted to get to something like the friend you were talking about's world, I think we really need to figure out how to get people to configure their coding agents to be much more autonomous on those later stages of the work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):\nIt makes sense. Like you said, writing code, I used to be an engineer, I was an engineer for 10 years, really fun to write code, really fun to just get in the flow, build architect, test. Not so fun to look at everyone else's code and just have to go through and be on the hook if it's doing something dumb that's going to take down production. And now that building has become easier, what I've always heard from companies that are really at the cutting edge of this is the bottleneck is now figuring out what to build. And then it's at the end of like, \"Okay, we have all this, all 100 PRs to review. Who's going to go through all that?\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:43:14):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:15):\nYeah.\n\n(00:43:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Jira Product Discovery.

It's clear how engineering is impacted, code is written for you. What has it done to the way you operate and the way PMs operate at OpenAI?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:44:24):\nYeah, I mean, I think mostly I just feel much more empowered. I've always been sort of more technical leaning PM, and especially when I'm working on products for engineers, I feel like it's necessary to dogfood the product. But even beyond that, I just feel like I can do much, much more as a PM. And Scott Belsky talks about this idea of compressing the talent stack. I'm not sure if I've phrased that right. But it's basically this idea that maybe the boundaries between these roles are a little bit less needed than before because people can just do much more. And every time someone can do more, you can skip one communication boundary and make the team that much more efficient.\n\n(00:45:03):\nSo I think we see it in a bunch of functions now, but I guess since you asked about products specifically, now answering questions much, much easier. You can just ask Codex for thoughts on that. A lot of PM type work, understanding what's changing. Again, just ask Codex for help with that. Prototyping is often faster than writing specs. This is something that a lot of people have talked about.\n\n(00:45:29):\nI think something that, I don't think it's super surprising, but something that's slightly surprising is we see... We're mostly building Codex to write code that's going to be deployed to production, but actually we see a lot of throwaway code written with Codex now. It's kind of going back to this idea of ubiquitous code. So you'll see someone wants to do an analysis. If I want to understand something, it's like, okay, just give Codex a bunch of data, but then ask it to build an interactive data viewer for this data. That's just too annoying to do in the past, but now it's just totally worth the time of just getting an agent to go do something.\n\n(00:46:02):\nSimilarly, I've seen some pretty cool prototypes on our design team about if you want to... Well, a designer basically wanted to build an animation, and this is the Coin Animation Codex, and it was like normally it'd be too annoying to program this animation. So they just vibe coded a animation editor and then they use the animation editor to build the animation, which they then check into their repo.\n\n(00:46:24):\nActually, our designers, there's a ton of acceleration there. And speaking of compressing the talent stack, I think our designers are very PME. So they do a ton of product work and they actually have an entire vibe coded side prototype of the Codex app. And so a lot of how we talk about things is we'll have a really quick jam because there's 10,000 things going on, and then the designer will go think about how this should work. But instead of talking about it again, they'll just vibe code a prototype of that in their standalone prototype. We'll play with it. If we like it, they'll vibe engineer that prototype into an actual PR to land. And then depending on their comfort with the code base, like Codex utilizing Rust is a little harder, maybe they'll land it themselves or they'll get close and then an engineer can help them land the PR.\n\n(00:47:11):\nWe recently shipped the Sora Android app, and that was one of the most mind-blowing examples of acceleration, actually, because usage of Codex internally at OpenAI is obviously really, really high, but it's been growing over the course of the year, both in terms of now it's basically all technical staff use it, but even the intensity and know how of how to make the most of coding agents has gone up by a ton. And so the Sora Android app, a fully new app, we built it in 18 days. It went from zero to launch to employees, and then 10 days later, so 28 days total, we went to just GA, to the public, and that was done just with the help of Codex. So pretty insane velocity.\n\n(00:47:55):\nI would say it was a little bit... I don't want to say easy mode, but there is one thing that Codex is really good at if you're a company that's building software on multiple platforms, so you've already figured out some of the underlying APIs or systems, asking Codex to port things over is really effective because it has something you can go look at. And so the engineers on that team were basically having Codex go look at the iOS app, produce plans of work that needed to be done, and then go implement those. And it was looking at iOS and Android at the same time. And so basically it was two weeks to launch to employees, four weeks total. Insanely fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:31):\nWhat makes that even more insane is it became the number one app in the app store. This just boggles the mind. Okay, so 28 days?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:48:39):\nYeah, so imagine number one app in the app store with a handful of engineers. I think it was two or three possibly in a handful of weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:51):\nYeah, this is absurd. Wow.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:48:56):\nYeah, so that's a really fun example of acceleration. And then Atlas was the other one that I think Ben did a podcast, the engine lead on Atlas, sharing a little bit about how we built there. Atlas is actually... I mean, it's a browser, and building a browser is really hard. So we had to build a lot of difficult systems in order to do that. And basically we got to the point where that team has a ton of power users of Codex right now, and it got to the point they where basically... We were talking to them about it, because a lot of those engineers are people I used to work with before at my startup. And so they'd say, \"Before this would've taken us two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week.\" So massive acceleration there as well.\n\n(00:49:49):\nAnd what's quite cool is that we shipped Atlas on Mac first, but now we're working on the Windows version. So the team now is ramping up on Windows and they're helping us make Codex better on Windows too, which is admittedly earlier, just the model we shipped last week is the first model that natively understands PowerShell. So PowerShell being the native Shell language on Windows. So yeah, it's been really awesome to see the whole company getting accelerated by Codex from... And most obviously, also research and improving how quickly we train models and how well we do it. And then even design, as we talked about, and marketing. Actually, we're at this point now where my product marketer is often also making string changes just directly from Slack or updating docs directly from Slack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:37):\nThese are amazing examples. You guys are living at the bleeding edge of what is possible, and this is how other companies are going to work. Just shipping, again, what became the number one app in the app store and just beloved all over the... It just took over, I don't know, the world for at least a week. Built, you said, in 28 days and I don't know, 10 days, 18 days just to get the core of it working.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:00):\nYeah, so it was like 18 days we had a thing that employees were playing with, and then 10 days later we were out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):\nAnd you said just a couple engineers.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nTwo or three. Okay. And then Atlas you said took a week to build?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:12):\nNo, no, no. So Atlas, not the whole week, but Atlas was a really meaty project. And so I was talking to one of the engineers on Atlas about just what they use Codex for. And it's basically like, \"We use Codex for absolutely everything.\" And I was like, \"Okay, well, how would you measure the acceleration?\" And so basically the answer I got back was, \"Previously would've taken two to three weeks for two to three engineers, and now it's like one engineer, one week.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):\nDo you think this eventually moves to non-engineers doing this sort of thing? Does it have to be an engineer building this thing? Could Sora have been built by, I don't know, a PM or designer?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:51:45):\nI think we will very much get to the point, well, basically where the boundaries are a little bit blurred. I think you're going to want someone who understands the details of what they're building, but what details those are will evolve. Kind of like how now if you're writing Swift, you don't have to speak assembly. There's a handful of people in the world, and it's really important that they exist and speak assembly, maybe more than a handful, but that's a specialized function that most companies don't need to have.\n\n(00:52:14):\nSo I think we're just going to naturally see an increase in layers of abstraction. And then the cool thing is now we're entering the language layer of abstraction, like natural language, and then natural language itself is really flexible. You could have engineers talking about a plan and then you could have engineers talking about a spec, and then you could have engineers talking about just a product or an idea. So I think we can also start moving up those layers of abstraction as well.\n\n(00:52:39):\nBut I do think this is going to be gradual. I don't think it's going to go off to all of a sudden nobody ever writes anything, any code and it's just specs. I think it's going to be much more like, \"Okay, we've set up our coding agent to be really good at previewing the build or at running tests,\" maybe that's the first part that most people have set up. And it's like, \"Okay, now we've set it up so they can execute the build and it can see the results of its own changes, but we haven't yet built a good integration harness so that it can,\" in the case of Atlas... By the way, I don't know if they've done any of this or not. I think they've done a lot of this. But maybe the next stage is enable it to load a few sample pages to see how well those work. So then, okay, now we're going to set it up to do that.\n\n(00:53:18):\nAnd I think for some time at least, we're going to have humans curating which of these connectors or systems or components that the agent needs to be good at talking to. And then in the future, there will be an even greater unlock where Codex tells you how to set it up or maybe sets itself up in a repo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:34):\nWhat a wild time to be alive. Wow. I'm curious just the second order effects of this sort of thing, just how quickly it is to build stuff. What does that do? Does that mean distribution becomes much, much more important? Does it mean ideas are just worth a lot more? It's interesting to think about how quick how that changes.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:53:51):\nI'm curious what you think. I still don't think ideas are worth as much as maybe a lot of people think. I still think execution is really hard. You can build something fast, but you still need to execute well on it, still needs to make sense and be a coherent thing overall, yeah, and distribution is massive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nYeah. Just feels like everything else is now more important. Everything that isn't the building piece, which is coming up with an idea, getting to market, profit, all that kind of stuff.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:54:18):\nYeah. I think we might've been in this weird temporary phase where, for a while, it was so hard to build product that you mostly just had to be really good at building product and it maybe didn't matter if you had an intimate understanding of a specific customer. But now I think we're getting to this point where actually if I could only choose one thing to understand, it would be really meaningful understanding of the problems that a certain customer has. If I could only go in with one core competency.\n\n(00:54:52):\nSo I think that's ultimately still what's going to matter most. If you're starting a new company today and you have a really good understanding and network of customers that are currently underserved by AI tools, I think you're set. Whereas if you're good at building websites, but you don't have any specific customer to build for, I think you're in for a much harder time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:14):\nBullish on vertical AI startups is what I'm hearing. Yeah, I completely agree. There's the general thing that can solve a lot of problems and then there's like, \"We're going to solve presentations incredibly well and we're going to understand the presentation problem better than anyone and we're going to plug into your workflows and all these other things that matter for a very specific problem.\" Okay, incredible.\n\n(00:55:36):\nWhen you think about progress on Codex, I imagine you have a bunch of evals and there's all these public benchmarks. What's something you look at to tell you, \"Okay, we're making really good progress,\" I imagine it's not going to be the one thing, but what do you focus on? What's something you're trying to push? What's a KPI or two?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:55:51):\nOne of the things that I'm constantly reminding myself of is that a tool like Codex naturally is a tool that you would become a power user of. So we can accidentally spend a lot of our time thinking about features that are very deep in the user adoption journey. And so we can kind of end up oversolving for that. And so I think it's just critically important to go look at your D7 retention. Just go try the product, sign up from scratch again. I have a few too many ChatGPT Pro accounts that I've, in order to maximally correctly dogfood, signed up for on my Gmail and they charge me 200 bucks a month. I need to expense those. But I think just the feeling of being end user and the early retention stats are still super important for us because as much as this category is taking off, I think we're still in the very early days of people using them.\n\n(00:56:44):\nAnother thing that we do that I think we might be the most user feedback/social media pilled team out there in this space is like a few of us are constantly on Reddit and Twitter, and there's praise up there and there's a lot of complaints, but we take the complaints very seriously and look at them. And I think that, again, because you can use a coding agent for so many different things, it often is kind of broken in many sort of ways for specific behaviors. So we actually monitor a lot just what the vibes are on social media pretty often, especially I think for Twitter/X, it's a little bit more hypey and then Reddit is a little more negative but real actually. So I've started increasingly paying attention to how people are talking about using Codex on Reddit actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):\nThis is important for people to know. Which of the subreddits do you check most? Is there like an r/Codex or?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:57:44):\nI mean, the algorithm's pretty good at surfacing stuff, but r/Codex is there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):\nOkay. I'll take. Very interesting. And then if people tag you on Twitter, you still see that, but maybe not as powerful as seeing it on Reddit.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:57:56):\nWell, yeah. Well, the thing with Twitter is it's a little bit more one-to-one, even if it's in public. Whereas with Reddit, those are really good upvoting mechanics and maybe most people are still not bots, unclear. So you get good signal on what matters and what other people think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:09):\nSo interestingly, Atlas, I want to talk about that briefly. You guys launched Atlas. I tweeted actually that I tried Atlas and then I don't love the AI only search experience. I was just like, \"I just want Google sometimes,\" or whatever. Just waiting for AI to give me an answer, I'm like, \"I don't want to... \" And there was no way to switch. I just tweeted, \"Hey, I'm switching back. It's not great.\" And I feel like I made some PMs at OpenAI sad. And I saw someone tweet, \"Okay, we have Atlas now,\" which I imagine was always part of the plan. It's probably an example of just, \"We got to ship stuff, see how people use it and then we figure it out.\" So I guess one is that, I don't know, is there anything there? And two, I'm just curious, why are you guys building a web browser?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (00:58:48):\nSo I worked on Atlas for a bit. I don't work on it now. But a bit of the narrative here for me just to tell my story a bit was I was working on this screen sharing, pair programming startup, and then we joined OpenAI. And so the idea was really to build a contextual desktop assistant. And the reason I believe that's so important is because I think that it's really annoying to have to give all your context to an assistant and then to figure out how it can help you. So if it could just understand what you are trying to do, then it could maximally accelerate you. So I still think of Codex actually as a contextual assistant from a little bit of a different angle, starting with coding tasks.\n\n(00:59:30):\nBut some of the thinking, at least for me personally, I can't speak for the whole project, was that a lot of work is done in the web. And if we could build a browser, then we could be contextual for you, but in a much more first class way. We weren't hacking other desktop software which have very varied support for what content they're rendering to the accessibility tree. We wouldn't be relying on screenshots, which are a little bit slower and unreliable. Instead, we could be In the rendering engine and extract whatever we needed to help you. And also I like to think of video games, I don't know if you've played, I don't know, say Halo, you walk up to an object, I mean, this is true for many games, you press... Man, it's been a long time, this is embarrassing. Press X and it just does the right thing. And I was one of those guys who always read the instruction manual for every video game that I bought.\n\n(01:00:24):\nAnd I remember the first time I read about a contextual action and I just thought it was this really cool idea. And the thing about a contextual action is we need to know what you are attempting to do. We have a little bit of context and then we can help. And I think this is critically important because imagine this world that we reach where we have agents that are helping you thousands of times per day.\n\n(01:00:49):\nImagine if the only way we could tell you that we helped you was if we could push notify you. So you get a thousand push notifications a day of an AI saying like, \"Hey, I did this thing. Do you like it? \" It'd be super annoying, right? Whereas imagine, going back to software engineering, I was looking at a dashboard and I noticed some key metric had gone down. And at that point in time, an AI could maybe go take a look and then surface the fact that it has an opinion on why this metric went down and maybe a fix right there right when I'm looking at the dashboard. That would much more keep me in flow and enable the agent to take action on many more things.\n\n(01:01:26):\nSo in my mind, part of why I'm excited for us to have a browser is that I think we have then much more context around what we should help with. Users have much more control over what they want us to look at. It's like, \"Hey, if you want us to take action on something, you can open it in your AI browser. If you don't, then you can open it in your other browser.\" So really clear control and boundaries. And then we have the ability to build UX that's mixed initiatives so that we can surface contextual actions to you at the time that they're helpful as opposed to just randomly notifying you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):\nHearing the vision for Codex being the super assistant, it's not just there to code for you. It's trying to do a lot for you as a teammate, as this kind of super teammate, and that makes you awesome at work. So I get this. Speaking of that, are there other non-engineering common use cases for Codex? Just ways that non-engineers... We talked about designers prototyping and building stuff, are there any fun or unexpected ways people are using Codex that aren't engineers?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:02:24):\nI mean, there's a load of unexpected ways, but I think most of where we're seeing real traction with people using things are still for now very, I would say, coding adjacent or tech-oriented, places where there's a mature ecosystem or maybe you're doing data analysis or something like that. I personally am expecting that we're going to see a lot more of that over time. But for now, we're keeping the team very focused on just coding for now because there's so much more work to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:54):\nFor people that are thinking about trying out Codex, does it work for all kinds of code bases? What code does it support? If you're like, I don't know, SAP, can you add Codex and start building things? What's the sweet spot? Where does it start to not be amazing yet?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:03:11):\nI'm really glad you asked this question actually because the best way to try Codex is to give it your hardest tasks, which is a little different than some of the other coding agents. Some tools you might think, \"Okay, let me start easy or just vibe code something random and decide if I like the tool.\" Whereas we're really building Codex to be the professional tool that you can give your hardest problems to. And that writes high quality code in your enormous code base that is in fact not perfect right now. So yeah, I think if you're going to try Codex, you want to try it on a real task that you have and not necessarily dumb that task down to something that's trivial, but actually a good one would be you have a hard bug and you don't know what's causing that bug and you ask Codex to help figure that out or to implement that the fix.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:00):\nI love that answer. Just give it to your hardest problem.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:03):\nI will say if you're like, \"Hey, okay, well, the hardest problem I have is that I need to build a new unicorn business,\" obviously that's not going to work. Not yet. So I think it's like give it the hardest problem, but something that is still one question or one task to start. That's if you're testing and then over time you can learn how to use it for bigger things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:25):\nYeah. What languages does it support?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:27):\nBasically, the way we've trained Codex is there's a distribution of languages that we support and it's fairly aligned with the frequency of these languages in the world. So unless you're writing some very esoteric language or some private language, it should do fine in your language.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:41):\nIf someone was just getting started, is there a tip you could share to help them be successful? If you could just whisper a little tip into someone just setting up Codex for the first time to help them have a really good time, what's something you would whisper?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:04:54):\nI might say try a few things in parallel. So you could try giving it a hard task, maybe ask it to understand the code base, formulate a plan with it around an idea that you have and kind of build your way up from there. And the meta idea here is, again, it's like you're building trust with a new teammate. And so you wouldn't go to a new teammate and just give them like, \"Hey, do this thing. Here's zero context.\" You would start by first making sure they understand the code base and then you would maybe align on an approach and then you would have them go off and do bit by bit. And I think if you use Codex in that way, you'll just naturally start to understand the different ways of prompting it because it's a super powerful agent and model, but it is a little bit different to prompt Codex than other models.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):\nJust a couple more questions. One, we touched on this a little bit, as AI does more and more coding, there's always this question of, \"Should I learn to code and why should I spend time doing this sort of thing?\" For people that are trying to figure out what to do with their career, especially if they're into software engineering computer science, do you think there's specific elements of computer science that are more and more important to lean into, maybe things they don't need to worry about? What do you think people should be leaning into skill-wise as this becomes more and more of a thing in our workplace?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:06:11):\nI think there's a couple angles you could go at this from. Well, the easiest one to think of at least is just be a doer of things. I think that with coding agents getting better and better over time, it's just what you can do as even someone in college or a new grad is just so much more than what that was before. And so I think you just want to be taking advantage of that. And definitely when I'm looking at hiring folks who are earlier career, it's definitely something that I think about is how productive are they using the latest tools? They should be super productive. And if you think of it in that way, they actually have less of a handicap than before versus a more senior career person because the divide is actually getting smaller because they've got these amazing coding agents now. So that's one thing, which is, I guess the advice is just learn about whatever you want, but just make sure you spend time doing things, not just fulfilling homework assignments, I guess.\n\n(01:07:11):\nI think the other side of it though is that it's still deeply worth understanding what makes a good overall software system. So I still think that skills, like really strong systems engineering skills, or even really effective communication and collaboration with your team, skills like that I think are important or are going to continue to matter for quite some time. I don't think it's going to be all of a sudden the AI coding agents are just able to build perfect systems without your help. I think it's going to look much more gradual where it's like, okay, we have these AI coding agents, they're able to validate their work. It's still important.\n\n(01:07:51):\nFor example, I'm thinking of an engineer who was working on Atlas, since we were talking about it, he set up Codex so that it can verify its own work, which is a little bit non-trivial because of the nature of the Atlas project. So the way that he did that was he actually prompted Codex like, \"Hey, why can't you verify your work? Fix it,\" and did that on a loop. And so you still, at various phases, are going to want a human in the loop to help configure the coding agent to be effective. So I think you still want to be able to reason about that. So maybe it's less important that you can type really fast and you understand exactly how to write... Not that anyone writes a 4H loop or something, or you don't need to know how to implement a specific algorithm. But I think you need to be able to reason about the different systems and what makes a software engineering team effective. So I think that's the other really important thing.\n\n(01:08:40):\nThen maybe the last angle that you could take is, I think if you're on the frontier of knowledge for a given thing, I still think that's deeply interesting to go down, partially because that knowledge is still going to be... Agents aren't going to be as good at that, but also partially because I think that by trying to advance the frontier of a specific thing, you'll actually end up being forced to take advantage of coding agents and using them to accelerate your own workflow as you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):\nWhat's an example that when you talk about being at the frontier of something?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:09:12):\nCodex writes a lot of the code that helps manage its training runs, the key infrastructure. We move pretty fast and so we have a Codex code review is catching a lot of mistakes. It's actually cause some pretty interesting configuration mistakes. And we're starting to see glimpses of the future where we're actually starting to have Codex even be on call for its own training, which is pretty interesting. So there's lots there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:38):\nWait, what does that mean to be on call for its own training? So it's running, it's training and it's like, \"Oh, something broke, someone needs...\" And does it alert people or it's like, \"Here, I'm going to fix the problem and restart\"?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:09:47):\nThis is an early idea that we're figuring out. But the basic idea is that during a training run, there's a bunch of graphs that today humans are looking at and it's really important to look at those. We call this babysitting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nBecause it's very expensive to train, I imagine, and very important to move fast and-\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:03):\nExactly. And there's a lot of systems underlying the training run. And so a system could go down or there could be an error somewhere that gets introduced. And so we might need to fix it or pause things or, I don't know, there's lots of actions we might need to take. And so basically having Codex run on a loop to evaluate how those charts are moving over time is this idea that we have to how to enable us to train way more efficiently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):\nI love that. And this is very much along the lines of this is the future of agents. Codex isn't just for building code, it's a lot more than that.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):\nOkay, last question. Being at OpenAI, I can't not ask about your AGI timeline and how far you think we are from AGI. I know this isn't what you work on, but there's a lot of opinions, a lot of, I don't know, timelines. How far do you think we are from a humanly human version of AI, whatever that means to you?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:10:56):\nFor me, I think that it's a little bit about when do we see the acceleration curves go like this? Or I don't know which way I'm mirrored here. When do we see the hockey stick? And I think that the current limiting factor, I mean, there's many, but I think a current underappreciated limiting factor is literally human typing speed or human multitasking speed on writing prompts. And like you were talking about, it's like you can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on can you go review all that code?\n\n(01:11:29):\nSo my view is that we need to unblock those productivity loops from humans having to prompt and humans having to manually validate all the work. So if we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks. Unfortunately, I don't think that's going to be binary. I think it's going to be very dependent on what you're building. So I would imagine that next year, if you're a startup and you're building new pieces, like some new app or something, it'll be possible for you to set it up on a stack where agents are much more self-sufficient than not. But now let's say, I don't know, you mentioned SAP, let's say you work in SAP, they have many complex systems and they're not going to be able to just get the agent to be self-sufficient overnight in those systems. So they're going to have to slowly maybe replace systems or update systems to allow the agent to handle more of the work end to end.\n\n(01:12:22):\nSo basically my long answer to your question, maybe boring answer is that I think starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity. And then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies like hockey stick that productivity. And then somewhere in that fuzzy middle is when that hockey sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI tier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nI love this answer. It's very practical and it's something that comes up a lot on this podcast. Just like the time to reveal all the things AI is doing is really annoying and a big bottleneck. I love that you're working on this because it's one thing to just make coding much more efficient and do that for people. It's another to take care of that final step of, \"Okay, is this actually great?\" And that's so interesting that your sense is that's the limiting factor. It comes back to your earlier point of even if AI did not advance anymore, we have so much more potential to unlock as we learn to use it more effectively. So that is a really unique answer. I haven't heard that perspective on what is the big unlock. Human typing speed to review basically what AI is doing for us. So good.\n\n(01:13:31):\nOkay, Alexander, we covered a lot of ground. Is there anything that we haven't covered? Is there anything you wanted to share, maybe double down on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:13:43):\nI think one thing is that the Codex team is growing. And as I was just saying, we're still somewhat limited by human thinking speed and human typing speed. We're working on it. So if you're an engineer or a salesperson, or I'm hiring a product person, please hit us up. I'm not sure the best way to give contact info, but I guess you can go to our jobs page, or do they have contact for you actually? Do listeners have contact for you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:10):\nWhere they send me like, \"Hey, I want to apply to Codex\"? I do have a contact form at lennyrachitsky.com. I'm afraid of all the amazing people that are going to ping me. But there we go, we could try that. Let's see how that goes.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:14:20):\nOkay. Or maybe an easier version, we can edit all that out or up to you. Yeah, or I would just say you can drop us a DM. For example, I'm Embirico on Twitter, and hit me up if you're interested in joining the team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\nWhat a dream job for so many people. What's a sign they... I don't know, what's a way to filter people a little bit so they're not flooding your inbox?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:14:42):\nSo specifically if you want to join the Codex team, then you need to be a technical person who uses these tools. And I think I would just ask yourself the question, \"Hey, let's say I were to join OpenAI and work on Codex over the next six months and crush it, what does the life of a software engineer look like then?\" And I think if you have an opinion on that, you should apply. And if you don't have an opinion on that and have to think about it first, depending on how long you have to think about it, I guess that would be the filter. I think there's a lot of people thinking about this space. So we're very interested in folks who have already been thinking about what the future should look like with agents. And we don't have to agree on where we're going, but I think we want people who are very passionate about the topic, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nIt's very rare to be working on a product that has this much impact and is at such a bleeding edge of where it's possible. What a cool role for the right person. So it's awesome that you have an opening and this audience is a really good fit potentially for that role. So I hope we find someone, that would be incredible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, Alexander. Are you ready?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:15:54):\nI don't know what these are, but I'm excited. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:57):\nThey're the same questions I ask everyone except for the last one. So probably not a surprise. I should probably make them more often a surprise. Okay, first question, what are a couple of books that you recommend most to other people, two or three books that come to mind?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:16:12):\nI have been reading a lot of science fiction recently, and I'm sure this has been recommended before, but The Culture, I think it's Ian Banks is the name of the author. Part of why I love it is because it's basically relatively recent writing about a future with AI, but it's an optimistic future with AI. And I think a lot of sci-fi is fairly dystopian. But the joke, at least on The Culture subreddit is that, let me see if I can get this right, it is a space communist utopia, or I think it's a gay space communist utopia. And I just think it's really fun to think about, to use The Culture as a way to think about what kind of world can we usher in and what decisions can we make today to help usher in that world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):\nWow. I don't think anyone's recommended that. I know you're reading, you've mentioned before I start recording, Lord of the Rings right now. If you want another AI-ish sci-fi book, have you read Fire Upon the Deep?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:15):\nNo, I haven't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):\nOkay, it's incredibly good. It's like a sci-fi space opera sort of epic tale with super intelligence.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:25):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:25):\nYeah. Mostly not optimistic, but somewhat optimistic.\n\n(01:17:30):\nOkay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:17:36):\nYeah, there's an anime called Jujutsu Kaisen, which I really like. Again, it's got a slightly dark topic of demons. But what I love about it is that the hero is really nice. And I think there's this new wave of anime and cartoons where the protagonists are really friendly and people who care about the world rather than being sort of, if you look at some older anime that started the genre, there's Evangelion or Akita and those characters, the protagonists are deeply flawed, quite unhappy. They didn't start the genre, but it was a trend for a while to poke fun at the idea that in these cartoons the protagonist was very young, but being given a ridiculous amount of responsibility to save the world. So there was kind of a wave of content that was critiquing this by making the character basically go through serious mental issues in the middle of the show. And I'm not saying this is better, but at least it's quite fun to have these really positive protagonists are just trying to help everyone around them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:43):\nI love how much we're learning about your personality hearing these recommendations. Nice protagonists, optimistic futures. I like the [inaudible 01:18:53].\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:18:53):\nI think if you don't believe it, you can't will it into existence. So you need a balance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):\nThis is your training data.\n\n(01:18:59):\nIs there a product you recently discovered you really love? Could be an app, could be some clothing, could be some kitchen gadget, tech gadget, a hat.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:19:09):\nYeah, so I have been quite into combustion engines and cars. Actually, the reason I came to America initially was because I wanted to work on US aircraft, but now I work in software. And so for the longest time, I've basically only had quite old sports cars, old just because they were more affordable. And then recently we got a Tesla instead. And I have to say that I find the Tesla software quite inspiring. In particular, it has the self-driving feature. And I've mentioned a few times today, I think it's really interesting to think about how to build mixed initiative software that makes you feel maximally empowered as a human, maximally in control, but yet you're getting a lot of help. And I think they did a really good job with enabling the car to drive itself, but all these different ways that you can adjust what it's doing without turning off the self-driving. So you can accelerate, it'll listen to that. You can turn a knob to change its speed. You can steer slightly. I think it's actually a masterclass in building an agent that still leaves the human in control.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):\nThis reminds me Nick Turley's whole mantra is, \"Are we maximally accelerated?\"\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nFeels like it's completely infiltrated everything at OpenAI, which makes sense, that tracks.\n\n(01:20:32):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often think about and come back to in work or in life that's been helpful?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:39):\nI don't know if I have a life motto, but maybe I can tell you about the number one company value from my startup.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:45):\nLove it.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:46):\nWhich is still something that sticks with me, which is to be kind and candid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:51):\nThat tracks. Kind and candid. Wow, that's a great combo.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:20:54):\nYeah. And we had to put them together because we, as founders, realized that we often would be nice and it wasn't actually the right thing to do. We would delay the difficult conversations and we were not candid. And so every time we would remind ourselves of this motto and then we would become more candid. And then six months later, we would realize that we were in fact not candid six months ago and we needed to be even more candid. So then the question is like, \"Okay, how should we be candid?\" It's like, \"Okay, well, let's think of being candid as an act of kindness,\" but also think of that both in terms of doing it and willing ourselves to do it, but also in terms of how we frame it as people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:32):\nThat is a beautiful way of summarizing how to lead well. What's the book about challenge directly but care deeply? Radical Candor.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:21:43):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:44):\nSo it's like another way of thinking about Radical Candor.\n\n(01:21:46):\nOkay, last question. I was looking up your last name just like, \"Hey, what's the story here?\" So your last name is Embiricos, and I was talking at ChatGPT and it told me the most famous individuals with the surname are the influential Greek poet and psychoanalyst Andreas Embiricos and his relative, the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector, George Embiricos. So the question is, which of these two do you most identify with, the Greek poet and psychoanalyst or the wealthy shipping magnate and art collector?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:19):\nI think it's going to have to be the poet because he loved the island that our family's from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):\nWait, you know those people? Okay, this is not news to you. Okay.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:30):\nWell, I mean, it's an enormous family. But it's like Greek, so these big families, everyone's your uncle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):\nLove this. Okay.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:36):\nYou know what I mean? My mother's Malaysian and also everyone is my uncle or aunt in Malaysia too, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:42):\nYeah.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:22:43):\nBut yeah, he loved this island that the family initiated from. I believe, I don't actually know where that's shipping magnate lived, I think it was New York or something. But anyway, we all came from this island called Andros, which is a really beautiful place. And it's like there's more livestock there than humans. Not too many tourists go there. But I think part of what I think is really cool is he published a lot and a lot of his writing is about the beauty of that island, which I think is super cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:12):\nWow, that was an amazing answer.\n\n(01:23:14):\nTwo more questions, where can folks find you if they want to follow you online and maybe reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:23:20):\nI'm one of those people who has social media only for the purposes of having work. My phone turns black and white at 9:00 PM at night. But yeah, so Twitter or X, @Embirico. And yeah, if you post in r/Codex, I'll probably see it. So you can go there.\n\n(01:23:40):\nHow can listeners be useful? I would say please try Codex, please share feedback, let us know what to improve. We pay a ton of attention to feedback. I think, honestly, the growth has been amazing, but it's still very early times, so we still pay a lot of attention and hope to do so forever. And also, I would say if you're interested in working on the future of coding agents and then agents generally, then please apply to our job site and/or message me in those social media places.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:10):\nAlexander, this was awesome. I always love meeting people working on AI because it always feels like this very, I don't know, sterile, scary, mysterious thing. And then you meet the people building these tools and they're always just so awesome, and you especially, just so nice. And like the examples you shared, optimism and kindness, this is what we want to be. These are the kinds of people we want to be building these tools that are going to drive the future. So I'm really thankful that you did this. I'm grateful to have met you, and thank you so much for being here.\n\nAlexander Embiricos (01:24:45):\nYeah, thanks so much for having me. This was fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nThank you so much for listening.

I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. It's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here, and so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nYou're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:00:29):\nThey're trying now to be the leader who everyone loves, but what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. This employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job, you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them. You don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out. Ultimately, that leads to the demise of your company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nYou have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end the meeting.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:00:54):\nMy three questions to end the meeting are...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nToday my guest is Alisa Cohn. Alisa is an executive coach who has worked with C-suite execs at both startups like Etsy, Wirecutter, Venmo, and DraftKings, along with Fortune 500 companies like Microsoft, Google, Pfizer, and the New York Times. She was named one of the top 50 coaches in the world by Thinkers50 and the number one startup coach for the past four years by Global Gurus. What I love about Alisa is that she gives her clients very specific and actionable advice. In her conversation, Alisa shares specific language and phrases that you can use when having a difficult conversation with your reports to make these conversations go much smoother and be less difficult. Also, three questions you should ask at the end of every meeting to make the most possible forward progress after each meeting. Plus, why your job as a leader isn't to make people happy and what you should be focused on instead, and a set of questions that she calls the founder prenup that you should talk through with potential founders to make sure that these are the people that you want to be working with for a long, long time.\n\n(00:01:59):\nThere's also so much more advice. If you're a leader of people or a founder, and especially if you dread hard conversations, this episode is for you.

Alisa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:04:54):\nLenny, it's so great to be here and thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:57):\nI want to dive right into talking about your advice on having difficult conversations. I personally dread difficult conversations. I feel like I practice ahead of these things. I'm like, \"I'm going to say these things. It's going to go like this,\" and it never goes as well as I hope. I always say the wrong thing. I feel like this is very relatable. They're called difficult conversations for a reason.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:05:18):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:19):\nI know you work with a lot of execs on this specifically, and what I love is you've actually come up with a bunch of scripts that help people make these conversations less difficult. So how about we talk through some of these scripts that people can actually start applying?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:05:32):\nLet's do that. I love that idea. And also Lenny, as you just said, very relatable and also, so you're not alone. If I could ask you a question, if you're picturing a difficult conversation that you have had, should have, might have, and you're nervous about, it's hard for you, can you sum it up? What's hard about it? Because it's helpful to clarify what is hard about it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:56):\nGreat question. I just don't want to make people sad and upset, and I worry about their reaction, how to deal with that, and them just getting really upset and mad and just like, \"Oh, man. This really made things worse.\" So I worry about the reaction, I guess.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:11):\nOkay, about making things worse or about their reaction?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:13):\nThe reaction, just making someone upset and sad. I don't want to do that.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:17):\nMaking someone upset. Okay, good. And again, you're not alone about that. Just one more question on that. What's the problem if they're sad and upset? What does that mean to you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:26):\nOh, I love this life coaching we're doing. Yeah, so it's like what happens if they get sad and upset?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:36):\nI feel like it's stuff that I'm going to have to deal with. It's like this drama all of a sudden, this new fire I have to think about. And yeah, it's like the additional work it creates and also just, I don't know. Yeah, it's a good question.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:06:48):\nYou can think about it some more, right? I'm not going to put you on the spot right now, but just to say for all of us, the reason they're difficult, to your point, they're difficult. But we're putting meaning on things all the time, every day, all the time, and I think it's important, it's actually helpful in motivating you to have difficult conversations, but also in helping them go well. If you can get to the bottom of what you're putting on top of it, what you're weighting it with, because I can understand that again, you are not alone. I don't want to make people upset. Totally.\n\n(00:07:20):\nAnd also, I would just say on the other hand, when you're enlightening someone or you're working out a situation with someone and it's difficult, if you don't give them the opportunity to hear what you have to say, if you don't bring this up, then you're never going to have the opportunity to help them see something differently or help them improve or help you improve the relationship or whatever it is you're trying to do. And so, I can understand it's a natural thing. I don't want to make them upset.\n\n(00:07:51):\nNo one wants to make anybody upset, but through that upset on the other side of that, can often be a whole new possibility and a whole new revelation, and actually a lot of joy and freedom. I think that we forget about all the other possibilities that come out of difficult conversations and we just land on these really uncomfortable parts about like, \"oh, it's going to be a lot of extra work\" or like, \"They're going to get uncomfortable or even maybe cry.\" And I think it's just really helpful to tap into what you make it mean and then also what other possibilities it could mean.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:23):\nI love that. And it's one thing to hear that and say that, it's another to actually feel that deeply and feel like I shouldn't be as worried as I am. I think part of it is doing these enough times where you're like, \"Okay, it's actually not so hard.\" And the other is having some of this support. To make this even more real, let's give some examples of what we say when we say difficult conversations. There's like, \"You're not getting a promotion that you thought you would, we're going to let you go.\" What other examples or common difficult conversations that you run across?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:08:50):\nThose are two very common ones. And then of course, the most common one is just difficult performance feedback. Or [inaudible 00:08:56] what we say, quote unquote, \"constructive performance feedback,\" which we never made positive. It only is the sort of things that you're not doing well. I think there are two flavors of that. One is, \"You're screwing up\" and the other is, \"Developmentally, I'd like to see you add something or change something.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):\nYes. And as you say that, one of the other fears I have is them just disagreeing and me feeling like maybe it's not right, maybe I'm wrong and feeling shit maybe. I didn't see something and then just looking worse after the whole thing.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:09:27):\nYeah. And so then I think what's also really helpful to, and part of the process that we can talk about this for sure is getting a difficult conversation is number one, tapping into what's uncomfortable for it, for you, about it. And then number two, also getting your mindset right. So to say the obvious, are you doing this to hurt someone's feelings? No, never, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:49):\nThe opposite.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:09:50):\nThat's not the reason that anyone's doing it. Sometimes people are giving the performance feedback or talking about something that's been bothering them in order to express themselves and vent. And actually, that is very helpful to identify for yourself, that's why I'm doing it. And then, maybe not do it then, until you can transform your reasoning. But at the end of the day, the hope is as a manager, the reason that you're giving someone this so-called constructive feedback is because you're helping them get better. You need them to change the behavior. They'll never get promoted if they keep doing that. They'll never be successful if they keep doing that. And so, it's your job as a leader and as a manager, to help them out of that problem and help them do something different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):\nThe best story I've heard to make that really real for me, I think it was Kim Scott when she came on the podcast. She told a story of, I think it was Bob, where everyone just knew he was terrible and it was like, everyone's was just like knew he was not good and eventually, the boss had a conversation with him eight months into it and told him, \"It's not going to work out. You're just doing a bad job.\" And he's like, \"Why didn't anyone tell me? I didn't realize that. If you told me, I would've changed.\" And everyone assumed he knew. And so I think to your point, this is to help the person. It's not not to hurt them.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:11:05):\nYeah, a hundred percent. One of my clients, he was running a division and one of his people was not doing it right, not doing it right, not getting the right kind of data, not having to do the right kind of analysis, whatever it was. We were talking about it and I said, \"Well, how come you have another feedback with her?\" And he said, \"You know, she's just going to cry. She's just going to cry. She's older, whatever, she's just going to cry. It's going to be too uncomfortable, whatever.\" So we worked, we talked and talked and talked. I gave him a script. We really worked it out and he agreed that he would go in and have that conversation with her, which he did.\n\n(00:11:40):\nAnd he reported back to me and he was shaken. She cried. Of course she did. She cried. That's what he knew she was going to do. And so she was upset and she went home early and the whole thing. The next day she came in and she said, \"Thank you so much for telling me that. I wish someone had told me that 15 years ago. I think I could have had a different career.\" And I think that is so meaningful for all leaders and people who are responsible for other people to understand that you're uncomfortable when they start crying, of course, or they have this difficult reaction or whatever. But honestly, the only way you're going to be able to help someone grow in their career and become the best person they can be is by leaning into these tough conversations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:23):\nWhat I love about the scripts we're going to talk about, which we probably should transition to, is it's again, one thing to hear that and be like, \"Yes, okay, I need to do this. I need to get better at typical conversations. I need to have that talk without someone that we should let go.\" It's another when it's like tomorrow is the meeting and you're like, \"Oh, my God. I have to have this conversation now.\" And so, I love that you actually give people a really simple approach to how to lay this stuff out in various different contexts. So let's talk through some of these approaches and scripts you've come up with. What do you think would be a good one to start with?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:12:55):\nWell, we can start with performance feedback and we can just sort of take a typical example. So first of all, once you've done your work to get your mindset right to kind of know what you're doing it, and then you just really want to really be able to wrap your mouth around the words. So what that looks like is practicing, and the script could be, \"You know, Matilda, I want to chat with you about the way you're interacting with your peers. So what I'm hearing from them is that you're missing deadlines on a regular basis and not letting them know you're missing the deadlines, and that also you're not fully keeping your team up to speed.\n\n(00:13:27):\nAnd so they're kind of confused running around. Now, we both know that the most important way you can be successful here and also achieve your goals is to make sure that you are working with your peers in a way that's consistent and that they can count on you and you can count on them. So I wanted to let you know about this. I want to certainly hear what you have to say, but the most important thing is that we leave this discussion knowing how you're going to make sure that you're keeping your peers in the loop and also your team in the loop.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:55):\nYeah, there's so many elements there that are really interesting. Just focusing on what I'm hearing versus just coming from you or something you've done wrong. It's, here's what I'm hearing from multiple sources. I think that helps people. Okay, it's not just you and just like, \"Oh, my manager hates me.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:13:56):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:14):\nIt's like, \"Okay, other people are saying this.\" And then I love this phrase of, we both know where it's not just me telling you this. It's like, \"You also know this. I know you're smart and you also know that this is, something is wrong here.\" And then this goal of, here's what we need to [inaudible 00:14:31]. You're like very clear call to action, almost action item, like leave this meeting with, \"Let's just be aligned on this thing.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:14:36):\nYeah, thanks for calling those out. I hope, and again, what I'm trying to convey in my tone is also, \"You know what? It's Tuesday. We got to have this conversation. I'm sure it's going to end well. I'm not mad.\" The whole point about my manager hates me, right? \"I'm not yelling at you.\" The more even keeled and even matter of fact you can be about something that's kind of just run-of-the-mill feedback, the better. And I think it's just also what I didn't say before, and I think it's also important is that, as you are recognizing that one of your jobs is to give this feedback, is that you have to build a relationship with people so they can hear you through the lens of, \"Oh, Alisa wants to help me.\" Not, \"Oh, Alisa hates me. It's always a problem.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):\nHow did you start that phrase again? Because the starting is always the hardest part for me. How do you kick off the conversation? What was the couple sentences used?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:15:28):\nI wanted to have a conversation with you about some things I've been hearing from your peers about the way that you all are interacting together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):\nAwesome. So there's an element of, don't make it feel like a huge deal. Just like, \"I want to have this conversation with you about something.\" And it's just like, \"Let's have this conversation and here's what we want to leave this conversation with.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:15:46):\nYes. And I can't stress enough that it's actually really helpful to also have spent some time with Matilda or whoever saying, \"Great job on the way that project landed.\" Or, \"Hey, launches, when they happen on time and they're smooth, sometimes we don't notice anything. I want you to notice, we didn't notice anything. That's fantastic. You did a good job in that launch,\" or whatever it is. Because then, you've had the conversation with them to give them positive feedback and point out what's working, that builds the relationship so that you have the lens of, \"Oh, yeah. When something's working, they tell me. When something's not working, they tell me, too.\" That's how you build trust as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:23):\nThey want to be criticizing them [inaudible 00:16:25]. We need to have another conversation what we're hearing about, problems [inaudible 00:16:28].\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:16:27):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:29):\nObviously, if you say it the same way every single time, they're going to feel like this is weird. Do you recommend it's this kind of Mad Libs approach or is it make it your own as much as you can? What are kind of the key? Or is it like, here's actually how you want to say it every time?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:16:42):\nIn my book and when I work with my clients, I give specific scripts and what I will regularly say when I'm working with my clients is, \"Okay, so this is how I would do it,\" and then I'll land it for them. But they have to make it their own. You always have to make it your own and I don't think it's a problem of doing it the same way every time. It's not like people are going to notice you because you're talking about different topics, theoretically. If you have a formula that can work for you, that's going to motivate you to do it, that is what's important. And what's important is that it's neutral, not loading on or not venting on someone and not unloading on someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):\nI love that we started with this one because it feels like the most common one of just your employee is underperforming and you want to make sure they understand and adjust. What if you're not hearing something from a bunch of people? What if it's just your perception of their writing? You need to work on your writing skills or you're coming in late. Is there another way you phrase it where it's not, \"I'm hearing it from other people?\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:17:43):\nOh, absolutely. Absolutely. So I'll talk about writing. I think it would be something like, okay, \"Matilda, part of your job is to be able to create these documents and I appreciate that you do them on time. What I've observed is that they can often be not as structured as I'd like them to be and they also lack a conclusion. So what I'd love you to do is look at these three or four examples of some folks who are doing them really well and see if you can model your writing on theirs. If you need to take additional classes or if you need help in any way, let me know. But ultimately, I want to get your writing to the level where everybody is appreciating what you bring to the table because the level of your writing really reflects the level of your thinking.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:27):\nMm-hmm. Wow, I like that. I'd want to follow your advice if I got that. So the way you started that is what I've observed, which also is not like, \"Here's what I think\" or \"Here's what you just need to do.\" It's more like, \"Here's what I've noticed, here's what I've seen, here's what I've observed about what you're doing.\" And then it reminds me of, what is it, nonviolent communication, that whole framework of just focus on what you see, not what is wrong with them, not what they've done. I guess, is there anything there you want to say of just the importance of focusing on what you've heard from people or what you've observed versus maybe what people often do instead?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:19:05):\nYeah, I mean you just really said it and I think it's such an important point, observable facts. The idea that this is not a judgment. This is not... Sort of as less judgy as possible is also very helpful. It makes it neutral. It's observable facts and it's also sort of based on expectations, right? So the writing is, we expect it to be at a certain level and it's not that way. And here are the reasons it's not, the specific reasons, it's not.\n\n(00:19:35):\nThe way you interact with your peers, it's important to be at a certain standard, and here's why. Because when we all work together, we're going to be able to execute and when we don't, unfortunately we won't be able to. So you staying in sync with them is important and the observation is that they don't feel fully in sync with you.\n\n(00:19:52):\nAnd so every time we talk about this, it doesn't become this, \"Oh, I don't know. I just feel...\" By the way, some things you have to give feedback on and they are kind of a feeling and those are more difficult, but so many things if you do the work to really think about what is the observable data, I always ask my clients, what's my evidence that this is happening? And you have to spend some time thinking about it, but it's really worth it because it makes the feedback easier for you to give and easier for them to hear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nIs there anything else along the lines of this specific type of feedback that is worth sharing before we move on to a different type of feedback?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:20:29):\nWell, I think just that the reason, one of the many reasons that people have gone uncomfortable giving feedback is that somebody might get defensive or they might start crying as we talked about. And so I have a script also, which is if someone gets defensive, which is it's like I'm giving you this feedback and you're getting defensive and I say, \"Well, let's pause for a second. First of all, I want you to know that I'm telling you this actually, just to make you better because I know how important your career is to you. I know how important the success is to you and it's important to me too as your leader. The second thing is, my observation is that you're getting a little bit emotional. I want to know if we can continue having this conversation now or if we need to kind of pause it. At the end of the day, we really have to have this conversation and I really want to see you make changes, but I understand you might need a few moments to digest it.\"\n\n(00:21:18):\nThe importance of that for you is not even what you say, but that you have prepared and you are prepared for if someone has that kind of reaction and that you don't have to, yourself, react to it. You know, \"No, I'm not doing that. No, no, no, no, whatever.\" And you can say, \"Yes, you are.\" Now we're in a fight and that is not cool for anybody. It's certainly not cool for you as a leader. So it gives you the opportunity to recognize that you have another tool in your toolkit rather than just react.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:48):\nSo if you find yourself feeling defensive or they are just not hearing and just fighting back, the tool is just pause. Let's just pause for a moment and it feels like there's kind of two parts to which you just shared. One is, remind them why this is important to them and why you're talking about this. And then two is, if there's just emotions kind of taking over, give them a chance to like, \"Let's just pause and maybe come back to this because maybe you're not in the right state right now to listen.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:22:18):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:20):\nSometimes people get upset when you mention like, \"You're getting emotional,\" or I don't know. Is that a thing that you deal with of just like, \"How dare you say I'm feeling emotional?\" I'm just...\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:22:29):\nI'm not emotional. Why do you think [inaudible 00:22:31] emotional? Right, exactly. Yes, of course. Now, when someone's crying, they're obviously getting emotional. When they're defensive, it's possible that you might want to use a different word. I can see that this is really upsetting you or this is really triggering you, or I can see that the temperature between us has just changed. You could say something like that. I do think also it's helpful to know your people because sometimes you could realize that actually they can deal with that, but then sometimes you have to really [inaudible 00:23:00] the delicate words that you need to use to pause the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):\nYeah. And I find, to your point, it's helpful to you too as the person giving it. And I feel like sometimes, you may be feeling like I should just pull back and maybe I'm wrong, maybe they're right, maybe I should stop and instead this gives you a chance to know I'm actually, I can't. I need to stay strong about what I believe because I... You put so much thought and effort into this already, it's unlikely you're just like, oh, totally wrong about what you're saying.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:23:30):\nYeah, exactly. There's something going on. There's something going on. And then also, the whole point about it being a conversation is that actually it's a conversation. Actually, Lenny, if you have a different point of view, I would like to hear it. Let's talk about it, but we can't keep going on like this, where I don't feel I can count on you for whatever it is that we're talking about. So we need to have this conversation and recreate a set of expectations between ourselves. Ultimately, that kind of conversation has the potential to really build the relationship and build trust, and that's another reason I encourage everybody to get over their discomfort and to lean into having these conversations because on the other side of that, is a much better, stronger connection.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nAnd especially if you do them well.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:24:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:12):\nFollowing this advice. So okay, so again, if somebody's feeling defensive, can you again say how you start that, if you notice that? And then I'll highlight the two elements again of the...\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:24:25):\nSo the way to pause is to actually say, \"Let's just pause for a second because I'm feeling the energy has changed and I can see that you're getting a little bit heated by what I'm saying and I want you to know that I have no intention of upsetting you. I just want to be able to talk to you about the things that are going to help you in your career.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:45):\nAwesome. And I love, again, just the reminder of here's why this is important to you, here's the benefit to you and why this will help you. And then it's like, \"Okay, let's just maybe take a pause and come back to this conversation if you're feeling like this isn't the best time.\" Awesome. Anything else along that line before we go to another type of a hard conversation?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:25:02):\nI mean, I can talk all day about this [inaudible 00:25:06], but I'm happy to move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:07):\nWell, let's pick another topic. I know you have kind of five buckets and types of conversation. Maybe the promotion one. That feels like I think we're in performance review season. It feels like these are happening a bunch. What do you suggest when someone's being told they're not going to get the promotion they expected or wanted?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:25:24):\nOf course that's challenging. So again, getting your mindset right, recognizing they're disappointed, they're going to be disappointed, recognizing how you felt, the time that when you didn't get a promotion or whatever. And so kind of coming to it with some compassion. And also, you have to get your reasoning right. So sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they were here for a year or whatever. Sometimes people think they should get a promotion because they're the only internal candidate who's qualified for this or they might have a sense of themselves succeeding or achieving that is more inflated maybe than you see them. So trying to think about where they're coming from.\n\n(00:25:56):\nAnd then the conversation is just, \"Matilda, I know this is going to be challenging for you to hear. I know you were hoping to get that promotion, but I want to let you know that we are going to actually be looking for an external candidate. I want to give you a few thoughts about why. First of all, in discussing this with my peers, I'm realizing that we need someone who has done this role multiple times in the past and has that experience. Number two, I think it's really important that they have an expertise in a specific realm that we've identified as really important. So for those reasons, we're going to bring someone in from the outside, not going to promote you, but I want you to know this. Number one, it's really important to me that you're able to succeed in your career here. And so I want to continue to help you find opportunities to build your skills and to advance. And then number two, when we bring this person in, I'm committed to finding someone who's a great people leader, who is going to help you build those skills.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:54):\nSo a few elements there that stood out to me. One is just being very upfront and not bearing the lead. Telling them very early, \"Here's what I've decided.\" As you said it, I could see my heart sinking immediately when I feel that. So at least that's over and then it's, here's why. And that starts to help you feel like, \"Okay, I get it. I understand at least how you thought about this.\" And then there's the hope for the future, your painting of, here's how I can get there eventually.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:21):\nYes, that hope for the future is so important and I think sometimes we're such in a rush to kind of deliver the bad news that we forget there's a human being over there who needs hope for the future. And hopefully. If they're a good employee, hopefully they have hope for the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:35):\nI love that. Is there anything else to that script that you think is really highlighting or do you think I touched on the key elements?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:41):\nI think you touched on the key elements.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:43):\nOkay. And again, the way you started is, I have some bad news for you or I have some disappointing news for you.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:48):\nYes, because it's just [inaudible 00:27:50].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:48):\nJust get right into it. Yeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:27:51):\nYeah, just get right into it. Yeah. By the way, the other piece on that might be, if it's appropriate, I'd love you to digest this information and then let's talk about it again next week to see what you've come up with or see how you feel about it because you want to send, this is not the script, this is for me to you. You want to send the, I care about you message because that's the other thing. In the workplace, people, they're going through all their feelings, all their emotions, disappointments. They're going to go home and tell their spouse, didn't get the promotion or whatever. It's going to loom large. It's going to be demoralizing.\n\n(00:28:24):\nWhen you, as a leader signal a lot, I care about you, I care about your feelings, I care that you're disappointed, I care about your career, you are always going to be able to help people stay resilient in the face of setbacks and ultimately, do extra work, do the right work for you and be engaged in your company because you've spent the time and energy making sure they know that even when things are not going their way, they have an ally in you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):\nWhat do you do if they just disagree, if they're just like, \"But I do have those skills and I don't think this is fair.\" Thoughts on responding to that sort of feedback? I guess, that's the defensiveness stuff.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:29:06):\nYeah, that's the defensiveness stuff. And again, I hope you've done your homework to identify that actually that person doesn't have those skills and if there is a [inaudible 00:29:16] for example, but I do have those skills or sometimes people, I think more, even more often, they don't respond to what you just said. They will instead explain to you that they've been here for a year or they're the only internal candidate or their peer got promoted.\n\n(00:29:31):\nRight, they'll sort of explain to you things which are not part of your decision-making process and then it's helpful for you to say something like, \"Yeah, listen, Matilda, I really understand that you were thinking that after a year, you'd get promoted around here. And in the past, I do think because of the stage of our company, probably people have been promoted at that period. That's not the place we're at right now. As we scale, we really need to think about not just what we need for today and tomorrow, but for the future. And that's why I want these specialized skills in here. I think it's going to help the entire company.\"\n\n(00:30:02):\nSo that's an example of a discussion that you could have. I do have the skills. That's kind of interesting. I'd love to hear what you see as those skills. And it's not a problem to have the conversation right there then, but if there's a \"Yes, I do, no, I don't, yes, I do, no, you don't,\" that pushback is never productive. And so, that's where you want to probably again take a pause and say, \"Listen, I totally hear you. You and I have a different point of view about this. I'm not sure if it's productive to continue to discussing right now. Let's talk about it again in a week. But I also want you to know this is a decision that I've made.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):\nI love though, when they come back to you and like, \"But here's X, Y, Z.\" And you're like, \"That's not what I was saying necessarily.\" I love that you basically mirror back. I hear what, I understand you believe, I understand you've been here for a year. I understand you're the only internal candidate,\" like making them feel very heard. That's a really powerful mechanic there. That is a good tool. Is there another script that you think might be helpful to talk through that is a common hard conversation people have?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:31:05):\nWell, the hardest conversation is firing someone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:09):\nLet's do it. Let's get into it.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:31:13):\n[inaudible 00:31:13]. I'm willing to get into it. I just want to say two things about that. First of all, when you're firing someone, the hope is that it's not a surprise to them. You've had multiple conversations with them that they're not living up to your expectations. It's essential because the truth is, you want to create a culture where people are not surprised by being fired. And that's not even true for this one person you're dealing with. That's true for the entire company. So just kind of getting in the mindset of recognizing that if you shied away from those conversations, kind of like, \"You're the problem here and you have some catch up to do.\"\n\n(00:31:43):\nThe second thing is that before you fire someone, I think it's helpful to have the conversation before the firing conversation because something you said Lenny is like, \"Oh, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm not sure.\" And that bleeds into, \"Maybe I haven't been clear with this person.\" Regularly with my clients, I'll say, \"Okay, have you been crystal clear about what you need from this person?\" And what they always do is the hand motion like well, sort of, but well, maybe. Which means no, which means no. You've not been crystal clear or you don't perceive even crystal clear. The way to make sure that you're crystal clear is by having the conversation before it comes to that.\n\n(00:32:23):\nWhat that looks like is, \"Listen, Matilda, we have to have a difficult conversation right now. I've talked to you multiple times about coordinating with your peers and not having them surprised about missed deadlines, and I've talked to you multiple times about keeping your team in the loop on different things. After six months of these conversations, I want you to know that the peers continue to feel like that you're operating on your own without coordinating with them. And I continue to hear from your team that they're not fully on the same page. I need you to know that this is very important. I need you to fix this within the next 30 days. Otherwise, I'm sorry to say, we're going to have to find a way to part ways because I can't keep this going with you. I know you have it in you to change. I value all you bring to the table, but if you don't fix these things, we're not going to have a future together.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):\nThat is very crystal clear.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:20):\nYes, crystal clear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:22):\nYeah. Okay.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:22):\nWhat do you think of that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:24):\nYeah, that was great. So it starts with being upfront. This is a difficult conversation, just to set expectations. They're like, \"Oh, shit.\" And then it seems like you come back to, again, multiple times this happened, observing here's what's happening. It's happened multiple times. I keep hearing from multiple people, [inaudible 00:33:44] be a problem. And so it's just like, \"I need you to know,\" and you're just very clear. \"Here's what will happen if this doesn't change.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:33:52):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:52):\nYeah. And I love that you also give them a little, there's always that hope for who they are and how you see them as. They're not worthless. It's just like, \"You are great at a lot of things. You have these skills. You're great at blah, blah, blah, but still this is a big problem.\" And it's communicating how critical this is. [inaudible 00:34:08].\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:08):\nYeah, and it's a deal breaker. It's a deal breaker. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):\nYeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:12):\nIf you have so many talents, but if you can't do these two things, then it's a deal breaker for all of us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:16):\nYeah.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:16):\nAnd I think it's important to really sort of see that both. Sometimes people think, \"Well, but I'm so talented.\" Yeah, but your talents are not going to make up for these two deal breakers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:25):\nYeah. And I feel like I know we were going to talk about the firing conversation, but I think this is even more important than that because hopefully, this addresses the problem and you don't need to fire them, which is more valuable.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:34:36):\nYes. Yeah, hopefully. But even if you do, it's actually easier because you've already had the conversation. Right? They're not surprised. It's clear. We've had the discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:46):\nYeah. So basically the script is like, \"There's going to be a difficult conversation. I've seen multiple times this thing and we've talked multiple times and it's still not fixed and here's what I just want to be very clear about.\" Is there also a script you have for just actually doing the firing or is that less scriptable?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:35:05):\nWell, the script for doing the firing is again, please everybody, talk to your HR professional. Talk to your lawyer. Okay, I'm not a lawyer, I'm afraid. So you have to make sure that you're all buttoned up on what you're going to do. But the conversation is actually very simple, which is just, \"Matilda, we talked about this multiple times. The last time we had this conversation, I told you I needed you to make these changes. You haven't made these changes and we're going to part ways. So I have here, Sarah from HR or whatever, and we're going to talk through the logistics of that. I'm happy to have a longer conversation with you, but I want you to know we've made the decision to terminate you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):\nFeels very reasonable to me. Is there anything else along these lines?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:35:46):\nI think what I want to say is that the conversations you need to have at work are not just difficult conversations. What I call them is sort of delicate conversations because what I think people also shy away from is just simple praise, specific praise. And I think it's really important to get in the habit of pointing out what your people are doing well as carefully as you need to prepare for pointing out what they need to improve. And sometimes leaders feel like, \"Yeah, it's all working. It's all working. I don't have to tell you.\" Or if I do tell you, it's kind of like \"Good job.\" Right? One time a leader or a manager I was doing in a training program, she said, \"I don't like getting positive feedback. I only like getting negative feedback.\" And I said, \"How come?\" And she said, \"Oh, positive feedback is just like, oh, good job. Negative feedback, you can learn something. You get something from it.\"\n\n(00:36:40):\nSo the positive feedback should have the same standard, which is, \"I saw the way you ran that launch, it was fantastic. All these different benefits came from it. You're so organized, keep doing that.\" Or \"The way you're keeping your peers in the loop, considering you've only been here three months is extraordinary. I've never seen someone so communicative. It's fantastic. Keep doing that. That's really working for you.\" If you do that often enough, you do get in the... First of all, it's positive, obviously. You become in the habit of getting better at positive feedback, which is extremely motivating to people at work. It helps them see their progress because that person I just mentioned, she's barely keeping her head above water and she's having trouble fitting in or whatever, but you come around and point out the things that are working. Again, it's very morale boosting. She knows where she stands, and then one day, if you have to give her these difficult messages, you've already sort of laid the reservoir of goodwill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:37):\nI love giving positive feedback. It's obviously so much easier, but to your point, it's like you have to really think about how to do it well. It's not just a, it's not that easy if you do it well, which is a really good point. And [inaudible 00:37:49] needs scripts for how to give really good positive feedback and have great conversations.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:37:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:53):\nThat's interesting. There's less demand for that. How do I have better great conversations or compliments?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:37:59):\nRight, right. True.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:59):\nNo man.

I want to go on a little bit of a tangent, something that it's kind of touches on all the things we've been talking about, which is, you're big on helping leaders understand that their job is not to make employees happy. What is your job instead? Why do people think this is their job to make their employees happy and what should they be thinking instead is their job as a leader?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:39:09):\n[inaudible 00:39:09], I work with a lot of founders and so, don't forget that the entry-level position for a founder is leader, and they have it, they often not had a lot of other experiences being a leader or a manager, and so they're just doing the best they can. It makes sense, right? And they kind of get all this information from other people and their HR leader wants to have a happy engaged workforce and they don't want to upset people for all the reasons we talked about, why you don't want to upset people. Nobody wants to upset people.\n\n(00:39:40):\nAnd so there's this idea of, they're trying to now be now be the leader who everyone loves and makes people happy. So they would often bend over backwards to make people happy, to keep people, their morale up. But what really needs to happen very often is, we need to drive towards results. And the way this system is working is not going to drive us towards results or this employee continuing to not really do a great job at their job and not really pushing themselves. And you don't want to push them because you don't want to upset them, you don't want to give them difficult feedback, so you're just going to keep hoping it works out.\n\n(00:40:23):\nUltimately, that leads to the demise of your company. I mean, ultimately right, as you're a startup? If you're not in a startup and you're a large company, it still is very subpar performance, obviously. And you're dancing around hoping and praying they're going to get there and they don't really know there's a problem. And so, I think it's very misguided for leaders to have this notion that their most important role is to keep people happy, is to create this high engagement workforce. High engagement workforce is great.\n\n(00:40:56):\nI think what that comes from is winning culture, which means we're set up for success. We've got the structure for success, we have the culture for success, everyone understands their role, they know the impact of their role. So doing the work to figure out and help them figure out the impact of their role and that when they work together and achieve these milestones, they win and then we celebrate the wins and then we do it all over again. And when you create that kind of a workforce, I think it's much more dynamic, even though sometimes in doing that, you have to redirect people and ruffle their feathers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:26):\nEssentially, the way I think about it is you think making people happy is not having hard conversations, not pushing them, when really, it's almost working backwards from, if we win and are killing it, people will be happy and what does it take to do that?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:41:40):\nA hundred percent. And then the right people are going to want to join your team, people who like to win and like to get results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):\nIs there a story, an example of a founder you worked with or that comes to mind of this kind of where they thought this was their approach and then they shifted? Or is there kind of a pattern you see often?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:41:57):\nOne company comes to mind. One leader I worked with. Sometimes I think to myself, if I'm writing a book, the book would start with, \"It all started with the avocado toast,\" because he wants to do right by his workforce. And so they have avocado toast at 10 AM, like tea time kind of a thing. And it became this great ritual where people would kind of hang out together and that was great. And then that turned into other longer periods of just hanging out together. Again, these are good things. And that turned into evening socials and everybody was enjoying spending time together, but they continued to be not fully clear on what they were actually supposed to do. And there began to be kind of a cliquey, gossipy culture of who's in and who's out. And that would take up a lot of the socialization time discussions. So rather than talk about expectations about the work and about results, and again, the results were not showing. So it wasn't a lot to celebrate.\n\n(00:43:05):\nThey started at a culture committee. So they had a culture committee to talk about how we can make people happier around here. And you can imagine there's now layers and layers of things where we're trying to focus on engagement and we're trying to focus on the employees having a great experience. And the leader I'm working with is completely sincere. It actually want to have a great workplace. But I think the misguidedness was that he hadn't done a great job setting expectations. He had not done a great job of quote unquote \"codifying their culture\" because culture is not just avocado toast and working together and having socials, culture is things like, we go the extra mile or culture is we make sure, or it could be, we measure twice and cut once. Those are kinds of things that are really about the way we get work done around here. And certainly, a focus on results is like, are we following the process to then get the revenue and to then build a profitable company or are we just kind of hanging out together?\n\n(00:44:07):\nSo he had to come to terms with his own discomfort of addressing this with employees and his own discomfort in being a corporate drone of, \"Oh, expectations and in the workplace and how we do things.\" And it turned out that's the whole thing with coaching and with working with people is that you kind of see what their underlying assumptions and beliefs are and there's a reason everyone does what they do. So there's a reason he's doing what he's doing. We had to come to terms with that and then he had to really courageously make some changes about the way he was operating. And ultimately, they had to part ways with one or two really toxic people who were creating this gossipy culture and making people feel not included and not focused on results. And then when they all got on the same page, they were able to gain a lot more traction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:56):\nI feel like a lot of leaders and founders can relate to this, of wanting to create a great culture and keep it nice and friendly and everyone's a family and then things don't quite work out often in those cases. And there's a shift to, \"Okay, we actually need to make a business that works.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:44:56):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nIt always reminds me, Sheryl Sandberg came to talk at Airbnb once and people are asking, \"What do you do with all this...? We're just constantly in chaos. Things are always reorging or changing, just never... I'm on different teams every six months. Our goals are shifting. What do you do with all this... Our culture's changing as we grow.\" And she's like, \"That is a sign of hyper growth and success. And the opposite is even worse when you are not growing and you don't want that. And so you should be happy this is the challenge you're running into.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:45:40):\nI love that. It's so true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:42):\nSo along these lines, you talk about how a lot of founders have to come to terms, and it's not just founders, it's just execs and leaders you work with, have to come to terms with, \"Here's what I thought leadership was going to be and how to be a great leader, and here's what it really is.\" Is there anything more there that you find is commonly what they're wrong about or what they miss and what they have to realize?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:46:01):\nYeah. And I think as we grow as leaders, we all have to realize our own blind spots and the difference between what we thought and what is actually going on. So I worked with a founder who she wanted to be was a visionary leader, which is fantastic. I would love that. And she was an incredibly visionary person, very inspirational. But what she didn't see is that what her company needed was somebody to structure and hold people accountable and help them create goals and achieve milestones and course correct when they got off course. And she'd be very frustrated when all those things happened. People got off course, people didn't have goals, people weren't structured to work together. But what she didn't realize was that was, in one way or the other, her job to make that happen.\n\n(00:46:49):\nNow, maybe she needed to have, and I would talk to her a lot about this, a partner, like a COO or somebody else who could be the person who would be sort of managing the internal while she got to be more visionary, inspirational, but ultimately, it was her job to make sure that that was in place. And she didn't sort of see that and she did not adjust her style. And so there's a lot of wheel spinning that happens from that. Even though, by the way, she was an incredibly inspirational person and incredibly inspirational leader and she meant so well. There was nothing malicious about it. It's just that she didn't see the situation for what it was and then adjust.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):\nIt reminds me, we had this coach on the podcast, Joe Hudson, and he had this phrase that I think a lot of people use, but it just stuck with me. What you resist, persists. So if you hate confrontation, you're going to have much more confrontation. If you hate structure... Actually, this reminds me, Joe Gebbia at Airbnb. He was very anti-process at the beginning of Airbnb. He's like, \"We're not going to have a process. I hate process. We're going to run... That's the big company stuff.\" And then it just chaos constantly. And then eventually it's like, \"Okay, we need to have some process to how we build things.\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:48:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:03):\nAnd so it's interesting. A lot of people have to realize the thing they think was bad is actually, I see why people do it this way.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:48:10):\nYeah, totally. Actually, I'd like to say something about that because so many... Founders are kind of mavericks and they come into a situation or they start at this company and they want to do things their own way and that's fantastic. Otherwise, they wouldn't be a founder. That's actually fantastic. And so many of the founders I've worked with want to reinvent leadership. Right? They want to have it with no process, they want to have no hierarchy, they want to have autonomy, whatever it is.\n\n(00:48:37):\nAnd my feeling is like, \"God bless. You should absolutely try to do that.\" But at the end of the day, what happens is, they kind of invent for themselves the understanding that they need to have process, hierarchy, roles and responsibilities, goals, OKRs, whatever it is. And I think it's helpful sometimes to go through that fire of thinking we can do it a different way. But ultimately, I think that the ways to structure a group of people and get them organized so that they can win, are kind of well trod. And I would say that it's helpful to get through that stage quickly so that you don't have to constantly reinvent the wheels of leadership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):\nSuch an important context. Obviously, one of the... The most successful founders come up with, have first principles thinking into how to do stuff, and oftentimes they find something no one has ever thought about. So it's always this balance of try a bunch of stuff, a lot of it won't [inaudible 00:49:34]. Some of it was, what will help you win. And I think that's a really good point. I want to get into a couple more tactical things that you often work on with founders. One is, running meetings. Meetings come up a lot on this podcast. People hate them, people love them. There's some are great, some are bad, most are bad. You have some cool advice on just how to make meetings more effective and how to especially end a meeting to help you move forward. Talk about what your advice is there and just generally any advice for better meetings.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:50:01):\nYeah. I'm one of the few people that loves meetings. Or I should say I don't love meetings. I love the potential for meetings. We have all this smart people in the room. We have the potential to talk about these great things and make decisions. And unfortunately, they don't go that way. So what happens often, I mean there's so many downfalls with meetings, but one thing that happens is, we keep meeting. Either we make decisions or we don't make decisions, but then we come back to meet again and we don't have any continuity from the last. So then we re-meet, we re-decide, and that is a big problem. So my three questions to end the meeting are, what did we decide here? Who needs to do what by when? And who else needs to know? And if you can capture those, articulate those as deliverables, I promise you, you're going to have better meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:51):\nOkay, so it's, what did we decide here? Who's going to do what by when? So basically, action items with dates. And then, who needs to know about what we decided here? Is that how you put it?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:51:01):\nYes. Who else needs to know? There's so many executive teams that I've worked with and at first, they go into their room, they have their meeting, they make their decisions and then they leave and they don't tell anyone. \"I made this promise for my team that you guys need to kind of go do.\" Or, \"We decided on a policy of some sort and we forgot to tell everybody.\" And again, no, absolutely no maliciousness, just that they forget or they're too busy and there's not part of the protocol and the process inside of the company that encourages and really insists that people share important information, so cascading that down.\n\n(00:51:37):\nBut even the first question, what did we decide here? If you really go around the room at the end of a meeting or six people in the meeting, let's say, and you say to everybody, \"What did we decide here?\" And they all write it down, you will get six different answers, even though we're in the same meeting. I love that it's so powerful, but also, so helpful to really raise that up, to surface that and then to figure out what to do about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:58):\nI love that you highlighted that. I was going to say exactly the same thing, that everyone in their head has the thought of, \"Here, oh yeah. Here's what we decided.\" And to your point, it's often not the same. So is the advice here, is this like a template or something you fill out at the end of a meeting or is it someone's job to make sure these three things happen or how do you operationalize these three questions?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:52:19):\nI like it that it's someone's job, the person that I sort of think of as the meetings are. And typically, that's somebody who enjoys follow-up, who enjoys putting lists together and putting things into boxes and whatnot, and there's usually someone like that on the team. And so then it's kind of exciting for them to be the follower upper. But one way or the other, so you could use a template. I think that actually baking it in as a ritual to the meeting, because the other thing about meetings is that we never have enough time. We go right to the end and we don't leave the five or 10 minutes at the end to make sure that we ask these three questions and make sure that we have an understanding of what the follow through is on these meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:57):\nWhat I'm imagining is, say it's the product managers. Put this doc on the screen in the meeting as the meeting's ending and just have it filled out basically, and just confirm, \"Does this look good to everyone?\"\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:53:09):\nLove that. That's a great way to do it. By the way, with... Well, I just would say what's interesting about that is that if we ask people what did we decide here, I think there's value in just asking that question in particular because somebody might say, \"We decided,\" I don't know, \"Something.\" And other people would say, \"No, we didn't. But that's actually a good idea. It sort of crystallizes what we did talk about in a more comprehensive way.\" I think there's value in raising the differences and I think there's value in stitching those together. So just putting it up on the board is good, especially if you're running short of time. I worry that somebody might not weigh in and say, \"Actually, I have a very different point of view of what we decided here.\" So maybe it's also about building the culture to break in and say, \"No, that's not what I see. Let's spend some time on that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:03):\nLet's actually spend more time on this because this is really, I think, really this specific detail I think could be really powerful if you do it right. So say you're the PM in the meeting, who do you ask? Do you say to the room, \"What did we decide here?\" Or do you look at the most senior person? Otherwise, it feels like it could just lead to a whole discussion the last couple of minutes, which I guess could be valuable, but who do you point this question to?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:54:24):\nYeah. So I picture this for let's say, a six-person executive team meeting, which means everyone go around quickly and say, \"What did we decide here?\" Now, if you're in a meeting with a large executive team, which I do work with sometimes or non-executive team, like a group of some sort, then you probably want to get a few people just to... I would just even say as a facilitator, two or three people, \"Okay, two or three people, what do we decide here?\" And if you can kind of get common, great. That's fantastic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:52):\nGot it. Okay. So if it's a small meeting, go around the room and everyone just shares, here's what we decided here. And they could just be like, \"Yep, he's got it or she's got it.\" Awesome. Okay. This is great. So the advice here is, next time you have a meeting, especially an exec meeting, just at the end of the meeting, you, the listener of this podcast, just ask, \"Okay, everyone. Let's just make sure we're on the same page. What did you decide here? Who needs to do what by when?\" And then everyone chimes in and you're writing this in this doc, and then what else? Who needs to know about what we decided here?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:55:22):\nYeah. Lenny, I love that because also, do you have to be the leader of the meeting to do that? No. You could just be the person in the meeting and just chime in and just start it yourself. And if you do that and everyone kind of picks it up, it can become a ritual just by virtue of your own agency. So I love that you just encouraged everyone to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:42):\nAnd this is how you become a leader, is you just start doing these things and people are like, \"Oh, Alisa is so helpful. She's just on top of it. Every time she's in a meeting, the meetings go better. We get things done.\" So I think just doing the thing that is useful to everyone is how you move up.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:55:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nAmazing. Okay. Another topic that I know you spend a lot of time on is something you call the founder prenup. And what I love about this is, a lot of the problems that a company trickle down from the founders having their challenges with each other. And I started a company in the past and I don't think people realize how significant this decision is in your life. It's basically, you are marrying someone in a business context and you're stuck with this person for a long time and you basically came up with a prenup, which is a set of questions of just things you need to talk about to make sure you're aligned before you start this company. Is there any context around this thing before we talk through actually the questions that you recommend people talk through?\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:56:41):\nWell, I just want to reiterate what you just said. Exactly right. And it turns out that according to Noam, Noam Wasserstein, 65% of startups fail because of conflict with founders or the founding team. So it's really essential to get this right, and I agree that people step into this relationship with a lot less care than they should. And bad things can happen because you haven't done the work of getting to know each other before you decide to co-found.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:12):\nYeah. It's so easy just to like, \"Yeah, I'll start a company. We have this cool idea. Let's just do it. It's going to be so awesome.\" And then you don't realize how much you're committing to and how often things don't work out because of that quick decision. And oftentimes, it's like friends and then it becomes even more challenging because I want to be friends, but we're in business together. So yeah. Let's talk about what you recommend folks talk through as much as we can on this podcast.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:57:36):\nSo I do have kind of an extensive questionnaire, so we just touch on a few things, but one thing I think first and foremost is, what are your values? And I think it's really essential to do some sort of values clarification exercise. You can find a ton of them online. You can find a list of values and just pull out your core values and just compare them with each other because when you are aligned, it's great. Or when you're adjacent, it's also great.\n\n(00:58:01):\nI might care a lot about excellence, Lenny, you might care a lot about learning. Fantastic. Those are great values that we can kind of, go together. I might care about excellence and you might care about work-life balance. Wow, let's talk about that because I think it's going to be really important as we go through our startup journey that we understand both of us, what does work-life balance mean and what does excellence mean? Because those two things can at times be at odds with each other, just as kind of an example.\n\n(00:58:30):\nSo talking through those core values in advance and updating them regularly, even as you go down the path together is so essential. Just so you know where the other person's coming from. Because the other problem is, someone acts in a certain way, you don't know them that well maybe, or maybe you've known them as an eighth grader. A lot of founders do know each other from their youth and they've matured into different kinds of people. And so you think they're acting strangely, but actually, they're acting in accordance with their values. And so getting a handle on that upfront can solve, I would just say, solve a lot of problems before they start.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):\nSo signs that your values don't align. It's basically you both can't be true is almost the way I think about it as we talk. It's hard to be the excellent, focus on excellence and also not work long hours, which it's possible, but it's hard. Those are challenging and worth the conversation.\n\nAlisa Cohn (00:59:26):\nYeah, worth the conversation because in fact, as you say that, I'm like, \"Well, I guess you can do that. Right. You can do that.\" And so therefore, that's where the conversation has to figure out how you're going to marry these two values, which might be at odds or might be aligned, but let's talk through what work-life balance means to you and let's talk through what excellence means to me, and let's see if we can have a meeting of the minds about it or at least I know where you stand.\n\n(00:59:50):\nOne of the founders I worked with, he would text or Slack his co-founder on weekends and the co-founder wouldn't respond. And that was extremely frustrating to the person, to the co-founder I was talking to. And it turned out, after they finally addressed it, it really was about wanting to have some downtime and some, quote unquote, \"Balance.\" Nothing wrong with that, but because they didn't talk about it, both sides made [inaudible 01:00:20] big assumption about it and then it caused this conflict that didn't have to happen if they'd had the conversation in advance.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:25):\nComes back to where we started of having these conversations is necessary and almost helps the other person because this small issue could become a huge issue over time, if you just start assuming and it keeps happening and it keeps scratching and scratching at you. And letting that person's [inaudible 01:00:45] is screwed up because you're, \"I can't do this with you anymore.\" Right? So it's just another reminder of how it's good for the other person for you to engage in a difficult conversation.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:00:54):\nYes, very true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:55):\nOkay, what else? So values. By the way, is there a values framework you most love that you can point people to or there just a bunch and don't worry too much about which one you go [inaudible 01:01:05]?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:01:04):\nI mean, the one I use is super simple, which is on the thing called the internet. There's a lot of lists of values and I think when you see a list of values, you can pull out the ones that are most meaningful to you, and that's a very simple and helpful and free tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:19):\nGot it. So you just Google list of values, there's a PDF, and just circle the ones that are most and pick whatever small number, don't... Half of [inaudible 01:01:27]-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:01:26):\nActually, well, just to give you the process, right? It's helpful to pick 20, for example. Great. And then you winnow them down to, let's say, 10. And then you do the difficult work of winnowing them down to three to five that you feel are core to you. And that's a good exercise for everyone to do actually, every year because things can change. It also forces you to make the difficult decisions about when it comes down to it, what are the things that really are important to me? The more you know your values, the more you can operate in the world with just more clarity for yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:58):\nAwesome. All right. So values. What else?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:02:01):\nYeah. So another one is, vision of the company. So when this company is successful, what does that look like? And what that might look like is, we're in control of our destiny and we are able to operate this business independently and we have a lot of freedom. What that might look like is a big venture outcome that we all read about. And if you are both assuming that you both think the same thing but aren't talking about it explicitly or talking about the trade-offs you need to make inherent in that, then what often happens if you have differences is they come home to roost while it's too late or when it's too late.\n\n(01:02:40):\nSo an example is the two co-founders I worked with, one of them would said to me wistfully, this is like five or six years into the company, and the company was going well, but it was challenging and they had all their growing pains and like you mentioned about Sheryl said all the chaos. And he said to me, \"Gosh, I don't see why we have to grow. I just wish we could actually have fewer employees. And I used to love it when I knew everybody's name and I would just much prefer an environment where we didn't have to grow.\" Well, unfortunately, they were already venture backed and also, the other co-founder had a very lofty ambition for a very big company. And since they hadn't talked about that, it was way too late to even have that conversation and it was a very painful reckoning for both of them to realize they were not on the same page.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):\nTotally, see the value of this one. I could totally see how people would have different goals. I imagine it also changes over time, so there's probably an element of, if something has shifted for you, you should probably also have that conversation. I don't want to build an IPO venture scale business, I just want to build something chill. So basically, a line on what is... How would you phrase that? What does winning look like to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:03:52):\nYeah, what does success look like?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:54):\nWhat does success look like to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:03:54):\nOr what's the vision for the company when it reaches its full potential?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):\nOkay. Great. What else?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:04:01):\nAnother one is, it's sort of a two part question. How do you handle conflict? So how do you handle conflict? But then, you might want to ask your spouse, someone close to you, \"How do I handle conflict?\" Because you might think, \"Oh, I handle conflict with such an enlightened person. I'm so neutral about it. I'm so great at bringing things up.\" But the person who's close to you might say, \"You seethe until you're ready to bring something up and it's really uncomfortable in the seething period.\" So it just gives you a little more self-awareness about how you actually handle conflict.\n\n(01:04:42):\nAnd that's really important because I might be the kind of person who wants to bring up conflict and talk about it immediately. The other person might be a person who totally wants to talk about the conflict but wants to let it settle first and wants to also go through their own thinking process about what's important to them and might actually feel like they've resolved it themselves without having to have a conversation with you. And if you're the person who's like, \"Let's talk about it, let's talk about it, let's talk about it.\" And they're like, \"I'm working through it myself.\" Now you have conflict over the conflict and it just turns into dynamic that's not necessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:22):\nAs you go through these questions, it's absurd to imagine people don't do this when they find a co-founder and work through stuff, and I know nobody does. The percentage of people that do this sort of work ahead of time, it's very low. And so I love that we're helping this percentage go up, but it also reminds me of just how crazy it is people don't have these conversations and how it explains why so many founder relationships don't work out. So these are awesome. What else? I know you have a whole list and we'll link to it, right? There's a PDF we can link to?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:22):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:53):\nWith the questions or-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:54):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):\n[inaudible 01:05:55] post. Awesome. Let's do a few more.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:05:57):\nAnother one is, how do we decide when we disagree? And that is a very good thing to explore because there's actually a lot of different ways to decide when you disagree and they're all good. And if you have it sort of upfront and it's just for an ongoing discussion, but if you have it up front like when we disagree, because that's definitely going to happen, let's assume that the person who cares the most can win that argument. That would be a great way to do it. It might be, the person who's got the best perspective and the most expertise can win that argument. It might be, we'll go back and forth when we really disagree. First you win and then I win, like that, back and forth.\n\n(01:06:41):\nThere's so many different ways to handle it and if you talk about it upfront, you'll be much more likely to be able to actually put that into practice when you do disagree because you will definitely disagree. There's no way around that. And that's not even a bad thing. You're smart people. You have this dynamic tension in the relationship. You bring different things to the table. You've got different perspectives. Disagreeing is normal. Working through it and having a practice and a process of working through it, will help it be a good conversation rather than this sort of sulky difficult conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):\nI love it. Maybe one more?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:07:14):\nYeah. So another one is, what kind of company culture do I think is important? People definitely don't talk about this before they found the company and they assume they're on the same page. So one founder might be, \"I want to have this great company where everyone loves it and we're all loving together and working hard together. And it feels like a...\" To use your word before, \"It feels like a family.\" By the way, that's great. That's fantastic. \"I want to have a get it done, results-focused culture where we're just executing the hell out of everything and that we're just focused on winning.\"\n\n(01:07:52):\nBy the way, those two can actually exist together. But if you're pushing in one direction without the other and your co-founder is pushing the other direction without yours, it really can feel like two different companies. And that's... When I go into a situation at one of my client sites, often I will hear from the employees, \"It feels like we have two different companies and two different cultures depending on whose team you're on.\" And that, of course, leads to lack of coherent working together and certainly even just lack of different standards and expectations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):\nAwesome. Okay. To kind of start to wrap our conversation, I want to take us to a recurring segment of this podcast that I call, Fail Corner. We've talked a lot about failure at this point and just all the ways people fail. I'm curious if, in your career or life, there's a story that might be helpful for folks to hear when things didn't go great and you've failed, and if you learn something from that experience. And the reason this is something I do is I feel like people listening to this podcast, everyone's like, \"Sounds so amazing, everything's always going great. They're killing it.\" When in reality, that's not actually how things go. So these end up being really helpful for people like, \"Oh, wow. Even Alisa had a really hard time sometime.\" Is there a story that you could share?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:09:04):\nAbsolutely. I mean, so many examples. I'm going to give two quick examples. One is, when I first started my coaching practice, I just kind of started and so I just did everything I could to get clients, to build a business, to build a practice, to build my brand, all the things. And I was working so hard and I think I'd had this conversation with somebody that didn't go very well. And I just thought, in my mind's eye, I thought, \"Well, what will become of me?\" That was my voice in my head for quite a long time, \"What will become of me?\" And I was living in Boston at the time. I got onto the floor, my hardwood floors in my Brookline condo, and I just balled in the fetal position. I just balled and balled and balled for an hour. It wasn't 10 minutes, it was an hour.\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd I was so frightened and just upset. Am I going to be able to make this work? And it was a while and I got into the couch and took a little stress nap. And then I got up from my stress nap and I just started making more calls and doing more things. And that was definitely a rock bottom moment for me. And I think what I learned is, you have to literally pick yourself up from the ground and pull yourself forward. And when you keep taking action, action, action, win or lose, win or lose, you'll get where you need to go. And that turned out to be true. But in those moments, I was not thinking that was going to turn out to be true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nWow. Amazing story. I imagine many people feel those moments and it's empowering to hear that it can all turn out really well, even when you're lying in the floor crying for an hour. An hour is a long time to cry on the floor.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:10:45):\nIt is a long time to cry. It really... I thought about it because most people just cry for 10 or 15 minutes. I was crying for an hour. I'm positive. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):\nGreat story. You said you had another story.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:10:56):\nYeah. I'll tell you a second story, which is more focused on actually my work life. So one thing that I do is I do coaching of course and I do off sites. And this was early, early days of my coaching career and I was doing this off site and it wasn't going well. And I was debriefing with my client during the breaks and at one point she said something like, \"I just think we should end this offsite. I just think we should just decide it's over and it's not working.\" And I felt horrible, obviously, humiliated, certainly, and just like that's a failure. That's like, \"Oh, fail.\" And I know that what I took away from it was that I can improve my skills in every aspect of running an offsite.\n\n(01:11:40):\nSo getting aligned with the client in advance, making sure that I had the right activities getting us to our goal, being very goal-oriented and focused, and making sure that I had kind of understood the rhythm of what it takes to bring people together. So I took some training on that. I worked my mentor on that, and I got so great at offsites after that experience. I'll tell you that was a real low because in the moment, in that moment, I'm not thinking, \"I'm going to get great at offsites.\" In that moment I'm thinking, \"Oh, my God. I'm going to get... What will become of me?\" But I turned it into, in my mind's eye, or I should say, I turned it into the ability to build my skills. And I just want to tell everybody, even at your lowest moments, anything that you're learning from that, can then be turned into fuel to build your skills to get great at the thing that you're not great at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):\nWhat I also love about this is there's this feeling of imposter syndrome, is specifically this fear that I do something wrong and it'll all crumble and everyone will see I suck and I never... I don't know anything and everyone will see it. And I love both these stories are like, it doesn't go well and doesn't crumble. You build from there. And no one's like, \"Oh, Alisa's terrible forever.\" No, it's like move on to the next thing. And then you use that as fuel to become really good at this thing that didn't go great.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:12:57):\nYeah, that's really well said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:00):\nAmazing. Alisa, we covered a lot of stuff. Is there anything that you were hoping to cover or you think might be useful for folks to hear before we move to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:13:10):\nThe only last thing I want to talk about, just sort of circling back to your role as a leader, I was one time working with the CEO who was handling the fact that this launch was not going well, as in the launch wasn't happening. [inaudible 01:13:25] foot off, foot off, foot off. And his point of view was, you need to have patience with it as it goes. And my point of view is, because I've talked to a lot of the people around, was that there was a massive process problem going on that he was not kind of touching into and really investigating because the product manager wasn't experienced, was kind of hiding it because he knew he didn't have the skills, was fighting with engineering, it just wasn't working.\n\n(01:13:53):\nAnd when the CEO was telling me, and we really had a long discussion about this where I kind of enlightened him about some of the issues that he needed to get involved and fix, he kept thinking, \"I need to have patience.\" So what I want to say to everybody is, sometimes you need to have patience and sometimes you need to look at the process. And I think you, as the leader, need to have the wisdom to know the difference, but also your finger on the pulse to recognize, is this an issue with patience or an issue with process?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):\nI guess, is there a sign that you're like, it's probably a process thing and you're just ignoring a glaring problem that everyone else sees?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:14:30):\nI think the sign is when, if you search your mind, you don't really know how this thing is going to come together. There's no plan in your mind. You haven't touched in with people or talked to people about what's going on. You kind of hear this uncomfortable silence about it. Those are symptoms that you just need to dive deeper and just be a little more in touch with what's going on and talk to some folks and look at some data. And by the way, it might not be a massive process problem. It might just be one little thing that needs to get unstuck but you, as the leader, need to recognize that and figure out a way to make that unstuck. And if there's, of course, a big problem that needs to somehow be just surfaced.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nSo if there's this hope this'll work out versus I see a path to this working out, it's probably a problem. Awesome.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:15:16):\nYeah, well said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:17):\nIs there anything else that you wanted to share or touch on that you think might be helpful?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:15:21):\nWe talked a little about the co-founders prenup, which I think people would think, \"Well, I'm not a co-founder, I don't need that.\" I just want to invite everyone to also think about a different tool that I have, which is called the Personal Operating Manual. And it helps prompt you to talk about working style together because you may not be co-founders, of course, but you're working on a team with a bunch of people and they all have their different working style.\n\n(01:15:42):\nSo it's kinds of questions like, what communication style do you like the best? How do you like to work? Do you like large uninterrupted blocks? Do you like meetings here and there? When I'm trying to get a hold of you for something important, what's the best way to do that? What is one of your pet peeves or some of your pet peeves? How can I get a gold star with you? Also, this is my favorite. What's your delegation style?\n\n(01:16:10):\nDo you want me to check in with you regularly, like once a week as I'm working down the path of a project? Or do you want me to just let you know when it's done and just tell you at the end that it's been complete? So lots of different ways people assume other people work because it's like your style, but actually it's just your style. So those kinds of conversations can be great for working together and also be a great team activity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):\nSo this kind of what goes into these READMEs people put together, here's how to-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:16:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):\n... work with me. I really love the gold star concept because I feel like people want to know how do I be super awesome? How do I be really successful working for you? And I like that visual of the gold star and the pet peeves. I feel like a lot of people will identify that. What are my pet peeves so that people don't do these things because they don't know, right? They don't know until you tell them.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:16:55):\nNobody knows what's your operating style until you tell them. And the more you can showcase, the more everybody will be able to do it right for you and you'll be able to do it right for them. And then you'll be able to have better workplace harmony and save your conflict with things that are really important. Not just because like, \"Oh, you didn't text me when I wanted you to text me.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:13):\nBeing clear. What do you know? Is there anything else that you think might be helpful to share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:20):\nNo, just that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:21):\nWell, with that, Alisa, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:24):\nI can't wait. I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:26):\nHere we go. First question, are there two or three books that you find yourself most recommending to other people?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:17:33):\nSo we already talked about Kim Scott, the wonderful, amazing Kim Scott and her book, Radical Candor, is one I recommend a lot to people. It's fantastic. Working Backwards by gosh, Colin Bryar and Bill something, is about sort of the Amazon way of working backwards from the customer. Super geeky and tactical. I love it. I slurp it up like Harry Potter. It's so good. And I definitely recommend to my clients about Amazon's Management Science. And the third is Walt Disney by Neil Gabler because it really shows how Walt Disney, sort of it's everything about his youth and how he turned into a very bad entrepreneur and ultimately into a fantastic inventive entrepreneur. And it shows all the origins of how he invented these different pieces that now make up the Walt Disney Company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:26):\nThe first two recommendations we've had on the podcast, Kim Scott and Bill Carr, is the other-\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:29):\nBill Carr.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:30):\n... co-author. He's been on the podcast and people love that episode. I haven't had Walt Disney on. I got to work on that.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:37):\nOr the writer, Neil Gabler\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):\nOr the writer. Yeah, yeah. Good tip. Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoy?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:44):\nYeah, I enjoyed Inside Out 2. I thought it was fantastic, the idea [inaudible 01:18:49].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:48):\nI could see why you love it. I feel like it's for all coaches in the world.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:18:51):\nTotally. Just the idea that like, oh yeah, we're all this complex stew of emotions and it's okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:56):\nMm-hmm. I also love that movie. Next question. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:03):\nYes, the Ninja Creami. So good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:07):\nSay more.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:09):\nThe Ninja Creami turns anything into ice cream. So you can actually make ice cream. Good, God bless. But I take my protein shake, which is okay, and turn it into ice cream, which is delicious. And it takes 10 minutes and very little prep, and it's simple to use and it works as expected, which so many things do not. The Ninja Creami, go get it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:28):\nThat's the first for the Ninja Creami. And I love, the holidays are coming around, so this is going to be good for people. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to you find useful in work or in life?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:19:41):\nThis quote by Joseph Campbell animates my life, which is, \"If you can see your path all the way through to the end, you are following someone else's path. Your path only becomes clear moment by moment as each foot hits the ground.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):\nWow, that's so good. It's so empowering because it helps you realize if you don't see where it's all going, that's normal and that's good. Wow. Great one, good one. I need to do something with all these mottos. They're so good. I need to create a poster or something.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:14):\nThat's a great idea. Or your newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:16):\nHere we go.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:16):\nSend them out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:18):\nYeah, that's the easy path. Okay. Last question. So I'm curious, and not to create more competition for you, but I feel like a lot of people think about becoming a coach of some kind, like a product coach, exec coach. If someone is thinking about going down that path, is there one piece of advice you could share to help them pursue this path, even explore if it's right for them?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:20:38):\nIf you think you want to become a coach and you immediately want to build up your coaching skills, listen to people more deeply and ask deeper questions, not just respond to what they just said, but why do you think that? Or where is that coming from? And you will see if you enjoy that process of really going deeper with people. I think that would be helpful for everyone to do. But certainly if you want to become a coach, I think that's essential to be able to get really beneath the surface.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nI love how your energy just changed into coaching mode when you said that. I love that. That was such an interesting thing to see and that was great advice. That's easier said than done. And it's interesting, you could tell people are so good at that specific skill versus not. And so I love that that's the thing to work on, is ask better questions, think deeper about the person and what they're coming from. Alisa, this was incredible. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, maybe work with you, what kind of people do you work with in case people are interested in that, and finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:21:47):\nOh, thank you. Well, I work with executives at startups and also at large public companies, so feel free to reach out if you want to have a conversation about coaching. And you can find me at alisacohn.com. And actually, I'm going to take some resources and put them at a special link, which is alisacohn.com/lenny. If you want to download the Co-Founder Prenup. I also have a Personal Operating Manual and a few other resources I will put there. So alisacohn.com/lenny and you can also join my newsletter from there.\n\n(01:22:20):\nAnd I think in terms of helping me, I guess there's two things I want to say. My life's work genuinely is to make a difference. When I became a coach, it was because the music in my head was to make a difference. And so I hope I've made a difference for all of you today and I would invite you to try one thing that makes you uncomfortable, this week. As soon as you hear this, this week, try something that makes you uncomfortable and feel free to let me know on LinkedIn or even send me an email and let me know what you did that made you uncomfortable.\n\n(01:22:51):\nSo that would be very meaningful to me. And the second thing that would be very meaningful to me is if you would go find my podcast called, From Start-Up to Grown-Up and give it a listen. Maybe give it a rating and review because as you know, Lenny, the way people find your podcast is when other people are interested in your podcast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:09):\nFrom Start-Up to Grown-Up. I love that title.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:23:11):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:12):\nAlisa, thank you so much for being here. This was awesome.\n\nAlisa Cohn (01:23:15):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny. It was great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:17):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening. If you found this valuable, you can subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app. Also, please consider giving us a rating or leaving a review as that really helps other listeners find the podcast.
