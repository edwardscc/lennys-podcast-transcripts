The problem is the message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024, we still have too many teams doing work around the work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:11):\nEven if you are told to build the thing that the execs are really excited about, you're still going to get fired eventually.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:00:15):\nIf you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team? Frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nWhich is something you call the low impact PM Death Spiral.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:00:26):\nIs the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in, one way or another.\n\n(00:00:33):\nIt starts with adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements until the next round of layoffs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nYou have three steps to become more of an impact first product team.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:00:42):\nSo the first is in setting team goals, no more than one step away from company goals. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:50):\nYou're an ICPM. It's up to you. No excuses.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:00:52):\nYou can follow all the best practices, but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0. 6 or a 0.7.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:02):\nToday my guest is Matt Lameé. Matt is a longtime product leader, author of one of the most popular and practical books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.\n\n(00:01:12):\nOver the course of his consulting practice, he's worked with hundreds of product teams, helping them improve how they operate and drive more impact, more consistently.\n\n(00:01:20):\nFrom that experience, he wrote and recently published a new book called Impact First Product Teams, that I could not agree more with.\n\n(00:01:26):\nIn our conversation, Matt shares why it is so essential to align all of your work with business critical outcomes, especially if you fear layoffs at your company.\n\n(00:01:35):\nWe talk about the low impact death spiral that many product teams fall into. What steps an individual product team can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organization approaches product development. Tips for how to push back on stupid ideas that execs ask you to build, and so much more.\n\n(00:01:52):\nThe message in this episode is one that I believe every product manager needs to hear, especially if you don't work at a high-flying Silicon Valley tech company.\n\n(00:02:00):\nA huge thank you to Martin Erickson, Adrian Joselow, and Dan Corbin for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.\n\n(00:02:07):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

I'm really, really excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):\nI'm even more excited. You have a really interesting background. I usually don't spend time on background, but I thought this would be fun.\n\n(00:04:38):\nI was looking at your LinkedIn and your background. The beginning of your career you spent 13 years at Pitchfork reviewing music.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:04:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):\nReviewing artists. Pitchfork was a massive deal. I don't know where it is today, but it was the most influential music review site. Is it still a big deal or is it less so?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:04:55):\nIt is still a big deal. It was much less of a big deal when I started working for them and I was a 16-year-old music nerd, writing record reviews in my bedroom at my parents' apartment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\nOkay, so what I'm hearing is you helped make them a big deal. Excellent. That's impacts. We're going to talk all about impact.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:05:11):\nIf I were better at telling my own story, that's exactly what I'd be saying, is that before I started, I was product manager number one at Pitchfork.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:17):\nFunny enough, you look at your resume, you went into product management from Pitchfork. Very typical career path.\n\n(00:05:23):\nBy the way, if you're on YouTube watching, there's a lot of musical paraphernalia behind you, an awesome guitar, so clearly there's a thread of music throughout your background.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:05:31):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:31):\nLet me ask you this question: what is most similar about making music, and even critiquing music, and building great product?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:05:39):\nThe magic lies in the way people work together. That's really what I think has been the consistent thread between all the work that I've done.\n\n(00:05:47):\nI spent years as a touring musician. I still occasionally tour in my friend Will Chef's band. And it's that magic of people with different perspectives, different ideas, building into something that is somehow greater than the sum of its individual parts and perspectives.\n\n(00:06:03):\nThat's what makes this interesting. That's what makes music magical. That's what makes product development interesting, especially in the age of AI.\n\n(00:06:13):\nWhen people have the opportunity to, I think, close themselves off from the messier parts of human interaction, from those moments where you realize that your perspective might be limited, that somebody else might be able to expose you to something, show you a way of working, show you a way of seeing that you haven't seen before, I think that those interactions, that ability to learn from and build with each other, is only going to become more valuable and more precious, frankly, as technology continues to do what technology does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:44):\nWow, what a beautiful answer.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:06:45):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:47):\nI love that. So let's get to the task at hand.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:06:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:51):\nSo you're known for writing one of the most popular books in the field of product management called Product Management in Practice.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:06:58):\nI suppose I am.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:59):\nYes. Basically describes the job of a product manager very practically, very specifically, better than any other book out there.\n\n(00:07:09):\nYou have a new book out called Impact First Product Teams. I asked you what the goal of this book was and you said the goal was what are the steps that individual product teams can take to align their work to business critical outcomes, regardless of how their organizations approach product development?\n\n(00:07:25):\nAnd I thought this was a really nice way of framing this conversation. There's two important parts to the sentence that you gave me.\n\n(00:07:32):\nOne is aligning your work to business critical outcomes, and the other is steps an individual product team can take, regardless of other business functions.\n\n(00:07:40):\nSo let me start with this first part. This is kind of you named your book after this concept of impact, first: Why is aligning work to impact and to business critical outcomes so important?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:07:51):\nIt's important because at the end of the day, it is those business critical outcomes against which you and your team will be evaluated. That's the reality of working for a business, right?\n\n(00:08:02):\nIf you are contributing to the business in a way that the business at large can understand, that the CEO can understand, that the CFO can understand, if your team is a good investment for the business, then the business will continue making that investment.\n\n(00:08:16):\nIf your team is not a good investment for the business or you don't really know if your team is a good investment for the business, but you figure you're showing up, so probably it's fine, you guess, then that puts you in a really tenuous position, and a position that I think we've all seen not work out terribly well for everybody in recent history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):\nAnd so, what is this a reaction to? Because I imagine many people hearing this are, like, \"Of course, PMs, product teams we're driving business impact, well, that's why we're here.\"\n\n(00:08:44):\nThat's not actually the case in most cases. So first of all, just what is this reaction to? Is this the reaction to people being, like, \"Oh, we're just going to build great products, we're going to listen to customers,\"? Talk about the flip side of this.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:08:55):\nI mean, there's a couple of things. I think the main one is just more product managers and teams are getting laid off. That's a really scary reality right now.\n\n(00:09:05):\nAnd if you look at the messages that are being conveyed by CEOs when they lay off these teams, some of them are pretty clear.\n\n(00:09:13):\nThe message that Daniel Ek from Spotify sent out with their layoffs in 2024 said, \"We still have too many teams doing work around the work and supporting work, rather than focusing on opportunities with real impact.\"\n\n(00:09:25):\nAnd that really struck a nerve because I've been on those supporting teams before. I've done the work around the work. And I've assumed that if I was given work around the work to do, that surely it must be critical to the business, otherwise they wouldn't have hired me to do it.\n\n(00:09:40):\nI don't think that is a safe assumption to make. I think especially given that we are no longer in a zero interest rate environment, given that hiring and retaining employees is expensive, given that companies are looking at cost savings, I think we are in a moment where it is really incumbent upon each product team and each member of each product team to be able to understand, articulate, and work towards the top line business impact of their own work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):\nAwesome. So where this comes from is, one, if you are not driving something that is directly driving business growth, you're not as valuable to the company. You're the kind of person that they'd lay off.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:10:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:23):\nThere's also a flip side of finding a job. It feels like if you have shown impact in your resume, \"Here's all the impact I've driven,\" this also helps you get hired. True?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:10:31):\nAbsolutely. Yeah. I mean, it's the most common resume advice I see, is show the number, show the impact, say what you did.\n\n(00:10:40):\nI have a friend who does resume coaching, and I showed her my resume a couple of years ago. And she said, \"I love your resume except for one thing. Why do you write like a little girl? Say what you did, say what your contributions were. Don't say 'I helped. I may have maybe helped people do this'. Say the impact. Put the number on it.\" And I think I needed to hear that from her because I think there is a tendency, especially for those of us who do really thrive in that collaborative environment, who our nature is to not want to take credit for work that could only exist via the contributions of many people with diverse experiences and perspectives.\n\n(00:11:22):\nIt's really hard to say, \"Well, I did this and I contributed to that,\" but that's part of why I wrote this book at the team level, because I think for folks, like myself, who really enjoy and thrive in that team environment, if you can look at the product team as the foundational unit of impact and say, \"We delivered this. We were able to work together to have this impact for the business,\" that feels really good and also speaks directly to the work that that team did together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:49):\nThat's a really interesting insight. I think a lot of this comes from just PMs naturally are trained to deflect credit and to include, say 'we' in everything and just this person did that. So I get where that comes from. So most listeners will probably still be thinking, \"Yes, I'm driving impact, I'm great. I don't have a problem here. I don't to change, need to change anything.\" What are some ways to stress test your thinking? Maybe some questions to ask yourself or maybe your team of just, like, \"Okay, maybe I'm not?\"\n\nMatt LeMay (00:12:17):\nSo the first question I ask most of the teams I work with is if you were the CEO of this company, would you fully fund your own team?\n\n(00:12:29):\nAnd that is a small question that can provoke some big reactions. Because, for me, when I was working as a product manager, I truly believed that my job was to find the next most defensible thing to build, build it, celebrate it, find the next most defensible thing to build, and so on and so forth. Rinse and repeat forever and ever.\n\n(00:12:53):\nI kind of assumed that the existence of my team was this righteous fact of the universe, right? My team would always be there for all time, and it was just a matter of us finding the next thing to work on, which meant doing discovery and making concessions to what leadership wanted and doing all that stakeholder management.\n\n(00:13:13):\nBut the idea that my team came at a cost to the business, that at some point somebody might look at my team on a spreadsheet and say, \"Who are these very expensive people? Why do we need them? Do we actually need them?\" It just wasn't something that crossed my mind because I wasn't in the room for those conversations. That wasn't how I was thinking about my team's work.\n\n(00:13:34):\nSo I like asking this question because it's a perspective shift. It gets you thinking if you were personally accountable for the existential market-level success of this business, would you invest in your team?\n\n(00:13:52):\nAnd frankly, most of the people I ask that question to don't know the answer right away. They're not sure. They say, \"I think so,\" or, \"Yeah, yeah. Yeah, because... \" And then you can see the gears turning.\n\n(00:14:05):\nAnd again, to me that is a risky situation to be in because if you can't answer that question as a member of the team, nobody else in the organization is going to be as well-equipped to answer that question as you are.\n\n(00:14:19):\nSo bringing that question to the team, asking it and answering it proactively and collaboratively and being ready to say, \"Okay, if we can't answer this confidently, what are the changes we need to make? Do we need to change our purview? Do we need to change our goals? Who do we need to talk to? What do we need to do in order to make this happen, in order to answer that question confidently?\" We are much better off having that conversation at the team level than waiting for someone else to have it for us, or at us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):\nSo is kind of the signal here is if you can't confidently say yes, asking yourself this question or your team talking through this and having a clear answer, there's maybe a potential problem that you need to work on?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:15:01):\nAbsolutely. I think that's exactly it, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:04):\nAnd we'll talk about what to actually do and the steps you recommend to fix this problem, but I want to keep talking about impact because sometimes it takes a while for people to be convinced, \"Okay, I need to really do this,\" versus, \"Okay, here's the ways to do this.\"\n\nMatt LeMay (00:15:15):\nYeah. It has taken me until now, until writing this book to be convinced, and I still feel like I need to be convinced a little bit sometimes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:22):\nI think the layoffs are a really good convincing function for people.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:15:26):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:26):\nWhere they're seeing all these PMs being laid off and just, like, \"How do I avoid that?\" And this is basically the answer to that, is here's how you avoid getting laid off.\n\n(00:15:33):\nThere's an interesting implication in what you describe here where you encourage the PM and the product team to think like the CEO.\n\n(00:15:39):\nThis touches on something I've been meaning to write about, but I haven't, which is a lot of people, there's this argument are PMs the mini CEO?\n\n(00:15:46):\nIn my mind, the PM is 100% the mini CEO, in terms of they think like the CE or they should within the team. They're the same; their job is to think about the business like a CEO within the team.\n\n(00:16:03):\nObviously they're not in charge of everyone. They can't let get anyone go. The reporting lines are not the same. But I feel like that's a really good lens for the job of a PM, is just you're like the mini CEO on a team, making sure you're building the right things, thinking about the business, solving real problems that matter.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:16:19):\nI think the way I've come to think about it is that the product manager is responsible for the whole team thinking like a CEO, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:26):\nI love that.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:16:27):\nSo if the product manager takes that on as their sole responsibility and says, \"I'm the mini CEO. I think about the business,\" that's a missed opportunity.\n\n(00:16:35):\nIn my consulting work, it's more often than not been an engineer who's actually able to get to that specific impact-level goal for the team, sometimes before the product manager does, because the engineer is thinking in systems, is thinking about, \"Okay, I know this system, I know this other system. I've had this conversation with this person. I think I see how this can all fit together.\"\n\n(00:16:55):\nSometimes it's a designer or a UX researcher who understands what customers need and who has that direct firsthand knowledge.\n\n(00:17:02):\nSo I think the way that I certainly initially misinterpreted the mini CEO thing was you are solely in charge of this, as opposed to you are the person who brings that kind of CEO-level commercial thinking to the team. And I've been much more inclined of late to see the product manager's job as to bring in and facilitate that conversation, rather than to be the sole owner of that conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):\nThat is a really good Nuance to what I said, and it makes all the sense in the world.\n\n(00:17:34):\nFollowing these lines of what is the job for product manager, you have a really nice way of just thinking about it. What does a business expect from a product manager?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:17:42):\nYeah. My favorite definition of product management comes from Melissa Perry's book Escaping the Build Trap, where she describes product management as facilitating a value exchange.You're facilitating a value exchange between a business and its customers.\n\n(00:17:57):\nThe actual shape and nature of that value exchange depends on so many things. It depends on your funding model, it depends on your business model, it depends on whether you're B2B or B2C, it depends on whether you're publicly traded or privately held. There are so many different variables that go into what a business expects from product teams.\n\n(00:18:19):\nAnd one thing I've come to is that I'm probably too hesitant to generalize in general, aside from that generalization I just made, but I think that the best product managers and teams I've worked with are really curious to understand what success means to their particular business.\n\n(00:18:38):\nSo if that's a startup, how much runway do we have? What do we need to raise that next round? Are our investors looking for growth? Are they looking for profitability? What are they looking for in order for us to reach that next existential milestone?\n\n(00:18:52):\nIf we're a publicly traded company, what are investors looking for? What have we told shareholders? What's in our next prospectus? What are we saying we're going to deliver to the market at large?\n\n(00:19:01):\nThis information usually exists somewhere, but it's really easy to get disconnected from it as we go about the day-to-day work of doing product management.\n\n(00:19:11):\nI've been in a lot of rooms having workshops and sessions with teams I work with, where they're pulling up the last town hall meeting to look for slides from their CEO because they're so busy, they have so many day-to-day things to deal with, that for them that town hall day is, like, \"Okay, finally I can just not have to deal with people emailing me every 10 seconds.\" It's a chance to take a deep breath and then get back to the stuff that really matters.\n\n(00:19:38):\nBut those top-level things, those promises that have been made to the market at large, to the board, to the shareholders, those are often a great place to start for understanding what exactly your business is looking for, so you can figure out how your team's work helps contribute to success in the terms that matter most to the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:01):\nThat's an amazing segue to exactly where I'd wanted to go, which is this quote that is exactly what you just said, the question you should be asking, it's kind of a different version of the one you shared earlier, which is what are we doing to contribute to the success of the business?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:20:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):\nSo what is it that you think people are thinking instead most often?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:20:21):\nIt's interesting. We live in a world where for the last 20 years of product development, we've been all about best practices. We love best practices.\n\n(00:20:30):\nAnd I love best practices too. I think best practices can be really valuable, can be really useful. I love how much knowledge sharing there is out there. When I started 15 years ago, it was so much harder to get any sense of how anybody was doing anything.\n\n(00:20:44):\nBut I think the downside of this is that there are a lot of folks who are really, really fixated on doing things the right way. And a lot of the writing and thinking about doing things the right way exists in kind of this middle layer, between impact and day-to-day work.\n\n(00:21:03):\nSo if you have impact, the overall success of the business, revenue, growth, profits. Then from there you set objectives and you do initiatives, and then you do bets, and then you make a strategy, and then you do your day-to-day work.\n\n(00:21:15):\nI think the tendency among a lot of product teams is to key to those middle pieces, to say, \"Okay, what we're doing is on strategy. What we're doing is part of objectives. We did OKRs, right? We spent three weeks coming up with our OKRs for three months. It's OKR season, everybody. We have to pretend to care about our goals, and I read a book that says we have to have five to seven objectives with five to seven key results, and we want the score of each one to be a 0.6 or a 0.7.\"\n\n(00:21:41):\nAnd at the end of the day, you've actually spent so much time and energy being really clever and cascading these things into these intermediate steps, that each step has incurred more and more risk that we might not achieve that impact we seek to drive.\n\n(00:21:59):\nEach time we abstract things out, each time we cascade things from impact to something else until we wind up with a checklist of features to build, we're assuming that if we then build that checklist of features... We will have a successful business.\n\n(00:22:14):\nBut honestly, most of the companies and teams I work with, if I ask them how their lowest-level goals add up to their highest-level goals, they look at me like I just asked them the most impossible question in the world.\n\n(00:22:27):\nBecause by the time you get things down to that level, maybe it's going to work, maybe it's not going to work. There are assumptions baked into each of those levels.\n\n(00:22:37):\nYou might go through the motions of doing OKRs the right way or doing strategy the right way, but that doesn't guarantee that your strategy is going to work. It doesn't mean that your OKRs are going to add up to what your investors or your shareholders need to see.\n\n(00:22:52):\nSo I think there's a tendency among product teams to really sweat the middle, and to get really stressed out if the middle is not in perfect theoretical harmony with itself. If the objectives are a little out of line with the initiatives, are a little out of line with the bets, are a little out of line with the domains.\n\n(00:23:14):\nBut at the end of the day, I don't think I've ever worked for a company where these things add up to a perfect breadcrumb trail you can trace back from, \"We prioritized these bits of work in this sprint because it adds up to this objective, which is part of this strategy, which adds up to this initiative, which is part of this bet, which will deliver this much impact.\" It's just not how things work in the real world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:37):\nI feel like a lot of listeners are, like, \"That sounds very familiar,\" exactly what you just described. Again, we're going to talk about what to change and how to make work better to actually align your teams with impact. But I want to first talk about something that follows this thread you're on, which is something you call the Low Impact PM Death Spiral. Talk about what that looks like.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:23:55):\nThe Death Spiral.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:56):\nI love the hands.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:23:59):\nThe Low Impact Death Spiral is the dynamic in which every-\n\nMatt LeMay (00:24:00):\n... impact death spiral is the dynamic in which every medium to large company I've ever worked with finds itself in one way or another. And honestly, a lot of small product companies do as well, and it goes something like this. It starts with teams taking on low impact work. Adding little features here and there, making little cosmetic improvements because it's easier, it invites less scrutiny and you're less likely to mess up something important, right? The analogy I use sometimes is if you're working on a car, if you put your hands in the engine, you might make the car run really well or you might make it so that the car doesn't run at all. If you have the option of doing that or decking out the car with a paint job and rhinestones and making it look really, really cool, what are you going to choose to do? I know for me, I would choose the rhinestones every time because then the car runs however it runs. Whoever else is the expert in engines can fix the engine, but I'm going to do this thing which everyone can see. All the executives can look at it and say, \"Wow, look at how cool this car looks,\" and it's not going to do any harm, right? What's the worst that could happen? We can always take the paint off.\n\n(00:25:15):\nThe problem is if you have 10 teams adding rhinestones to a car, eventually the hood of the car is going to be so heavy that you can't lift it to get to the engine anymore, and that's exactly what happens in most product organizations. As you have more and more teams adding in these little features, making little enhancements, adding features, which might get some usage, but they're not going to take away anything meaningful, they're not going to mess with the commercial engine of the business. You have more folks building in and the hood of the car gets heavier and heavier, the product gets more and more complicated.\n\n(00:25:50):\nYou have all these little bits that have little dependencies on each other and the product becomes as, I think most modern products are a collection of loosely connected features rather than a single guided experience. What does that mean? That means internally, building anything becomes a lot harder, right? Because there's 10 product teams that have to manage dependencies whenever you want to build something, so companies start adding program management layers. They're like, \"We have too many meetings. We need to reorg for program management because reorgs fix everything and we need to make sure that we have all these layers and people are connected and we're doing dependency management.\" But as you add more of those things, it becomes harder and harder to do high-impact work.\n\n(00:26:33):\nThe hood just gets heavier and heavier and heavier, which in turn sends teams deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole of low-impact work. Low-impact work begets low-impact work. The more low-impact work you do, the harder it is to do high-impact work, the more likely you are to do low-impact work and so on and so forth. It goes and goes and goes until the next round of layoffs, and this is a real problem.\n\n(00:27:01):\nI've experienced this at again, pretty much every company I've worked with, and it's been really interesting to see how often the breaking of that cycle comes down to individual product teams being brave enough to look at their own work and look at what matters to the business and say, \"You know what? We are not going to incur the risk of being a low-impact team anymore. We are going to proactively seek out high- impact work and we're going to deliver, even if it means we have to coordinate with a lot of other teams. Even if it means that suddenly the executive team takes a really big interest in the work that we're doing. We're going to see that as signs that the work we're doing matters not as things that are going to be an impediment to getting the work done.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):\nAs you just kind of alluded to, there's a big implication here of even if you are told to build a thing that the execs are really excited about, that is low impact in your opinion, that's no excuse. You're still going to get fired eventually, even though they're telling you to build it. It sucks, but that's how it goes.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:28:04):\nIt's funny, I worked with MailChimp for three years leading up to their acquisition by Intuit, when they were on this really interesting journey of going from a single product company to a platform company, which is a journey that a lot of companies are on. Where they've found success in one part of the market and they say, \"You know what? We recognize that there's a value add in working more horizontally and giving people a suite of tools they can use. We want to build these tools and really make sure that we are meeting the needs of our small and medium business customers.\"\n\n(00:28:34):\nSo I was brought on shortly after they did a reorg. They went into a domains model. They had different teams that were supposed to be experts on different parts of this marketing platform that were building in new features and their VP product, Natalia Williams, who then became their CPO, she said, \"This is great that we're doing this, but I'm worried that we're going to lose sight of the commercial fundamentals. We have these teams building this really cool stuff and we've been so clear that we're excited about the teams that are working on initiative, that are building these new things, that are building out this platform, but let's make sure we stay focused on making sure that the entire platform grows in a healthy and sustainable way. And that as we are adding in these new features and functionalities, we're not making this so crowded and complicated that it's harder for people to get value out of it.\"\n\n(00:29:31):\nSo she set a very clear goal for the product team. She wanted a specific change in the rate of users who successfully send their first email. She was like, \"As we build these new things, email is still where people are coming in. We want to make sure that they can do this successfully.\" And she set a really ambitious goal for the entire product organization. And she put it forth to the product teams and a lot of product teams were understandably hesitant to take this on, for a number of reasons. They said, \"If we mess this up, that's the entire commercial heart of the business. That's really risky.\"\n\n(00:30:12):\nOther ones said, \"That's great, but we're building out these new parts of the platform that are really important. We don't want to risk slowing those things down.\" There was one product manager I worked with who really understood how important this was. She had worked on enough different parts of the app at that point. She had been on a growth team, so she really had that kind of user-centric, how do we hit the metrics we need to hit mindset? And she came to me and she was like, \"I want to make sure we do this because I'm worried about what'll happen if we don't do this, right? I don't want to be on the product team that failed to deliver what matters most to the business.\"\n\n(00:30:53):\nSo she went and worked with some user researchers and found where people were getting stuck. She did this amazing study finding where people were getting stuck before they sent that first email and she gathered together a group of product managers. I'll never forget this. I was on site in Atlanta and she gathered together a group of product managers and she was like, \"Look, these are the things we need to fix if we're going to hit this, but if we fix these things, I think we can do it. I think we can get there.\" And there was a moment of silence where again, for totally understandable reasons, people were like, \"Okay, this is great. I see it, but I'm kind of afraid that if we do this,\" and this product manager, I will never forget that.\n\n(00:31:34):\nShe looks around the room and she says, \"You know what? I'm going to haunt all of you in your dreams if you do not take this on. This is the most important thing for the business.\" And everyone laughed. It was a strong comment, but it was a strong comment made in really good faith that in its own way, I think acknowledged the fear that people had about taking this on. She was like, \"Look, this is really important and if we work together, if we care less about the constraints and parameters and borders of our domains and care more about how we work together to deliver the thing that our leader has told us is the most important thing for the business, we can get this done.\"\n\n(00:32:15):\nAnd they did get it done, and they got it done through subtracting. They streamlined the experience. They took out steps that people were getting stuck on. They made things easier. They did the kinds of things that are rarely celebrated in the way that traditional feature launches were celebrated, but because they had this clear, impactful, specific sense of what success looks like, they were able to take on that work themselves and it made the product better, made the business better, and it was just a great moment of working with a great team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:48):\nThat was an awesome example. I love just how much of a hero's journey this example is. Along those lines, it's interesting how much courage it takes to do this. Because to your point, the easy thing is just, \"Okay, everyone's just telling us to do this thing. We're going to build this feature. Great, easy. I don't have to put myself out there.\" And what you're pointing out there is it's up to you to recognize what you're doing is not high impact and to have courage to push back and suggest something else.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:33:15):\nThe funny thing is, it's courage, but it's also a kind of radical acceptance of reality. There's a very kind of emotional philosophical dimension to this conversation because I think it is in human nature to not want to be accountable for things outside of our control. Impact is not something we can just check off a list. If we're really working towards business impact, that means that there are things that might happen in the market that are going to affect us, right? Our competitors might launch something, there might be a pandemic or a war or something we didn't expect. We're reliant upon customers to change their behavior, to convert or to upgrade or to do whatever it is we hope they will do.\n\n(00:33:58):\nI use the word hope because again, we can do our best to influence that behavior, but we can't just check a box. And I think there is this very understandable human fear of being accountable for things that are beyond our control. I get that so hard, but what I think the last couple of years have shown us is that we are accountable for things outside of our control. The success of the businesses we work for is ultimately beyond our immediate control.\n\n(00:34:26):\nAnd you can follow all the best practices and have the highest velocity and do everything quote-unquote \"right\", but if your company goes out of business, they're not going to say, \"Yeah, we're going out of business, but we're going to keep writing your paycheck for two years because all of your OKRs were a 0.6 or a 0.7.\" That's not how it works. The reality is that things outside of our control affect us, and I think that if we can internalize that, there's a real freedom in it. The thing that surprised me most when I was researching this book is that the commercially minded PMs I interviewed were also the happiest, which I did not expect at all.\n\n(00:35:06):\nAs you said, I come from a music background. I was expecting the business people to be really stressed out, and like, \"I have to show up at work 92 hours a day to crush it and make sure that we hit the metrics and crush the numbers.\" But they were just like, \"Yeah, I work for a business and I do the best I can, and then I go home. When I'm at work, my job is to help the business succeed. And I do that by understanding our business model, by trying to do work that contributes to what the business wants. In order to do that, if my goals are really impact level goals, I have to learn about our customers. I have to do discovery, I have to do all these things that we're supposed to do, not because they're abstract best practices, but because that's how you build a successful product.\"\n\n(00:35:49):\nAnd then at the end of the day, I'm not fighting my company to do product the right way, and if they can't do it the right way, I'm willing to die on this hill. It's like, \" I work for a company. I don't get to make every decision. There are things outside of my control. I'll do the best I can, and I get to free up a little bit of energy to live the rest of my life.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):\nTo make this even less scary, hopefully, I'm curious what your answer is going to be here. Do you find that people who take this leap and push back and try to change the way their teams are thinking and what they take on, do you find that even if they fail, even if they impact wasn't there and the project fails, they're seen more favorably and their career ends up doing better and they end up doing better even if the project fails?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:36:36):\nI hope so. I'm always super, again, it's outside of my control. I can't say, if you do these things, then you will be looked upon favorably by the people who manage you because I don't know those people, and maybe they're not going to react well. Maybe they're not actually... People are not always rational, and these things don't always play out the way you hope they will. What I will say is there's a story in the book, in Impact-First Product Teams about somebody who worked for a dating app, and they were given a project to work on, which had a very specific ambitious revenue goal. And at a certain point, it became clear that they were probably not going to be able to hit this because of other things they needed to do.\n\n(00:37:15):\nSo they went to the finance team and said, \"Hey, we have to adjust this down.\" And the finance team said, \"Yeah, of course you do. That makes sense. Let's adjust it down together.\" Would that conversation have played out the same way if they had not taken that step of saying proactively, \" Based on what is happening in the broader world in the market, our product, we no longer believe we are on track to hit this, but we want to adjust so that the company at large can make better predictions and resource things accordingly\"?\n\n(00:37:42):\nI don't know. But I think again, if you are embracing that mindset that there are things outside of your control and your job is to do what you can from where you sit to contribute to the success of the business, I think you're certainly doing so much more by telling the business honestly what you think is possible and what's going to happen, as opposed to stepping back from it and saying like, \"Oh, well, if we talk about it, we're going to get in trouble and nobody's going to believe us.\" And just that simple withholding of information does its own kind of harm. So I can't guarantee any kind of outcomes. I can't say, \"Yes, this will be received with generosity and grace,\" in all cases, but I think it's the right thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:29):\nMy sense is either you will be respected more highly because you are kind of solving problems for people, like higher ups that you're seeing, things that they should be seeing, and you're right, and they're like, \"Oh, wow, Matt's amazing. He saw all this stuff and changed.\" Or you realize this is not the company for me. They don't value this. They just want me to ship this widget and that's all they want from me. I could do more somewhere else.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:38:56):\nWell, I think you touched on something really important there, which is that when you understand the business model, you understand the real world ethics and priorities of the company you work for, right? If you understand what the company's optimizing for, what they really care about, what trade-offs and sacrifices they're willing to make in order to achieve those goals, that tells you a lot more than the mission statement. Which usually sounds great, but if you follow the money, if you follow the decision-making, sometimes it paints a different picture.\n\n(00:39:28):\nAnd I think the more you can understand how the business model works, what that value exchange is, what value is being delivered, what value is being extracted, that I think puts you in a better position to decide, if I were to help the company achieve success, do I feel good about that? Do I feel like this is a company that if it achieves its goals has made the world a better place or not? And the more you understand the business model, the better equipped you are to make those decisions with all the information available to you, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nThat's such an important point.\n\n(00:40:07):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing and all kinds of stuff. Just last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me, what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions? How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment, results, and competitive intel?\n\n(00:40:43):\nClaude can handle incredibly complex multi-step work. You can throw 100-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources. Claude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at claude.ai/lenny and using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's claude.ai/lenny.\n\n(00:41:24):\nOkay, so let's shift to talking about how to actually, what to do. This concept of actions you can take regardless of how your company operates. And that first part is really important. Something that I've seen you big on is you don't let people have an excuse for not pushing on this. And we've talked about this in other ways, but just maybe share more of just like you don't have an excuse no matter how your company operates, to not think deeply about this and try to make change.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:41:51):\nYeah, I mean, the reality is that most companies that product managers work at aren't big tech companies. And when I worked with product teams at those companies, at insurance companies or at banks or at CPG companies, or I worked with a company a while ago that makes audio equipment, which was obviously really fun for me, the first thing they usually tell me is, \"Well, we can't do product the right way because we're a regulated industry,\" or, \"because we're B2B,\" or, \"because we have these quarterly earnings targets we need to hit.\"\n\n(00:42:22):\nAnd that always makes me a little sad because yes, there's a way of looking at it where you can say, \"All right, if these five famous companies do product management the right way, then anything that puts us in a different situation from those companies must mean that we're doing product management the wrong way,\" which is demoralizing and distressing, and again, leads people to these kind of quixotic battles of like, \"I have to turn a bank into a search engine,\" which is not going to happen.\n\n(00:42:49):\nBut the other way of looking at it is that those constraints are how you do product management. Those are what guides you to the commercial decisions you should be making. If you're regulated, your competitors are regulated too. If you can really understand those constraints, figure out how to work well within them, that's a huge commercial advantage for your business. If you're B2B, I honestly prefer working with B2B companies in a lot of situations because they have such immediate access to their customers and they can understand the whole system of their customers and their users and how these things connect in a way that's really immediate and actionable.\n\n(00:43:24):\nSimilarly, if your company has quarterly financial targets to hit, congratulations, you know what the business really cares about. You don't have to go looking much farther than that. You don't necessarily need to cascade that 10 different levels into 45 OKRs if you can do work that you know feeds directly into what the company cares about the most.\n\n(00:43:47):\nSo yes, these things are constraints, but they're the constraints that shape the work that we do. And if we embrace them as such, if we treat them as guides, not restrictions, if we say we're working with not against the commercial realities of our business, there's so much we can do. There's so much that product managers and product owners and project managers that everybody working on product at every organization can do if we again work with, not against the realities of the companies we work for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:23):\nOkay. So I think that's really empowering. You're not saying, \"You need to change the way product is built at your company. It's up to you. You're an ICPM, it's up to you. No excuses.\" What's a simple way to describe what you're actually saying, which I think is going to make people feel a lot better?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:44:38):\nWhat I'm actually saying is that the things you think you're fighting against are usually the things that are giving your work shape, if you let them be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nAwesome. Let's talk about, you have three steps, three handy steps to become more of an impact-first product team. So let's talk through them. What is step one?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:44:59):\nYeah, so the first step, and I think the most important and where a lot of my work plays out is in setting team goals, close to company goals. No more than one step away from company goals. This idea comes from Christina Wodtke's book Radical Focus. She had a great episode on your podcast that I just re-watched for inspiration before I came on here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:22):\nNice move.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:45:24):\nBut in that book, she has this visual where she says that most companies approach cascading OKR as kind of this multi-level, like at the top is company goals, then department goals, then big team goals, then small team goals, and smaller team goals. Which leads to the very situation I described where you can't add those small team goals back up to the company goals. She has a visual that she compares that to, which is the company goal as a center of gravity, and then every other team goal orbiting one level around it. And this blew my mind when I saw it for the first time, because whether you're doing OKRs or KPIs or north star metrics, whatever framework you're ostensibly using, if you use it well, it looks like that.\n\n(00:46:09):\nI worked with a team a while ago that was a traditional feature team at a FinTech company. They were the team that was kind of like the team I worked with at MailChimp, kind of given new features to build to take this product and build it more into a multi-product platform. And the business would say, \"Go build this.\" They'd build it, they'd celebrate, they'd say, \"Go build this.\" They'd build it, they'd celebrate. And then the business said, \"Okay, we're going to do things a little bit differently. Now we have this top line revenue target. We want to make this much more money next year, and we want you to tell us how you're going to contribute to this.\"\n\n(00:46:42):\nAnd this was a really challenging conversation for this team because as much as people complain about being feature factories, again, it feels safer, right? There's more control over that. If you're told what to build, you have a lot more control over whether or not you build it than you do over whether or not it generates revenue. So we started having this conversation, what framework should we use? How should we do this? And I was not asking very good questions. I was kind of panicking too, to be honest. And then I asked them, I was like, \"Okay, why does this team exist, right? Why are we doing this at all? Why is the business investing in this big team to build all these features? Why do we care if we're a single-product company or a multi-product platform company?\"\n\n(00:47:26):\nAnd one of the team leaders said, \"Oh, well actually, the customer lifetime value of a multi-product user is much higher than that of a single-product user.\" I was like, \"Oh, do we know how much higher?\" And they said, \"Yeah, we actually have a number on that.\" And I was like, \"Wow. So if we had a goal of converting a certain number of single-product users to multi-product users, we know exactly how much revenue is on the line.\" They were like, \"Yeah, I guess so.\" So we were able to set a goal, and from there we had this conversation about what's the number we would need to hit to make this team feel like a good investment? And we came to a specific number and-\n\nMatt LeMay (00:48:00):\nTo make this team feel like a good investment. And we came to a specific number and that number informed every decision that was made by that team for the rest of the year. We said, \"By the end of the year, we need to convert this many single product users to multi-product users because if we do that, there's this much additional revenue which contributes this much to the company's top line revenue goal.\" It's one step away.\n\n(00:48:22):\nAnd when they went and shared that goal with company leadership, they got it right away. They didn't have to say, \"Well, why is this valuable?\" They didn't have to say, \"What are your other OKRs? Show us the deck.\" They got it. And that gave them so much leeway to make bolder decisions, to work more closely with other teams to ask for the resources they needed. And that process of arriving at that goal, that goal that is impactful and specific and one step away from what the company cares about the most, is probably the most valuable way I have spent my time with teams of late. Because once you get to that, you see how everything else flows from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:01):\nAnd the implication here is that if it's too far away from people understanding what the hell are you guys even doing to help the business? That's the problem you want to avoid.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:49:10):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:11):\nSo one extreme is, I don't know, it probably doesn't make sense for your team to have exactly the same goal as the company. Say your company's trying to grow a hundred million revenue rate, that's not going to be your team's goal. So it's almost like that extreme is what's one step away from that? What's your contribution to that company goal?\n\n(00:49:29):\nThe other end is just some 10 level deep, we're going to improve conversion of this random step, which is going to grow this thing which grows that, and then that grows revenue.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:49:37):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:38):\nWhat is your guidance on revenue-based goals as goals for teams?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:49:43):\nI think, again, it depends. I know people have very strong opinions about teams should always or should never have revenue-based goals. I don't think it's that simple. I think sometimes yes, if your company is working towards revenue, having a revenue-based goal makes sense, or at least being able to put some value in terms of revenue on the work that your team is doing. I've worked with some startups where they actively are not going after revenue because right now the name of the game is growth, right? They want to show that they have enough users to raise that next round of investment. I actually worked with one startup where their revenue was going up, and their number of users was going up, and we had to have a really interesting conversation around which one actually matters to our investors. And we kind of wound up developing these two scenarios, the high growth scenario and the low growth scenario.\n\n(00:50:33):\nAnd talking to the product team, it was really clear that there was no way they were going to hit the high growth scenario. So they pivoted to focus on profitability so they could build more runway and raise that next round as a smaller business with a sustainable revenue base.\n\n(00:50:46):\nSo I get why people are hesitant to commit to revenue goals. I think that there are certainly situations where revenue goals would be too broad or not exactly what the business needs, but at the end of the day, money is how the impact of most teams is going to be measured. And if you don't have a point of view on why your team is a good investment, either in the money return it brings, or in another return that is equally or more important to the business, then again, that feels like a tenuous and risky position to be in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:25):\nTo kind of get people's brains noodling in the right direction. What are some examples of good goals, like specific goals that your teams have set that are one step away from a company goal? What are just some examples without naming companies?\n\nMatt LeMay (00:51:38):\nI have a story to tell to that effect, which also sets up the second step here, which is to keep impact first at every step.\n\n(00:51:47):\nSo, I worked with a growth team at a tech company that is beloved by many the people. And I was brought on to help them set OKRs, right? The company was doing OKRs across the board, and this team was going to set its growth OKRs. So they had done a lot of reading, a lot of research into how to do OKRs the right way. They had read, unfortunately, they had not read Radical Focus or they hopefully would've done things differently, they had read a lot of other books. They had printed out a lot of articles and they said, \"We're going to make sure we get this right. We're going to put together a slide deck that has five to seven objectives with five to seven key results each, and each key result is going to have an owner and we're going to make sure that people are accountable for it. And we're going to really, really do this the right way. We're going to get that middle piece perfect.\"\n\n(00:52:39):\nSo they spent a long time working on these OKRs, OKR season ends. They file away the OKR deck not to be seen until the next OKR season. We reconvene, and spend a whole day scoring all of the OKRs. And there are heated conversations about what's a 0.6 versus a 0.7? Is this a 0.9? Who really should be the owner of this key result? Who contributed the most to it? And we get through this whole conversation, everyone's tired. And I'm like, \"There's just one question I need to ask. I'm so sorry to do this to y'all, but how does this all add up to the company level growth goals?\"\n\n(00:53:23):\nPeople look around and they're like, \"Well, that wasn't what we did. We set our team level OKRs and we went through the process and we made sure, and we followed the OKRs, we thought about the OKRs,\" and I said, \"Yeah, but the company has a goal of let's call it bringing on a million new users in this year. We're a growth team. How many users did we bring on?\"\n\n(00:53:50):\nAnd there's a moment of silence. And the leader of this team's a really, really good leader. She stands and she's like, \"Okay, we're going to do things differently.\" She steps up to the whiteboard, puts 1 million on the right end of the whiteboard, draws a line, \"This is the year,\" draws a little tick on the line. \"This is where we are now. It's a smaller number than a million. This is where we need to get to. If our conversation doesn't start with this, I don't want to have the conversation. And if you are 51% sure that a different approach is going to get us 1% closer, I expect you to advocate for that approach. And this is now how we are going to do everything.\"\n\n(00:54:34):\nAnd I think about that all the time, because it's subtracting steps. It's making things less complicated. It actually is doing exactly what you described. It's saying, \"This is what the company cares about. We're the growth team. We need to figure out how everything we're doing contributes to this.\"\n\n(00:54:55):\nThat story really stuck with me because it seems like it should be obvious, right? If you're the growth team at a company with a growth goal, obviously that's going to be something you care about. But it's so easy in the day-to-day work of setting these intermediate goals, of doing strategy, of doing the things we do to make things just a little bit more complicated than they need to be. So for this particular team and this particular moment, a good goal was looking at the company level goal and saying, \"If we're the team that's driving growth, we're accountable for this. We're going to step up and we're going to do everything we can to make sure, the company meets its ambition.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:38):\nAnd it's so obvious if you come at it from the perspective you shared earlier. If you're the CEO, would you fund this team? If you see our goal is a million users, this team will drive us a hundred thousand users. Assuming that's a lot for you. Obviously we want that team to do great and we're going to give them the resources to do that. They're going to contribute meaningfully to this goal. It's very obvious as you see it. The trick is a lot of people think they're doing that and they're not. Maybe one heuristic I think about as you're talking is just like, how do you know if you're doing this? There should be a very simple spreadsheet formula of just here's the company goal, here's your goal. There should be one simple formula that translates up that adds to it.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:56:20):\nOne Y statement and or one mathematical operator is usually the way I think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:24):\nThere we go.\n\nMatt LeMay (00:56:26):\nIn some cases, like the story I told about that FinTech company, it's something like upgraded users. That's one step, right? You multiply that by the increased customer lifetime value. In some cases, it's a smaller unit of the same thing. So it's a subset of the revenue or growth that the company's trying to deliver.\n\n(00:56:47):\nI worked with a company recently that had a team rebuilding their ad tech platform. This is a big company that does a lot of different things, and at the heart of all of their different offerings is this ad tech platform. And I was brought on to do a day long workshop with this company because this was a really important team and they were struggling to figure out what success looked like.\n\n(00:57:06):\nSo I said, \"Okay, what are your goals?\" And they said, \"Here's the deck with our goals.\" I said, \"That's a lot of goals. I wouldn't be able to make decisions with those goals.\" They said, \"Oh wait, wait, wait, no, we also have a Miro board. We went through this and we decided the deck was too much. So we also have a Miro board,\" but as Miro boards tend to do, it kind of grew and grew and grew in all directions. So now it's a big board. Turned out they had two Miro boards because they had tried to do this twice.\n\n(00:57:33):\nSo we sat down and we did this really interesting kind of subtractive exercise, where everybody got a post-it note to write down what they think the most important goal of the team is. And then they would pair up and they would have to make it smaller each time, make it more concise. If there were two things, get it down to one thing. If there were 10 words, bring it down to eight words, make it smaller and more concise each time.\n\n(00:57:56):\nAnd we came up with two options. One was build a fantastic, wonderful, magical, beautiful platform to increase our team's profits by 20%. Fair enough. The other one was, build a stupendous, wonderful, fantastic platform to increase our team's profits in the next financial year from 20 million pounds to a hundred million pounds.\n\n(00:58:18):\nAnd I'm looking at these and I'm like, \"Okay, so we know that there is an expectation of revenue here. There's an expectation that we will drive profitability, but one of these is 20% and the other is 500%. Where do these numbers come from?\" And the folks who had said 20%, they were like, \"That feels like a good return.\" And what's interesting was when I was telling the story, when I was giving some talks recently, and people would kind of laugh like, \"Oh, they named the wrong number.\" But they were so brave to do that, and them saying 20% is what actually unlocked the conversation at the team level, because somebody else in the room heard that and said, \"Wait, I do remember something about profits. There was some target we were supposed to hit, but I think I remember it being a lot bigger than that.\" And they actually went back and found a town hall that their VP had given and buried in a slide in that town hall was this hundred million pound profit target by the end of the next financial year.\n\n(00:59:22):\nSo they have this number and they start to go like, \"Oh gosh, that's a lot, but it's a whole financial year. It'll be fine.\" And we do, again, inspired by that leader I worked with, I just put this out on a whiteboard. I'm like, \"All right, a hundred million in profits by the end of the next financial year right now we're here. What else should be on this timeline?\" Somebody said, \"Well, we're launching this in October.\" So I put October up there. I go, \"Okay, so if we don't ship anything until October, and right now it's March, how much profit do we make until?\" And they said, \"About 10 million.\" I'm like, \"Okay. So that means that between October and March, we need to generate 90 million pounds of profits.\"\n\n(01:00:06):\nAnd this team, I was worried they were going to freak out or they were going to be like, \"Oh, we can't do this. It's impossible.\" But they were like, \"Okay, it's time to step up. It's time to do all these things that we need to do. We need to ship sooner. We need to do more validation. We need to do more testing. Can we commercialize things sooner? Can we do more discovery to make sure that this is really going to have the impact we need to have? Why are we doing this whole big relaunch? Why don't we rebuild individual things? What impact will we have if we brought more people in top of funnel now? Can we begin building our user base and then upgrade that user base? What are the trade-offs if we do that versus if we bring people in?\"\n\n(01:00:41):\nAll those things that I think is really the heart and the intent of these best practices. They came to life because this team had clarity. They understood like, \"Okay, we are accountable for something which is specific enough to drive some real urgency, and which is impactful enough that we have to get out there and do all these things that we're supposed to do.\"\n\n(01:01:05):\nSo that to me, is a really good example of how if you start with this question of like, well, what's expected of this team? What does success look like for us? It'll often lead you to the right neighborhood of what kind of unit of measure you want to look for, how the business is going to look to you, whether they're looking directly at revenue, whether they're looking at something else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:29):\nOkay. These stories are awesome. So basically, so far, the two steps that you've illustrated here of doing this correctly, step one is set team goals that are close to company goals. And then step two is, do this at every step of the product building process. It's not just a one-time thing at the beginning.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:01:46):\nRight. As you're doing OKRs, like that team I talked about, when you're thinking about your company strategy, when you're writing epics, whatever it is, keep that impactful goal top of mind. Don't let it slip away. Don't let it get cascaded into oblivion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:02):\nBecause to your point, the examples you shared where you think you're just like, \"Cool, we have our goal, let's go.\" And then you spend months doing this thing and then you forget, okay, this actually got disconnected from the company goal.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:02:12):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:12):\nEverything you've worked hard to do is just, no one cares.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:02:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):\nOkay. What is step three?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:02:18):\nStep three is to connect every bit of work back to impact. So this is when we get to the prioritization piece, right.\n\n(01:02:26):\nSo impact estimation is something that is written about quite well, quite extensively in product management stuff, but it's something that it's easy to not do. I work with a lot of teams that want to know, again, the right best practice for doing prioritization, whether that's should we use ICE or RICE or MoSCoW or whatever it is, what's the right way to do prioritization? And again, it depends, but if you don't have a clear and specific sense of what impact means, you can't really prioritize effectively. So this is where, again, everything comes back to that first step of the way you set goals.\n\n(01:03:13):\nSo that team I told you about that had the goal of converting single product users to multi-product users, one of the product managers on that team came back to me a few months later and said, \"Hey, Matt, I could really use your help figuring out how to do prioritization. Should we do ICE? Should we do RICE? Should we do MoSCoW? I put together an ICE matrix where I scored impact and I scored certainty and I scored effort, and I multiplied each one by each one, and I have a list of the things we should do.\"\n\n(01:03:38):\nAnd I said, \"That's awesome.\" And I do really think it's awesome when people take the initiative to do the thing to say, \"I put this together, let's walk through it.\" So when they showed me this, I said, \"Let's start with impact.\" They're like, \"Okay, well here's the score for each one.\" I was like, \"What's the score?\" They're like, \"Oh, it's a lot of different things.\" And I said, \"Okay, well, we have a team goal of a certain specific number of users we need to convert by the end of the year, so let's try to express impact as a function of that goal. So rather than an abstract score, what is the most number of users we could convert in each of these different scenarios?\"\n\n(01:04:18):\nAnd understandably, they were kind of like, \"Oh, you know what? I don't know exactly.\" I'm like, \"Let's, just work through it. We don't have to be precise. It's called impact estimation, not impact getting perfect number.\" So for one of them, they were like, \"Well, we can do this landing page.\" I'm like, \"Okay, well how many people hit the landing page?\" And they were like, \"Not that many, maybe a few hundred.\" I'm like, \"Okay, cool. So that's maybe a few hundred.\"\n\n(01:04:43):\nAnd there was one thing which they were really reluctant. It had a high effort score and a medium certainty score. And what they basically said was like, \"Look, if we really wanted to do this, we could redesign the entire onboarding experience. We can make it so that rather than us trying to retroactively shuttle people into multi-product usage, we can understand them when they join and get them into the right category of user right away.\"\n\n(01:05:08):\nI'm like, \"That sounds amazing.\" What's the most impact that could have? They were like, \"It would get us all the way there if we did it right, but we'd have to work with these other teams and we'd have to work with marketing. And there are so many dependencies and so many things outside of our control that we don't know if we could do it.\" And I said, \"That's okay. These are the trade-offs we make as product managers, you will have some things to work on that are going to have less impact, but might be easier and more certain to deliver. But if this thing could get us all the way there, if it's really the only thing we're looking at, which has really any chance of getting us to our goal, which remember we came up with to answer the question, what does this team need to deliver to be a good investment for the business, then I think it's worth going for it.\n\n(01:05:55):\n\"It's worth having those conversations with other product teams. It's worth talking to folks in marketing. It's worth stretching ourselves a little bit and saying, 'This is going to be challenging to do, but if we can do it, we can really deliver on something which we're going to feel great about.'\"\n\n(01:06:11):\nSo the way that third step manifests itself the most frequently, tactically is are we estimating and measuring impact in the same unit of measure as our goals? Because if we're doing that, then we're keeping ourselves honest and we're saying, \"Does this actually have a chance of contributing?\" Whereas again, if we get really clever and we come up with a proprietary scoring system and all these little intermediate steps, we can feel like we're doing really awesome work and being very, very terribly smart. But we again, run the risk that we are going to lose our connection with why we're setting about to do this work in the first place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:51):\nSuch an important and often easily overlooked point. This idea that when you're doing RICE or whatever version of ICE that you do, that impact should be based on impact to your goal, which is one level removed from the company goal. It feels so obvious as you talk about it, and I hope most people know this, but I feel like that's something people forget. Just like, what is impact? Oh yeah, customers will be happier.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:07:16):\nAgain, this is not easy work, right? Working in product means that we have so many different perspectives, so many different folks who have so many different priorities. The stakeholder management piece of this is relentless and exhausting, and it's really, really easy to lose sight of this stuff. And it takes work and discipline and as you said, bravery to keep bringing it back. But I think again, it is not only the right thing to do, but it helps you at the end of the day, have a little bit more of a boundary between the work you're doing at your job and the stuff you're good at in your life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):\nSpeaking of boundaries, a lot of the advice you share will involve people saying no, and pushing back, and convincing people they're wrong, which is very hard. That's not a natural happy place for most people.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:08:12):\nNope.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):\nWhat advice do you have? What have you learned works well for pushing back, helping people see how they're not... What they want you to build is wrong.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:08:24):\nSo this is where I have the benefit, I suppose, of being a conflict-averse, people pleaser. So I've been through this, and I think the thing I am proudest of saying in product management and practice is that if you're doing product management really well, you never have to say yes and you never have to say no. You're giving people options and you're helping them understand the trade-offs.\n\n(01:08:52):\nSo in keeping with this idea that there are things outside of your control, as a product manager, you're not always going to be the one who makes the decision. There are going to be other people who come to you and say, \"Build this,\" or who say, \"I don't see the value in that. Do this, do that. I want this, I want that.\" If those people are in a position of formal authority in the organization, I've certainly never had luck telling them no.\n\n(01:09:16):\nFurthermore, I've found myself in situations where they just know things that I don't know. Where they're pursuing an acquisition, so there are certain things that we have to do or can't do. Where there's some serious financial challenge that they're working their way through right now, which is shifting around priorities, but they are not at liberty to discuss that with the broader organization. It is quite possible that the folks who are asking you to do things that don't make sense, have access to information that you don't. And that in trying to convince them otherwise, you are not only going to fail, but you are going to lose some of that trust and degrade that relationship that could in time be really important for you. So I think the challenge is to say, \"All right, you want me to build this thing? Maybe. Let's look at the different things.\"\n\n(01:10:15):\nIf you're going through these steps, if you say, \"I understand, here's what our team's goals are, here's the stuff we're prioritizing, here's the impact we think it could have.\" If you're coming to me with something which is going to have more impact, heck yeah, I would love to build that. That sounds amazing.\n\n(01:10:29):\nBut if it has an unclear impact or if it doesn't tie into this, then we might need to adjust the impact we're seeking to have. If this is suddenly really important, as with that story that was told in the book, right? Sometimes it's like, all right, we got to do this. Sure. That means that our impact projection is going to have to be adjusted this much.\n\n(01:10:48):\nYou're not saying no, you're not saying yes. You're helping someone who is in a position to make a decision, understand the trade-offs that go into that decision. And again, if you can do that, you're going to go home at the end of the day feeling better. You're going to feel less like you lost a battle or that you were overridden by an unjust tyrant, and it's going to be more like, \"Okay, I made sure they had all the information I would want to have if I were making that decision. That decision is ultimately theirs to make, and I'm going to do the best I can.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:19):\nTell me if you disagree. In my experience, you also want to recommend a path. Because a lot of people don't want PMs just, \"Here's all the options. I have no opinion, no bias of any kind. You decide.\" I find that people want you to have a perspective.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:11:33):\nAbsolutely. Options and a recommendation is kind of the magic formula. I did when I was working with MailChimp, we actually did a workshop with all the product managers at the company where we had people roleplay trying to sell in a single option versus multiple options with a recommendation. And it was amazing how when you present a single option, people's instinct is just to, well, I don't know, you start poking holes in it. Not because you're a jerk, but because-\n\nMatt LeMay (01:12:00):\nYou start poking holes in it, not because you're a jerk, but because you're looking at one thing and you're like, \"Oh, well, what about this? What about that?\"\n\n(01:12:07):\nAgain, all of your own anxieties and fears and the things that you don't feel represented in there, and where you're worried, \"What if this happens? What if that happens?\"\n\n(01:12:14):\nAll of that kind of detracts from the momentum, whereas if you come in and say, \"Here are three options, here are the trade-offs, here's the one we recommend,\" then every little bit of back and forth makes those options clearer and stronger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:30):\nI feel like people might miss that nuance, in the way we talked about it, so I think that's a really important point to make there.\n\n(01:12:35):\nLet me come back to the three steps, just for folks that are, \"Cool, I'm excited, I'm motivated. I'm going to change the way we operate.\" I'll summarize real quick.\n\n(01:12:44):\nSo step one is, set team goals close to company goals. Step two is keep impact first at every step. Don't forget, as you're building throughout the year. And then, step three is connect every bit of work back to impact.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:12:57):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):\nI think, again, it's important to remind people, this may be hard and annoying, and maybe things are going fine. Everyone's telling you what to build, you're building and shipping, and things are, it seems to be going all right.\n\n(01:13:11):\nI think an important part of this is just, if you believe what you're building is not helping the business grow and succeed, either, they'll let you go someday, because you're not doing something that matters. Or the business will not work out, and you'll be in trouble.\n\n(01:13:27):\nSo it's like, even if you don't want to do this something, you need to really seriously think about this, even though it's really hard.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:13:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:37):\nBut maybe let me just think of that a little bit. Say the business is doing great, everything's great. The CEO's telling you all the things to build, that sales guys and girls are just like, \"Here, ship these features, everything's great.\"\n\n(01:13:46):\nAnd everything's working, business is growing. What thoughts there? Is it just, \"Nah, leave it alone?\" Or is your sense, \"Okay, most often this will not last,\" and you should really start to work on these skills?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:13:56):\nIt's funny, the teams I've worked with, when things are going well, are sometimes just as anxious as the teams I've worked with, when things are going poorly, because they have a hard time attributing success to what they're doing, right?\n\n(01:14:08):\nThey'll look at it and they'll say, \"Yeah, we're doing great. But I think that honestly has more to do with marketing than it does with us.\"\n\n(01:14:14):\nOr, \"Yeah, we're doing great, but we're just in the right place at the right time. Our business is doing really well, our sector is doing really well. We're just growing along with everyone else who's growing.\"\n\n(01:14:24):\nAnd I think, as with most things, if you approach it with curiosity, there's a lot to learn from it. So if you look at it, and you say, \"Yeah, we can't necessarily take sole credit for this, but Marketing's doing awesome. Let's talk to them. What are they doing? Why is this going so well? What have they learned from this, that we can work with them more closely?\"\n\n(01:14:46):\nIf your sector is just doing really well, be like, okay, well what about this is working right now? What might change in the future? How can we understand this?\"\n\n(01:14:54):\nSo I think the challenge, when things are going well, is to keep that curiosity going, and to keep celebrating the things, not just that your team is doing, but that everyone is doing, and to take that time, where you have a little bit more leeway, where there's less pressure on you in the moment, to build those connections with other parts of the organization, to see where that really good work is happening.\n\n(01:15:21):\nOne thing that makes me sad is when teams look upon each other with envy and disgust, right, when it's, \"This team's doing, they're doing great work, but they're not held to the same standards that we are, and it's not fair, and they're the team that everyone likes.\"\n\n(01:15:37):\nIt's like, \"Go talk to them, because there's probably something you can learn from them. And if they're the team that's getting positive attention, that's doing meaningful work, there's probably a reason for that. And if you can understand that reason, and you can align your work, that team's work, that's probably going to be really good for you.\"\n\n(01:15:58):\nAgain, I think, in a lot of cases, it comes back down to that control thing, right? If we can't feel a sense of control over, \"Things are going well because we did this,\" we tend to disconnect ourselves from things going well and say, \"Well, I can't. It almost feels dangerous to engage with it because, what if we didn't do anything, but good things are still happening.\"\n\n(01:16:21):\nAnd I think, just keeping that openness, keeping that curiosity going, puts you in a much better position for when things inevitably begin to either plateau or decline, which is the cyclical nature of all things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:34):\nWow. Profound there. To start to wrap up our conversation, what's maybe one question from the book, or even from this conversation, that you think product leaders, product teams should ask themselves to help them solve problems, that maybe they're not seeing, and to help their team operate better?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:16:53):\nI mean, I love the, \"Would you fund this team, if you were the CEO question?\" I know that that can feel a little confrontational sometimes. So, a gentler way of bringing that up is to say, \"What's one sentence you'd want to be able to say at the end of this year, that would leave you feeling awesome about this team's work? What's something?\"\n\n(01:17:11):\nAt the end of the year, everything went really well for this team. You run into the CEO in the hallway, and you say, \"I feel awesome, because we did this.\" '.\n\n(01:17:20):\nAnd you'll sometimes get very different answers from different people on the team, building on those answers, saying, \"Okay, this is what you care about. This is what I care about. This is what I'm worried about. This is what I'm excited about.\"\n\n(01:17:33):\nThat's how you get that magical, people in a room building together, or musicians in a room writing their next song, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):\nWhat a call, back to the beginning.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:17:40):\nAnd then-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:40):\nI love this.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:17:43):\nIt's getting that conversation out in the open, and getting people to talk about their perspectives and their expectations, with the goal of bringing it together, to create something better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):\nBam. Matt, is there anything else that you wanted to cover or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:18:03):\nI think we covered it. I just leave people with, again, this hope that you can start to see the commercial realities and constraints of your business as opportunities, as guideposts, as things that shape and structure your work, not as things that you single-handedly need to change, or break down, or transform, because you probably can't. And that's okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):\nThat's empowering stuff. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:18:37):\nAs ready as I'm going to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:39):\nQuestion one. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:18:43):\nRadical Focus, by Christina Wodtke, is obviously, I cite it a lot in my book, I think it's the best book about OKRs. I love her style of writing. I love the way she tells stories.\n\n(01:18:56):\nI love the focus on focus, this idea that again, the way you do it is less important than the result of the way of doing it. I just find that so inspiring, always.\n\n(01:19:08):\nThe other book, this is a bit of a curveball, is by Alan Watts, the Buddhist philosopher. It's called The Wisdom of Insecurity. And a lot of the way I talk about control, and giving up control, comes from that book.\n\n(01:19:23):\nIt also has a concept. It opens with a concept called the law of reverse effort, which is that sometimes, the harder you try, the worse you make things. When it comes to setting goals, doing OKRs, doing strategy, I think about this a lot, that there is a tendency sometimes to put effort towards the overcomplication of things, which in turn makes those things less effective, what they're ultimately intended to achieve. So, highly recommend that book. It helped me a lot through some dark times, mentally.\n\n(01:19:59):\nThere's an idea in the book. He talks about how trying to keep yourself perpetually safe in an imagined future is effectively killing yourself to the present. And ooh, that hit hard. That hit me really, really, really hard. So, highly recommend that book.\n\n(01:20:18):\nIf the things we've talked about today make you even a fraction of, as anxious and fearful as they make me when I navigate them in my work, then I highly recommend The Wisdom of Insecurity, by Alan Watts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:32):\nI was going to ask what the title is, because that sounds really powerful. Amazing, amazing pick.\n\n(01:20:37):\nSecond question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:20:41):\nGod. So especially, when I'm in work-y write-y mode, my brain shuts off to all things that are not trash. So I have been watching a lot of trash.\n\n(01:20:53):\nI watched Temptation Island, the new season of Temptation Island on Netflix. I loved it so much. It's Mark L. Wahlberg, who is the host of Antiques Roadshow, just weaponizing therapyspeak to torture people, in this bizarre scenario.\n\n(01:21:15):\nAnd I should not love it, but I am only a human, and a messy bitch who lives for the drama, sometimes, so ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:25):\nSo good.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:21:26):\nI know. I enjoyed that very much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:27):\nI think it's the first Temptation Island call-out, and I love it. Okay, favorite product or ... Yeah, favorite product you've recently discovered, that you really love?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:21:37):\nYeah, so I'm really glad you asked this question, because as a musician, I live in this world of niche products, which is so much fun, because the economies of scale for music creators are just totally different, right?\n\n(01:21:48):\nYou don't need to build a product that's going to have a billion users, and create a huge return. You can do something that a few hundred or a few thousand people get a lot of use out of and love. You're in this fun realm of hybrid, physical and digital, and different types of things. And when you asked me this question, the first thing that came to mind was this, which is made by an amplifier builder who goes by Milkman Sound, in the San Francisco Bay area, who took, basically, the circuit of a Fender amplifier, and made a version of it that fits into this handy, compact, lightweight form factor.\n\n(01:22:35):\nSo for me, as somebody who is no longer 22 years old, and still occasionally tours with my friend's band, and has back problems, the fact that I can carry this really powerful amplifier around, in this really well-designed, aesthetically pleasing form factor, just feels like such a joy. It's one of those products that really understands what quality means to its particular audience.\n\n(01:23:09):\nAnd I can go on tour, and have things sound really nice, without having to lug a giant, heavy thing. And I love that. It's something for which I am truly grateful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:24):\nThis makes me want to play music randomly, but just so I understand how this works, do you still plug that into a speaker, or is that-\n\nMatt LeMay (01:23:30):\nYeah, so I have a little speaker.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:32):\nOkay. Oh, okay.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:23:32):\nYou can also plug direct into the soundboard at a club, or for recording.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:36):\nOkay, got it.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:23:37):\nAnd it has a little headphone jack, too. So if I want to practice in the hotel room, before you play, I can also use this.\n\n(01:23:45):\nIt does everything you would need this device to do, and nothing more, and it does it really well. And that is so delicious to me, to have a product-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:59):\nAnother great pick.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:24:01):\n... that I'm like, \"This does exactly what I need. It does it so well, and it's a delightful product.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:11):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work, or in life?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:24:17):\nI come back to something my mom told me. I'm sure you've experienced this, too. When you're a person creating things in the world, there's a tendency to look at the numbers, and look at, \"How am I doing? And did this resonate? Is this good? Did this work?\"\n\n(01:24:31):\nAnd I've definitely worked on things, especially in my musical life, where the amount of effort and love, and time and care that went into something, didn't feel like it showed up in the result of that thing, or the way it was received.\n\n(01:24:48):\nI was talking to my mom about this once, and she said, \"I really believe that no good work is wasted. Even if you don't see it right away, when you put good work out into the world, even if it only finds a few people, it's never wasted. If you do work you really believe in, it's going to have some positive effect on the world.\"\n\n(01:25:10):\nAnd that really stuck with me. I've carried that with me, even when I think about how to write, and what to say, and when I start to worry about outsmarting myself, and should I be more strategic in the way I message this, and should I say something I don't really totally believe?\n\n(01:25:34):\nThere've been a few times, not recently, but a few times, 10 years ago, where I dabbled in writing click bait-y headlines, because I was like, \"Ooh, is this going to get more attention?\" And there was one in particular, that got really thoughtful critique from some people I really respect.\n\n(01:25:49):\nI was like, \"I don't want to do this. I don't want to put work I don't believe in out into the world,\" and even if it doesn't do what I hoped it would do, I'm going to go forth with the belief that no good work has wasted.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:03):\nI totally believe that. Final question. You wrote a ton of music reviews over the years. I'm curious if there's one that was just very, people super disagreed with it, or just one that you're super proud of?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:26:19):\nI mean, I am a villain, in certain corners of the internet-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):\nSay more.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:26:23):\n... for the review I wrote of Liz Phair's self-titled album. I wrote this review when I was 19, when my worldview was toxic, and very much in progress. It was a really condescending, arrogant review, written from a place of unearned condescension and arrogance.\n\n(01:26:46):\nNot that condescension and arrogance should necessarily be earned, but it felt righteous at the time, in a way that is dangerous, right? That toxic righteousness where you're like, \"I'm fighting something bad.\" But then you realize that what you're fighting is not actually bad.\n\n(01:27:09):\nYou're actually punching sideways and down, but you don't have the wherewithal and the maturity to realize that you are not where you think you are, in relation to people and culture, and yourself. So I apologized for that review in 2019, and Liz Phair and I actually had a really nice little Twitter back and forth.\n\n(01:27:34):\nThis was back when Twitter was still a place where this kind of thing could happen, and it was nice to wrap that up in that way. I still don't feel good about it, because it was playing into some really toxic and hurtful dimensions of discourse.\n\n(01:28:06):\nBut what can you do, if not look back on it and say, \"Yeah, I was wrong. I was just flat-out wrong, and beyond being wrong, I was being a jerk.\" Somebody posted this, a meme creator on Instagram, posted that review a couple months ago, with a caption, \" Matt LeMay, you will be dealt with.\"\n\n(01:28:31):\nAnd I was like, \"Yeah, yeah. If I read that now, I would probably say something pretty similar.\" So I think, as I said, I'm a conflict averse people pleaser.\n\n(01:28:48):\nI went through my kind of edgelord phase. And I don't think it did any good for me, or for anyone else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:57):\nWow. That was a much more profound answer than I expected. I can't believe people are still referencing this review from a long time ago. How many years? How ...\n\nMatt LeMay (01:29:08):\n22? It was 2003, so it was 22 years ago. It was more than half my life ago. But this is the wild thing, is that on the internet, it still looks new.\n\n(01:29:19):\nThe first talk I ever gave, in London, actually, was at a Red Monk event, and I brought my teenage diary with me, to make the point that if something has 10 years of age on it as paper, it's contextualized by its own material existence, right?\n\n(01:29:36):\nBut somebody will go, \"Oh, I wonder what Pitchfork thought of this record,\" they'll see my jerk-ass review, and be, \"Pitchfork published this jerk-ass review. Who was the jerk-ass reviewer who wrote it?\"\n\n(01:29:48):\nAnd they'll find me, and be like, \"Hey, you, you're a jerk-ass, because you wrote this jerk-ass review.\" And I'll be like, \"Yes, I did write that jerk-ass review, from the place of being a jerk-ass.\" But I like to think I am a person who has lived 22 years of life since then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:11):\nYour frontal cortex has developed more since then. I think it doesn't stop-\n\nMatt LeMay (01:30:13):\nGod, I hope so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:14):\nUntil 25, 26. Matt, this was awesome. We covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to, and more.\n\n(01:30:22):\nTwo follow-up questions. Where can folks find you online, talk about the sort of work you do with companies, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:30:29):\nYeah, so you can find me online at matlemay.com, pretty straightforward, and in terms of how folks can be useful to me, hopefully I can be useful to them, whether that's through the books, or through coming into work with your company, and help your teams focus.\n\n(01:30:47):\nI find that facilitating these conversations is a really big value add. It's hard to have these conversations to do this without some outside help sometimes. So again, whether it's in book form or in me form, I hope that I can be useful to you, and having these conversations in a way that's less scary, more accessible, and leads you down that road to doing impactful work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:11):\nAwesome, and mattlemay.com. And then, what's the name of the book? Where do they find it\n\nMatt LeMay (01:31:15):\nImpact-First Product Teams. You can find it at all the places where you find books, on Amazon. There's an author read audiobook, which I recorded right here in this room, with this microphone. I did all the musical interludes myself ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:28):\nWhy?\n\nMatt LeMay (01:31:30):\nBecause it was a great way to procrastinate, when I did not actually want to read the book. But I hope you will find it fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:39):\nMatt, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMatt LeMay (01:31:41):\nThanks so much, Lenny. This was great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):\nBye, everyone.\n\nSpeaker 1 (01:31:44):\nThank you so much for listening.

If you overstaff, you get politics, you get people working on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. That is poison. It's wasteful. It slows you down. It creates cruft.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nYou've been a long time COO at Rippling. Recently, you moved into CPO, Chief Product Officer at Rippling. Something you talk a lot about is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:00:26):\nIf you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult. You got to sort of remind people that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. It's supposed to be really fricking exhausting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nYou're a big fan of escalating issues.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:00:41):\nFundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. When you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable. Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort, and it's fundamentally selfish. So many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well. Teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes. The purest form of ambition and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO. Every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity. That is fucking dangerous.\n\n(00:01:17):\nAs an executive, as a leader, your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level. You've had a couple really interesting experiences with your own startup. We talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:33):\nToday, my guest is Matt MacInnis, Chief Product Officer and formerly longtime Chief Operating Officer at Rippling. If you don't know much about Rippling, it's a massively successful business last valued at over $16 billion. They have over 5,000 employees, and Matt has been instrumental to that success. He's also got a really rare combination of brutal honesty, a ton of experience building a very complex and very successful business, and being able to clearly articulate what he has learned really well. Matt shared a lot of insights and advice that I've not heard anyone else on this podcast share, and I left this conversation feeling that every leader needs to hear his advice.\n\n(00:02:12):\nA huge thank you to Albert Scrashim and Sunil Raman for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

Hey folks, I'm Amar, product and design lead at Google DeepMind. Have you ever wanted to build an app for yourself, your friends, or finally launch that side project you've been dreaming about? Now you can bring any idea to life, no coding background required with Gemini three in Google AI Studio. It's called vibe coding and we're making it dead simple. Just describe your app and Gemini will wire up the right models for you so you can focus on your creative vision. Head to ai.studio/build to create your first app.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:18):\nThis episode is brought to you by Datadog, now home to Eppo, the leading experimentation and feature flagging platform. Product managers at the world's best companies use Datadog, the same platform their engineers rely on every day to connect product insights to product issues like bugs, UX friction, and business impact. It starts with product analytics where PMs can watch replays, review funnels, dive into retention and explore their growth metrics. Where other tools stop, Datadog goes even further. It helps you actually diagnose the impact of funnel drop-offs and bugs and UX friction. Once you know where to focus, experiments prove what works.\n\n(00:03:56):\nI saw this firsthand when I was at Airbnb where our experimentation platform was critical for analyzing what worked and where things went wrong. And the same team that built experimentation at Airbnb built Eppo. Datadog then lets you go beyond the numbers with session replay. Watch exactly how users interact with heat maps and scroll maps to truly understand their behavior. And all of this is powered by feature flags that are tied to real-time data so that you can roll out safely, target precisely and learn continuously. Datadog is more than engineering metrics. It's where great product teams learn faster, fix smarter, and ship with confidence. Request a demo at datadoghq.com/lenny. That's datadoghq.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:43):\nMatt, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast. Thank you for having me. I want to start with something that I know is really important to you, something you talk a lot about that I don't think people hear enough on podcasts like this, which is that extraordinary results require extraordinary efforts. Talk about why this is so important, what you think people need to hear.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:05:04):\nThis is a term, that phrasing I actually attribute to a friend of mine, Dan Gill, who's the chief product officer at Carvana, which as a company also doesn't get enough credit for how much of a tech company it actually is. Super interesting. And I think as a general framework for me, and a lot of what I say with you today is not really specific to product in any way. We should actually talk about that. It's like the product function is an instantiation of the general concept of management. Being a chief product officer is not that different from being a chief whatever officer. You have to apply the same frameworks and concepts to get people to achieve goals together. But one thing that is absolutely universal that I think we, honestly, I think we forget it in Silicon Valley or a lot of people don't sort of internalize it, is that if you want to accomplish something truly extraordinary, if you want to be in the 99th percentile in terms of outcomes, it's going to be really difficult.\n\n(00:05:56):\nIt's going to be really uncomfortable. And you got to sort of remind people of that, that if they ever find themselves in the comfort zone at work, they are definitely making a mistake. They have definitely screwed up somehow. It's not that an extraordinary effort is sufficient to an extraordinary outcome, but it is 100% true that it is necessary. And so I do use that framework as a sort of guiding principle in my own leadership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:23):\nTo make this even more real for people, what are examples of moments that were extraordinarily hard?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:06:29):\nIt is not about any sort of grand single story. I think the story is actually told through a thousand little things. And so for me, the story is told through a thousand Jira tickets, not through a thousand grand events. The extraordinary effort thing is a reminder that it's supposed to be really fricking exhausting. It's supposed to be. So on Friday night, when you get hit with an escalation on Friday night, when you get sort of hit with a bunch of new bugs from someone in the engineering team that you've got a triage, those are the moments where great players and great teams are separated from good players and good teams. And it's so easy to say this at a company like Rippling because we're winning. As a company, for all of our foibles, and we should spend time today talking about where things are not perfect and not great, but the growth rate of the company on the revenue foundation that we have is extraordinary, really, really compelling.\n\n(00:07:33):\nAnd it gives you, as a leader, the air cover to get up in front of your team and say, \"Hey guys, I need the last ounce of oil that you've got left.\" And if your company's not growing very quickly, if things aren't that great, if your growth rate is 30% or 40%, it doesn't feel as good as a contributor in that business to lean in and give everything you've got on Friday or Saturday or Sunday because you don't know that it's going to yield much. And so extraordinary results, outcomes demand extraordinary efforts, but if there's no chance at an extraordinary outcome, it's very hard to get the extraordinary effort. And so I like to remind people at Rippling at least that it's so rare to have the opportunity to be able to be a part of a team where the extraordinary effort that you do put in on Friday or whatever, whenever it is actually contributing to an extraordinary result.\n\n(00:08:27):\nIt's a very special and rare thing, and it gives me a superpower as a leader because I can lean on that when I'm ringing the oil out of somebody who's in the bored and tired zone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:38):\nI saw the same thing actually at Airbnb with Brian Chesky. It always felt like things were going great and maybe we could take a break after something we shipped was killing it. And it always felt like the opposite. It always felt like, how do we press the gas pedal further? How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? There's never a moment to take a break.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:08:57):\nI spent seven years at Apple and learned under Steve Jobs when he was the CEO, learned what we called the death march, which is what we did to the engineers. It was like as soon as you shipped one version of the iPhone, you were just immediately thrown into the pit of building the next one and there was no break. It was just relentless and talk about an extraordinary outcome at the end of the day. There is no relief. In a competitive market, and if the market is valuable, it's competitive, no question. If you leave anything on the field, if you sort of leave a crack for your competitor, 100% chance they're going to go fill that crack. And so you have to be relentless. There can be no relaxation of the organization. It doesn't mean people can't come and go or people can't take vacations or live their lives, of course.\n\n(00:09:48):\nAnd it's not like people are human beings. You can't grind the individuals down, but the team as a collective group of people has to be sort of on the ball all the time. There can't be a break. And if you leave one, you're just begging for the slightly more hungry competitor to come in and eat your lunch. And that's the beauty of capitalism.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:12):\nAlso, very counterintuitively, and maybe the more optimistic perspective here is when you do give your team space to just twiddle their thumbs, bad things start to happen. Morale actually dips in my experience. People get distracted. They're like, \"Oh, what are we even doing? It's not interesting.\" I find that keeping people busy and motivated and fired up, even though you may think they'll be happier taking a many week break and slowing things down, I find they get more, the more I actually goes down in those moments.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:10:44):\nSo here's a management framework that I use fairly often. As an executive, you don't know how to get any decision exactly right. It's not knowable. You don't know how much budget to allocate. You don't know how many people to put on a project. You don't know how to set a deadline for when you're going to ship something. But of course, you have to set some default so you make your best guess and then you manage to that best guess and you learn as you go because in software development and in business in general, everything's emergent. These are not things that are knowable top down or a priority. And so you take a best guess and knowing that you're not going to get the right answer, you need to decide whether over-steering or under-steering relative to your perceived midpoint is better. And so let's talk about staffing. When you staff a project, is it better to overstaff or is it better to under-staff knowing that you can't get it right? Well, it's better to under-staff. If you overstaff, you get everything that you just said. You get politics, you get people working, I think most importantly on things that are further down the priority list than necessary. You have like 20 things on a stack rank list and you know that you got to do the top five, but the next 15 data's kind of ambiguous, but you've overstaffed the project. So the next 10 things down are getting worked on. Before you even know if they're necessary, that is poison. It's wasteful, it slows you down, it creates crust. And so it's very clear that under-staffing is less evil than over-staffing. In this particular framework, the advice is under-staff deliberately, always. And then the wisdom, the wisdom element is to know not to under-under-staff and sort of knowing the difference between those two things.\n\n(00:12:22):\nAnd so that's the way we work at Rippling. Everyone is constantly asking for more resources and of course where we can afford to and where it's appropriate new resources arrive, but it is really important to me that we feel that we've deliberately understaffed every project at the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):\nThere's a previous guest, I forget who this was. They used this metaphor if they want their team to be dehydrated to always be wanting more water. And then eventually they're too dehydrated and okay, we needed someone to help. Interesting. Yeah. There's a line along the lines of extraordinary efforts I want to make sure I read because I think this is really good. This may be a way to summarize what you're saying, that good teams get tired and that's when great teams kick the good team's asses.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:13:04):\nYes. This was a quote actually from Sunil, and he found it from a women's basketball team coach. And it is, to my point earlier about you got to run the engine at the red line at all times because the minute you let your guard down, the minute you slow down, the minute you relax, the minute you leave a crack for your competition, the great teams are going to come in and kick the good team's. And it's like sports, I'm not a very sporty guy, but sports analogies are sort of irresistible because at the end of the day, business is a game and none of this matters. We're not going to carry it to the grave. It's like you're here to do this stuff because it somehow fulfills you while you're on the planet. And I love the sport of business and I find that sports, notwithstanding the fact that I watched very little of it, that military, those are very ripe sources of parallel concepts to apply in leadership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:56):\nI find also those most intense, stressful, long nights are the moments you remember most and remember most fondly back to when you're building something. The key though is that it has to go well. As you said, if you are succeeding and winning, all of this is romantic in the end and nostalgic. Remember that time we built this thing and worked late nights and shipped this thing? If it doesn't go anywhere, you don't feel that. So I think that's a really important component of this is you need to be winning and succeeding.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:14:23):\nOne thing that I've learned from Parker, Parker's our CEO at Rippling, he said, \"You don't really learn from your mistakes, you learn from your successes.\" And it's like you do, of course, and he would admit you learn a bit from mistakes, but I do think that this is sort of feel good that it's like, \"Well, you didn't succeed, but at least you learned something.\" I've had failures. When I look back at the nine years I spent working on inkling from day one in 2009 until we sold that business to a private equity firm in 2018, up the curve of Silicon Valley coolness, back down the other side into obscurity. Of course, I learned and grew a ton during that time, but in now what I think is six or seven years, I'm trying to do the math, seven years coming up on at Rippling, I've learned so much more because I've seen success.\n\n(00:15:13):\nI've seen rapid, wild, crazy off the charts success of the business and it's more informative. There's more to glean from seeing how it's done right than there is to glean from seeing how it's done wrong. If I tell you you're going to get on an airplane and one maintenance technician has seen it done right a hundred times and the other maintenance technician has seen it done wrong a hundred times, but he learned from his mistakes, but still hasn't had any success himself. I mean, give me a break. There's not even a comparison which plane you're going to feel more comfortable on. And so I do think that learning from your mistakes thing is a bit of a feel good trope that actually has very little substance in reality. And it's why as an early career product manager, or it's why frankly at any stage of your career when you want to learn, you should join a winning team.\n\n(00:15:57):\nIt's cool to go and start a company at 22. Good luck to you. The odds are not in your favor, but the folks who, when I look at a resume and I see that someone's joined, they were at really good companies when those companies were super exciting and in crazy growth mode. I'm like, \"I instantly want to interview that candidate because I want to hear what they learned from being part of a winning team.\" And that's sort of one of my go to heuristics when I'm looking at candidate profiles and I think it's an under-told trope. Sorry, not an under-told trope. It's a piece of advice that I don't think people embrace enough in the valley that success begets success and you should chase success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:35):\nSpeaking of success and learning, you've been a long time COO at Rippling and the reason you're here recently you moved into CPO, chief product officer at Rippling, which is very exciting and very rare. I don't see a lot of COOs moving into product. Let me ask you why did you move into that role? I feel like you've been killing it at COO. Maybe that's the reason. Be careful what you're good at. And also just what are some surprises about this, about moving into product? Because a lot of people imagine what it's like and then you're actually doing it.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:17:08):\nThe story at Rippling is pretty interesting and I'll tell it because I think it explains why I'm making this transition, but this isn't really about me. I think it's sort of a pattern that your listeners would find useful. In general, your best executives are the ones that you can mostly toss into any challenge and they will bring order to chaos. They will fix the thing. And I do appreciate the terms that people have used at Rippling for me, talking about MacInnis's injured birds, where at any given moment some function is in disarray or in jeopardy and I go and focus very carefully on that function to get it back in order batting 800 maybe, like not always wild success, but I did that everywhere except R&D. I would think about helping out with components of the sales organization like our channel team, or I spent time building out the recruiting function a few times when it needed to be sort of rethought in response to our growth, but it never R&D.\n\n(00:18:23):\nAnd so I would have my feet up on the table looking out across the floor at this dumpster fire off in the distance, just sort of emitting smoke and wondering if someone was going to go in and deal with that. And the smoke takes various forms and when you're growing as quickly as rippling is growing, it's not always something that necessarily even impacts customers, but it's the sort of thing where you're like, that architecture's not right or they're not measuring adoption correctly.\" From the outside, I actually had quite a few criticisms that I could lob in. And what happened at Rippling was we made some hiring mistakes. I think the folks that we had in those roles would agree that they weren't the right people. We had a hiring mistake in engineering leadership where the product leader at the time had to sort of run engineering.\n\n(00:19:07):\nWe subsequently had a mistake in product hiring and a lot of us had to sort of pitch in. And Parker and I sort of stared at each other through two years of this kind of disarray or this chaos or this agony of things and just never really having good executive leadership over both engineering and product at the same time. And I remember Parker sort of slumped down in his seat and said, \"Oh, I have to run another search.\" And I said, \"No, the gig's up. I'm going to go do it.\" And he really sprung up in his seat. He's like, \"Really? You'll go do that?\" I'm like, \"Dude, this is what the business needs.\" And so that's what I did. And that really started about a year ago in sort of, I realized I was going to do it and expressed that to Parker in December. I really took it on in January of '25.\n\n(00:19:51):\nAnd so it's been 11 months of learning. Jumping into the product role when the product function itself, although staffed with really talented people, wildly under understaffed, and without a single spiritual leader on top of it to drive consistency and process excellence had become locally optimized but globally incoherent. And if you know Conway's law, you are destined to ship your org chart. And so with a locally optimized, globally incoherent team, you had a locally optimized, globally incoherent product experience that needed to be resolved. And so my efforts over the last 11 months have been to establish greater clarity in terms of how we do things around here, better process, better general leadership, hiring and firing. I mean, just doing the sort of cleanup on aisle three that needed to be done, even though, again, a lot of the people in the team were quite talented and doing an excellent job of managing their specific domains.\n\n(00:20:52):\nJumping into the product role has been quite eye-opening. I feel a little bashful about the naivety of my view from the outside a year ago. Product teams have a hierarchy of needs, and we like to point at the failures to meet elements of that hierarchy higher up the triangle and sort of impugn the failure of that organization for not, as an example, measuring adoption metrics very carefully and not closely tracking those metrics as a means by which to drive execution. When I jumped in, I was like, \"Man, we need to establish some basic standards for test coverage. We need to establish some basic standards for how we do what I call a factory inspection on a product once it's ready to roll off the assembly line.\" Do we have a checklist for what we call product quality and what does product quality mean? Those basic things weren't there. And so the idea that we should be spending time measuring adoption metrics is absolute insanity.\n\n(00:22:08):\nYou're skipping a lot of steps between here and there. And so we have made great strides and I think it's translating to product quality improvements for our customers, but I feel, as I said, a little dumb for the way I was thinking about it before I jumped into the deep end. There is just no excuse as an executive for sitting outside of the mess and thinking you know the answers. It's a cardinal sin as an executive to do that. You need to go and see. You'd be in the boiler room, you need to study the system, bottom up and develop hypotheses for how to amend the system. And that's what I've been doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):\nI love hearing this because so many people have teams that are not functioning incredibly well and hearing from someone that is not a longtime product person come in and try to fix these problems, I think is really useful and interesting for people to hear. To dig into this a little bit more, was the big lesson and kind of eye-opening moment that there's a lot of foundational work that needs to happen to achieve this outcome that you're trying to achieve, which is measure engagement and adoption well? Is it like tracking and metrics and data science? Is that kind of the lesson there?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:23:18):\nThe lesson is that everything must be done in its time and order, and you can move really, really quickly. There's no sort of excuse not to move with urgency on all of these things, but you got to do them in order and you have to lead bottom up. You got to lead from the specific circumstances you observe. And I think for me, one of the best things that's happened over the last 11 months is that I've gained a greater trust in my own instincts, that sort of patterns I've matched across other functions do indeed apply in product, but I have both the advantage and disadvantage of not having led a product function before and therefore must think about every problem from first principles. I have no choice. I can read shit on the internet. I can listen to clear thinkers on topics and import their ideas, but I'm very reluctant to import an idea without breaking it down into its constituent parts and figuring out how it applies at Rippling.\n\n(00:24:29):\nAnd so I don't actually give a shit about adoption metrics as a matter of principle. I care about adoption metrics when I care about adoption metrics. I realize that that's a total logical statement, but it's like I'll get there. And so in certain parts of our product, I really do care about adoption metrics. I care a lot about adoption metrics in our applicant tracking system, our recruiting product, because it's in a really good place from a usability standpoint, it's very well instrumented, it's got very happy users, it's got an awesome growth profile, and so we should still ...\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:25:00):\nIt's got an awesome growth profile. So we should be really focused on the adoption metrics because I think that's going to be an important ingredient to low churn over time, removing friction from the implementation process as an example.\n\n(00:25:13):\nThere are other parts of our product where I would say I don't care at all about adoption and am much more focused on foundational things like I said earlier, test coverage or whatever, just to make sure that the thing is stable and good and delivering exactly what it's supposed to deliver once it's adopted.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:28):\nNow that you're on the inside of the product team, what's something that you think people outside of product, say Matt two years ago or other, I don't know, go to market leads, other execs should hear, need to understand about product that they don't until they're on the inside?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:25:44):\nI'll give you another framework that I like to use. In the financial world, there's this concept of alpha. Alpha is outperformance relative to the index. So that's why you have seekingalpha.com as a very popular website. What they mean by that is you're looking to buy something, some combination of assets that will outperform, let's say the S&P 500, if that's your benchmark. So alpha is the outperformance relative to the index.\n\n(00:26:12):\nAnd then you have the concept of beta. Beta is just volatility. Beta's not good. A high beta stock jerks around for no particular reason. It's discorrelated with the index. It's very high beta. Great if you're an options trader, but other than that, it's not really something you want in an asset.\n\n(00:26:28):\nSo your ideal stock is a very high alpha, very low beta stock. They don't really come in that shape because alpha and beta tend to be correlated, but that's what you want when you buy a financial asset.\n\n(00:26:40):\nSo what's the analogy? I think you have high alpha people who are very valuable. I think you also have low beta people who are also very valuable people. Dennis Rodman, basketball player, nut job, very high alpha. And there's room on every team for one Dennis Rodman is a favorite of mine. It's like you can have one difficult employee who's got a ton of upside.\n\n(00:27:12):\nSo this alpha beta thing, I use it pretty often when contemplating what kind of person I want and also what kind of process I want. So when you're building a product from zero to one, you're probably pursuing alpha. You're looking for some angle on this market or this customer problem where the product is actually going to provide an outsized return relative to whatever the default solution is. When you have a more mature product or if you have somebody in the product operations group or whatever, you probably want a more low beta environment where it's like it cranks it out, it does it very reliably.\n\n(00:27:44):\nOur payroll product, we badly want the payroll product to be very low beta. We really don't want the payroll product to have any unpredictability or aberration, and so we're willing to accept more process.\n\n(00:27:55):\nAnd here's a fundamental principle of design in an organization, which is that processes, processes in a business exist for the sole purpose of lowering beta. Processes are for decreasing volatility in the output of the system. The downside of a process is that it suppresses alpha. And you have to be super, super careful and judicious in the application of process and the product team to know that you're lowering beta in the places where you want to do that without suppressing alpha in the places where you need it.\n\n(00:28:35):\nSo as we've gone through the last year of reforming the way that we build product at Rippling, it's been a game of recognizing those places where I need to implement a touch of process, just a touch. Other places where I need to implement a very clear, rigid process where I don't want alpha, I just want low beta. So examples of this are let's say our product quality list, which we lovingly at Rippling call the PQL.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:00):\nWhy PQL?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:29:01):\nYeah, so it's actually a really important thing. I think if you want to bring about cultural change in a team ... Look, we have 1,300 people in our R&D organization. It's a big ship that we have to steer. If you want to create a moment that sticks in people's brains and sort of becomes a zeitgeist or something that they latch onto, you got to create an entity, a vessel for meaning, and then you got to fill that vessel with your meaning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:23):\nA meme, you might say.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:29:24):\nYeah, well, sure, a meme. A meme is actually a good example of this in common culture. In pop culture. I think it's why, when people come to the table with ideas from the outside, I welcome those outside ideas. But the first thing I ask the person to do is to tell me what they mean without using those words. So when someone comes in and says, \"Hey, I want to do this thing on strategy.\" I'm like, \"Cool. Tell me what you mean without using the word strategy.\" And it forces them to break it down into its constituent parts. And if they can articulate it clearly without using that word, I know that they know what they're talking about. And if they just fumble around with the word strategy again, I'm like, \"Okay, you actually haven't thought this through.\"\n\n(00:30:01):\nSo with the PQL, with the product quality list, it's like I could come up with some generic term for this, but I really want a new joiner at the company to understand that this is an idiosyncratic thing to Rippling. This is unique to us. You want to understand this thing. I also want it to become a component of common parlance in the day-to-day work of the product management and engineering teams. So PQL, as cheeky or silly as it sounds, was deliberately sort of angular or stood out as a vessel I could fill with a particular meaning, and so we have a product quality list.\n\n(00:30:32):\nAnd the product quality list is lightweight in the sense that it just articulates in the simplest ways the standards we want you to meet when you ship a product. It doesn't apply to every product, not every line applies to every product, but it's comprehensive and it provides me with a framework for iterating over time as we learn.\n\n(00:30:50):\nSo just yesterday, we shipped the product to Parker. This is part of our process. When we ship a new product, it goes to Parker, who is the big admin for Rippling at Rippling. If you're not aware, Parker is the sole payroll administrator for Rippling for all 5,200 employees. He personally runs payroll always, there is no exception, for all 5,200 people. He does complain about it sometimes, but it's a remarkable achievement for the software and perhaps for him. So he also installs any new app that we're going to install for ourselves because we dog food the hell out of everything we build.\n\n(00:31:22):\nYesterday, he goes to install this new application. We're about to ship a new app for feedback, allowing people to give one another feedback on their companies. And he installs it and he goes in and it dumps them onto an empty screen. And he's like, \"What the fuck is this? What is this? What's going on? Hey, wow, talk about fail.\" So I chop another one of my fingers off, I'm down to nine. And I'm like, \"Well, what did we miss?\"\n\n(00:31:48):\nWhat we missed was there was a fucking feature flag, a fucking feature flag. And I'm not allowed to say feature flag without fucking in front of it because feature flags are the bane of my existence and the worst things in the world that constantly cause problems. Engineers put one in temporarily and forget about it. It's like shims if you're building a house and the general contractor puts little shims in places and then forgets that they put the shims there and then builds a wall over them and eventually the shim fails and all of a sudden your door doesn't fit. Feature flags are super dangerous and need to be managed carefully, so fucking feature flags.\n\n(00:32:18):\nAnyway, we had one. Parker installs it, they forgot to disable the feature flag. He gets a blank screen when he installs the application. What did I do? My reaction was, \"Ugh.\" Go back to the team, give them direct feedback, tell them not to make that mistake again. But also ask the question, \"How do we miss this in the factory inspection process?\"\n\n(00:32:37):\nAnd the answer is we didn't have any line item in the PQL for feature flags. So I added a line to the fucking PQL that said, \"You are allowed to have one feature flag that governs your entire product at ship.\" It's an extreme standard that might not be achievable, but it's the standard we aspire to.\n\n(00:32:59):\nThis framework, the PQL, given these lightweight checklists, iterated on consistently in response to everything we learn as we go, constitutes a very nice lightweight way to lower the beta of the system with hopefully only a modicum of negative impact on the alpha for how we build product.\n\n(00:33:22):\nYou asked me a very simple question, I gave you a very long-winded answer, but these frameworks help me design systems that scale across one going to 2,000 technical workers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):\nWow. Okay. By the way, PQL, is that like an acronym or it's just like, I like this word we're going to call it PQL?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:33:40):\nProduct quality list.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):\nOkay, I see. So it's the [inaudible 00:33:44]. Okay.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:33:46):\nPQL, which how could you pronounce it other than pickle?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:49):\nI'm imagining all your decks have little PQL emojis and the-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:33:53):\nThe pickle emoji thing, the dancing pickle in Slack, there's a lot of-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:56):\n[inaudible 00:33:56].\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:33:56):\nYeah. It lends itself to a bit of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:58):\nWhat I think about is pickle Rick. Do you get that reference?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:34:02):\nThis is a Rorschach test.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:04):\nOkay. So this high alpha, low beta, I love this concept. So the idea is depending on the team, depending on the problem, we need a high alpha, low beta person or actually okay with a lot of variants for this specific project that's actually [inaudible 00:34:16]-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:34:16):\nYeah, we're willing to accept a bunch of volatility in this area in exchange for the upside we get from the creativity and risk taking of these people or the lack of process that sort of gives them the latitude to do what they want to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:26):\nSo when you're hiring, you're looking for, again, is this person low beta or not? That's going to [inaudible 00:34:30]-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:34:30):\nFor sure. It's really quite a useful way. You know when you meet a candidate and you ... My modus operandi, and I think with talk about hiring for a second, I think I've spent a lot of time with teams at Rippling talking about how I hire. And it is born of batting practice. It'd be super interesting to actually be able to rewind the tape on my life and sort of contemplate how many candidates I've met in every context. Many thousands, maybe tens of thousands, I don't know. It's a lot of batting practice and a lot of model training in my brain.\n\n(00:35:06):\nSo I rely a lot of my intuition, which of course HR people say you're not supposed to do. That's complete bullshit. If you have a good intuition, you should absolutely rely on your intuition.\n\n(00:35:15):\nAnd what you have to do after you have a reaction to a candidate when you're looking at hiring somebody is you need to decode your intuition so that it can be expressed to other people productively. So one of the frameworks that I use for this is SPOTAC. It's a very ugly acronym. There's a hat tip to somebody out there in the universe who originally thought of this. It's not me, but I adopted it. And it's that people are smart, passionate, optimistic, tenacious, adaptable, and kind. Those five things. Six, can't even count. I told you I lost a finger when I made a mistake, so I was down one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:54):\nNine to go.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:35:54):\nSPOTAC isn't by itself a good top down framework, but when you're thinking about, \"Oh, why did this candidate just ... Why did it not click? Why did I not like them?\" You go down the list, you're like, \"Oh, yeah, no, this person, it's that they were not excited about the idea. They weren't passionate.\" It's that they talked shit about their previous manager and that they were a victim of the performance of their last two companies. That's what it was, they're not optimistic.\n\n(00:36:24):\nThe framework is super useful to evaluating people. And I think the alpha beta framework is also super useful when you come away from a conversation and you're like, \"I like that guy. I think he'd be really, really good. Why is it that I don't think he would do a good job on this product in particular?\" And the answer is like, \"This is a high alpha product area and he's a low beta person.\" Valuable, but definitely not the right fit for this. So I think it's really useful in that context as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:48):\nI love all these frameworks. You're speaking to this audience, framework to frameworks, frameworks.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:36:52):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:53):\nSo high alpha, low beta, sometimes high beta is okay, SPOTAC. In hiring, is there anything else that you find really useful? Before we move on to a different topic.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:37:03):\nWhen I first started working in the product organization, I was introduced to an interview framework or an interview tactic that I hadn't really used much at all, I think in my career, which is that every product person at every seniority level is given the same case study. And the case study is extraordinarily difficult. It requires you to think about many, many dimensions simultaneously, to think about data propagation issues. It gets quite technical.\n\n(00:37:37):\nAnd the rubric that we use to sort of evaluate performance of that case study is it gives you guidance on what for us, like an entry level PM looks like, what a junior, mid-career, senior executive PM might look like. And everybody comes away from that interview feeling like poop, like they had failed it. Whereas on our side of it, we're like, \"Wow, that person got really far.\" They saw around three or four corners in a really impressive way. There was 10 they didn't see around, but they saw around four of the hardest ones. And they were not defensive when we gave them new information that called into question the validity of their solution. And they were willing to interrupt us to ask more questions,\" and and and, like a lot of the sort of basic human interaction models.\n\n(00:38:25):\nYou never think that giving someone an impossible task and even including the L5 person versus the VP on the same thing would be productive. And let's just say our recruiting team still sort of kvetches a bit about this and feels like we eliminate people too aggressively at this stage of the interview process. But I've found the wisdom in it and think it's actually quite useful to give everyone the same simple, complicated prompt and just see. Hand them a drill bit, give them the concrete wall and see if they can get a millimeter or an inch into the concrete. They're never going to get all the way through the wall. It doesn't matter. You're going to learn a lot. And I've found that to be kind of an eye-opening new thing for me that has been fun.\n\n(00:39:04):\nLook, the joy of product and the joy of product management and the joy of being part of product, I think there's a bunch of joys actually, if I could give you a sort of running list, but one of the big joys is that you get to work with some of the smartest people in software. Engineers are very smart. They're not always the best sort of social entities. Salespeople are awesome social entities. They're not always the best systems thinkers. You go down the list.\n\n(00:39:28):\nBut the magic of product management is that you kind of have to ... We talk about the mini CEO. I think it's kind of a stupid misnomer, but there's some wisdom there. And I think the wisdom is that you have to be a polymath. You've got to be really good at working with other people. You got to be good at communications and articulation. You got to be good at project management. You got to be good at the science and the math and the engineering. And it's really fucking cool. So I think one of the great joys of this job for me has been interacting with the tippity top of the smartest and most polymathic people in the industry.\n\n(00:40:01):\nI'll say one other thing about what I love about leading product, which is as a COO, my job was to accept the product as it was and optimize everything around that. My job was to make sure that the product operations, in our business, the interface to the insurance carriers, the interface to the payment entities, the government regulators, that stuff all just sort of worked. It was to make sure that our sales engine, our marketing engine, all the go to-market stuff optimized itself around what the product was. It was about recruiting and making sure we got people in to work on the product. You kind of go down any function that isn't in R&D, and I had some hand in trying to figure out how to make that function work to the best of its ability, given what the product was.\n\n(00:40:48):\nAnd now that I lead product, I'm like, \"Oh, wow. This is the high order bit.\" Not that I didn't sort of understand that, but now I really get that product is the high order bit. If you get the product right, it fits in the market, everything else gets easier. Finance is easier, sales is easier, marketing is easier, recruiting is easier, everything gets fucking easier. So I think the other joy of leading the product function is that I get to set the highest order bit in the business's success to one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:22):\nThis is really great to hear. A lot of times people outside product don't understand these sorts of things and look down on product a lot of times, especially sales folks, COOs a lot of times. I love that you're seeing this and realizing this and recognizing just how important and interesting and challenging this work is and just how awesome PMs are. As you know, a lot of people are a very anti-product manager. \"Why do we need product managers? We don't need them. Slow everything down, all this process.\"\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:41:51):\nYeah. I have a distinction there, which is that I'm anti-shitty product managers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:53):\nThat's exactly how I put it. If you hate product managers, you just haven't worked with a great product manager.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:41:58):\nWell, it's like, look, I love wine, wine's one of my things. And I've learned a lot about wine. And one of my favorite lines is like, \"I don't like Chardonnay.\" And I'm like, \"No, no, no, no, no. Chardonnay's are the most fucking amazing varieties of wine in the world. You just haven't had good Chardonnay. And there's a Chardonnay out there for you.\" Product management, it's like you don't like product management, you think product managers suck. It's like, well, you just haven't had a good Chardonnay yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:22):\nThat's exactly what I [inaudible 00:42:24]-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:42:24):\nOnce you have one, you can't unlearn it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:26):\nYou're like, \"Let's find that PM ASAP.\"\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:42:30):\nNo, let's find that Chardonnay ASAP.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\n[inaudible 00:42:34] with some Chardonnay. You touched on this product market fit point, and I want to double down on this thread. You've had a couple really interesting experiences of struggling to find product market fit with your own startup. You said you worked on it for nine years, you said?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:42:47):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):\nOkay. And then with Rippling, complete opposite, extreme product market fit, up and to the right. What's something you've learned about just that that you think people maybe don't understand about what it feels like, what it takes to get to product market fit, how things change?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:42:59):\nThere's a line that this venture capitalist, whose name I will not mention, said, which was that product market fit is a sort of thing where you absolutely know it when you see it, and therefore if you don't absolutely know it, you don't have it.\n\n(00:43:17):\nAnd this kind of gets back to my point about learning from mistakes versus successes. It's like, ah, man, over and over again, over the course of the many years that I spent at Inkling, we thought we had it. We thought we had product market fit, maybe, maybe. And in hindsight, with the benefit of now having experienced solid product market fit, it was so, so obvious that we didn't.\n\n(00:43:45):\nAnd I've invested in like 60 companies or 70 companies. I don't know, it's not something I actively do. But opportunities, by virtue, I think, of my role at Rippling, sort of show up. And I talk to lots of entrepreneurs and I love it and I find it super stimulating and I love the fresh ideas and it's just something I do as a real cherry on top of the sport that I play already. But when I get the investor updates for the guys who've been at it for like three, four years and I read the updates from them that I sent to my investors in 2011 and 2012, I'm kind of heartbroken.\n\n(00:44:29):\nWe talk in Silicon Valley about never quit, but that is complete absolute venture capital bullshit. The incentive of venture capitalist is to put money into your company and milk you dry. They never get their money back. There is no way for them to take that investment back. So the only logical desire that they would have is for you to keep trying against all odds because there is the occasional example where someone pivoted from A to X and it was wildly different and it worked. Slack was originally some sort of a gaming company and became corporate chat. Airbnb maybe. It's like there's some examples of companies having made wild pivots and succeeded, but man, is that rare. Just so exceedingly rare.\n\n(00:45:21):\nAnd I think it's important to remember, I'm 45 years old, we're going to be on the planet, the average age of a man in the United States when he dies is something in the mid 70s. I got 20, 30, maybe if I'm lucky, 40 years left on the planet. Very conscious of the time that I have. And I don't regret what I did at Inkling, I learned a lot. It informed what I do now. I don't think the chapter I'm in right now could have come without the chapters before it. So it's a beautiful, wonderful thing that I did what I did. But when I read the investor update and I'm like, \"You're where I was and you are not getting out of this.\"\n\n(00:45:56):\nThe Silicon Valley try until you die mindset is not pro-entrepreneur, it's pro-venture capitalist. And I know why that is, but I think it's important to say out loud that you should fucking quit. You should reset the clock, you should reset the cap table because trust me, product market fit when it arrives is insane and it's exciting and you should pursue it. And never delude yourself into believing you have it when you don't. It is dangerous and regrettable. How's that for a speech?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:33):\nBeautiful. The anti-VC speech. The-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:46:38):\nI got more where that came from. By the way, it's not anti-VC. It's anti-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):\nVC propaganda.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:46:45):\nEverybody's acting in accordance with their incentives in Silicon Valley, the executives, the founders, the venture ... Everybody's, of course, behaving in accordance with their incentives. And the venture capitalists have very strong enduring incentives that have shaped the dynamic of how Silicon Valley works. There's nothing wrong with that. It's just really, really important to point them out and scream at them for the 25-year-old entrepreneur who has no fucking clue how this stuff works.\n\n(00:47:12):\nTrust me, the 45-year-old entrepreneur or the 50-year-old venture capitalist who've been in the game for a while, they get it. They've observed it. They know what it's like. The system is there to take advantage of the people who don't, or at least it is the easiest prey for the incentive structures, not for venture capitalists as individual people who are beautiful and all of them are just really wonderful people. It's just that the incentive structures lead to some real harm, I think, in certain cases.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:37):\nAnd the thing I find is when you do quit, VCs ... I'm always just like, \"Hey, let me know when you're starting your next thing. I'm excited to invest.\" They're rarely, unless they're not a great VC, rarely are they just pissed at you for how could you possibly not make this work [inaudible 00:47:52].\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:47:52):\nThat's the thing, as a founder, when it's time to throw in the towel on your business and you're so obsessed with giving money back to the cap table, I always remind the entrepreneur like, \"Hey, if you're in the seed investing game, your forecast is zero. Your assumption on every investment is that it's going to go to zero.\" Any seed investor who doesn't take that stance is off their rocker anyway. They're a very bad investor. Seek investors who play the long game, who want to be in your second and third company and are willing to take a bet on the first one and let it go to zero so that you can get on with stuff. This is like, I've had that conversation many times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by GoFundMe Giving Funds, the zero-fee donor-advised fund. I want to tell you about a new DAF product that GoFundMe just launched that makes year-end giving easy. GoFundMe Giving Funds is the DAF or donor-advised fund supported by the world's number one giving platform and trusted by over 200 million people. It's basically your own mini foundation, without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or appreciated assets like stocks, get the tax deduction right away, potentially reduce capital gains, and then decide later where you want to donate. There are zero admin or asset fees, and you can lock in your deductions now and decide where to give later, which is perfect for year-end giving. Join the GoFundMe community of over 200 million people and start saving money on your tax bill, all while helping the causes that you care about most. Start your giving fund today at gofundme.com/lenny. If you transfer your existing DAF over, they'll even cover the DAF pay fees. That's gofundme.com/lenny to get started. This begs the question of just when is it time to quit? If people hearing this might be like, \"Oh man,\" what are some signs that, okay, it's time to wrap it up?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:49:38):\nHere, look, history provides us with a clear guide. When you look at companies having hit it big, they hit big pretty quick. It's very, very dangerous to be late to the party, it's very, very dangerous to be early to the party, and the vast majority of the time, that's the problem. Rippling, had it been started in 2014, would not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what-\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:50:00):\n...Not be what it is today. I think Rippling, had it been started today, would not be what it is five years from now today, and so I think timing is a lot and it's very hard to control for, but when you get the timing right and the market is real and the product works, product market fit, like I said earlier, it's super clear, and so if I were to pick a number out of a hat just from my lived experience, I think it's very important, one aside, don't ask people for advice, ask people for relevant experience. If you ask them for advice, they will always give it, but if you ask them for relevant experience, they rarely have any to offer, and if they don't have any to offer, then don't ask for their advice.\n\n(00:50:41):\nSo ask people for relevant experience, and I try to do this with my own entrepreneurs when I work with them, it's like, let me offer you whatever relevant experience I have, and my relevant experience on this topic of when to quit is like, I think we could have called it after the second or third pivot, which was somewhere around year four. It is of course very important to believe in what you're building and to be persistent, but there is definitely no shame in saying, \"Look, we've pivoted once or twice. It's not catching. I got to go do the next thing,\" and I think if you're year four, year five in your entrepreneurship journey, and it's not just obviously a screaming rip-roaring growth story, it's extraordinarily difficult. This is so extremely rare. So beyond even already the rare scores you're going to face from the outset that now is going to convert to something crazy. So that's hard to hear, I guess, but man, it can be really liberating when you're like, \"Fuck it, I'm going to do this. I have the energy. I'm going to do it again. I'm just going to do it with a clean sheet.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:48):\nThat is really helpful. You have this really fun way of describing product market fit around receptors and drugs.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:51:54):\nOh yeah. Yeah. I think this is a really fundamentally misunderstood dynamic. When founders message me and they're like, \"Hey, like my LinkedIn post and my tweet for this launch,\" I do it. I retweet it, I like it, whatever. Nobody follows my Twitter anyways, it doesn't matter, but I do that, but I think to myself, this is not what this is about. This is not how great companies are built. It can be a nucleating event, but it's not a major thing, because nobody cares about your company. Your launch doesn't matter. Big, fat, pull the slingshot back, launches amount to the teeniest thimble of water in the ocean of noise about startups and companies, and so you just got to build it brick by brick bottom up, and these launches don't really amount to much, and so how do you think about that? How do you think about the insignificance of your launch or you think about all the effort you're putting into building a product that you believe is going to have product market fit?\n\n(00:52:56):\nWell, if you recognize that the market is immutable, no amount of tweeting, LinkedIn posting, advertising is going to change whether the market wants your product. It might raise awareness about your product, but it's not going to change whether somebody wants it. Then you take a different mindset. You have to view your startup as running an experiment in the universe to see what you get in return for that, and this analogy of drug discovery and binding receptors is like nobody at Genentech thinks they can market their way to better performance inside your body. The binding receptors for that drug, they exist or they don't, and when they build their product, their goal is to find out whether the binding receptors exist, but fate already has decided the outcome. This is absolutely true of every software product you build. Fate has already decided the outcome. The market's either going to latch onto your product and run with it or it's not. Do not ship the product, find a lack of success, and then try to market your way through that, because the binding receptors likely don't exist, and for me, it was a very liberating mindset, because now I just have to find the right drug, and I can forget trying to convince the body to develop the binding receptors for whatever it is that I'm building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:13):\nWhat I love about your advice here is you were an early investor in Notion, which is one of the classic stories of it took them... I think it was four years to get to something. They moved to Japan, they worked on the whole thing, and so is [inaudible 00:54:24] from there? Is that a rare example where it actually worked? And that's not an example to be inspired by, because it's extremely, extremely rare. Let's talk about alpha beta again.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:54:32):\nOkay. As an investor, you might build a checklist of things you want to make sure are true or false about a company and hope that that's going to yield the kind of investment success you're looking for. Does it have this kind of founder? Is it a C Corp in Delaware? Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and these checklists are all about what? They're all about suppressing beta. They're about avoiding avoidable mistakes. They're about bringing stability. Jeff Lewis is an investor who has many angular views on things, and I think one of his most enduring phrases is narrative violations. This idea that the common wisdom must be violated in some way by every company that has an outsized success. It is absolutely true, and when I give these general observations on the patterns in Silicon Valley, the most successful businesses inevitably violate something on that list in some really important way.\n\n(00:55:37):\nSo Notion, you can't replicate Notion's success as an entrepreneur. You can't replicate it because you're not Ivan. You can't replicate it because you're not Notion. You can't replicate it because it's not 2010 when they started the company. Do the math on that. Or 2011, actually. These guys stuck with it. They went through hell. They pivoted. They went to Japan and sat in kimonos and meditated on what they were going to build, and by hook/crook, they got to where they are today as a really wildly successful business in an extraordinarily difficult market where building businesses is virtually impossible in productivity. It is dominated by Google and Microsoft. Carving out your own niche in that market is just unthinkable, and so I look at Notion as having succeeded by virtue of the narrative violation of persistence, I don't think is a good idea for very many people that happen to work for them, and I look at it as being a function of the founding team and their specific idiosyncrasies, the absolute insistence on craftsmanship from Ivan. This is him. That's his thing.\n\n(00:56:55):\nThe takeaway lesson is not give up or don't give up. The takeaway lesson is certainly not go do what Notion did. The takeaway lesson is that every company succeeds on the foundations of the idiosyncrasies of the founder. The idiosyncrasies of the founder. Rippling succeeds for almost the polar opposite reasons that Notion succeeds, but in both cases, the companies succeed on the idiosyncrasies of the founder, and so embracing that, recognizing those idiosyncrasies, that's what great investors do. They spot that element of spikiness and greatness in a candidate investment, and they convert that to a commitment, and then of course the investor or the good ones accept what they get in exchange from that for the universe, from the universe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:44):\nI love that we went in this direction. I wasn't planning to talk about your investing career. Just to give people a reason to listen to this and maybe rewind, and I want to ask another question around investing. What are some other companies you invested in early?\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:57:55):\nFirst of all, okay, so I sort of hate the question. What are some other companies you've invested in? It's a fair question, but the problem is I'm going to give you a bunch of companies I've invested in that won, that are really notable. So what I would like to do instead of answering that question ... Here, let me give you some bait. I was one of the first investors in Notion. I was perhaps the first, I don't know, ask Ivan. Clever, which had a great exit. I was one of the first investors in Zenefits, if you've heard of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:26):\nHeard of it.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:58:27):\nI was, before I joined, one of the first investors in Rippling, and then more recently invested in ... Here's a funny one. I was one of the first investors in Deal, if you've heard of them.\n\n(00:58:43):\nI was able to exit that position, and then hopefully that company's going to zero with their criminal behavior, but whatever, but more recently, if you know Decagon, which is doing some really cool stuff on the AI front.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nKilling it.\n\nMatt MacInnis (00:59:00):\nI'm in laying chain. Great. So those are some companies that you maybe have heard of, but how about I invested in Macro. Founder was Derek Lee. Macro's out of business. I invested in Debrief, Ned Rockson. It's out of business. I invested in Verb Data with David Hertz out of business. I'm reading from a list. I invested in... What's the number? 70 companies according to this list where I track things and most of them went to zero and all those founders were awesome, all those founders were kick, and all those founders put a ton of energy into building their businesses, and they went to zero and they're enduring relationships.\n\n(00:59:37):\nI can call on any of those people, I think, maybe with the exception of Deal, and call in a favor and have... and I've got a few subsequent... and actually a lot of them joined Rippling, believe it or not. So I don't know. Companies I've invested in is a long list, and I love to give you names of companies that don't exist anymore because it's self-serving and a horrible survivorship bias to just list the good ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:00):\nI love that answer. I think you're being modest in the context of your hit rate is clearly very high. Even one or two incredibly successful companies out of 70 is a win in VC, and so you're doing very well, but I think that's a really important perspective. When you see people's logos on their websites of all the companies they've invested in, you have no idea how many hit bats they've had.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:00:22):\nI think it's good practice to ask people to give you the full list. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:24):\nWhat are your favorite failures that you've invested in?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:00:29):\nOh, no. I'm not actually... Okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):\nWell, obviously, no, we don't need spend time on it, but I think it's actually a really good question, but yeah, what are some of your best failed investments? Show me the logos of the companies that didn't work out.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:00:39):\nIt's a juicy question. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):\nThere's a topic around this area that I wanted to spend time on, and I haven't heard anyone think of things this way, which is this idea you talk about of compounding plus power law plus entropy and how that's a really useful frame to think about business.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:00:58):\nSo you kicked this conversation off sort of invoking the extraordinary outcomes, demand, extraordinary efforts line, hat tip to Dan Gill, and these are part and parcel. Man, understanding the nature of the universe is a pretty good way to work within it, and so power law distributions happen everywhere. It explains why so few people control so much wealth. It explains why Steph Curry is just so vastly better than the next guy down on the list on the basketball team. It explains why populations are concentrated into a relatively small number of mega cities in the world. It's like, power law distribution just plays out everywhere, and once you see it, you can't unsee it. It sort of plays out in many dynamics.\n\n(01:01:47):\nPeople tend to think that the world plays on a more linear relationship where the X and Y axis are sort of Y equals X, but that is absolutely not the case, and the implications are profound. It's like if you build something to 80 or 90%, the Y axis is barely budged yet. You haven't hit the inflection point in terms of reward, and so the implication of the power law more broadly is that people who are in the top 10%, the top 5%, don't just get 10 or 20% more reward. They get 10X the reward or 100X the reward. It's really dramatic.\n\n(01:02:20):\nEntropy, the second law of thermodynamics is a very simple concept. It's the reason your sock drawer becomes messy. It's the reason that potholes form. It's the reason we have to put so much energy into maintaining the aircraft we fly to keep them safe because they really, really, really want to fall apart, and that's the nature of things. If you abandon a city for a few months, it starts to go fallow, and so entropy is just this concept that shit tends toward disorder.\n\n(01:02:48):\nThe universe, I mean, life itself is a temporary victory against entropy. You and I should not exist. The sun gives energy to the planet. It organizes stuff that we can eat and we fight entropy until we lose the battle somewhere, as I said earlier at the age of 70 or 80, if we're lucky. What does this have to do with product? This is really about effort.\n\n(01:03:17):\nThe only antidote to entropy, the only antidote to decay in a system is energy. You got to inject energy. So if you have a code base, every line of code that you add to that code base increases the entropy of that system and demands ever more energy from human beings to go and intend to it to make sure it doesn't break, and if you want to achieve greatness, if you want an extraordinary outcome, and in particular, if you want to be in the top 10%, top 5% on the X axis so that the Y axis is through the roof, then you have to relentlessly inject energy at every single step of the game. Teams will, sadly, but because we are all human, teams will always optimize for local comfort over company outcomes.\n\n(01:04:11):\nNot because they get together and think, \"We should do that,\" although unions do do that unequivocally, deliberately, but even in a collection of product managers or engineers, what's going to happen over time is entropy is going to creep in and people are going to optimize for local comfort. Your job as an executive, as a leader, is to fight that entropy tooth and nail every single day. It means that every time you see a bug, every time you see a bug, not most of the time, every time you go and you drop it at the feet of the product manager or the engineering manager, every time, in public, preferably, it means that every time someone comes to you to hire someone and says that they have skipped the back channel, every time you're like, \"You can't hire this person unless you do the back channel,\" it means that when you get into the board and tired zone on any process, that you as the executive have got to demand the 99th percentile of energy, because otherwise entropy creeps in and the system decays. You have to do this.\n\n(01:05:19):\nOne of the messages that I delivered recently at our big executive big... Like our top 75 manager offsite that we do roughly every 18 months, was a reminder that if the purest form of ambition and the purest and most intense source of energy in the business is the founder CEO, that every next concentric circle of management beyond the founder CEO has the potential to be an order of magnitude drop off in intensity, and that is dangerous because if you go to two layers and it's two orders of magnitude drop off and signal and intensity, that is a very dysfunctional organization. So what I say to the team was, it's not that you need to buffer people from the intensity of the CEO, it's that you need to absolutely mirror that intensity.\n\n(01:06:13):\nThere are plenty of constituents in the business around you who will advocate for relaxing. There is an infinite supply of people under you who will buffer other team members from the intensity of the demands. Your job is not to be one of those buffers. Your job is to preserve that intensity at its highest possible level and let the buffering happen somewhere else, and that's the point is that entropy creeps into the system insidiously and slowly over time off your radar and you have to maintain that intensity every minute of every day to try and fight it if you want to stay at the extreme right end of the power law that obviously governs the outcome of everything that we build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):\nWhat does that look like to pass along that intensity? What does that feel like? What does that look like? So say Parker comes to you, \"This bug sucks. I got this broken screen.\" You cut off your finger. Maybe that's the example.\n\n(01:07:18):\nOkay. Still got them. I got all 10.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:07:21):\nI'll give you concrete examples. Actually, the joke that I sort of played on this one when I presented to the team was that the next sort of slide in my presentation was with the sound effect, the Slack huddle thing, and Parker's icon in Slack is just, he uses the generic yellow...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:42):\nThe egg?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:07:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:43):\nOh, wow.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:07:46):\nIt's funny, and so everybody knows the yellow egg is Parker, and so the next slide in the presentation was boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, which is the sound that Slack makes when someone calls you, and it was Parker Conrad is inviting you to a huddle, and then the next slide was Parker Conrad is modeling personal intensity, and the idea is that if you know, you know, if you've ever been dragged into an... \"I want to talk about this fucking problem right now and whatever you're doing, unless it's an interview, I want you to come and have a conversation with me.\"\n\n(01:08:13):\nThat intensity is one place where it plays out. Every product team at Rippling, and we have a lot of them now, have public feedback channels. I am in there upside down on everything I find when I use those products, and I just model for everybody that this is how at least I want to do it, which is, \"I don't like this. I don't understand this. Tell me why this is this way.\" Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, and people jump in and respond. The factory inspection process that I mentioned, which is where at the end of the assembly line, I jump out with the pickle and we talk about all of the elements. You have to record a loom of every major flow through the product. I personally review every one of those flows, I got a backlog I got to catch up on today and provide feedback to people always in a public channel so that every other product manager and engineering manager can jump in and see how the process has worked for other teams.\n\n(01:09:01):\nIt's about modeling the intensity publicly so that other people can say, \"Okay, this is how we do things around here,\" and it gives the reaction from the team that received the message that you have to inject that energy every minute of every day and that there are no exceptions, was not like, \"Ooh, that's exhausting.\" The reaction is, \"Oh, that is so invigorating.\" It's so wonderful to hear that we're going to achieve these great outcomes, or at least we have a shot at doing so, and that you're empowering me to follow my instinct, which is to really push for the best result.\n\n(01:09:39):\nThe reaction universally is like, \"Ugh, what a relief that I get to go be intense,\" because nobody in a position of leadership wants to be chill, and what's worse than a chill boss? No, don't work for a chill boss. Don't be a chill boss. It's the most pejorative label I could give you. Chill boss or chill PM. Don't be chill. Chill doesn't accomplish shit. Be intense. Be good, be respectful, be intense. Don't be chill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):\nAgain, this advice comes from where we started, which is this is what success looks like, because somebody that is less chill than you is going to find that crack and come after your market. Is that the gist?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:10:21):\nFor sure. I mean, again, if you're chill and you move the X axis down 10 or 20 points, the Y axis collapses. It doesn't just drop 10 or 20%. The Y axis collapses, and this is just kind of true in everything we do. So yeah, if you want to win, you should probably try.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:45):\nThis is what I always say to people trying to build lifestyle businesses. There's always this idea, \"I'm going to build a side business, I'm going to make recurring income, it's going to be amazing,\" and in my experience, anytime there's a market or something shows up that's juicy and there's ways to make money, somebody's going to come at you and work harder, raise more money, and there's only so long you can maintain that.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:11:04):\nWell, man, there's a whole other podcast episode on the concept of leverage. If you sell your time, you've only got 24 hours a day to give, but if you can create a product that scales, the marginal cost of a unit of that product is zero like software, it's going to be competitive, man. Sell your time, it's not going to be super competitive, but achieve that level of leverage and it's a pretty efficient market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):\nTo close out this thread of intensity and adding energy to everything, something I've heard about you is you're big on escalating. You're a big fan of escalating issues, and also you always tell people to never not give you negative feedback, to always share feedback to not hide anything. Tell me about those two.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:11:49):\nFundamentally, the most selfish thing you can do is withhold feedback from someone. Who are you optimizing for when you do that? What are you optimizing for when you think a thought that would help someone improve and you avoid giving it to them because it would make you uncomfortable? Well, you're optimizing for your own comfort and it's fundamentally selfish. It's the most selfish thing you could possibly do, is withhold feedback that would otherwise be useful to someone because you don't want to be uncomfortable. Well, that's not how high performance teams operate. So I demand feedback, and I give it, and it doesn't mean that when I give feedback, it's not open to being questioned or discussed. I mean, of course it is, but when I observe something, I try to say it. That's the feedback topic.\n\n(01:12:35):\nThe part of this that has been interesting to me is that people withhold, escalate, the customers withhold. Customers don't want to escalate to me as an executive. Even the founders in whose businesses I've invested who use Rippling are reluctant to hit me up when something goes wrong because they don't want to bother me, but it's literally my job, literally my job to find things, problems, and make them better, and by virtue of making those specific things better, to iterate on the processes so that the system that builds the system can get better.\n\n(01:13:09):\nThere's no greater gift to me as a product executive than receiving an escalation from a customer. We have an escalations team at Rippling, which sounds weird, but it's people who are just particularly skilled at pistol whipping other people in the company to get to real root causes, real root causes. Not like throw away the word root cause, like, \"Oh, we fixed the data error and shut the ticket down.\" No, you went and you found the software that created the data error, and then you found the system that created the software that created the data error, and you solved all of that back to the top.\n\n(01:13:44):\nEscalation seems extremely good at that at Rippling. So we have sort of a dedicated little team that does this for us. Escalations are a gift, and it's like, if you're a listener right now on this podcast and you are a Rippling customer and you have shit that you think we should know, the fact that I might already know it is not a reason for you to withhold the gift of your feedback. So it's an attitude that I take to this every day. I've got a little cue of some stuff that I've... Minor things that are from the last couple of days from people who had some knits and issues that I'm just like, I've got them queued up on my to do list today and I'm going to take them to the product teams directly and be like, \"I'd like to understand what happened here.\" Not in a negative way. I just think we'll all get better if we study this one, and so yeah, escalations are a gift, feedback like that is a gift, and nobody is ever inconveniencing me when they do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:32):\nFor people that are listening to this and feeling like, \"Man, this is so stressful and intense and just like, I don't know if I want to work this way,\" give them a sense of just how successful Rippling is. I think a lot of people may not even have heard of Rippling. A lot of people are like, \"Yeah, it's doing great.\" What are some things you can share that are public or not public that give people a sense of just how massive this business has become?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:14:53):\nPeople look at Rippling from the outside, I think they think of us as payroll and HR or whatever, which is cool. It's a bit like saying Microsoft is a desktop operating system company or it's like every company starts from somewhere.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:15:00):\n... system company or ... It's like every company starts from somewhere and grows out from there. We see ourselves as building the most successful business software platform in history. In fact, that's the mission statement of our product organization under the umbrella of the mission statement of the company, which is to free smart people to work on hard problems. And when you translate that from where we are today to where we think we're taking things, it's like we really do believe that the core of every workflow and everything that a company has to do, be it AI or manual traditional GUI based software, is who's doing stuff, who owns it, who's accountable? And so the people record is a really important component of that. You can argue that the customer record's also very important. And of course some big businesses have been built on that primitive as well, but we think the people primitive is actually much more important.\n\n(01:15:43):\nAnd that the only thing that hasn't been done here is somebody hasn't been ambitious enough to build a good business on top of that primitive. Workday is terrible software. Everybody agrees on that. I think Workday agrees on that. Good luck to them. But they have failed actually, despite their success, to build a really broad general purpose software platform for business software on the foundation of the people primitive. So we're going to do that.\n\n(01:16:03):\nAnd we're successful because we deliver on that promise at the scale we're at today. The fact that you can do ... and this is not a sales pitch or sort of like an advertisement for Rippling. I just think it's important to sort of contemplate that when you bring together a bunch of disparate business processes into one system on a common business data graph, an object graph, a data lake with a consistent interface, you can do some pretty magical things.\n\n(01:16:27):\nSo we do payroll, we do HCM, we do IT, we do spend. We are about to launch a new product in the category of business intelligence and data management. And there's a whole bunch of other stuff coming beyond that. And then you layer in AI on top of this, where we alone, where we alone have all of your business data organized into this nice, neat package with a beautiful semantic layer on top of it. The AI can work magic. And we have shipped nothing, nothing yet in this category that I would say gets anywhere near what we're going to show next year. And it is going to set the standard. It is going to be the most ... The back flips that the AI is doing reading and writing data for the user just on our internal use cases at Rippling is jaw dropping. So I'm super excited about the tailwind this is going to create for us.\n\n(01:17:20):\nYou ask about what can I share about the success of the company? What I can say, there are tens of thousands of companies that now run on Rippling. We're less than 1% of the market. And the market cap at 16 billion, I think now undervalues where we are from a revenue perspective by a long shot. There is just so much upside to do what we're doing. And SaaS might be dead-ish in terms of point solutions, but long live SaaS in terms of what we're building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:48):\nLet me follow that thread in AI. There's been a lot of talk about AI is going to replace SaaS, as you maybe just said.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:17:55):\nYeah. People are going to vibe code their way to their payroll system, which I ... good luck to the employees of those companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):\nAnd so what I'm hearing here is that you actually do believe a lot of SaaS companies that are selling individual solutions are in big trouble. The answer implied here is this kind of compound startup idea of you need to do a lot of things for people for them to continue to pay for your software. Is that the gist?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:18:18):\nNo. I think the gist is ... there's a really good quote. I forget who it's attributable to, but it's, \"There's two ways to make money in software, bundling and unbundling.\" And you just got to get the timing right. So this is a period of bundling. So here's the problem; point solutions don't have enough data in the age of AI to be useful. You got to be able to provide the AI with a lot of context about a lot of data so it can do things. It can do joins. It can do correlations.\n\n(01:18:49):\nAnd so if you're a point solution, you're in hard water because you've got to now rely on data from other sources. You've got to integrate to third party systems. And when you integrate to a third party system, even the best ones are still sort of drinking their data through a straw, which is a real problem. I mean, the biggest HCM software company you can think of integrates to the other biggest payroll software company you can think of through flat files via SFTP. What are they going to do? What are they going to do? It's just never going to work. It's just no way. And so I literally have no idea what they're going to do. They're just not going to build AI software, I guess. Point SaaS is sort of in a rough spot, especially when you cleave two really important systems apart and say they have to integrate. It's very, very hard.\n\n(01:19:39):\nThe other thing that I would say about the world of, even just like not SaaS, but AI software is that point solutions in the AI world are also in a rough spot for the same reason. It's like if you're selling the shovels like OpenAI and Google with Gemini, you can make money. And if you own the mine, like Rippling, with the data, you can make money. If you're somewhere in the middle, building AI software that then tries to use the shovels from the shovel provider, but then also needs to rent out the mine, or get the ore out of somebody else's mind and start refining it, you're in a very difficult place from an economic standpoint. Because you're not going to be permitted by either of those parties to build a big business on their backs.\n\n(01:20:25):\nThat's just not how it's going to work. They're going to demand value capture that crushes your unit economics. So I look at the landscape of AI companies that I've seen and I think you have to have a really durable, interesting insight that gives you a shot at viable unit economics to be an interesting business. And that is going to kill off 80 or 90% of the stuff that I see right now as standalone AI businesses.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:53):\nSo what I'm hearing here ... I love that you correct me when I get these things wrong, and that's exactly what I want. What I'm hearing is it's less about how difficult it is to build the SaaS product. It's about, do you have first party data that allows you to build an incredible AI product on top of what you've got?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:21:09):\nYep. Because look, SaaS software is a bit flipping. All SaaS software applications are bit flippers. It's an interface changing-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):\nYour database?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:21:18):\nYeah. Changing values in your database, that's what it does. It's a really hard problem. One of Rippling's superpowers is we're a coin sorter. You dump $20,000 for an employee in the top of the coin sorter, and it figures out what goes to the government, what goes to health insurance, what goes to your 401k, what goes to you. And it has to move all that money very, very reliably and seamlessly, very challenging software to build and manage. What's it doing? Even that is just flipping bits in a database. And so AI is a new way to flip bits. AI is just a new way to flip bits. Hopefully a way that abstracts us a little bit further from having to think because our future is Wally. It's going to be great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:57):\nSpeaking of Wally, actually, I have this Matic Robot. You have one of these?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:22:04):\nUh-huh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):\nNo. It's like a self-driving car robot, basically, a self-driving car. People built this robot that cleans your house. Maybe I didn't mention that. It's like a house cleaning robot that just goes around.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:22:15):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:15):\nIt's like a Roomba. You should have one. They're expensive, but incredibly cool. And actually in Wally, there's a scene where they actually have basically what these things look like. So it's not so far-fetched for that movie.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:22:26):\nI definitely was actually quite prescient, perhaps with the exception of the gravity defying day beds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):\nYeah. I don't know, but that's not good news. You've seen that movie. Oh, man. So on this AI stuff, which I'm hearing is we're going to see a lot more consolidation where these point solution companies realize they need this data. This is existential, and they're going to combine and merge and bundle, as you described?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:22:51):\nIt's possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:52):\nOr for now.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:22:52):\nI am not an investigator on this stuff. I think there's some really interesting investors out there who I think are thinking quite deeply about this. And in particular, the conviction, which is like Mike Fornell and Sarah Guo. I think those are two investors who are hyper focused on AI. And when they made the decision to take that approach, at the time I thought that's kind of narrow. Now I'm like, no, no, no, that was the right move. And it just means that they have a very deep, deep, deep set of hypotheses that they've formed over the course of seeing every AI deal in the valley. And there are better people to ask this question of than I am. And I think if you're an entrepreneur, I recommend them to you because I think they're really smart.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nAwesome. I love those guys. Also, Sarah and Elad have a podcast called No Priors that I'd also recommend. We'll point it to you in the show notes. So on this AI note, I guess is there anything else that you think would be really helpful for founders that are working in this space building an AI startup to hear they think you were seeing of like, here's what you need to do to win in an AI company?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:23:58):\nSo much. I actually think that if I were to give you an answer to this question right now, it would be bullshit. Yeah. I don't have anything ... Back to my point earlier, I don't have enough relevant experience in the abstract to dole out on a podcast on that topic, but I wish them luck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):\nI love that. Circling back to your advice, don't ask for advice, ask for a relevant experience. And I love that that's where your mind immediately went. I'm going to take us to AI Quarter, which is a recurring segment on this podcast. And the question is just what's one way you've found AI to be useful in your work day-to-day? Is there something that you found it unlocked in how you work?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:24:37):\nI mean, it's not a super exciting thing, but I'll say where I use ... So one of the most important functions that I perform as an executive is the synthesis of ideas, and the ability to communicate those ideas very clearly to people. So when I talk about the product quality list and the pickle, as something that we've come up with internally, I do turn to AI, ChatGPT and Gemini, where I take a really, let's say, angular view of some topic and I give ... really, I write the essay for the AI and I'm like, \"Look, this is the crisp idea I want to communicate. Help me come up with pithy ways to articulate these things.\" And 80% of what it outputs is trash. It's just sort of middle of the road, average, low alpha junk.\n\n(01:25:24):\nBut it is a thought partner, a non-judgemental thought partner where in 20% of the stuff it comes out with, I'm like, yeah, it's pretty good. That's a new word I didn't think of. That does kind of hit the nail on the head for this concept. And so if I believe that my job is to sort of bring brains along on the journey for some sort of change that I'm trying to bring about, then the most important tool is language. And I do find that the ChatGPT and Gemini do a great job of helping me refine how to articulate the concepts that I want to articulate. They are not useful in coming up with the ideas themselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:59):\nThat's an awesome tip. I don't know if you've played with Claude much, but I actually find Claude is better at writing and words and language.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:26:05):\nI have not spent a lot of time with Claude. I have used it, but by virtue of this conversation, I'll probably go give it a go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:12):\nRight. Yeah. They're all great, but there's something about Claude that is just at writing specifically is much better, but they're all getting better all the time. There's always something new.\n\n(01:26:23):\nMatt, we've covered so much ground. We've touched on everything I was hoping to touch on. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you were hoping to share or anything else you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:26:34):\nYeah. We've spent a lot of time talking about intensity and the grind, and the need to just always be operating at the 99th percentile. And I think if you listen to that in a vacuum, it's very easy to believe that that intensity is soul crushing, that it's a negative, that it's maybe not something that you want. And I think there's a backstop for me that I didn't talk about today that I think is important to share, which is that life is amazing. That the fact that we all exist on this blue marble drifting through space and time, that we are some weird instantiation of consciousness, each of us, and that you're here for such a short period of time whittling your stick, doing something, that if you remember how insignificant we are and all of this is, it brings this levity to what we do and to the work we put into building this.\n\n(01:27:47):\nBecause Silicon Valley in 2025 is Florence and the Renaissance. It's crazy. The amount of creativity and insane invention and progress that's happening for our species right now in this place is absolutely unparalleled in all human history. You've got to zoom out and appreciate that magic. And so then you turn around and you're like, fuck, I've got to work on Friday night, right? I've got to go give it my all. I've got to go compete in the arena of business.\n\n(01:28:22):\nYou have to never forget that number one, none of this matters. And number two, it is an absolutely beautiful and amazing phenomenon that we get to be alive doing this right now. So play the sport, play it with everything you've got, but never forget that it's just a sport and that none of it matters. I think it's super important as a counterpoint to the intensity that we talked about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):\nThat is beautiful.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:28:50):\nI think about Pale Blue Dot, Carl Sagan's whole thing. Just a stunning photograph that literally changed the way I think about who I am as a person when I saw it. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:02):\nWell, going in a completely different direction, with that, Matt, we reached our very exciting lighting round.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:29:07):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:07):\nAll right, five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:29:09):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:29:16):\nOkay. Two or three books. You give me a heads-up on this. So one book is Conscious Business. I don't have Conscious Business in front of me because it's actually at the office because we have Conscious Business Reading Club at Rippling. And every member of my current, my product leadership team is going through this right now, Conscious Business, Fred Kofman. It's been used in many businesses, LinkedIn most notably, as a framework for thinking about ... effectively, it's a user manual for human beings. So if you are a leader, a manager, an executive, whatever, particularly younger people in their 20s and 30s who are just sort of getting the hang of being a CEO or a product leader for the first time, this book is absolute fucking gold. It was recommended to me by Bryan Schreier at Sequoia when he was on my board at my previous company. I took way too long to take him up on the advice, wished I had read it sooner. Highly recommend Conscious Business. Changes your life.\n\n(01:30:01):\nNumber two, Thinking in Systems, Donna Meadows. I always mispronounce her name, Donella Meadows. She died partway through writing this manuscript. Her fellow professors picked it up and finished it for her. It is the best generic framework for thinking about how systems work. You will extrapolate from this book to every aspect of your life after you read it.\n\n(01:30:23):\nAnd then the third is classic 1960s, The Effective Executive. It's an anachronism. It uses weird pronouns for the secretary and the executive. I'll let you guess which ones. But the book itself is so chock-full of simple enduring advice on how to be effective at leading teams. And the good shit is the stuff that's been in print for 70 years, and that's one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:48):\nBeautiful. I love the first one is you don't have it because you're using it with your team constantly. You mentioned at one point before we started recording, you have eight copies of that book that you just give out to everyone.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:30:57):\nYeah, and we handed out like candy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):\nOkay. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:31:03):\nYeah. So I'm a little embarrassed by this answer, but I'm going to be honest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:07):\nPlease.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:31:08):\nThere's a new series called Heated Rivalry and it's about ... I'm Canadian and I'm gay. So it's about two hockey players. In Canada, rivals between the Bruins and the Maple Leafs, although they don't use those names, who are just heated rivals on the ice. And it's a huge thing that the world is watching, but actually they're secretly in love with each other and they start hooking up. And it's been labeled by the media as smutty but delightful. And I would say that's accurate. So it might not be for everybody, but it is a smash hit right now. It's on HBO Max and Crave, and it's only six episodes. But like I said, a little embarrassing because it's a little chintzy, but it's a lot of fun. It's also really fun to see gay people represented in the media as though they're normal, and it's fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:57):\nAnd soon to be on Netflix with the acquisition if that goes through.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:00):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:00):\nIt's crazy. Amazing. Okay. Is there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:06):\nMy Fellow coffee maker. I love my Fellow coffee maker. It's got an interface that lets you set light, medium, dark roast. It changes the temperature. It blooms the coffee. It tells you how many grams of coffee to put into the basket, slick interface, high quality coffee. It's definitely awesome. And so I have Ashley have one in the office and one at home and one in the garage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:30):\nWow. That is a favorite product. You have three of them in the same cool space.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:35):\nOh no, in the office. Okay.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:35):\nFellow is also a Rippling customer and that's a nice side effect when we get to ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:39):\nHave they ever escalated anything to you?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:42):\nNo. If you're listening and you're from Fellow, I want to hear all your gripes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:46):\nPerfect. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to often in work or in life?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:32:51):\nIt's a dark one, and I'll share this one sort of partially for the humor of it, but it's actually sometimes useful immediately. At least it's sort of a moment of smiling when it happens. The motto comes from my dad who said, \"Matt, nothing's ever so bad in life that it couldn't get worse.\" And it's like we were going through some shit yesterday at work and we were like, \"Fuck, now that happened.\" And I looked at the CTO and I'm like, \"Dude, nothing's ever so bad that it couldn't get worse.\" And we had a good laugh and continued to brace for whatever might come next. So not exactly uplifting, but fun to use.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:26):\nNo, it is uplifting. I'm an optimist and I find myself thinking that often with my wife just like, \"It could be worse. It could be worse than this. \" Definitely. It's actually [inaudible 01:33:36].\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:33:36):\nAnd it might get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:38):\nSo let's enjoy this less worse version. Final question. Something you shared with me is that you were a DJ when you were a younger person. Can you just give us a little DJ voice to give people a sense of your skills?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:33:52):\nWell, so first of all, it's not DJ, Lenny. It's radio personality. And yeah, I used to do the greatest hits of all time with hits from the '60s, the '70s, the '80s, and a little bit of the '90s, 101.5 The Hawk. Yeah. You can turn it on. It's very inauthentic, but it sounds good on the radio. It's cool. I did it when I was in high school. I ended up doing the midday segment right before I went to college. And what a gift. What a huge gift in my most formative years to have developed an ability to be in front of a microphone comfortably, because here we are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):\nI love for people that weren't watching this YouTube, you lean really close to the mic to get that radio personality voice.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:34:34):\nYeah, you got to be able to hear the saliva in the mouth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):\nIncredible, and it's like the same person talking. If you're not watching this, you're like, \"Where did that guy come from?\" That was great. You nailed it. Matt, this was incredible. I really appreciate being here. I really appreciate you sharing all this advice that I have not heard other people share. Two final questions. Is there something you want to plug, point people to, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:34:55):\nLook, my life is rippling. I point people there, and this is my life's work. It's going to be a banger, so stay tuned. And the way that you can help me is that if you're a customer, you got to tell me when you have problems, because that's how we get better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:10):\nWhat's the way to get to you? Is there any place you want to point people to?\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:13):\nDM me on Twitter, is easy @stanine. You can email me my last name at rippling.com, and I'll go that far without giving out my phone number. How's that? Perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:25):\nA perfect boundary.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:26):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:27):\nMatt, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:29):\nIt's my pleasure. Thank you for having me, Lenny, and congrats on all the success with this podcast. It's been great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:34):\nSame to you. It's always a good sign at the end of a conversation when you're like, oh, I got to get me some of that stock and I got to get into that Rippling.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:41):\nIt's a good buy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:41):\nA great job.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:42):\nRecommended by-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:43):\n15 billion.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:44):\nYeah, but you're [inaudible 01:35:46]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:45):\nYou're hard to get [inaudible 01:35:46] All right, man. Thank you so much.\n\nMatt MacInnis (01:35:50):\nThanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:52):\nThank you so much for listening.

If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on to Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera, because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You don't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. And of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. So, that's the most important thing.\n\nLenny (00:01:08):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my aim here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Matt Mochary. Matt is a full-time executive coach, but not just any coach. He's worked with folks like Naval, the CEOs of OpenAI, Coinbase, Reddit, Rippling, Fair, Front, Notion, the list goes on. He's also coached partners at VCs like Sequoia, YC, Benchmark, many others.\n\nLenny (00:01:34):\nWe are so fortunate that Matt agreed to join me on this podcast and in our conversation we cover a lot of ground. We talk about why learning to fire people is one of the most important skills as a leader and how to do it well, why anger and fear often point you in the exact opposite direction you should be going, how to innovate within a larger company, how his coaching has evolved over the years, where the most successful founders still struggle, and so much more. This may be my new favorite episode and I bet it will be years, too. So much real talk with tactics, templates, all kind of goodness. Enjoy this conversation with Matt Mochary.\n\nLenny (00:02:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI.

I'm looking forward to it.\n\nLenny (00:04:49):\nI am looking forward to it even more. The way I learned about you is back in the day I read this book called The Great CEO Within, which I have right here, and I was like, holy moly, this is the most tactical, practical, useful book I've seen for leaders. I need to tell everyone about it, and I did. Then a few weeks ago, someone shared a link in my newsletter Slack community to this document that is called the Mochary Method Curriculum Document. I was like, oh my god, this is the most practical, tactical, useful document I've seen in a long time. I got to share this with everyone, and I did. Then I realized it's the same person that wrote these two things, and so I reached out to you and you kindly agreed to join me on this podcast. And so again, really appreciate you being here.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:05:30):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:05:32):\nGive folks a little bit of background on you who aren't so familiar with you, and just to help understand a little bit of a how you got so wise. Can you give folks just kind of a brief overview of some of the wonderful things you've done in your career, maybe some of the folks you've worked with and how you got to what you do now?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:05:47):\nRight on. I've had a very varied career. I started a company back in internet 1.0 called Totality, which was a good financial outcome. Then I went and just had fun for a long time and then I went and did social good and helped ex-convicts get and keep a job by becoming truck drivers. All that was super fun, but I realized I missed my peers and I wanted to get back into the tech world, but I didn't want to start a company because a company is a lot of work and the end result is you make a lot of money, but I didn't need money.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:06:15):\nAnd so I thought, how could I get in the tech world and not actually have to do the hard work? Oh, I could be a coach. I could coach people and then I just get to do the fun stuff and advise them and then they have to do the hard work. And so I looked around and thought, well how could I do that because I'm not a coach and so why would anyone listen to me? Then someone told me that there were students at Stanford that had started companies but no one would coach them. They couldn't get into YC because YC doesn't accept students. So, I went and started coaching them and it was super fun and very successful and then they started recommending me up the food chain and eventually, I met folks like Naval Ravikant and Sam Altman and Brian Armstrong and they recommended me around to the rest of the tech community, and ended up coaching some of the CEOs and the leaders of the biggest tech companies and biggest tech investment firms.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:07:07):\nIt's been a ton of fun and for me, I do things for joy and each and every one of these interactions has been massively joyful for me and the people I coach become my really close friends, so it's all very selfish on my part.\n\nLenny (00:07:21):\nI feel you on a lot of that. I also tried to explore starting a company again and similarly decided this is way too much stress and work, what else can I do instead? And that's what led to the work I do now, which I love.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:07:33):\nRight on.\n\nLenny (00:07:34):\nHow long have you been doing this coaching?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:07:36):\nThat whole process started about 10 years ago, so about 10 years.\n\nLenny (00:07:40):\nAwesome. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and the internet and ahead of this chat I polled folks on Twitter and asked them what they would ask you if they were chatting with you, so I thought I'd start off with asking you a few those questions and then we'll dig into a few very specific topics that I'm excited to talk about. The first question comes from Leo Polovets who's a GP at Susa Ventures, and he asked, \"Matt has coached some incredible founders, what are some of the most common areas where even the most successful founders still struggle?\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:08:11):\nGreat question. To me, the bar is fear and how strongly do people feel fear? There are few people that I coach that just don't feel fear at all. And frankly with them, we have very tactical conversations, but they're the minority. The most feel fear to some degree, some feel it a lot, some feel it less, but when they feel it grips their mind and it prevents them from seeing... It prevents them from doing the thing that is difficult but necessary, so that's a lot of what our coaching is, me pointing out to them, hey, I think you're in fear.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:08:55):\nWhat happens is very early on in coaching they'll go, yeah, okay, I'm in fear. So what? I go, great. I believe that fear is actually giving you bad advice and I think you're predicting that if you do this A will happen. Well, I'm predicting that if you do that, the exact opposite will happen. So, I'll tell you what, why don't we make a bet? This is very high stakes, why don't we pick something that's lower stakes? You make a prediction, we'll see if I make the opposite and then let's bet on it. So we pick something and then we make a bet on it, and whoever wins the bet in the future gets to determine what the actions are.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:09:31):\nI've made this bet hundreds of times and so far, I've never lost. It's not because I'm magician or a genius, it's because when someone's in fear, they're gripped. They can't see reality, their brain is making very exaggerated predictions. Whereas when someone is not in fear, and I'm not because it's not my situation, I am not gripped and therefore, my brain isn't making exaggerated predictions. And so, we make this bet once I win, then all of a sudden the CEO realizes, oh my God, there's something to this, fear gives bad advice. Then after that, all I need to do is remind the person that I perceive them to be in fear. That's all it takes, and they're like, oh, okay, and then they go ahead and do the thing that they feel fear about. Then of course, later they come back to me and say, Matt, that was magical. It works so well.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:10:23):\nI mean, I'll give you examples. The most extreme is when a CEO realizes that there's a problem in the business and they haven't told their board yet and their board doesn't know, and remember, their board is their investors, and they have another round coming up, they know they're going to have to raise money in another six to 12 months. They need their current investors to participate in the upcoming round, otherwise outside investors won't. Then they say, well, what the hell do I do? I've got this problem. Do I tell my investors? And most often, the knee jerk reaction is, no, I'm not going to tell them.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:11:01):\nThen I say, \"Well, I think that's fear. I think if you actually tell them, tell your investors, the exact opposite of what we think is going to happen is going to happen. You think you're going to lose their trust. I think you're going to gain their trust.\" And so, if we've done this fear exercise before, they do it, they share transparently with their board all the problems and say, and I'm excited to tackle these problems. Every single time that's happened, the board members have said, \"This is fantastic. I love this honesty. Thank you so much. This is one of the only companies that I'm on the board of that actually is transparent and honest,\" and they gain trust.\n\nLenny (00:11:42):\nI'm glad that you brought this topic up. I wanted to spend time on it. Just to double click a little bit into it, just kind of to summarize your advice here, if you feel fear, which you may not recognize you feel, the advice is: do the opposite of what your brain is telling you to do, right?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:11:57):\nGenerally, I mean, check with someone. Don't just randomly, I feel fear crossing the street crossing a crowded highway and then go, oh, that's fear talking. I should cross the highway anyway and then get hit by a cop. No, that's not what I mean. I don't mean physical danger, I mean things that we perceive to be danger to our egos, but that the easiest thing is just to check with somebody else who's not in fear because they will be able to see clearly when you can't.\n\nLenny (00:12:24):\nI was working through your curriculum and you pointed out that you found a way to express to somebody that they are in fear. I think it was your wife that kind of iterated on how to give you feedback that you're in fear where you didn't get defensive, you got more fearful and angry and can you talk a bit about that?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:12:40):\nYeah, so we iterated, I at times feel anger and I act on that anger and I don't even realize I'm in anger, so I wanted her to let me know, and so she would say, at first she said, \"You're in anger,\" and that just made me feel accused and made me go into more anger. And then she said, \"Are you in anger?\" And that felt passive aggressive or indirect and that also made me go into more anger. Then finally she said, \"I perceive you to be an anger.\" So it's an I statement and it's simply what she's perceiving. There's no judgment. That was able to punch through my anger and then I woke up and went, oh, and then I stopped and just didn't act until I was able to shift out of anger.\n\nLenny (00:13:25):\nAwesome. And anger and fear, I think there's different pieces of advice for if you feel angry versus fear. Is that right?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:13:32):\nYes. I mean, anger, you're just destroying and what you're doing is you're destroying relationships and so you just got to stop because you're breaking glass. Of course, you're breaking it with the people who are closest to you. They're the people who are nearest to you, which are the people you love and care about the most. They're not only people you work with, but they're the people you live with and you don't want to do that. You don't want to hurt them.\n\nLenny (00:13:59):\nYeah. Maybe one last question along these lines, why do we do this? Is this just we're trying to protect our ego and ourselves and we just want to do the safe thing?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:14:06):\nThat's it. I mean, I just learned very recently, and this isn't written anywhere because I just learned it, someone shared with me that anger is not a base emotion. Anger is actually a cover. It's a cover for when we feel pain, and so our brain doesn't want to feel the pain, so instead it externalizes it. But the problem is it shoves that pain onto everybody else around us. The real answer here is not to have people let us know that we're in anger and then stop. The real answer is just to allow ourselves to feel the pain and it sucks by the way, it actually hurts. But then we're not... Sorry, I'm getting emotional. We're not pushing that out onto other people and I only learned this very recently and I'm just starting to practice this and I'm still not good at it, but I'm now at least sometimes not going to anger.\n\nLenny (00:15:02):\nIt's interesting how personal this advice is that it sounds like something that you deal with. It's not just like you're this coach that's just like, hey guys, here's all these problems you have. Here's how you fix stuff that you help yourself with.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:15:15):\nI'm human. Yes, and that's why I try to figure it out with me and if I can figure something out with me, then I can share it with others.\n\nLenny (00:15:24):\nAmazing. That was a fruitful question from Leo, and we might come back to this topic.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:15:30):\nBy the way, this also applies to organizations. I mean, the way that I used to get all this information about how to run organizations is I started a company, Totality, and my co-founder and I, we did a terrible job running that company. What happened was I didn't have any learnings from that which I could share with people because it was just worst practices, not best practices. But then 10 years later, I thought to myself, well, how could I have done that better? How could we have done that better?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:15:55):\nSo, I picked up a book, a business book, it was High Output Management by Andy Grove. I read it and I was like, \"Oh my God, here are all the answers.\" And then I read another book, The Hard Thing About Hard Things by Ben Horowitz was like, \"Oh my God, there are even more answers.\" I just kept reading more and more business books, and every one I read, they were just chock full of answers. But then I needed to test whether or not these really worked, so that's when I started coaching and I started testing them in companies, but I had to let the people know here, do this, but they weren't going to read a 350 page book. I had to summarize it in two pages and then share it with them, and then they did, and then they implemented it and it worked.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:16:29):\nThen I had all these summaries, and then I started to create my own summaries of little niche cases that weren't in any book that I'd read. That's where all these writings came from. Then one day, someone that I was coaching said, \"Matt, you got to take all these writings. They're a book, you got to publish them.\" And I said, \"No, I don't.\" My friend said, \"Well, how about I do all the work? How about I take care of the editing and the publishing?\" And I was like, \"Okay, if you want to do that, great.\" That was Alex MacCaw. Others had offered before, but he was the one that actually followed through all the way to the end. That was it. That's how the book was born.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:17:06):\nBut I realized also, recently, that many of my most radical ideas, I can't get anyone to test them because I'll say, \"Hey, I think you should do blank.\" And the CEO will say, \"That sounds crazy. Matt, can you point me to other examples of other people that have done this and it's worked?\" And I say, \"No, this is an original thought that came out of my head. No one's done it before that I know of.\" They're like, \"Okay, well I'm not going to be the first.\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:17:33):\nThen I realized I needed an organization to test my most radical ideas, and also all of my CEOs had been asking me to create software because I have a methodology and it's step one, step two, step three, and you do it in one-on-ones and then a methodology for a team meeting and then a methodology for feedback and then a methodology for every different motion in the company. It's all in Google Docs. And they said to me, \"Matt, this is amazing. I love this one-on-one process. I love your team process, but I don't want to have to teach each of my reports the way you've taught me. I'd like it just being softer. I just hit a button and boom, it happens automatically.\" At first, I said, \"No, that's not interesting to me. I'm not a developer. You, Brian Armstrong, you're a developer and you have a thousand engineers that work for you. Why don't you go create it?\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:18:21):\nBut in the end, I said, \"Okay, this could be fun.\" So, I hired a team of developers and we started to create the software, and one, the product is working. But two more importantly, I now have a team of humans that we work together that I can start testing my more radical ideas out with. I would say about half of them are wildly successful and the other half complete duds. It almost seems like one are the other. But now I have my own basically laboratory to test things. Of course, when I see radical things that other people are doing, I try them in our organization, and it's phenomenal.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:18:59):\nI'll tell you the most radical one. I was asking one CEO, I said, \"Have you ever let someone go and regretted it?\" He said, \"No.\" And I said, \"Well, then you don't know what the bar is because the bar of where you should be letting people go is here, and the bar that you've let people go is here. So until you get close to that line, you don't know what that line is.\" He said, \"Wow, that's true.\" Then I thought about it and I thought to myself, uh-oh, I have never let anyone go that I regret it, so I don't know where the line is.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:19:34):\nThen I thought, oh no, I've got to go into my team and let someone go, and here's the problem. We've already done talent density, we've already done the Netflix thing. If someone is meeting expectation, we let them go. We've already let all those folks go. So on our team, it's only outperformers. So, I thought there was one guy, he's an outperformer, no question about it, and super positive, an amazing guy and can do anything and is happy to do everything. But there wasn't much left for him to do because everything else was being covered. I talked to my number two and said, \"Can you do what you're doing and what he's doing?\" And she said, \"Give me two weeks,\" and she did. She came back and said, \"Yeah, I can.\" So, we let him go.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:20:19):\nNow, when I let someone go, I try to do it with a massive amount of compassion because I know it's brutal. I mean, losing your spouse, your home, and your job, these are the three most traumatic things that can happen to you. When that happens, of course you go into massive fear and the brain shuts down, so I want to be there and help them through that process and actively help them find their dream job because there is a place that absolutely needs them. So, what I do is I become their agent and I say, \"I want to help you discover what it is that your ideal role is, and I want to help you create it or land it.\" I did that with him. Turns out, what he wanted to do was go start a company and create a new product so he could just start that day one. But, the litmus for me is that everybody I've let go, I believe anyway, that I continue to be friends with. That shows me that the process by which I let people go is a humane one.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:21:17):\nHere's the crazy thing, after letting this guy go, after about 30 days, I was like, ugh, did I do the wrong thing? Was that too much? But then after about two to three months, I realized, no, that actually was the right thing because my number two was able to absorb the things that he was doing and here's the crazy part, with fewer people in the organization, things work better. That's the big realization that most people never discover. they hit product market fit, they get tons of money from investors, just higher, higher, higher, higher, but every additional human you have in your organization causes extra overhead and geometrically so, because now you have to keep all those people informed, give them all context, make them all feel heard, because unless they feel like they're contributing and you understand what they're saying, then they feel ignored and they feel passed over and they feel disrespected and grumpy.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:22:11):\nThere's this morale problem that exists. There's this friction of information flow and a morale problem that grows and grows and grows. Really, the only answer is, I mean, that's why people bring me in because they're growing, growing, growing, and things are breaking. I have a system that keeps things together, but it doesn't make it perfect. It just makes it so that the company doesn't fall apart. But really the ideal is just to keep the team super small. That's what WhatsApp did, that's what Instagram did, that's what Linear is doing right now. That's what Notion has been doing for a while. Those, to me, are the real success stories.\n\nLenny (00:22:53):\nThis reminds me of a story I just listened to on Lex Fridman's podcast. They were interviewing the head of AI at Tesla, or former head of AI, and Lex was asking him, \"Why did you get rid of LiDAR on your cars? Like aren't more sensors good so that you can be better at self-driving?\" And he's like, \"If you have LiDAR, you got to think about the supply chain and getting all those parts. You got to think about all the additional data that it brings and adds more chaos to your data, and you have to think about that. Think about if that one part is gone, everything slows down, and in theory it is better, but then all these other factors end up making it worse.\" Talking about how Elon's philosophy is the best part is no part. It feels like that's exactly what you're saying.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:23:36):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:23:37):\nYou're getting to all the stuff I want to talk about, which is awesome. So firing people, this is good. We were chatting earlier and you mentioned that this is a skill that most managers are really bad at and maybe is the most important skill to develop as a leader and as a manager. People are just bad at it. You shared a few pieces of advice there, but is there anything else that you could share about just how to get better at firing people and that skill?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:24:03):\nYeah, the reason people are bad at this is because they think that they're hurting the person who they're letting go. I mean, how many times have I heard from someone, \"Yeah, this person's not performing, but gosh, they really need this job and their mother has cancer,\" and whatever personal situation they're in. Wei Deng, who is the CEO of Clipboard Health, who's one of my favorite CEOs, who frankly I learn more from her than she learns from me, she shared with me her framework for making decisions, which is she separates the decision from the implementation, meaning she thinks about who is the stakeholder here that I'm solving for? And almost always in a company, you're solving for the customer. So, what would the customer want to see happen? That's the decision. Of course, the customer would want to see only the best employees and anyone who isn't a great employee, don't be there.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:24:52):\nNow the implementation is, if I do this, if I let this person go, who gets hurt? Well, the employee gets hurt. Maybe I get hurt because it's a painful conversation. Maybe the rest of the team gets hurt because they're sad that their friend is leaving. Then you look at, well, what can we do? Each person who gets hurt, what is it that they really want? Let's see if we can help them get what they really want. Well, the person let go, what do they want? They want a great job where they're actually needed and they feel fulfilled, so they enjoy what they're doing and they're actually critical to the company or organization that they're with. Right now they're not, by the way, they're not critical, clearly. So you're actually holding them back from what it is that they really want.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:25:36):\nWhat you do is you help them find that place that really needs the skill or the passion that they have. Yourself, what do you really want? You want to not have a difficult conversation? Well, cognitive behavior therapy, the best way to get over that is to actually have one and realize it's not that bad. Then the rest of the team, they feel sad because their teammate left. Well, here's how you solve what they really want is they want to know that... They want to release their emotions. Okay, great. Listen to them, let them share their emotions, let them share the sadness that they feel, and then it's released out of their body.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:26:12):\nDecision is one thing, implementation is completely and utterly separate. That's the same thing here in letting someone go. But if you let them go kindly and humanely, the key is, in my opinion, you become their agent, like Michael Ovitz, the CAA agent. You help them find their next job actively. Michael Ovitz is the one who reaches out to employers for his clients and says, \"Hey, do you have work for my client?\" That's what I mean by being agent, not by, if you need a reference from me, I'll be happy to give you reference. That's bullshit, that's passive.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:26:50):\nI'm talking about active, and it doesn't take long. Maybe one to two hours of my time reaching out to people I know saying, \"Hey, I've got this great person.\" Oh my God, of course they're going to pay attention. Of course, they're going to react. Now you might say, well, wait a second, what if the person isn't great? What if they're a bad performer and my posit is that they're good at something. You have to find out what it is they're good at. And really what they're good at is what they're passionate about, so find out what they're passionate about and that you can recommend them for. That's what I do.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:27:25):\nI think for almost all managers that aren't good at letting go, it's because A, they've never done it, or B, they've done it badly. They didn't help the person, and that person then went off and had a very painful time and now hates that manager. But if you actively help that person, they will appreciate it. Now, there are situations when a person says, \"Screw you, I don't want your help.\" Okay, but they still recognize that you offered.\n\nLenny (00:27:56):\nWho's the best person at firing that comes to mind when you think of this person's really good at this?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:28:01):\nWei Deng from Clipboard Health. She's the most compassionate.\n\nLenny (00:28:07):\nAwesome. The framework you shared reminds me of something my manager once taught me similarly. They missed the final piece of actually being their agent and finding their next gig, but just the idea of separate the emotion and doing the thing from, if there were no feelings involved, what would you do? And then you should do that, and that might be hard.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:28:26):\nThat's exactly right. By the way, this whole thing about no feelings, I do have probably two CEOs that don't feel emotions. They don't feel fear, they don't feel anger. One, in particular, feels zero emotions. I have to say, he's a machine, he's an operating machine and there's zero time between ah, this is the right thing to do and doing it. It's amazing. It's an incredibly well run company and an incredibly valuable company. So yeah, emotions typically, again, typically fear and anger are the ones that derail our brains.\n\nLenny (00:29:08):\nIt makes me think of Alex Honnold, I think is his name, the free climber, the solo dude. His amygdala doesn't quite function so he doesn't-\n\nMatt Mochary (00:29:19):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:29:21):\nThat's interesting. He could be a free solo climber, he could be a CEO.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:29:25):\nThat's right. CEO's a little safer. The prediction for Alex is that he will at some point, unfortunately die.\n\nLenny (00:29:33):\nYeah. Did you see The Alpinist? Not to spoil anything.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:29:36):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:29:38):\nOkay, moving on from that, I'm curious, in a remote world, does your advice change in terms of firing? It seems like everything you shared you could do easily in person or remote, but does something change when you're doing it over Zoom?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:29:51):\nNo, it doesn't change at all. There is one point I didn't include, which I'll include now, is there's helping the person be their agent, but there's also allowing the person, whenever I have a difficult conversation, I start it off, \"Hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this.\" What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So, if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard because if they're aware that they're going to go into fear, they're going to go into anger, they're going to go into sadness, then they can see it coming and they go, oh, that's what it is. But if they don't see it coming, just a surprise and all of a sudden it grips their whole brain and now they're in it and they don't even know they're in it.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:30:43):\nThat's the first thing I do. This is going to be a difficult conversation. Are you ready? Then I share the news. I'm letting you go, here's why. Then second, I deliver the message. The third thing is now they're feeling emotions, strong ones. Even though I warned them, they're still feeling them. Now you want them to be able to release those emotions, and so I say to them, \"My guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking?\" Sometimes they don't answer, but many times they do and they share with me and they let it out. That's important to allow them to let it out. Then I make them feel heard and I actively listen. That makes them realize that I'm not trying to run away from the pain that they're feeling. I'm not trying to leave them alone with it. I sit with them as they have it and then I try to help them get through it.\n\nLenny (00:31:47):\nThat's something else I wanted to chat about is the feeling heard lesson that you have for people. I'd love to just get your advice on just how to help people feel heard. It's like, oh yeah, I know that's important. I want people to feel heard. I will listen and it'll go great. But you have some very tactical advice on how to actually make people feel heard.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:32:05):\nYeah, there's sort of a few different levels of it. One way to make people feel heard is, let's assume you're talking to them because there's another way, there's an even more surface way is verbal. Sometimes what I do is I ask, if I'm in a group of people, and there's a question or a problem that we're trying to solve, instead of going around the room and hearing people's verbal opinions, which takes forever, I ask everyone at the same time to take five minutes to write down their solution. Then we all drop it in a doc and then I just read it. When I read it I say, \"Thank you, Lenny.\" And that makes you know that I at least read it, so that's a little bit of feeling heard.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:32:40):\nSecond, if I want to make you feel more heard, I ask you to say it verbally and then I repeat it back to you. \"Lenny, I think what I heard you say is... Is that right?\" And you're like, \"Yes.\" Or you're like, \"No, not quite a little bit different.\" Then if it's a little bit different, I repeat it again until you say, \"Yes, that's it.\" Now you know that I understood you.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:33:00):\nThen there's a third way which is even deeper, which is especially if you're giving me feedback, you likely don't want to hurt my feelings. So what you're doing is you're giving me the feedback, but you're couching it, you're polishing it, you're rounding the edges, you're making it softer. It's not really what you're thinking, but it's what you're willing to say. If I want to make you really feel heard, I reflect back what I imagine are the thoughts in your head. If I think you're feeling anger, I sort of think to myself, well, what would anger feel like? I cause myself to feel that anger, then what are the thoughts that appear to me? I say something to you like, \"Lenny, I think what I'm hearing you say is you're off and you're thinking, screw you, Matt. How dare you walk into the office and not even say hello to me? Is that close?\" And you're like, \"No, Matt.\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:33:49):\nPeople either say one of two things, they say, \"Yeah, that is it.\" Or they say \"No, that's stronger than what I was thinking, but directionally that's right.\" What that really means is, yeah, that's what I was thinking. Almost always their thoughts are bigger than their words, but they really feel heard when I share their thoughts. Now, that's not the end of the process. I mean you actually have to then do something. Once you made them feel heard, you have to say, okay, well either I accept or don't accept this feedback and if I accept, here's what I'm going to do about it. If I don't accept, I need to explain to you why. Here's what's going on. You shared with me what's going on in your world, now let me share with you what's going on in my world. Hopefully, you can see why this thing that's going on in my world doesn't allow me to accept what it is that you shared, and hopefully now that you see what's going on in my world, your feedback changes and that's it. That's the whole process.\n\nLenny (00:34:45):\nI'm listening to this advice and I'm like, yes, I will do this next time I'm talking to someone. I imagine people don't and they forget, and it takes time to actually learn these things. Like the firing advice you just shared, how do you actually get good at this and practice these things is like I have to work with a coach who will continue to reinforce these things? Is it follow these steps next time? Have them written down? What advice do you have for folks that are like, I want to get better at this. I want to start doing this stuff.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:35:09):\nWell, these docs are all free to the public in the curriculum. You can post them here, you can post them on Twitter, you can post the whole curriculum on Twitter, frankly, other people have. It has a step-by-step. There's a doc in there that is a step-by-step script. All you do is you read it and you follow the script in letting someone go or in making someone feel heard. My posit is once you do it one time, you're like, oh my god, that worked so well. That's the only motivation you need. And you've got the script, so you can just keep doing it. I don't think you need a coach.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:35:42):\nIn fact, I remember one time I asked an investor who their best up and coming CEO was. The investor gave me a name. I was like, \"Great, can I please get introduced to him? I want coach him.\" I reached out, the guy responded immediately. He's like, \"Matt, I've read your book. I love your book. I read it three years ago. I've been implementing all the elements in our company. It's fantastic.\" When someone says that they know my work, they've already implemented it and it's worked, 10 out of 10 times, that person wants me to coach them. Then I said, \"Great, that's fantastic. I'd love to coach you.\" And the guy said to me, \"No, thanks.\" I was shocked. I was like, \"Why?\" He said, \"Well, because it's all working. I don't have any problems. I don't think I need to be coached by you.\" I couldn't have heard a better answer. That, to me, is the ultimate answer. And he is right. He doesn't need me, doesn't need anyone.\n\nLenny (00:36:39):\nI was going to ask if that's the goal of all of this writing down and systemizing is just to make yourself unnecessary.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:36:45):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:36:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.\n\nLenny (00:37:22):\nIf you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.\n\nLenny (00:37:49):\nFor a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:38:05):\nThat actually reminds me of another question a reader asked on Twitter who happened to be the one on only Ryan Hoover. He asked, \"How has your approach changed in your coaching since you started?\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:38:16):\nRyan obviously started Product Hunt and then he sold the company to AngelList, so he was part of AngelList when I went there because I was coaching Naval. What we realized coaching Naval is that Naval did not want to be CEO and he just didn't know how to get out. So, I said there's a way and I can show you, and so I did and made Naval's life 10 times better. Frankly, made AngelList 10 times better because Naval wasn't enjoying being CEO, therefore he wasn't good at it. We ended up putting someone in who did a fine job, then put someone else in who's doing an insanely good job. Now, of course, AngelList is massively valuable.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:38:53):\nRyan was there at the time, Ryan Hoover, great guy, I love Ryan. So, what has changed since then? I think what's changed is I don't think back then I had any of this fear and anger give bad advice. I think back then it was all very tactical. It was all very high up management type stuff, which is you need to have goals and at the company level, at the department level, at the individual level, you then need to track those goals. You need to track all the agreements that people make, all the actions they say they'll do. You have to put it all in Asana. Everyone has to be able to see each other's Asana board so they can see what each other is doing. I still do that, but now I've added on this piece of oh, you're in the moment and you're feeling fear? Okay, you still got to go forward. That's sort of the big change.\n\nLenny (00:39:42):\nI noticed that's at the top of the curriculum. Do you find that's where a lot of the biggest transformations happen, that curriculum component?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:39:49):\nAbsolutely. I cause people when they first start coaching, they have to read that first. There's sort of three seminal documents: on time, top goal, and fear and anger give bad advice. On time just says, hey, we're going to start our meetings on time and you're going to show up and if you don't show up on time, you're going to let me know first. That's just because I don't want to... And by the way, I showed up two minutes late for us. That's because I was on the Google Hangout for 10 minutes. I didn't realize, I thought you were-\n\nLenny (00:40:21):\nI'm trying to fix that bug. Every time we send an invite, there's a Google meet button there. I think I cracked it finally. Yeah, that would've been a funny podcast where I'm just sitting here starting on time and for two minutes. Hello, we're just waiting.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:40:33):\nExactly. Second one is top goal, which is this concept from McKeown, who wrote Essentialism, which is everyone is making requests of you, but if all you do is spend all day is responding to other people's requests, you never actually march towards your own priorities. You need to A, create priorities and then set aside some amount of time each day, 30 minutes, an hour, two hours that you just work on your own priority. If you do that, you'll make massive gains. And that's true. I mean, in five minutes I can change someone's life just by having them follow that practice. Then the third one is, if you're in anger, give that advice and that's what I have people read and say, \"Does this resonate with you?\" If it does, we can work together and if it doesn't, we shouldn't work together. So yeah, that's kind of like the crux document of whether or not people philosophically are going to resonate with what I have to share.\n\nLenny (00:41:25):\nThe top goal piece, I'm reading a book called Make Time right now and that's a big part of it. I actually just added top goal to my calendar every day. It's not working yet. Every time I get to it, I'm like no, I'm going to just check Twitter right now. But I'm working on it.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:41:38):\nThat is the hardest part. Now, what I've done is I'm similar. During my top goal time, I have somebody sit with me and they prevent me from doing anything but my top goal.\n\nLenny (00:41:51):\nWait, can you talk a bit more about that? Is this like a coworker? Are you just like, \"I need you here for this hour every day?\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:41:56):\nYeah, I mean it's like the same idea as a trainer in a gym. A trainer in a gym, maybe they're teaching you a little bit, but more often than not they're just forcing you to do the thing that you know need to do. But if they weren't there, you would kind of go eh and not do it. That's all this is. It's what I call an accountability partner.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:42:15):\nThere's even an app now where you can go online and you can sign up and I think it costs like $5 a month and you can sign up to meet someone else and you become accountability partners to each other. It's insanely effective. I'm not the only one that has a problem focusing on tasks that I don't love that are necessary, but I don't love. Like a meeting, I could take a meeting, I could take 20 meetings, I could take 10 hours of meetings, no problem. Especially when I'm the presenter, when I'm the active one. But doing asynchronous tasks for me because so people-oriented that when there isn't another human with me, it's painful, so I just have another human with me.\n\nLenny (00:43:04):\nI love that. And that person is doing other work, I imagine they're not just watching you full-time.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:43:09):\nNo, they can do whatever they want.\n\nLenny (00:43:12):\nIs this what you recommend to leaders and CEOs? Just have someone there for an hour. Wow.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:43:18):\nIf your personality is like mine, yes, have someone there. It can be remote, it can be in person, it doesn't matter. In person's a little bit more effective.\n\nLenny (00:43:27):\nRight, there's like a little zoom window.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:43:28):\nI have my kids do it. They love it.\n\nLenny (00:43:32):\nI love that. There's an app I use called Centered, that app that I'm an investor in, but I use it all the time and they have this buddy feature actually where you can be paired with a buddy in real time.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:43:40):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny (00:43:42):\nTo close a loop on the firing piece, something I was thinking about while you were talking is there's a lot of layoffs happening right now. When you're letting go of like a thousand people, you can't really be their agent unless you've seen that happen. Do you have any advice for just like there's a large layoff how you could do this?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:43:58):\nAbsolutely you can be their agent, not you personally, but they each have a manager and the manager usually has 12 reports and they're rarely letting go more than 50% at a time. That means six people that they've got to be the agent of maximum. Yes, each manager can be the agent for six people. My companies have done a lot of layoffs and here's why. Back in March of 2020, there was a chance that the world economy was imploding. Now of course, by April and May we realized that wasn't the case, that the tech world kept going, in fact, it was even flourishing.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:44:38):\nBut in March of 2020, we didn't know that. And so you needed, if you were being fiscally responsible, you needed to prepare for that eventuality, so you needed pare costs. 80% of costs in any tech company is payroll, is humans. If you're going to pare costs, you actually have to let go of humans. Almost every one of my companies did. Some on the low side of 5%, some on the high side. One company that is a hotel company let go of 40% because it looked like their business was about to get obliterated and the results were crazy. Within 60 days of each layoff, the CEO reported back to me: It's insane. I don't know how this happened, but the company's now operating better. I'm not talking on a relative scale, I'm talking on an absolute scale. We're putting out more features, more code. Our NPS is up, whatever it is, whatever department is performing better. The only answer for it was we've got less people, so this coordination issue is reduced.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:45:49):\nThen now in May, June of this year, we had this huge reset of valuations where growth tech stocks dropped by 50 to 90% value and all of a sudden, which we're still in and we don't know how long this can last, it's all based on interest rates so it's likely that growth stocks will be at these valuations until interest rates come back down again, which could be two to three years. These companies now they can go raise money, but it's going to be at a big down round and down rounds are very painful. So now these companies have to make sure that they don't need to raise money in the next three years. They've got to conserve cash once again.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:46:33):\nHere we are, we're in the land of layoffs again, but this time it's different. This time these CEOs know that the company actually gets better. And the CEOs that have never done this before, I simply connect them with the CEOs who have done this before and then they get convinced like, oh man, my company will be better. And now this time, people have been even more aggressive. We've had companies that have laid off 50% of the company and the results have been frankly, phenomenal.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:47:02):\nBut the key to doing it well is there has to be a humane delivery. The biggest marker that I've seen between a botched layoff and a successful layoff is at the moment someone hears that they no longer have a job, did they hear it from their manager in a one-on-one? If that's when they heard it, it'll be okay. But if they heard it in an email, in a group chat, in any kind of thing where they were sitting next to or they're hearing it along with other people, it wasn't personalized, it wasn't one-on-one, that is terrible. That's when people get really angry and that's when they start going on Twitter and going to newspapers and et cetera because it feels dehumanizing. It feels like you didn't give a shit about me. You didn't even have the courtesy to tell me to my face. Of course, there's no way to allow that person to express their emotions because they're in a group. That's the most important thing.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:48:17):\nThe second thing is then later, so tactically, this is how it happens. You have an inner circle. I think that inner circle should include all managers in the company and you say, this is how much we need to let go. Here's how much each of you needs to let go. First of all, you don't say to each department head or team leader, manager, tell me who you can let go because they'll all say nobody. You actually have to give them numbers. You have to let this dollar amount go or this many people go, dollar amount is better because if you say people, then they'll just let go of the cheapest people, the most junior, and often the most junior are the ones that are actually doing the most work. You want it to be dollars because that's actually really what you're trying to save. You're trying to save dollars.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:49:07):\nSo, you say you have to save this many dollars, come up with a number, they quickly come back with a number. You don't want to have department heads choose for managers because if you have a team lead and all of a sudden they're told to let go these three people, the team lead will go, that was crazy. Those are my three best people. So you want to let each manager choose and that doesn't need to take long. That could take 48 hours.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:49:29):\nThen you move to implementation. At implementation, you spend the morning and have each manager reach out to people and just Slack them say, \"Hey, can I talk to you for 15 minutes?\" And then they have these meetings back-to-back-to-back or as close as they can and they deliver the news, the difficult conversation that we talked about before. \"It's going to be a difficult conversation. I'm letting you go. I imagine this feels crappy or feels like worse than that. This is horrible. If you're willing to share your feelings and I want to be your agent now. I don't have time to do it now, but I'd like to schedule with you another hour tomorrow, the next day whenever, so that we can go and dig in and I can help be your agent.\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:50:12):\nThen, that takes the morning. By the afternoon, you've scheduled an all hands for the stay team. With the stay team, you'd tell them what had just occurred and you answer their questions. The questions are almost always around fear. Like, \"Holy shit, is this going to happen to me? Did these people even get feedback that they weren't performing? Does this mean that we're dying as a company and that we're going to implode?\" You have to address each one of these questions and hopefully the answer is: no, to the first one, is this going to happen to me? No, this isn't. We cut deep so that we only cut once. The people to your left and right and you, you are the state team. This is the team that we're going to building the company with going forward. It's important to be able to say that. You actually want to cut deep because cutting two times or three times creates PTSD in an organization. It's trauma one, trauma two, trauma three. Now they're like, ah, it's just going to keep happening.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:51:10):\nThen, the third piece is, and this not everybody does, if you don't do this, your company within 60 days will be performing better. If you do this, your company within two weeks will be performing better because people now, the stay team, they feel sadness, they feel anger, they feel fear. Yes, you addressed their questions in the all hands, but not fully because some people didn't even talk in the all hands.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:51:34):\nSo, what you do is with each and every person on the stay team, you have a one-on-one with their manager for one hour and all the manager does is say, \"I'd like to know your thoughts and feelings,\" and the person shares and then all the manager does is make them feel heard. I think what you're telling me is you feel sad because your three buddies are now no longer here and you feel anger because you think this is bullshit and you think why did we hire this many people if we're going to fire them? That was just irresponsible. You feel fear because you're not sure if the company's going to implode or if your job is safe. Is that right? And they're like, \"Yes.\"\n\nMatt Mochary (00:52:11):\nIt doesn't take away the emotion entirely, but it knocks it down by a good 25%, which is enough that the person won't do something rash, they won't quit, they won't stop working, they won't say bad shit to other people, and it allows them to accelerates their recovery. Within two weeks, they're now seeing how the company's operating better and morale then comes up and the company's now performing better than it was before. So, three elements.\n\nLenny (00:52:44):\nThat was thousands of dollars of advice I think, in just five to 10 minutes.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:52:50):\nThat's after having probably gone through this with CEOs maybe 40 times and iterating AB testing, and what's the difference, and what works well, and what didn't work well. Yeah, I can't imagine there's somewhat out there who has advised more people through a layoff process, certainly in the tech world, than I have. I'm not saying I'm proud of that, but it just is.\n\nLenny (00:53:17):\nWhat a fun place to be. As you were talking, I was thinking a little bit about Twitter and Elon and the experience that's going through right now. It feels like on the one hand, he's letting go of a lot of people, which matches kind of your advice. On the other hand, not being handled too well. I think it's emails and just a lot of random quick things. What's your perspective on this whole thing?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:53:39):\nI haven't been following it directly, so I don't know how he's implementing the layoffs or how much he's doing. Frankly, just haven't been following it at all. But here's the sad reality, even if it's handled incredibly poorly, the company ends up performing better. It just takes a little longer for people to recover, for the stay team to recover emotionally. But the worst case scenario, it's handled terribly, within two months, the company will be performing better.\n\nLenny (00:54:09):\nFascinating. That's actually a good segue to this last topic I wanted to touch on, which something that I think you have a lot of thoughts on is building new products within a larger company and innovating inside of a larger kind of scaled company, and especially the challenges around that. What are your thoughts on just how to do this well, how to innovate within a larger company?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:54:30):\nI can tell you the short version, but I'll tell you the long version. The long version is that this was a real problem for everyone I was coaching and I didn't know the answer. But it was obvious that YC startups were crushing and just iterating so much faster. And then I had the thought, well, why not just create your own YC startup and have it crush you but you own it? It, of course, has to really look like a YC startup. It has to have a founder mentality person as the head of the team, someone who's willing to just break glass and just won't stop until they run through the brick wall. It's actually pretty easy to find founder mentality folks. You just literally go to the YC alumni list and the ones whose startups failed, perfect, they're available and they are founder types and now they want to join a company that's actually succeeding because they realize how hard it is to create something on their own, but they still have the mentality.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:55:24):\nThen you want to keep the team really small because then they can, again, there's no buy-in required, like everyone's on the same page with the same information. We started testing that and it worked, and then I thought, well wait a second. The reason that a big company has a hard time innovating, it's because once a product is scaled, it's now got millions of users. So you have two things that you need to make sure stay true every day: the site is up and running and there's no security breach. Every time you add code, you've got to test it thoroughly to make sure it doesn't take down either one of those. The review process is insane.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:56:06):\nSo now you're innovating, you're writing prototype code on new features. You can't get it approved it takes so long. That's what you're trying to decouple and you're trying to create an entity that isn't touching the core code, but you also don't want to have to go through the approval process of the product team or the head of product. That takes way too long, as well. That's why it has to be a small team that reports to outside of EPD. It can't report to the head of engineering, head of product, head of design, it can't. It's got to go outside, usually directly to the CEO. That's the only other place to report that's outside.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:56:48):\nThen I had this idea, well wait a second, there's also a brand question and so why don't you create an entirely new name for this product that isn't the core, the base business? Why don't you actually just create its own C corp? Why don't you make it so clear that this is its own entity? So I wrote this whole thing up and created its own C corp. I shared this with a few people and one CEO said to me, \"Matt, this sounds radical and sounds like it could work, but is anyone actually doing this?\" I thought to myself, oh shit, no, nobody's actually doing this. Nobody that I know has created new C Corps for the entities, the new products they're developing.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:57:34):\nThen 30 days later, I got in a call with Wei Deng. I told you before, I'm a huge fan, and we talked about product and I shared with her this write up. She's like, \"Oh yeah, that's what I do.\" She said, \"I created five C Corps in the last two months.\" I was like, \"What? Someone's actually doing it.\" I was like, \"Well, what are the results?\" She's like, \"They're fantastic.\" She goes, \"The team doesn't worry about trying shit because they know that it doesn't hurt our core brand, and so they're iterating fast.\" And she said, \"Not only do I do that, I actually have two teams, independent, working on each new product. One I have is more engineering focused, they build custom code. The other is more sort of customer relationship-focused and maybe they don't even have engineers and they build a manual solution or they use off the shelf products to build a solution, and just see which one makes more progress faster.\" Wow, insane. That's why, again, I have so much respect for Wei.\n\nLenny (00:58:36):\nWhen I think about these ideas, I think of the NPE team at Facebook and I think it's called Area 21 at Google, which works on new ideas and I don't know if anything amazing has come out of those groups maybe, I don't know. But it feels like the missing piece, and you didn't mention this piece, is feeling like there's a huge upside if you get something. Like founders having equity of their company feels like such a motivator. I could become a billionaire if this works out, versus I'm helping my startup in some small incremental way. Is that an important piece or do you think it's not critical?\n\nMatt Mochary (00:59:09):\nI'm going to be radical here. I don't think it matters at all. I think that what really motivates people is building shit that gets used in the world. I think people will say, and they'll fight for equity and money, but in the end, that's not what actually motivates them. Because I've seen this work in companies where they don't have big equity, but they have autonomy, they have ownership, not equity ownership, ownership over decision making, ownership over creation. That's what I think people want. Amazon does this. They're not giving their people... Amazon's famous for being cheap bastards, but someone has a great idea, okay, here's 5 million bucks, go do. Amazon is definitely innovating successfully.\n\nLenny (01:00:02):\nWhat about the flip side of that of not necessarily the huge upside, but the I'm staking everything on this startup, I need this to work, this is my thing, my name's on the line. I feel like that's a big motivator also for founders, like I'm not going to give up this feeling of grit. Is that important?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:00:21):\nYeah, it's also fear. It's fear, which is like if this doesn't work, I'm screwed. Fear, frankly, is an excellent motivator. It gets people to move fast and move hard. The only problem with fear is it's also corrosive, so it eats out my insides as I go along. It makes it that I don't enjoy life, but it's highly motivated. Now, I think joy is actually even more motivating or they say it's as motivating, but it's noncorrosive, so I can last much longer if I'm doing something for joy. Fear is short term, extreme motivation. It's adrenaline. Joy is long term, consistent motivation that also allows me to look back on my life and go, wow, that was a great life. So yes, that is effective motivation, but I don't recommend putting oneself in that position to get motivated.\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\nFor companies that want to try this method that you're describing, is there a curriculum document for this approach out there?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:01:21):\nThere is.\n\nLenny (01:01:22):\nOkay, we'll link to that. Are there any other companies that are doing this well that come to mind? You mentioned Amazon, Clipboard Health.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:01:29):\nIn my portfolio, I know Scale and Attentive Mobile are both doing this well. More and more companies that I coach are starting to do this because I have more and more examples of it working well, so more and more companies are then copying. I don't have other names offhand that I can share though.\n\nLenny (01:01:43):\nWhat was that first company? Scale?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:01:45):\nScale.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\nCool. Is that Scale AI?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:01:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:48):\nOkay, cool. I love that. Love that founder. Maybe a last question, something that I noted just in case we had a little more time is around energy audit. This is something that you advise folks to understand what gives them energy, what zaps their energy, can you talk a bit about that?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:02:06):\nSure. It turns out that what we're really good at is what we love and what we love is often space and time disappear when we do it. Therefore, we actually probably don't even value it because it comes so easily to us that we don't ascribe value. Whereas things that we don't love but we're good at, we often ascribe value there and other people want us to do those things because they're often creating value for the whole team or the family or the group.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:02:39):\nThere are four zones I posit and I learned this from Diana Chapman at Conscious Leadership Group. I don't know where she learned it from, but almost everything that I have, I poached from somebody, but at least I tell you where I poached it from. The concept is you have four zones.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:02:58):\nZone one is your incompetence, you're not good at it, someone's better at it than you. That's like fixing a car. You should let someone else do that.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:03:07):\nSecond is your zone of competence, you're fine, you can do it fine. But so can somebody else do it fine. Like cleaning your house. Yes, you could do it, but it would take a lot of time and you're not creating that much value. You should let someone else do that.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:03:22):\nThird zone, your zone of excellence. This is something that you're uniquely good at, but you don't love it. This is the danger zone. This is likely what you're getting paid for and you're likely to getting paid a lot of money for it. Other people want you to do it. You are creating value, but it's also sucking the life force out of you and it doesn't allow you to become amazing and create massive value.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:03:45):\nThen there's your zone of genius. This is the thing you do that's uniquely good in the world and you don't even notice that you're doing it because you love it so much. The key is to go and look at your day. How do you move into the zone of genius? It's not that you figure out what it is and do more of that, it's that you figure out what it isn't and eliminate that and then naturally, you'll be drawn toward what it is that you love.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:04:10):\nWhat I do with the energy audit is you go through a calendar, two weeks of a calendar, a representative two weeks and you first look at all the meetings you have, but then you fill in there's time in between meetings. What were you actually doing? Take your best guess, write it in and then hour by hour, take a green marker and a red marker and each hour from Monday, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM and the same thing each day for two weeks, each hour ask yourself at the end of that hour, did I have more energy or less energy?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:04:41):\nIf it's more energy, you mark it green. If it's neutral or negative, you mark it red. Then, once you've done that for two weeks, you look at all the reds and say what's with the themes here? Oh, one on ones with people who are no longer by direct reports, team meetings where nothing was prepared in advance and everything was verbal. Recruiting meetings, interviews with people that we didn't end up hiring. Informational interviews from people that wanted to meet me and just know me but provide no value to me. These are all things that are energy draining.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:05:14):\nGreat. Now what you do is you go through each one of them and say, one, do I need to do this at all? Does it need to be done? If the answer is no, just cancel it. Two, it needs to be done, but someone else can do it. Great, delegate it to them. Three, and this is the most common, it needs to be done and only I can do it. Great, then the question is, what would make it exquisite? Well, it's the exec team meeting. I'm the CEO, I have to be in it. Well, what would make it exquisite?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:05:41):\nYou know what would be exquisite? It would be exquisite if everyone pre-prepared their update, which said how they're doing against their priorities, regular green, what they did last week, what they're going to do this week, and then they pre-route any problems they saw in the company and any proposed solution they had for those problems. If everyone did that, then we could spend the first 15 minutes of the meeting just reading, processing the decisions and we could take a three hour meeting down to a 45 minute meeting. Great, go write that up, share it with a group and say, hey gang, this is what would make this meaning exquisite for me. What do you guys think?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:06:18):\nNine out of 10 times people look at it and go, yeah, that would be amazing because they're feeling the same way. Then you go with a new methodology and it turns out to be great. That's how you take what you do each day from a lot of energy draining things into open space or energy raising things which will then allow you to start doing more and more of the things that you love. You keep doing this energy audit repeatedly, 1, 2, 3 times until your calendar is 80% green. Once that happens, magic will occur. All of a sudden, your life will become phenomenal and you will start to create massive value. I did it. That's what happened to me.\n\nLenny (01:07:05):\nI did that too actually, a simpler version where I just paid attention to what gave me energy and what didn't give me energy when I was on this journey post Airbnb and I thought I was wanted to start a company, I thought I wanted to do some advising and consulting and I realized none of that gives me energy, but writing interesting things that people like, that was fun. So I just kind of doubled down on that path and had no idea was going to make any money and it ended up making money and that's what I do now. So yeah, two thumbs up for this method and it's a more sophisticated version, which I like.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:07:36):\nRight on. That's also trusting that there will be, if you need to monetize, eventually you will be able to monetize, but you got to start with doing the thing you love first.\n\nLenny (01:07:51):\nRight. Yeah, I feel like there's a lot of people on Twitter and newsletters that are just doing it because they think this is something they will enjoy and other people are doing it. But I find that with this content life, you get on this treadmill where you have to continue producing things and if you don't actually enjoy it and it's not interesting to you, you end up just building this job for yourself that is no fun at all. Extra important if you're kind of going down this path.\n\nLenny (01:08:19):\nOne quick question I had along these lines is you're talking about how you focus on yourself and your energy and what works for you or not. And I was like, do these collide with other people on your team because they maybe get energy from something you don't? But your point is that oftentimes, everyone's like, \"Yes, this is good for me too. We should do this because it's going to help everybody feel better.\"\n\nMatt Mochary (01:08:38):\nThat's exactly right. I remember one time we did this energy audit process, I did it with Henrique and Pedro from Brex and it was revolutionary for them. It caused them to change how the two of them operated together. They realized one really enjoyed the internal meetings and the other really enjoyed the external meetings, so well great, let's just do that. It changed the trajectory of the company so much so that they said, \"Matt, would you please come in and do this energy audit with all of our managers?\" And we did. We did a big group thing and what they found was that process also changes the trajectory of the company because for everything that you don't enjoy but needs to get done, there's someone out there that loves to do it. You just got to find out who it is, and that's what happened.\n\nLenny (01:09:28):\nI was just talking to my mom who's a CPA and I'm like, \"Do you even enjoy this job you're doing?\" She's like, \"I love it. I love doing taxes. It's so interesting.\" I'm like, I'm so happy somebody out there enjoys this. I would pay anything for someone to take this off my plate. You can charge me. Because my mom does my taxes.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:09:44):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLenny (01:09:45):\nMatt, any final thoughts you want to share before we wrap up?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:09:49):\nThis was fun. Thanks, Lenny. I appreciate this.\n\nLenny (01:09:52):\nSuper fun. I feel like a sign of a great conversation is it feels like we've been talking for maybe five minutes, but also a lifetime. Maybe we'll do this again. There's like a million other questions I'd love to get into, but until then, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatt Mochary (01:10:07):\nWhere can people find me? I don't know. Don't find me. I won't be able to respond. I get too many inbounds and I can't respond to them. In terms of people helpful to me, just read the content and use it and don't pay me to coach you. Just do it on your own because you don't need to pay me to coach you.\n\nLenny (01:10:28):\nI love that. It's the first time someone's like, \"Do not reach out. I got it all for you online.\" We'll link to the show notes of the doc and everything. Matt, thank you. This was incredible.\n\nMatt Mochary (01:10:39):\nThank you, Lenny. This was great. Take care.\n\nLenny (01:10:43):\nThank you so much for listening.

There's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days. 20+ years of good sentiment burned in days. You are like a 100% beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this, a lot of people don't like you.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:00:23):\nIf you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years. Previously, 1% of the world thought I was terrible and now I feel like it's up to four or 5%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nPeople that don't know what the hell's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:00:39):\nThere's a company called WP Engine. By 2018, they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. Since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit. They started using the trademark, they're offering something called WordPress. They're referred to it as like a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nWhy do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:00:58):\nA lie gets around the world seven times before the truth has time to get out of bed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):\nToday my guest is Matt Mullenweg. Matt is the co-creator of WordPress, which powers 40% of websites on the internet today, including whitehouse.gov. He's also the CEO of Automatic, which is valued at over $7 billion and owns products like WordPress.com, Tumblr, WooCommerce, Gravatar, and Pocket Casts. There is a lot of drama these days around Matt and WordPress and within the open source community, so I thought I'd have Matt on to address many of the criticisms head-on that he hasn't addressed in other places and also just get the full story on what's going on. We also chat about what incepted him to spend over half his life at this point on open source and creating WordPress. Also, why products like Llama are what he calls 'fake open source' and his perspective on AI and open source. Also, how AI is actually trained on open source code and what that means for the future and his approach for deciding what companies to acquire within Automatic.\n\n(00:02:03):\nIf you enjoy this episode, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for auth zero and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more, that's workos.com.\n\n(00:03:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta and I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta joining me for this very short conversation.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:03:51):\nGreat to be here, big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:54):\nVanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:01):\nSure. So we started Vanta in 2018 focused on founders helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001. Today we currently help over 9,000 companies including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:39):\nThat is very much our experience before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:55):\nWe appreciate you for doing that and you have a special discount for listeners, they can get $1000 off Vanta at vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A .com/lenny for $1,000 off Vanta. Thanks for that, Christina.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:05:10):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):\nMatt, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:05:17):\nThanks, big fan and long time listener, so happy to be on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:21):\nI'm a long time fan. I've been wanting to get you on this podcast for so long and this is such an interesting time to be chatting with you, there's a lot going on with Matt and WordPress these days, so it's really interesting, almost good that we waited a little bit to talk so we're going to get into a lot of that stuff. But I want to start with just what is it that you do, Matt? What are all the things you're involved in? Give people a sense of just the things you're working on.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:05:44):\nSo first, when I was 19, I co-founded an open source project called WordPress with Mike Little and we started just blogging software, then became sort of a full site thing and then became a platform that really tons of stuff is built on and now it's kind of transitioning into this cool WASM can be embedded anywhere or run locally or make mobile apps. It's really interesting seeing WordPress used as an engine for powering things I would say don't even look like a website, which is kind of wild to me, but that's kind of the beauty of the open source people do things with that you don't expect. End up dropping out of college, moving to San Francisco and then worked at CNET for a year as project manager actually, that's how they hired me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:27):\nI want to talk about that, but go on.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:06:30):\nAnd then had this vision where instead of downloading the software and setting up a database and everything, we made a SaaS version of WordPress. I pitched it at CNET, they didn't want to do it, so I was like, \"Okay, I got to do this,\" so I left and started a company called Automatic. And the idea was to essentially compliment the core WordPress software with some commercial services, things that run in the cloud, like Akismet which is our machine learning AI, I guess you'd call it AI now, but anti-spam system, or Jetpack, which is iCloud for WordPress. It does the backups and the real time sync and everything like that.\n\n(00:07:04):\nSo that was 19 years ago, so that's now grown to be over 1700 people in actually 90 countries so we've actually been fully distributed and remote and asynchronous from the start, which I think is one of our superpowers. I actually wasn't the CEO in the beginning, but in 2014, so I guess 11 years ago, I became CEO. The original CEO was... Well, I guess I wasn't the very beginning, but then I hired Tony Schneider from BCL, probably four or five months in.\n\n(00:07:35):\nAnd yeah, so that is a very full-time thing and Automatic does a lot of products, WooCommerce, which is open source Shopify, which is now half our revenue. And then we have some really cool apps so like Beeper, DayOne, Simplenote, Rocket Casts or trying to fill up your home screens with open web, open source things that are very privacy and user-centric. So running that company is definitely a full-time job. I still run WordPress.org and the WordPress project, so I'm the lead developer there and so sort of manage all those releases in the community and the directories and all the sort of things we do on WordPress.org and this cool thing called Openverse we took over Creative Commons, which is a way you can find sort open licensed images and audio and video. So basically if you notice a throughput through all these things, it's open source.\n\n(00:08:31):\nOn the nights and weekends or side, a few hours a week I do some angel investing. So I've done over 100 angel investments through an entity called Audrey Capital, which is sort of, if anything's in the sort of WordPress space, I invest in it through Automatic, but if anything's a little more further afield I do it through Audrey Capital and have done some really exciting investments there, everything from name brands like Stripe and SpaceX, but also it was in the seat of Calm or a lot of home automation stuff like Ring, August, smart things. Yeah, just check out Audrey Capital, it's got some fun stuff in there. Daylight Computer, which is one I'm very excited about right now.\n\n(00:09:11):\nAnd I guess finally I love San Francisco, so I an a co-owner of a cool grungy jazz club in North Beach called Keys with Simon Rowe. So if Wednesday through Saturday night, you want to see some awesome live jazz, check out Keys.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:28):\nWow, okay. You said too much, I get it now. Jazz club I was not aware of, I got to check this out. It's called Keys?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:09:36):\nYeah, keys Jazz Bistro.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):\nOkay, cool.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:09:39):\nIt's over on Broadway in Columbus, kind of right around there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:42):\nAmazing. That was news to me. Going back to Automatic, I think people don't get the scale of this thing, so just to mirror back, if you think that even add to what you've said, 1700 people work there, 90 different countries. Also, you didn't share this stat, it was something like 43% of internet websites are built on WordPress, run on WordPress.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:10:02):\nYeah, so when we started, a lot of websites were built on custom CMSs and there's a lot of fragmentation in the space, but now WordPress has grown to be over 40% of all websites in the world, which is 10x the number two, which right now is Shopify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:17):\nRight, they're like at 4%. I was looking at that list.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:10:20):\nThey're around 4%, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):\nThat's unreal.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:10:22):\nIt used to be open source was the top three. Unfortunately, Jula and Drupal have fallen behind, and so now it's like Shopify, Wix, Squarespace are the top ones but WordPress is still, because we have this flywheel of open source community, its movements, any open source like Linux or Apache or Wikipedia, it has some positive flywheel effects when it takes off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):\nAwesome, okay. And then there's a few other things you didn't mention, I want to get to this later, but I'll just mention now, you guys own Tumblr, you bought Tumblr, which I don't think a lot of people necessarily know.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:10:56):\nI'm sorry, I forgot to mention that, Tumblr.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:58):\nWe're going to get into that, yeah.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:11:00):\nYeah, running a social network is definitely the hardest thing I've ever attempted. I thought we knew what we were doing because WordPress ran so much of the web, we dealt with, I thought, every content moderation thing you could ever deal with, but social networks are a whole other ballgame.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):\nOkay, a couple more fun facts before we get into some other stuff I want to chat about. Fun fact number one is you were super involved in the Bay Lights project. I didn't know this. For people that don't know what the Bay Lights, if you're in San Francisco you definitely know what the Bay Lights project is and I'm sure you love it, for people that don't know what this is about, what is this project and how have you been involved? Why have you been instrumental in to make this a thing?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:11:37):\nBay Lights, there's two famous bridges in San Francisco, the Golden Gate Bridge, which is kind of the iconic one, there's actually the Bay Bridge, which is the workhorse of San Francisco. It's one of the busiest bridges in the country. And it's really beautiful from an engineering point of view. And so kind of a vision between Ben Davis and artist Leo Villarreal, who's an amazing light artist, actually who started Burning Man was to put, gosh, I forget the number, I think 18,000 LEDs on the side of the bridge on all the cables and create this really beautiful, gentle kind of algorithmic light piece, light art piece.\n\n(00:12:18):\nAnd yeah, Ben Davis was dating an artist friend of mine and we were over and having drinks on my patio and we were looking at the Bay Bridge and I had this kind of thing where there's some lights at the top of the Bay Bridge and I was like, \"Oh, wouldn't it be cool if those lights were Christmas lights and they could do patterns or something?\" It's the lights to keep planes from hitting it. And I was like, \"Oh, you could program that.\" He was like, \"Yeah.\" It was almost like the Social Network thing where a million's cool, but a billion would be really cool. He was like, \"Yeah, that would be cool, but what if we put the whole side of it?\" And so I was like, \"Oh, cool,\" and sort of made an angel investment in that thing. They hadn't raised anything or had, I don't even think an entity at that point, but I was like to get you started, I forget what it was, 100 or 150k so I gave them that first bit and then it kind of blossomed into a thing.\n\n(00:13:07):\nAnd then sort of fast-forward, I don't remember the exact timeline, but they were kind of at a final bit of fundraise and they weren't able to close that last bit and I actually mortgaged my condos and donated the last million, million and a half to finish out that project. The Bay Lights were online for 10 years. The technology degraded, and so the environment's very harsh. So actually we just completed a fundraise and are reinstalling the Bay Lights. They're calling it Bay Lights 360. So now it'll be both sides of the bridge, it'll be visible from also Oakland and the Treasure Island because the first version, the city was very worried about the drivers seeing the lights and it might distract them so we had to angle them so that you could only see it from San Francisco, which was a compromise we didn't love because we love the East Bay and everything else like that too. So new version is coming online hopefully later this year in the fall. And also that turned into a nonprofit called Illuminate, which I'm on the board of run by Ben Davis, who I mentioned previously, that does cool public art stuff around the city. So they're responsible for the Grace Lights, all the JFK Boulevard stuff where that has some murals and the beer garden and all the chairs, that's all Illuminate. So their thing is radical public art. So it's like art that needs to be free and accessible. And I think that's so important for San Francisco. We have great institutions know the SF, MoMA, the Opera, etc, that have huge budgets like 100 million a year and Illuminate literally one 10th of that has created something that millions of people can enjoy.\n\n(00:14:40):\nAnd I like to think that anyone along the Embarcadero, you might be going through a tough time, obviously we have people who are struggling with mental health and homelessness and everything like that, but maybe seeing a little bit of art can help raise your soul a little bit. And that's how I think about philanthropy as well. You need to work on the base issues, the fundamentals at the bottom of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, and then you also have to work on the things that raise your soul a little bit, so arts. So I like that barbell approach to philanthropy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:13):\nElon has a great quote along those lines, \"You can't just work on solving problems all day, you need something inspiring to think about and to work towards.\" First of all, thank you for doing this. If you live in SF, you're like, this makes the city better, just having this around. I didn't realize you were involved in helping come up with the idea itself. I know that you did mortgaged your house to make it possible.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:15:32):\nI can't take any credit for the idea, I was exposed to it. I had an adjacent idea and they had a way cooler one with a real artist and everything like that. So I was just happy to be there. It's like being an angel investor, you can support the entrepreneurs and the people who truly do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:49):\nYeah, okay. And the other funny thing you said is about they were worried about the angle of the lights distracting people. What's funny is when I drive across the bridge, you can only see it when you're driving towards San Francisco looking backwards. So I'm looking in my rearview mirror or in the mirror turning around to the kind and it feels more dangerous, the lights shining in my face.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:16:07):\nThey call it impossible works of art. There were like 13 agencies that had to sign off, they were worried the lights would distract birds or seals or environmental reviews, and it was really a lot of public bureaucrats and to make that happen, there was 20 places where someone could have said no and it never would happen. So it's very inspiring to see the city come together.\n\n(00:16:31):\nAlso in San Francisco, I feel like is entering new chapter right now, going from the doom loop to the boom loop. I'm a big believer in the city. So much innovation has come here from food, the burrito, fortune cookies, all these sorts of things are from San Francisco to obviously all the tech innovation that we're all familiar with. It's kind of the city of the future and I don't know what it is in the water from the '60s until now, cultural innovations, things that happen and influenced the whole world, Burning Man, Grateful Dead, et cetera. That all starts in San Francisco. So it's exciting to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:03):\nLet's set the so back, as they say on Twitter. Okay, someone very close to you told me that you're an excellent rapper. I'm not going to ask you to rap, but if you ever want to answer any questions in rap form, feel free.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:17:17):\nOh man, that would be fun. I've dreamed about being able to do a Q&A and rhyme, but I don't think I'm that talented.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:26):\nPlanting the seed, I'm planting the seed. So I want to get into all the drama there in this world and right now, but I want to first lay the foundation of how you got into this and where this all came from. So let's talk about just the origin story of you and open source. More than half of your life, you've been working on open source, you've been working on WordPress, specifically WordPress is such a core community within the open source. What was kind of the origin story of you becoming obsessed and, I don't know, open source-pilled?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:17:56):\nI was a broke kid in Houston, Texas, and my passions were jazz. Houston has actually amazing music programs in the public schools, and so I was very fortunate to go to some of the best civil arts programs, including my high school called the High School for Performing and Visual Arts, where Beyoncé went, Robert Glasper, amazing folks went there. And so music was a big part of my life, and actually economics. So I had this fun teacher, Scott Roman, who participated in our school in the Federal Reserve Challenge, which was run by the Federal Reserve that sets the interest rates and backs the national banking system and everything like that, has this competition for high school students. It ended up being the first academic competition this art school ever won. And yeah, first year we kind of didn't get that far, second year we went all the way to nationals so I got to meet Alan Greenspan, Ben Bernanke was our judge, went to DC. So that was very, very exciting.\n\n(00:19:01):\nAnd so being exposed to us having a great liberal arts education, the ideas of Frederick Hayek, Agnes Smith, Alexander Hamilton, Ben Franklin, Thucydides, all these sorts of things, that philosophy really influenced me. And combine that with that, music lessons were expensive, so we couldn't really afford them, so I would barter and trade. I'd build websites for local musicians and exchange for lessons. So these websites, I would start to put software on forums or different things and that kind of exposed me to open source. So my father was also an engineer, he worked for oil companies and things, but his world was all Microsoft, it was all proprietary. And I always kind of grew up in early days of the internet, so was Slashdots and Jeffrey Zeldman talked about web standards and all these things are really kind of the social milieu and zeitgeist that I grew up in.\n\n(00:19:56):\nSo combining all this philosophy I studied, it felt that open source was actually the most important idea of our generation. If the founding fathers were around today, I think they would be open source advocates. If you think about it as more and more of our lives are influenced and actually controlled by the software we use, if we don't have fundamental freedoms attached to that software, we're not truly free.\n\n(00:20:24):\nSo WordPress is under license called the GPL, which has four freedoms, the freedom to use the software for any purpose, so we can use it for anything, whether I agree with you or not, the terms of service is you could do whatever you want with it. The freedom to see how the software works, open up the hood, see how it works, see every line of code, you can audit it. The freedom to change it is the third freedom. And then finally the freedom to redistribute those changes so you can share them. And the GPL has a fun little hack where if you share them, you have to provide those same freedoms to who you share it with. So it's called a viral open source license as opposed to the MIT license or some of the others that aren't.\n\n(00:21:03):\nSo yeah, just kind of decided that this was what I was going to devote my life to. And so that became getting involved with some early open source projects, WordPress was actually a fork of abandoned open source project called B2. So the code base actually started was something that was already out there that I was a user and contributor to kind of volunteer on the forums and contribute code. And then when it was abandoned, myself and Mike were one of four or five different forks that started that, picked it up and tried to continue it for our own use and then later for our larger community.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):\nIt feels like a lot of people are coming around to exactly your worldview in, say, I was just watching a video of Jack Dorsey talking about how we're just controlled by algorithms and we don't know how they work and we are not in control of our lives. Have you seen that video?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:21:52):\nNo, but I actually love that. Also, some people who maybe made their first billion or whatever from proprietary software then come back and it's so cool to see folks like Marc Andreessen or Bill Gurley be huge advocates for open source. I actually remember one of my early meetings with Andreessen Horowitz, Marc Andreessen. I didn't realize that at the time, Tony Schneider and I were sort fundraising and Marc really grilled us, he's like, \"How can you build a business on open source? How can you be remote and distributed? Look around Silicon Valley, Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Sun, every great company has had an office. How are you going to build something that can change the internet with people all around the world?\" And just had this long hour long debate and we walked out of that, I was like, \"Wow, that was the worst meeting ever. They just hate everything we're doing.\"\n\n(00:22:48):\nAnd then the next day they were like, \"Hey, we're interested.\" I was like, \"What happened?\" I didn't realize that he had this idea where he wanted to attack the ideas and see how we defended it was how they battle tested things. I guess kind of like a Microsoft culture or whatever where you really grill the idea, I just wasn't familiar with that. But it's so cool now that some of these folks that I've learned so much from are such good advocates for open source.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):\nYeah, it's so interesting. I just had the Community Notes team on the podcast, and that's an amazing example of open source, Meta is adopting it from Twitter/X. Speaking of open source, one of the interesting, maybe most common ways people hear about open source these days is AI and AI models, and there's a couple areas here, one is you wrote this really interesting post where you talk about how Meta talks about Llama as an open source project, but you called it a false prophet. What is it about Llama that isn't open source? What are people missing when they see Llama and they're like, \"Oh, Meta is amazing open sourcing everything.\"\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:23:52):\nLlama, you can obviously download and run locally and all these sorts of things, right? You don't have to use their SaaS service. However, there's a clause in it that says if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users...\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:24:00):\n... as if you're above a certain threshold of monthly active users. I forget what it is. It's big. It's like 750 million, so it's pretty high. You need a license from them. And so that does not give you the freedom to use the software for any purpose. If at some point you have to ask for permission, you're kind of at the whims of this company who you might be aligned with or you might be an enemy with. And also, how do you define that? So, for example, on WordPress, our products don't have 750 million monthly active registered users, but we reach billions of people per month in terms of visitors. So, is that defined? So, there's just ambiguity there. So, I still think what they've done is amazing and I like that they're releasing it. I was very confused for why they insist on calling it open source because they...\n\n(00:24:54):\nActually, Meta has been a huge open source contributor. React. They've had incredible improvements to the PHP engine, which we benefit from a lot. So, they're actually a big open source contributor. I think Mark Zuckerberg really understands and loves open source too. My best guess now, I don't have any inside information here, but I think they're calling it open source because there's some European regulation about open source versus proprietary AI models. So, I think it might be a weird regulatory thing because clearly they understand this isn't open source. When I wrote the blog post, I was just kind of confused, and thought, \"Oh, maybe if I get this message out there, they'll change.\" And then when they didn't, I was like, \"Oh, there must be something else going on. I think it might be this regulatory thing.\" We were actually a big part of, actually many, many years ago, I think it was React that they were doing something with a licensing or a patent restriction on, and the WordPress community actually got Meta to change that and reverse something they were doing to lock it down.\n\n(00:25:53):\nSo, I consider my role as an open source advocate to actually be my primary thing. And it's very much my life mission. I hope to work on WordPress the rest of my life, but also just open source in general. I also support Drupal and Joomla. Anything else that's open source, I'm going to be a supporter of because I think when people choose that versus proprietary software, we're increasing the freedom and liberty in the world. It's incumbent on us to make open source, to make a better user experience, to make a better product so that people choose it, and then the world becomes more free, not less free.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):\nIt also feels it's important to you to, I don't know, white open source washing, like avoid people using the term when it's not true. And it's interesting in this case, that the thing that makes it not truly open source is the limit. There's a limit where you can no longer use it the way you want. Is that the issue?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:26:53):\nYeah. And there's actually an open source OSI. There's a formal definition for what makes an open source license. And there's actually many dozens of open source licenses, and sort of public domain licenses and other things. So, it's also their stance that this is not an open source license.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:15):\nSomething else that I think is really interesting when it comes to AI and open source, you wrote about this and it blew my mind, such a good point, that the code that these models were trained on was open source code because that's all they have access to. They don't have Windows code, they don't have Shopify code. And what a cool, I don't know, another success story slash... I don't know. I guess, how do you feel about that, that all these AI models are trained on code you wrote in open source community?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:27:43):\nThat's beautiful. It's one of the safest things to train on, right, because the license of open source very explicitly allows that. I also like to think about I have some window where my creative output is useful to society. And if you fast forward like 50 or 100, I do believe that the utility for proprietary software eventually approaches zero. When we're sending people to Mars, the operating system of the rockets and the devices and everything like that is not going to be built on the Windows NT kernel, as amazing feat of engineering that that proprietary kernel is. It's going to be built on an open source kernel, Linux or BSD or something like that. And so if you want to be part of something that sort of becomes the fabric of humanity's foundation, like things that allows a Cambrian explosion of things built on top of it, a renaissance of ideas, you want to be involved with open source.\n\n(00:28:38):\nAnd so I really hope that more and more people... I'm a little bit of an evangelist here. I'm a missionary, where I really want to encourage more and more people to consider at least making part of their time, even if just a few hours a week, contributing to open source because you could be part of something that is a huge impact. And it's fun, especially if you're a younger developer or designer or PM or whatever, you can't walk up to Facebook and change your home page or say, \"I'd like to change this feature,\" but you could come to an open source project, some of which have hundreds of millions of users. You could go to WordPress or, gosh, Bitcoin.\n\n(00:29:20):\nOr there's all these things are open source, Chromium, Firefox, and you could actually change a feature or project management things or change the design or improve it. And that's I think really, really special. And sort of the thrill for me of knowing that code I wrote is now executing millions of times per seconds and millions of servers around the world, that kind of thrill, that high is, when I first had my first open source contribution, such a thrill. And I've been sort of chasing that and enjoying that ever since.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:53):\nSay someone wants to actually do this, where do they go? How do they do this? Do they just pick up a project, go to WordPress. org and here's how you contribute? What's a next step there?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:30:03):\nYeah, pick a project that you use or like. That's obviously a nice one. For WordPress, we have this... It's called make.WordPress.org. That's where we make WordPress. And there's different groups, there's accessibility, there's design, there's the core code, there's plugins, there's all sorts of ways. So, really whatever your talent is, there's people who translate, there's people who do support, there's people who write documentation, there's people who organize events, so whatever you feel like your talent in the world is either that you have or that you want to cultivate. I learned how to code while building WordPress basically. I didn't have too much formal training there. So, it's a great way to [inaudible 00:30:48] your skills as well, and work with some of the best developers and others in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):\nThis also made me think about AI agents are coming around, Devin and all these AI driven coding agents. Do you have a prediction at when most of the code contributed to the open source projects will be Devin and AI agents such type projects?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:31:10):\nI think Google talked about 25% of their code or characters committed are now sort of AI-assisted, and they're probably on the bleeding edge. I don't know how much of WordPress's code right now is AI-assisted or something like that. But I think over the next five years it definitely approaches maybe a majority. And I'm actually very, very excited, so one of the big challenges that we have as a very open platform is we have this open plugin and theme architecture, so the 60,000 plugins and themes and the way WordPress works is these plugins and themes can modify every single part of the code, so you can really customize everything. However, many of these plugins and themes don't have the same sort of robust security and review process that core has. So, that's where when you hear about security issues with WordPress, it's very rarely in core anymore.\n\n(00:32:03):\nWe haven't had a remote exploit, knock on wood, it's like I think five or six years or something, but in the plugins it can be somewhat more frequent. And so one thing I'm very, very excited about the next year or two is actually more automated scanning because obviously that code basis is so many tens of millions, maybe over 100 million lines of code at this point. It's impossible for humans to review that, so we kind of rely on developers to review that and manage. And of course, we have bug bounties and everything do that, so when things get reported, we fix it quickly. But I can't wait for more automated scanning there, and I think that could vastly upgrade the security of open source. The other thing that's really exciting is right now you see people building apps and stuff and it's just sort of custom generated code, but I think the next generation of these models or sort of the next layer there is because...\n\n(00:32:54):\nAs everyone knows, just writing the code is just one part of it. It's maintaining it that really becomes the life cycle of it. And Stewart Brand's new book is all about maintenance, which I'm very excited about. He's publishing, I think, with Strike. And it's actually kind of open source. He's open sourcing the book, so you can see it being written online. But anyway, to go back, I think that if... And they're starting to do that, is when the open source models you say like, \"Hey, build me a website.\" It actually installs WordPress, and then builds on top of that, and then customizes on top of that. Then you get for free that core engine that's always being audited and updated and getting passkey support or whatever the new things are sort of continuously. And then your custom stuff can be on top of that, which I think is actually a lot more powerful than building something proprietary or custom from the ground up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:43):\nI love this book concept about maintenance. My sister's partner has this quote that I've always come back to, \"Life is maintenance.\" You basically... Everything you acquire and deal with... You get a generator for your house, you have to maintain that forever now. You get this backpack, okay, now you have to maintain this thing, keep it nice, nice jacket. Everything is maintenance. Everything in your life is just maintenance. And I wonder if that's what the book's about.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:34:09):\nWell, that's why I think technical debt is one of the most interesting concepts. There's so many companies as well that maybe have big market caps, but I feel like they might have billions or tens of billions of dollars of technical debt. You can see in the interface or how their products integrate with themselves through things. And I think about that a lot in our own company. We definitely have some products, almost a little embarrassed coming on because you have such great product people. And we have some variable quality around some of our things right now. If you check out Gravatar right now, I'm actually really proud of it. It's I think a really great user experience, very slick. But there's parts of... Well, I always say, \"I'm the unhappiest WordPress user in the world,\" so there's parts of WordPress and WordPress.com that I'm a little embarrassed and ashamed of.\n\n(00:34:52):\nWe have a really large surface area that we cover with relatively few people, and so there's some parts we haven't looked at in a little while that we need to get around to. And it's a big focus for us this year, is actually kind of going back to basics, back to core, and improving all of those kind of nooks and crannies of the user experience, and also ruthlessly editing and cutting as much as possible, because we just launched a lot of stuff over the past 21 years that maybe is not as relevant today or it doesn't need to be there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):\nThat sounds like excellent work for this AI agent of the future that's coming soon. There's one other area I want to mine and that's community, community building, building this ecosystem that you've created around WordPress. It might be one of the most successful, biggest communities on the internet. I'm curious just what lessons you've learned about what it takes to build a successful community, online especially.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:35:48):\nThis is probably influenced by economics and jazz. And economics is all about systems thinking. And what are the incentive structures of how you set something up? And then in jazz is all about collaboration. So, if there's something unique I have for your audience, I would say it's don't just build a product, build a movement. And to the extent that we've been successful, I think it's that we give people something to believe in, a philosophy, a worldview. Even silly things, like we had this tagline in the footer of the WordPress.org when we started, it's still there, it says, \"Code is poetry.\" This idea that we're not just writing code, we're trying to create something that can have elements. We name every WordPress release after a jazz musician for the past 60 releases or so. So, those sorts of things bring a little art and soul and some fun into it as well.\n\n(00:36:44):\nIt doesn't have to be serious all the time. I think they can give something to believe in and work on and aim towards that's more than just a paycheck or more than just the utility, the base utility of the software. So, it's not just the software, it's also like: how are the meetups? How are people getting together? What events are you running? Are there forums? How do people contribute? Is there office hours or town halls? I do a lot of Q&A. So, what are the things you're doing around the software that's allowing people to get involved, that's inviting contributions, that's allowing people to build on top of it? I've studied platforms quite a bit like Microsoft and others, so our whole ecosystem of plugins and themes is part of what's made WordPress so successful, and the moat that we have.\n\n(00:37:33):\nThe core features of a CMS, you can kind of write with a few developers in a few weeks or something. It's not... It's basically CRUD operations, but to replicate those 60,000 plugins and themes, gosh, no one's done it. That's a huge moat. And proprietary services can create platforms. Shopify has a third-party ecosystem and things like that, but it's never a true platform. And a true platform, it's when your ecosystem makes more money than the core does. And so many times, whether it was the Facebook platform, I'm putting that in air quotes, or the Shopify platform, companies build on it and then they get the rug pulled out from under them because they're too successful.\n\n(00:38:15):\nAnd then the sort of thing you're building on decides, \"Oh, we want that money or we want that growth.\" And they sort of change the API or remove your access. There's so many examples of this, especially on, I think, Facebook and Shopify and others, where people got too successful and all of a sudden they knock on the door and they say, \"Oh, that's a mighty nice app you have there. I'd love to offer you some warrants where we own a bunch of your company or we're going to shut it off,\" or those sorts of things.\n\n(00:38:42):\nAnd again, you don't have freedom unless you're building on open source. That's why more and more companies and people are choosing... If they're going to build a business on top of something else, if you build it on an open source, you have that guarantee. Even if I grew devil horns and became evil and automatic decided to know whatever, WordPress would still belong just as much to you as it would to me. People can fork the code. They can still own it. They can still build on top of it. So, those things I think are really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:13):\nWhat a segue to all of this drama that's swirling around you these days. I think a lot of people do feel like there's devil horns that have appeared, and so I'm excited to dig into this stuff. I find that every time you go on a podcast these days, if we don't get into this, everyone's just like, \"Why is Matt not answering these questions?\" Let's get into the hard stuff. So, I'm going to ask you some hard questions. For people that don't know what the hell's going on, they're like, \"What are you even talking about?\" or just have a sense something is swirling with WordPress and, Matt, I don't know what's going on, what's just like the high level overview of what's going on?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:39:48):\nSo ,to set it, you can get WordPress from WordPress.com or us, but also you can get WordPress from dozens of other hosts. The biggest in the world are like GoDaddy, Hostinger, Newfold. It's not the biggest, but it is in the top 10 or something. It has about 700,000 WordPress installs. There's a company called WP Engine. In 2019, WP Engine started as very WordPress oriented and they contributed a lot to the community and everything like that. They were very respectful about distinguishing themselves from core, so people really realized it wasn't officially associated and everything. But in 2019 they got bought out by a private equity firm called Silver Lake. And anyone who follows business, when private equity buys something, there's some the good ones, but there's also many, many stories about how they can really hollow things out, really optimize our profits, become user hostile.\n\n(00:40:45):\nActually recently read a story where one of the reasons there was a shortage of firetrucks these LA fires was that the fire truck manufacturers have been rolled up by a private equity firm, and they've been raising prices and their supply constraint and things like that. So, there's literally a shortage in firetrucks right now because of private equity. And of course, if you look at healthcare or other things, there's so many examples of where private equity can really, I think, be one of the darker parts of capitalism. So, since 2019, WP Engine has kind of changed a bit, and they really stopped contributing to core and they started using the trademark in a way that was very confusing in the marketplace. And particularly in the past year, year and a half or so, we're just getting lot... I get a lot of support for requests for WP Engine.\n\n(00:41:36):\nAnd when we do surveys, we'd find that 20, 30, 40% of people thought they were officially associated because how they were using our logo and presenting the brand and everything like that was very confusing to people. And as you know, if you don't protect a trademark, you lose it. And also the version of WordPress that they were offering actually wasn't our core vision of the functionality of WordPress. So to save money, they were actually turning off features like revisions. So, a cool part about WordPress that... actually one of my favorite features, is every change to every single post or page is saved forever, just like Wikipedia. So, if you make a mistake, you can always undo it. And of course, as building a great product, that sort of user safety of an undo is so critical.\n\n(00:42:19):\nNow, obviously you have to store these revisions, so it takes up more database space. Now, it's trivial, it's megabytes, so on modern databases is not that big a deal. But to save money, they actually turned us off, so they broke the undo feature in WordPress to essentially save money. And so you have this thing where they're offering something called WordPress. I think I refer to it as a bastardized hacked up version of it. It's diluting our brand, and then also people think it's official. So, even close friends of mine were like, \"Oh yeah, I signed up for this thing. I thought I was supporting you.\"\n\n(00:42:49):\nAnd it's came to a head. So, past 18 months they've also... We contacted them and said, \"Hey, you need a trademark license or something if you're going to use this or change how you're doing things,\" and tried to negotiate something and had many different term sheets over the months offered and different things, and they just kept stretching it out. And I was like, \"What's going on here?\" And I think part of what was going on is last year they tried to sell the company. So, private equity usually holds things for five to seven years, so they were kind of five years into this. They tried to shop it around and sell it. They weren't able to find a buyer.\n\n(00:43:25):\nThey said, \"Well, they don't have any IP, and it feels like they're using your trademark, so they're going to have trouble with you. They don't have a license and things like that.\" So, while they were negotiating with us, it appears they were also preparing this lawsuit against us. So again, I've been very fortunate in my business career that we've invested in dozens of companies, we've acquired lots of things, by and large, 99% of the time people I've dealt with in business have been ethical, straightforward, honest. I haven't really faced any baldfaced lying or duplicitous behavior. Very, very rarely people who just say one thing and do another or are fraudulent in their behavior, but I think that was happening here.\n\n(00:44:17):\nAnd so I also just wasn't prepared for it. I was thinking I was a little naive and kind of didn't realize what was going on for a while. So, it came to a head, and at WordCamp US in September, I was like, \"Okay, well, if you're still not going to even agree to negotiate, I'm going to give this presentation about how I think both private equity has messed up a lot of open source projects in the past, and how in particular, [inaudible 00:44:46] has done some very bad or evil things.\" And they were like, \"Okay, go for it.\" So, I did the presentation. I think it was on a Thursday or a Friday. Kind of spicy. People were like, \"Oh, can't believe he did that.\"\n\n(00:45:00):\nAnd then on Monday they launched this with Quinn Emanuel, which is kind of the baddest, nastiest law firm, it's like who Elon uses when he sues people, launched this big multimillion dollar lawsuit against both me personally and WordPress.org, so the WordPress community and Automattic. And also they're spending millions of dollars a month on both lawyers and PR. So, they're doing... If you read... Oh gosh, who was the celebrity that they were recently talking about this, like dark PR stuff where they're boosting things on social networks?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):\nOh, Blake Lively and-\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:45:37):\nBlake Lively, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:37):\n... the other guy.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:45:38):\nSo, all that stuff is happening, so there's... And I warned people. I think in the presentation I say, \"Hey, there's going to be a smear campaign against me.\" And internally in the company, I was like, \"Hey, they're going to dig up everything that's ever happens. Anything bad anyone's ever said to me is going to all of a sudden become a news item.\" And that has happened. It's been true. So, right now there is a portion of the internet that does think I have devil horns and everything. Fortunately, this is not my first rodeo. I know a lot of people think like, \"Oh, Matt was nice for 20 years, and then got mean.\" But one thing, if you're really open and open source, sometimes you have to stand up the bullies, and you have to fight to protect your open source ideals.\n\n(00:46:19):\nOtherwise people could take advantage of it in a way that ultimately can destroy everything you've created. So, this is probably the fourth time the internet has decided I'm the main character or really evil. And the previous ones we don't remember anymore. It's Hot Nacho or the Easter Massacre of Themes or these are the things that aren't even on my Wikipedia page anymore, but those seemed like really big deals at the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:43):\nThose are your incidents. Those weren't like historical battles.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:46:46):\nNo, no, these are things that, yeah, I was involved in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):\nCool names at least.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:46:49):\nIncluding some things I had screwed up, like Hot Nacho was definitely a screw-up on my end very early in the WordPress side, but...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:55):\nWow.

Just what finally convinced you this was time? Was it just to go, as you described, scorched earth nuclear? Was it like WordCamp is coming up and this is the moment to go public with this? Was there something else that kind of crossed the line?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:48:24):\nIt was a unique opportunity because we were essentially saying that, hey, WP Engine isn't going to be allowed to sponsor WordCamps anymore. They're not going to be a... Because we had, again, up to that point really done everything to bring them in and have to be part of the community. So I really had to also explain to our community, hey, why we're going to be excluding this company that a lot of people saw as doing good. If you go to the WP Engine website, they have whole pages about how much they contribute and give back and how they... they do kind of greenwash or open source wash a lot of what they do. So all their marketing branding was around this positive stuff, and so I was like, \"Hey, we need to just explain this case.\"\n\n(00:49:03):\nBut yeah, again, my defaults and how we've worked with, by the way, every other company in the WordPress space, many of which are much, much larger and make sometimes billions more in revenue than WP Engine, is collaborative. So if there's a trademark violation, usually it's not even lawyers get involved. It's just like there's a email, we have a conversation, we do a call, we talk about it. That's how things get resolved and that's my default. I'm a lover, not a fighter, and that's why this thing doesn't happen very often. I like to say that, yes, if WordPress community or whatever was doing this like every year or every couple months, yeah, you should worry about it, but it kind of happens every like 10 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:46):\nSo if I could mirror back the issues that you ran into, and I want to go through this a little bit more, the problems you had with WP Engine in this case. One is they were using the trademark both WordPress and WooCommerce without license, and they're just abusing it, confusing people. A lot of people thought WP Engine was actually Automattic and WordPress official. They weren't contributing to the project. They were just making basically a bunch of money and not doing the work off this company they bought and they're just kind of hollowing it out as you described. And then they're also cutting corners, making the product worse, and that kind of reflects on the whole brand of WordPress.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:50:22):\nThat's a great summary, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:24):\nAwesome. I'm curious just which of those three, or is it something even else that most bothered you about this? What's just like, \"This is the thing that's eating me\"? If I had to guess, it'd be damaging the legacy potentially of this thing you've worked on for most of your life. Maybe it's that, maybe it's just taking advantage of the community. What's the thing that you think is the root of this, just like, \"Just this needs to stop\"?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:50:50):\nWell, I guess the one thing I'd add to your list was as this was happening they were pretending to good faith negotiate. And in fact, at one point the executive, we were talking about her joining Automattic and running WordPress out of Oregon and when she thought... the VP and she going to sell, she was thinking about what was next. So yeah, a lot of this stuff was, I think that duplicitous behavior also kind of forced us to an edge more than even those other things that you mentioned. There's lots of companies that don't contribute back and it's not as big a deal. But yeah, the legal issue was definitely the trademark thing. So what pushed it to the edge? I think just the magnitude of the issue. They would refer to themselves as WordPress Engine in client meetings and other things. They were very cavalier about how they would imply their association with the project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):\nObviously, as you can tell on socials, a lot of people are just really upset and a lot of people blame you. There's just, like I said, every time you're on a podcast or on Twitter, people are just like, \"Matt, what about this? Why this sucks? Why are you doing this?\" And I want to go through some of those things, but just not many people go through... I think you were like a hundred percent beloved hero of open source and internet and now you're in this... a lot of people don't like you. Just as a human, just what is that? How do you work through that? How do you deal with that? What's that been like?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:52:17):\nIf you were kind of inside baseball with WordPress, it's actually a lot of people who have been unhappy with me over the years, and when we introduced something like Gutenberg, people hated it. Actually when we introduced a visual editor, people hated it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):\nYou've had practice.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:52:30):\nThese are huge controversies in the WordPress history. There actually hasn't been a fork or WordPress around all this latest stuff, but there was when we introduced Gutenberg. It's one called ClassicPress where people actually forked the software. So how I would describe it is previously like 1% of the world thought I was terrible, and now I feel like it's up to like 4 or 5%. So it's still not the majority, but as you know, something negative you feel seven times more than something positive. And when people are angry with you, it's kind of like restaurant reviews or whatever, they're more likely to leave a bad review than a good review.\n\n(00:53:14):\nThe people who WordPress, 98% of all the core developers have stayed and contribute and are working on the next version and are supportive and all these sorts of things. And part of the reason these folks are so good is they don't spend all their time on Twitter and Reddit arguing with folks, and also the arguments could be... they're very frustrating because people don't engage in good faith. They don't really change their mind when new facts are introduced.\n\n(00:53:43):\nAnd so I've done my best actually because from the open source side I'm really used to engaging with things, and I think that's been one thing I've learned from this is in some forums it doesn't matter how you engage and especially if you have bots or other things running there. I'd leave comments on Reddit and immediately get like 40 downvotes. I'm like, \"Hey, this is a article about me and I'm adding a fact to the thing. Why is it getting downvoted? This is very relevant to the discussion.\" But it's literally hidden. So when you see that thread, you'd have to click like three or four times to see the comment I had left, and so it can really change the perception. And then when you read these things, I think it's just very human nature. Even folks very close to me, if you read a thread and it's all super negative, it's hard to not be influenced by that because we're social creatures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):\n100%.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:54:37):\nNow the good news is I've had lots of credibility weighted support from people like Marc Benioff or other open source leaders or the core people in WordPress, Matias, Mary Hubbard, all the core committers. The international community actually, like just in Japan, they don't care about this stuff. So these are actually, if you look by number of commits and lines of code and everything like that, the folks who actually are most crucial in WordPress. So I feel like that's been a good balance as well for me because there are days where I'm like, \"Gosh, am I an idiot?\" or it could be really down reading all these things. So that is part of what allows me to balance and get back to that sort of positive, optimistic space that I think you need to be in to do great software and great work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:27):\nYeah. The internet can be brutal. Let me go through a couple of specific things that people pointed out because I think you've been on a lot of podcasts and people haven't asked you these questions and I think a lot of people are just like, \"But, Matt, what about this? This is really bad.\" So let me just ask you a couple of things here. One is there's just like a frustration in the community around the instability that this has just caused in the WordPress community. I'll read you a couple quotes. \"Real people are receiving fewer projects on WordPress because C-suite are seeing WordPress as unstable because of this feud, and I work at Enterprise and we're very concerned about the stability of this platform and our projects.\" Just thoughts on that and the impact that it's had on the community.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:56:05):\nYeah, I think this is until this gets resolved... which by the way I hope it is soon. I think there's no business reason for this to continue. I really hope that they come to a settlement or something. We're ready. They could end this tomorrow if they wanted to. WP Engine could. We can't. We're just defending right now. So it's really incumbent on them. All of our competitors, by the way, are like, \"Great. WordPress, the king on the hill, all of a sudden we can use this.\" And so there's also not just from WP Engine, but also from all the competitors to WordPress, and all the people who would love to capture some market share, they're really leaning into this. So I've seen white papers, I've seen all sorts of things where people talk about this.\n\n(00:56:49):\nWe're actually in the next couple of days going to publish something really cool on the WordPress.org blog though that shows if you actually look at the numbers, like the activity, number of commits, plugin updates, downloads, installs of WordPress since September 20th when this all started, it's quite healthy. And so I'm not saying that there isn't examples of where someone lost a project or something like that. I'm sure it's happened. It's the internet's big. WordPress has so many millions of users and developers and everything that you're going to get some example. But by the numbers things are actually quite healthy, and in some ways it's not that there's no press is bad press, it's raised the awareness of WordPress quite a bit. So people who haven't talked about WordPress in years are now like, \"Oh, Let's talk about it.\" And so a little bit of drama I think, I wouldn't do this all the time, but a little bit can be a good thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:39):\nOkay, so one of the most common frustrations I've seen on the internet, people complaining is around the trademark. I don't know all the details, but my understanding is there's kind of a... you moved the trademark to be owned by the foundation and Automattic is exclusive rights to use the trademark. And I think people are like, \"Oh, I thought it was the foundation owned it, but maybe Matt still owns it and then you're trying to monetize it through this agreement with WP Engine.\" Is there anything you can share there that'll make people feel and see your side of the story?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (00:58:10):\nYeah, this is totally fair because it's complicated, but people are saying this has been private. This has all been very public and documented on the internet from the beginning. So WordPress.org has always been me personally, and I think because it's... part of the reason we started there is . com was not available when we started. So that's why we started on the .org and things like that. But I think people also assume .org means nonprofit or something, and that's sometimes true but it's not always. It's not a requirement of the .org domain. Then when I founded Automattic and when we did register the trademark that actually was registered under Automattic. So it used to be, for the first five years of the project or whatever, that Automattic just owned everything outright. And again, I had investors and the board and that was under the control of that.\n\n(00:59:06):\nNow, as Automattic became more successful I was able to consolidate some voting rights and other things and at least later advocate. Also remember, I was like 21 when all this was happening, so I was not maybe the most savvy about legal stuff or didn't always have the best advice. So later as I learned more, I was like, \"Oh, I want to actually take this out of the company and create a nonprofit.\" And so we ended up creating a nonprofit. Now the rules around 501(3)(C) nonprofits run the IRS are actually very strict. So that's also something as people assume, it's like, oh, doesn't the nonprofit run the software, and we applied for that originally and it was denied by the IRS.\n\n(00:59:47):\nSo we actually weren't able to put WordPress.org or the software itself under the nonprofit, but we were able to have sort of an educational purview. So what was eventually approved was sort of running the meetups and other things for WordPress, doing educational stuff. We sponsor a lot of learn to code or running workshops in other countries. We have this cool thing called do_action where we'll do a weekend where we take a bunch of nonprofits and build websites for them and stuff like that. So the nonprofit does a lot of exciting things there and then also negotiated with the investors and everyone at Automattic to actually put the trademark under the foundation.\n\n(01:00:31):\nNow the compromise there was that Automattic at this point is running WordPress.com. So to continue running that, which at the time had already tens of millions of users and everything, it needed a commercial license. And so the compromise is that the foundation would kind of own the trademark and license it out for non-commercial purposes. I had a license to run WordPress.org because obviously I need that. And then Automattic would retain the commercial license and the ability to sub-license that, so to sell that to others. So this was kind of the grand compromise and create this tripartite structure. I was very inspired by the three branches of government. So there's sort of power in each of those that I think sort of checks and balances each side of it which is on purpose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:23):\nWow. Okay, I get why it's complicated. I get why people would be confused. This makes me think about OpenAI had a really strange structure and that got them in a lot of trouble, and it feels like when you're 21 you're like, \"Oh, this makes a lot of sense. What a great concept we've come up here,\" and then all this complexity just adds to a lot of confusion around what's going on. So thank you for addressing that. Another, there's a kind of related question I've seen a couple of times is just why don't you let that .org be run by a community. Why not just give that up to someone else and not just you that's there?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:01:53):\nYeah, and the frame of that question is kind of interesting because it implies I'm the only person making WordPress which is obviously not true. If you look at the daily commits and activity and everything, it is run by the community. So it's hundreds of volunteers every day that are actually doing the day-to-day work and making the daily decisions and everything happens. So there has been a radical delegation. However, there's ultimately a hierarchy, and I'm the CEO, so I'm like the final final decision-maker.\n\n(01:02:24):\nAnd so I think what people advocate for around this governance point of view is like, okay, well, install a board on top of you that ultimately makes decisions for the product or things like that. And there are other open source projects that have this structure. None of them have been successful as WordPress. So I think your audience in particular, is great software ever created by committee or does it more often reflects a vision of a leader or something that can allow us to... and I think particularly WordPress not just remaining relevant but actually accelerating growth over huge technological shifts over the past two decades.\n\n(01:03:12):\nWhen we started there was dynamic web apps or DHTML or JavaScript wasn't really a thing, and then the social web and then iPhones and then all this sort of stuff that's changed over time, and we've surfed a lot of these technological changes which is very, very hard to do. Most products do not remain relevant over multiple generational changes like that, and that's been because sometimes we've had to make very unpopular decisions. Gutenberg is a huge part of why WordPress is relevant today, and it's actually an open source project we do. It's the block editor. It's actually bigger than WordPress because it's not just used on WordPress, it's used on every WordPress site, but also like Tumblr, other people. I would actually love if Squarespace or Wix adopted Gutenberg. It's meant to be like a really open source framework.\n\n(01:03:56):\nBut anyway, if we had voted for whether we should do that or not, everyone would've voted against it or the majority would have. It was really a few core people of us in the community, Matias, myself, other core contributors, Ella, Andrew Ozz, that said, \"Hey, this is the future and it's going to take 10 years to do and it's going to be a long bet. It's going to suck for the first three or four years, and so everyone's going to hate it in the beginning.\"\n\n(01:04:20):\nBut then later with iteration, we've had I think now 200 releases of Gutenberg. We do sort of a very strict every two weeks release schedule since it started. It's going to get pretty good, and it's at that point now where it's actually getting pretty darn good. And the next phase of it, actually I'm so excited about, it's going to be collaboration. So all the real time co-editing like Google Docs and Notion has, it's coming out to this open source thing, and with the technological changes, we're actually able to do it peer-to-peer. So we don't need a centralized server. We can use WebRTC and other cool technologies.\n\n(01:04:49):\nI mean, anyway, I'm going sidelining, but I think that sort of more... and if you look at a lot of great companies, there's a board or whatever but ultimately there's an executive, and some of the most iconic companies of our generations are ones where the executive retains some majority of voting control or other things like that which I've been able to do with Automattic and with WordPress. And I definitely think about succession planning and everything like that, but if or when I'm gone I don't want to pass it to a committee. I want to pass it to someone else who can have a role similar to mine and really sort of try to be a steward.\n\n(01:05:34):\nThere ultimately is a check and balance on that because, again, the community could leave. They could fork the software. People could change. And so you're \"in charge\" quote, unquote, but you're also at surface. So it's a lot more being like a mayor than a CEO and that you ultimately are accountable to the folks who are contributing and new users and everything like that. So I do feel like there is a balance there. Some of this as well is that there's some people who aren't part of leadership who feel like they should be. So if you look at the Yoast or Korean things, these are folks who actually don't have commit status. They haven't contributed WordPress over the years and serve our normal hierarchy of the meritocracy of how you get the ability to commit code or things like that. They're like, \"Hey, I want to lead a release.\" That's cool, dude, but there's a process. We have different people lead releases over the years, but they kind of worked their way up to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:28):\nThis makes so much sense to me. That's one of the themes of the podcast, just the power of a singular visionary and leader, founder mode as we've all heard is trending these days.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:06:38):\nYou made famous, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:40):\nI wouldn't say that it was. Yeah, Brian shared it, but then Paul Graham pointed afterwards and then I renamed the title of that episode Founder Mode to [inaudible 01:06:49]\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:06:49):\nI really want your [inaudible 01:06:50]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):\nIf I zoom out, what I'm sensing here is there's people that have this ideal of how something like this should run, but they've never actually worked at a place where a nonprofit board runs it, runs a thing, and have seen what that actually looks like. And so I think there's a big disconnect between the ideal in theory and how does great stuff get built.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:07:11):\nAnd one of the things I think we've tried to demonstrate with WordPress is actually it's kind of like a open source side and a nonprofit side and a for-profit working in concert. And one of the things people don't necessarily appreciate as much about why WordPress has been so successful is because of Automattic and things like Akismet doing anti-spam or WordPress.com having a free version of WordPress that is introduced over a hundred million people to the software in a way that you could just sign up for free. You don't have to pay for hosting or download it yourself or things like that.\n\n(01:07:43):\nSo that kind of for-profit, nonprofit, open source, working in concert I think is a really interesting model that we're starting to see a lot more companies do. It's actually very exciting to me that some of the things that were controversial when we started open source or distributed work are now the default for so many exciting new startups, and this whole ecosystems of really, really cool open source, like Cal.com for open source Calendly. There's so much cool stuff out there that actually there's a whole generation of younger entrepreneurs that I find very, very inspiring because they're also bringing modern design and web development and everything to open source which is very neat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:21):\nI anticipate a blog post one day, \"I told you so, guys.\" Open source, remote work, I imagine there's a few more things there. There's one other thing I want to address. I haven't seen you talk about this. It comes up a bunch. It's around, this is very the weeds, but I think it's really important to people, and there's something here for a lot of people, the way you guys forked Advanced Custom Fields. So I think what happened here is you guys forked an existing plugin, I think somebody else's plugin, and then kind of pushed people to this plugin versus the original plugin. What can you share there?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:08:55):\nYeah, this is very complex. So WordPress.org has kind of like a app store. After WP Engine started suing us, creating millions of dollars of legal fees and things, we blocked their access to WordPress.org. So this plugin they had, Advanced Custom Fields, wasn't able to be updated. At the same time a number of security issues were found in it, including some we reported, and so there had to be an update to it. So we're like, \"Okay, we'll ship the update for you essentially.\" And then we were like, \"Okay, I think we need to call it something different because it actually isn't theirs anymore.\" And they still offer Advanced Custom Fields on their own and people can download it from them, et cetera. So we made Secure Custom Fields which was originally under the same directory listing, so again, because we want all the users of it to get the security updates. This is controversial, and actually they actually got a preliminary injunction, so the judge said \"Reverse this.\" So this has all been reversed by the way.\n\n(01:10:04):\nThere now is a separate fork under separate listing of Secure Custom Fields which actually we have a team on it, developers, designers, and we're creating... just like WordPress was a fork, we've actually forged this. Actually WooCommerce was a forge. A lot of things are forks. So we forked it and now have a new name, new everything that we're doing a lot of product innovation and improving it. So there's a separate project now and separate directory listing for Secure Custom Fields. That's kind of fast-forward to today. They now have access to WordPress.org again. They have updated the plugin. Everything's back to how it was before, and there's now this separate thing called Secure Custom Fields that the WordPress project is officially supporting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):\nSo I'm hearing essentially you blocked WP Engine as a part of this, we're just going to simplify WordPress, reduce confusion. They're being bad actors in the space, so we're going to block them, and in that block, there's like a dependency where people couldn't do a thing that they needed to do. So you're like, \"And the one that exists, there's a problem with it, so we're going to make that dependence... release a version that you can actually use and fix the security issues.\"\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:11:09):\nThat was the intention. I think that there was a lot of perceptions around it that were different, but yeah, that was the goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):\nOkay. Okay. Great. So maybe just the last question. We talked about just a lot of people see you with devil horns these days. They think you're doing bad things and they don't like the approach you're taking. You talked about there's this WP Engine spending a lot of money on PR and hiring this agency. I guess is there anything else that... why do you think so many people are looking at you as the bad guy? Is it mostly that you think... just where do you think it's coming from? Why are comments always so negative? And we talked a bit about it, but anything more there?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:11:46):\nI don't know if I can say why. I do think one thing I've learned is that a lot of these things we've talked about are nuanced. So one essentially thing I've learned in this process is that it's hard to explain this stuff in 240 characters or the-\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:12:00):\n... 40 characters. Some mediums do not lend themselves well to discussing this. And so I tried, but I'm participating less in Reddit or Twitter and trying to do more long form things like this, where you can actually have the context and things can't be taken out of context. Also, I think there's something where social networks sometimes are tuned to promote outrage. And it was very interesting. We ran a sentiment analysis recently. We were kind of looking at different social networks, analyzing all the comments, and we found, actually, that the negative, the sort of devil horn fraction on, what was it, like LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram was like 8%. It's actually pretty small. On Reddit, it was bigger, I forget the exact number, but on Twitter it was 52%. You're like, whoa, what's going on there?\n\n(01:12:53):\nAnd so there's something in the algorithm, and again, we can't see how the algorithm works or what the incentives are, but it can promote the most controversial things. I think that's not a novel perception. There's a lot of discussion around how social media might be creating more fragmentation in society, and I think this is just an example of that, where when you have networks, when people are getting the majority of the information from social networks, and those networks are not designed to provide nuance or balance, or even promote truth necessarily, misinformation can get spread far more than... What's the saying? Like a lie gets around the world seven times before truth has time to-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):\nGet out of bed.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:13:31):\nGet out of bed, yeah. There's been a lot of that. So there's actually been a lot of misinformation, untrue things that go viral, and then the untrue thing gets like 700,000 views, and the correction gets like 20,000 views. So there's been some of that happening. When mainstream media has covered this, it's actually been a lot better. So there's been some actually really good articles in some business publications and other things that sort of look at a more nuanced and balanced view. And I think the podcast have been pretty good, but definitely on Twitter, I think you can get a version of all of this that is both, I think, not entirely true and also pretty more negative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):\nYeah. I imagine people are going to be like, \"Lenny, you didn't ask him this thing. Here's the thing he said that I want to learn more about.\" I'm sure I missed some stuff, but from an outsider's perspective, this all make sense. There's a company, I don't think PE companies are bad innately, but their job is buy a company and make it run more efficiently, and then oftentimes sell it for more. So it makes sense that they buy a company, make it more efficient, cut some corners, don't put a lot of effort into making it awesome, even though I'm sure there's awesome people working in there, trying really hard to make it great. And basically what I'm feeling is they got to a point where this is hurting the ecosystem. They're feeling really dishonest with working with you, and there's a stalling technique. And so, makes sense to me why you just have to stand up and fight back. And it's hard, it's hard to do that. Is there anything else along this thread before we move on to a different topic, anything else you want to share before we close out this chapter?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:15:15):\nWell, if people have more questions, they can come to WordCamp Asia. We're going to do an open Q&A there. We do town halls in the WordPress.org Community. There's a Slack people can get on and ask questions. So there is kind of a lot of open ways to engage, and I'm definitely happy to do that. I'm probably not going to do it on Twitter as much, but when there's longer form opportunities to have a discussion here, particularly if it's more like real time, like this, I'm very happy to.\n\n(01:15:43):\nAnd that's why if you look at it, there's actually a big difference. WP Engine has not done any podcasts and no press. They don't respond to journalists, they don't talk about this. And I've done the opposite, where I'm really trying to be out there and engaged. And everyone's like, \"Why don't you just let the lawyers do the talking?\" And it's like, well, but we have community, and also I feel like we're in the right. So when you're in the wrong, you probably say only have the lawyers talk. When you're in the right, I think you should be out there and telling the story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:10):\nI remember at the end of your WordCamp talk, you were like, \"Any questions?\" after this big controversial talk, and I'm curious how it felt. All the questions initially were nothing to do with this. It's what it felt like. You're just like, oh, they already had these questions. They didn't even know what you said maybe, and I bet you're just like, wait, did anyone hear what I just said? Did it feel like that?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:16:28):\nWell, also, that's really like a WordPress community event, so it's a lot of the core developers and things, so they have WordPress questions, so that is something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:37):\nYou're like, hello.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:16:38):\nI've now done hundreds and hundreds of these town halls and QAs, and I really enjoy it because you never know what's going to come up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:42):\nYeah, okay. I want to talk about all the companies that you bought and will buy in the future. It's kind of like you're building a little Berkshire Hathaway. I think you've described it that way. It's kind of what it's feeling like. And Tumblr is really interesting. Until I started prepping for this, I didn't even know you guys own Tumblr. I haven't heard this story. Why did you guys buy Tumblr? What is going on with Tumblr? It was like a big deal back in the day. What is the current state of Tumblr? What is the story there?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:17:10):\nOh, Tumblr is so interesting. At the time, I think it was one of our best competitors. They created this really amazing sort of hybrid of blogging and social networking. And if you kind of zoom back, a lot of things that are now standard on other social networks, even the ability to embed an image with a post, again, it was not supported originally on Twitter and other things. Remember they used to have, what was it, like tweet image, or you have to linked out to other things to post an image to Twitter. It wasn't native functionality, and Tumblr had these multiple post types. You could post a chat, an image. They were, I think, one of the first to support video, so they did a lot of, I think, product innovation under the leadership of David Karp, who's a really amazing entrepreneur and product leader.\n\n(01:17:54):\nFunny story, both David and I were at CNET at the same time. They had hired both of us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):\nWhat an alumni group at CNET.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:18:02):\nThey could have kept both of us probably. But anyway, the Tumblr, I forget the year, but they sold, I think the same time that Instagram did, for a similar amount, $1.1 billion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):\nTo you or to someone else?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:18:16):\nInstagram bought by Facebook, obviously.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:19):\nRight, right. Tumblr.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:18:20):\nAnd Tumblr bought by Yahoo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:21):\nOh, wow.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:18:22):\nWho was at the time, again, Yahoo, we don't think about it now, but I feel a little old. But at the time, Yahoo was one of the internet giants and had recently Marissa Mayer, who was one of the big early people at Google, I think part of creating the API program and everything like that, was the CEO of Yahoo. This was, I think, one of her first big acquisitions.\n\n(01:18:46):\nNow subsequently, obviously ,we know how Instagram went. I think people were like, \"I can't believe you bought this for a billion dollars.\" And obviously now it's worth hundreds of billions. So that's had a really good trajectory. At Yahoo, I think things became more challenged. So again, this is a little bit of history, but Yahoo then had this thing where they owned part of Alibaba, which then became more valuable than the rest of the company. They had activist investors. I think they had some CEO switches. I think Marissa Mayer leaves or gets fired at some point. There's all this turnover, and I think Tumblr really languished under their ownership. And from what I can understand, the team was actually held back a lot from things they wanted to launch or ways they wanted to iterate. Then Yahoo merges with AOL, which is another kind of early internet thing. That goes for a little while. So again, then Tumblr's just kind of stuck underneath this stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:43):\nTumbling along.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:19:45):\nTumbling along. And then that gets bought by Verizon. So fast-forward to 2019. Verizon wants to get rid of Tumblr. And so they're kind of putting it up for sale and had a number of bidders. Automattic ended up buying it for a de minimis amount. I think it's been reported we bought it for $3 million.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:10):\nWhat a deal. 3 million.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:20:14):\nBut obviously, that represented a lot of value destruction over the years. Tumblr had had some tough times. They actually were banned from the App Store at one point for not moderating things well enough and having maybe a little too much porn. Obviously, Twitter [inaudible 01:20:31] porn. They maybe were a little too out there with it, and we're doing a good job filtering it and keeping away from App Store reviewers or whatever. And so Verizon, to their credit though, there were people bidding more. Actually I think a porn company was bidding on Tumblr that would've paid a lot more money. They really were looking for an acquirer that they felt like would be a good steward. From my point of view, I had such incredible respect for Tumblr as a product. And the community, still, despite all of this sort of stuff that had happened, I think at that point still was like, I forget the exact number, but call it 15, 20 million monthly active users.\n\n(01:21:14):\nSo really, sort of active core. And one of the things that's so fascinating is over half of that user base was under the age of 25. And actually had a huge, I think, it was like 25 or 30% LGBT+. I think a very unique place on the internet, where people could have a social network where they could be anonymous, they could put on different identities, they could be someplace their parents weren't, like Facebook or Instagram, really still could take a special spot. So we ended up buying it. Now, people are like, \"Oh, you bought it for $3 million.\" But we bought it sort of taking on all liabilities, including, I think they were under investigation by the FTC, there were lawsuits. There was all this sort of stuff. So it was free like a puppy, not free like-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):\nFree like beer.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:22:05):\nHad a pretty big team, I think 185 people. We were taking a lot of burners, burning a ton of cash, and that was 2019. And so, it's been, I think, a humbling experience running a social network. It was very, very different from all the other products that we've done. And I think there's some incredible things about Tumblr and that I'm still very excited about. So where WordPress has primarily a desktop and web user base, Tumblr is obviously like 85% app-based, has a younger demographic. And so part of the vision that now we're executing on is actually we wanted to create a path for people using Tumblr to actually it being powered by WordPress on the back end. So Tumblr users could unlock themes, customization, plugins, et cetera. Actually, we're in the process right now of migrating the half a billion Tumblr sites to WordPress, probably one of the largest data migrations-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:58):\nThat makes sense.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:23:00):\n... that's happened in a while. So we're kind of trying to do this in a way that's invisible to users on the front end, so changing at the back end while maintaining the APIs and the interface and everything. So it's a fun engineering project. I kind of posted this kind of call to arms, got a lot of fun people applying for Automattic, and we hired a lot of great folks around this sort of audacious project, this big hairy audacious goal. And so that's where it's at now. I've sort of ran it personally for a few years while we're doing turnarounds, but there's a great team there, but still challenged, still not profitable, so we're still subsidizing it from the rest of Automattic's businesses. Fortunately, the rest of our business have done really well, so we were able to do that, but I definitely want to get to a place where it's sustainable.\n\n(01:23:46):\nAnd one of the things we're also experimenting with is can Tumblr have not just an advertising-driven model? I think ultimately the incentives of advertising social networks can lead to the kind of dynamics that you see on the more negative side of Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, et cetera. And so really trying to create a subscription model or a sort of first-party user-driven advertising, where you promote your blog posts or something like that, or you promote a WooCommerce product or something, where it's not a third-party ad ecosystem, which I think has a lot of weird code and malware and lots of stuff I don't love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):\nWow, sounds like a lot you took on with this acquisition, and I love that you said you ran it initially. So this is a good segue to maybe my last question. I'm curious where this goes. Just how do you... Well, let me zoom out. There's a lot of people these days that are excited about roll of businesses. I'm going to buy a bunch of companies, make them better, make them awesome, save money, and then just keep building this holding company sort of thing. You guys are doing that, and it's working well. What do you look for? How do you decide a company's right for Automattic? What are the factors that are like, we should buy this, we can turn this around and turn it into a big success?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:24:58):\nI don't know if I would do another turnaround like Tumblr again, or at least not for many, many years. It's definitely a different thing. The vast majority of things we acquire, it's simply something that's done well, and we want to accelerate it, or sometimes acqui-hires, where we're plugging it into one of our existing projects, or we're taking the team and putting them on something we're already doing. So it's a really talented team. Tumblr, I think we ended up ultimately replacing 85, 90% of the team as well. So that's just very different. So I do think there are different ways of doing it, but if you look at our other acquisitions like Day One, et cetera, founder's still here, many years later, we're accelerating stuff like that. We brought it to Android, we're bringing it to it to web. It's more of taking something good and making it better. And probably our best example there is WooCommerce, which was a small company, I think 35, 40 people, based out of South Africa, and has obviously grown to... Again, I said Automattic makes about half a billion dollars a year now, and WooCommerce is a majority of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:06):\nSpeaking of that, actually, you haven't shared the revenue number. I know it's public. Just give people a sense of Automattic's revenue. Can you just share those numbers? Because I think it might blow people's minds.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:26:15):\nYeah, I think we say publicly it's about a half a billion dollars in sort of ARR revenue right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:20):\nIncredible. Okay. I have a question for you. It's kind of a hot seat question. As you talked, I wonder, I feel like people are thinking of this. So you've been talking about PE companies being often bad. You're buying Tumblr. You've talked about laying off a bunch of people, turning it all around. How's that different from a PE company, Matt?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:26:39):\nYeah, and I agree with you that just because it's private equity doesn't mean it's bad. And also, something people say is like, \"Hey, wait, don't you have private equity investors as well at Automattic?\" And we do. Now, they own usually a small percentage, sometimes under 1%, and they don't have control of the company. So I think there's a distinguish. Is it a minority investment or a control investment? And with WP Engine, Silver Lake controls the company. And when they control the company, I think there's a spectrum of actions. Obviously, being more efficient is great, and we should all strive for that. And I think every business does, whether it's private equity or our business or things that are founder controlled. You always want to be more efficient. Now, there's some spectrum there where you over-optimize, or you could have dark patterns. Right now on WP Engine, it's very difficult to cancel your accounts. Actually, I think as of today, 45,000 sites have left, so they're, I think, down to 600. Yeah, well, because their customers have realized like, \"Hey, this isn't WordPress, this isn't...\" or, \"They're suing the guy who started WordPress, so maybe we should not support this commercially.\" So we have the site wordpressenginetracker.com that sort of shows in real time the sites that are leaving. It's kind of an exciting thing to see that number tick up. Actually, maybe a good example as well, even though there's a lot of negativity, you actually look at how people are voting with their wallets. They're leaving.\n\n(01:28:07):\nSo I think you have to judge as well, just look at the track record. So one of the things I'm very proud of with Automattic is we are an acquirer of first resort, and we have founders that have sold to us. Paul Mayne at Day One is a great example that didn't need to sell. They're wildly profitable, could have run it himself for a long, long time, but people choose to join because they feel like we'll be good stewards of it in the future, and ultimately just have to look at the track record.\n\n(01:28:36):\nSo I think don't judge it by what it's called, judge it by the actions over time. And I hope to continue building that reputation for a place that's a good steward of communities and software and everything else for many years to come.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:52):\nMatt, we covered so much. I asked you all the hard questions and more. Before we wrap up, is there anything else that you want to leave listeners with? Any last thoughts, comments, insights, stories?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:29:04):\nYeah, follow me. I'm at photomatt, P-H-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, on Tumblr, Twitter, Instagram, everything like that. I post a lot about other stuff. I post a lot about AI and open source and other things. Some WordPress things in there as well. I have these life missions to democratize publishing and commerce. We added a new one last year, which is messaging, so it's in beta mode right now, but relaunching in a few months as a product called Beeper, which takes all your Telegram, Instagram DMs, Signal, everything, brings it all into one app. And you can do some really cool stuff like that, and especially when you start to imagine search or AI, local AI around that. So very, very excited about that relaunch. So I encourage people to, you check out the beta now, go to beeper.com/beta to get the new version, and we're going to relaunch that later in the year.\n\n(01:29:50):\nSo yeah, I'm very excited about that. It's kind of fun to be working on something that's at the stage where WordPress was in 2003, 2004. So WordPress is quite mature at this point. WooCommerce is kind of where WordPress was in 2010. And then the Beeper stuff, the messaging stuff is where we were in 2003. So one thing that keeps me excited is working at different stages of this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:12):\nThis feels like a reason to be doing your approach to Berkshire Hathaway is just stay active in early stage stuff and not just optimize established things. So it's beeper.com, by the way, awesome domain name. Photomatt, what's the story of photomatt? You're into photography, I imagine, is the story?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:30:32):\nYeah, it's a little bit of a pun. So a fotomatt is also, F-O-T-O-M-A-T-T, is a place that you would go to develop your photos back when you would have film and develop things. So originally my username was Saxmatt because I played the saxophone. Sometimes people mishear that. And also, I started traveling so much. There's been years I do like 400,000 miles of air travel, because I go around the world to go to WordPress events and meet the community. And as a distributed company, we do lots of meetups. And so, it became hard to carry my saxophone around. So my method of artistic expression became photography, and that's actually kind of how WordPress started, was actually originally a site where I could share my photos before Flickr, before Facebook and everything like that, sort of use this gallery software, actually open source gallery software, PHP software, to sort of share all the photos I was taking.\n\n(01:31:25):\nAnd actually now on my website, I think I have over 38,000 photos I posted. And yeah, it's still one of the things I really love. So it's also a username that was available everywhere, and I still do it. So I'm actually going to the Maha Kumbh Mela, the big 300-million-person gathering at the Ganges River in a few weeks. And one, I'm just excited to experience that, it happens every 12 years, but two, I'm just really excited to take some time to do photography. And yeah, I really enjoy it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:56):\nYou forgot to mention your website and your blog, your WordPress site itself, where you blog. Ma.tt, is the domain, which is amazing. I will point people to one of my favorite ritual you have on your blog, which is you share what's in your bag, you talk about how you travel all this, and I think every year you're like, here's the gadgets I use most and bring with me everywhere.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:32:18):\nIt's my most popular post of the year by far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:20):\nI'm not surprised. You need an Amazon, just buy everything button. Yeah, because basically you're just trying to optimize for the least weight and most utility, right, out of all these gadgets that you're bringing with the on trips.\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:32:33):\nYeah, actually weighing it is something I just started doing this year because my bag actually got really heavy, got like 35 pounds or something. And so, some friends were like, \"Hey, why don't we weigh everything and just go through.\" So now I'm posting the weights.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:45):\nOh my god. Okay. Anyway, we'll point people to that. Matt, thank you so much for doing this. This was awesome,\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:32:50):\nLenny, thank you so much. And I really appreciate the ability to discuss these things in a longer form. And also just your audience. Oh, I guess final thing I'll say is we're hiring a ton. So you have one of the most incredible audiences in the world. I recommend your podcast and newsletter to a lot of my colleagues. And so, if you're someone who loves this kind of stuff, I think there's a big opportunity at Automattic to have an impact on these things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:11):\nWhat roles are you hiring for most and where do people find these roles?\n\nMatt Mullenweg (01:33:15):\nAutomattic.com, A-U-T-O-M-A-T-T-I-C. There's a Work with Us page. You can kind of see how we work. We're fully distributed and can manage that forever. We sort of started that. Another interesting thing is we actually pay the same salaries globally. So whether you're in California or Italy or Nigeria or wherever, we pay global salaries. So yeah, a lot of opportunities, and we're hiring for kind of everything, I would say, but particularly people with great design or product skills is probably one of the areas that you can have the biggest impact at Automattic right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:53):\nAll right. If you made it this far into the podcast, you should definitely apply. Matt, thank you. Thank you for being here. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "title": "How to tell better stories | Matthew Dicks (Storyworthy)",
  "transcript": "# How to tell better stories | Matthew Dicks (Storyworthy)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:00:00):\nEveryone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers. Because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind, that risks them getting picked off, right? Getting picked off by some predator. But the alternative is you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. I mean, how many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway, you really can't remember anything that they said? Because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart or facts or statistics or platitudes or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten. 100%. You will be forgotten.\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Matthew Dicks. Matthew is the author of my All-Time favorite book on storytelling Storyworthy, which a previous guest of the podcast recommended to me and I couldn't put it down. So I reached out to Matthew and got him on the podcast. Matthew is a 59-time Moth Story Slam winner, and nine-time Grand Slam champ. He's also the author of nine other books, including fictions, rock operas, even a comic book.\n\n(00:01:20):\nIn his day job, he is an elementary school teacher and on the side teaches both individuals and teams at companies like Slack, Amazon, Lego, and Salesforce. The skill of storytelling and public speaking through his company speak up. In our conversation, we get very tactical about how to tell better stories both in life and in work, how to feel more comfortable speaking on stage, how to come up with story ideas that you can deploy when the need arises. Why every good story is centered around one five-second moment of transformation and so much more. Matt is an incredible human being and I am excited to spread his message more widely. If you're interested in this topic, definitely pick up his book, Storyworthy. It'll change your life. With that, I bring you Matthew Dicks, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:09):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date, conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is companies like ScaleAI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences. From embeddable, CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53, and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, Oneschema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at Oneschema.co/lenny.\n\n(00:03:15):\nThis episode is brought to you by Maui Nui Venison, a mission-based food company, bringing the healthiest red meat on the planet directly to your door. I actually joined Maui Nui Venison earlier this year after hearing their ad on the Tim Ferriss podcast, and I'm excited to be spreading the message further. Not only does this company provide the most nutrient-dense and protein-dense red meat available. Their operation produces the only stress-free 100% wild-harvested red meat on the market. That is the only one of its kind in the world.

I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:33):\nI'm even more excited to have you on. The way I found out about you is a previous guest mentioned your book as a book that really transformed the way they think about storytelling and even marketing. And I completely agree. It's the most tactical, practical, also just entertaining book on just how to tell better stories. And when I was reading, I was just like, \"Hey, what if I reach out to the author of this book and see if he'd come on?\" And here we are.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:04:55):\nI'm thrilled to be here, and I appreciate what you had to say. I tried to make my book as actionable as possible. I think the only reason I'm successful in what I do is that I've been a teacher for 25 years and I'm a storyteller. So the two of those things come together pretty well for me.\n\nLenny (00:05:12):\nOkay, so I thought it'd be fun to start with maybe the most mind-expanding takeaway I got from this book, is this idea that all good stories are rooted in this five second moment of someone's life. Can you just talk about this insight and maybe share an example or two to make this real?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:05:28):\nSure. Well, that is true what you just said, which is essentially every story is about a singular moment. I call it five seconds. It can be one second honestly. It's a moment of either transformation, meaning I'm telling you a story about how I once used to be one kind of person and now I'm a new kind of person. Or more common is realization. Which is I used to think something and then some stuff happened and now I think a new thing. And those changes they take place overtime. Or really what happens is it's an accumulation of events and feelings and thoughts that ultimately result in a singular moment where that flip actually happens. And I think that's true for almost everyone. It feels like it took a long time, but there really was one second when you thought one thing and then the next second when you thought the new thing.\n\n(00:06:19):\nAnd the purpose of a story is essentially to bring that moment to the greatest clarity possible to the audience. So that the audience can, in a way experience that flip that transformation or realization along with the storyteller. So 98% of the story is the context to bring that singular moment into fruition. And that is true for stories that we tell out loud, stories we tell on the page, novels that I write, movies that I watch, television shows that I watch, all of the stories of the world that are worth hearing and truly just about every story told that qualifies as a story has one of those moments.\n\nLenny (00:06:58):\nThat's a big statement. Is there an example too, you could share of either stories we know or just tell a short story, whatever is easier to give people like, oh wow, you're totally right?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:07:06):\nSure. Well, I'll tell you one that happened actually today. How about that?\n\nLenny (00:07:09):\nAmazing.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:07:10):\nSo I'm teaching math today. I'm an elementary school teacher and I'm teaching math, and I have a student in my class, her name is Eileen, and she's one of those kids that I worry about a little bit because she's got some anxiety. So she's not the most confident person in the world. And in September I was aware of this. So I've been working really hard at building confidence with her. And so today we're doing some math and I'm calling kids to the board, and I'm looking at Eileen and wondering, is today the day? Am I going to call Eileen to the board? Because doing so, there's a risk, there's inherent risk that she could be upset, she could embarrass herself in front of the class in a way that means something to her.\n\n(00:07:52):\nAnd I just wasn't sure. So I didn't call her to the board. And so at the end of the math lesson, I wandered over to her desk and I said, \"So Eileen, I was thinking about calling you to the board today, but I just wasn't sure if you're there yet. What do you think?\" And she said to me, \"First of all, I don't like that cheeky smile of yours.\" And that is all I needed to hear. That was my five-second moment. That was the moment of realization where I understood that Eileen trusted me, felt confident enough in my classroom that she could be herself, that she could fire off a quip at a teacher, sort of take a shot at me. I knew at that point that now I can call her to the board, that she's going to be okay. So essentially it is a very brief story that I could actually expand into something much more meaningful.\n\n(00:08:39):\nI could make that into a five or six minute story about my journey with this student. Which would include, in the longer version of it, the steps that I took to discover who she was, the steps I took to help her reach the point she's at now. I would probably pull in some backstory about students who I was not so successful with. Some of my failures before I learned how to be a better teacher. And then I'd bring it to the moment where she says, first of all, I don't like that cheeky smile, and that's all I need to hear. So that is essentially a five-second moment for me. That is the same though as any other five-second moment. If you think about a movie like Star Wars, the first Star Wars that came out that is a movie essentially about religion, which people don't always see, but it is true.\n\n(00:09:23):\nThere's a boy on a planet and he wants to go to space someday and fly a spaceship and use blasters to defeat the Empire. And along the way, he meets a religious figure to Obi-Wan Kenobi, and he introduces him to a religion called The Force. And when the final moment comes for Luke Skywalker to defeat the Empire, his vision of using technology, a spaceship and a blaster to destroy the Empire, all of that goes away, and he turns off his technology in his spaceship. Instead, he uses The Force to guide his weapon to defeat the enemy.\n\n(00:09:56):\nAnd that is a story about a boy who once had no religion, and then some stuff happened and he had religion in the end. And that's why a story like that resonates with us in a way that another story might not, because we all understand what it's like to not believe in something and then find belief in something. Whether that is religious belief or I used to think cheeseburgers didn't taste good, and now I believe that they taste good. Either way, we understand that process and we can connect with Luke Skywalker in a meaningful way. So every story essentially has those moments, including, \"I don't like that cheeky smile.\"\n\nLenny (00:10:29):\nWith this moment, what's also interesting is you talk about how knowing that moment of change also tells you how the story will end. So as a storyteller, you'll know how it ends based on knowing what this moment is, which then also tells you how it's going to start roughly. Can you just talk about that realization? Because, to me, every time I watch a movie now I'm like, wow, I know exactly how it's going to turn out just from the beginning.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:10:53):\nSo we start as storytellers at the end. Well, we start at the end if we are telling true stories about ourselves or our companies or our products, things that we know. I'm also a fiction writer. So when I start my novels, that's much more self-discovery. I really don't know the end of it. But in the storytelling that we're talking about, you have to know the end because you've lived the moment, and the end forms everything. So you know what you're going to say. You found a moment worth speaking to, that five-second moment. And then whatever that moment is, in my case, I discover that Eileen has more confidence than I realized and is ready to take a big step forward. What's the opposite of me realizing Eileen has confidence and is ready to step forward? It is, Eileen does not have confidence, and I need to help her find that confidence.\n\n(00:11:39):\nSo that's the opposites that will work in a story. Essentially, a story is about these two moments in time, a beginning and an end, and they're operating in opposition to each other. Sometimes more so than others, sometimes exactly an opposition. But you're right. If you watch a movie and you'll pay attention to the first 10 to 15 minutes of a movie, you will ultimately know how that movie's going to end. You'll see a character, you'll discover what that character needs or their flaw or their desire, and you know that that's going to be at the end. The easiest one is a romantic comedy. Two people are not in love at the beginning of the movie. You know they're going to be in love at the end of the movie. Even knowing it doesn't mean the story's ruined. We can get there in a very entertaining way. When Harry Met Sally, that movie, when it begins, Harry and Sally actually say they hate each other at the very beginning of the movie, \"I Hate You, Harry,\" right?\n\n(00:12:32):\nI hate that man so much. We know they're going to end up together, and the journey is well worth the fact that we know what's going to happen at the end. So it ruins a little bit of storytelling for people who think like me and go, \"Oh, well, I know where this is going.\" But you have to do it in an entertaining way filled with all the other things we talk about in storytelling. But yeah, every story should be essentially a beginning and an end and opposition to each other, and you should start at the end, that guarantees that you have something important to say rather than what most people do, which is they simply report on their lives. They just tell you stuff that happened over the course of time in some chronological way that ultimately doesn't lead to anything. You want to always be saying something of import. So we start at the end with that moment of import.\n\nLenny (00:13:21):\nIt's funny, as I was thinking of when Harry met Sally exactly as you were talking as an example, my wife wants to watch that movie basically every night. It's like the one movie she could just watch a billion times.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:13:31):\nWell, that's the power of story. I tell people this all the time. Why are we telling stories? You've never asked to see a PowerPoint presentation a second time. You've never gone to bed and dreamt about a PowerPoint presentation. You've never heard someone give a keynote and thought, I hope I get to watch that keynote again tomorrow. But movies, you'll watch a movie a hundred times, because it's a story, and our minds are wired to enjoy story over and over and over again. You have a small child, right? Eventually you're going to be reading to that child when your baby's old enough and you're going to discover kids want to read the same book 50 times. They're really no different than adults except kid books are so small, you can read them endlessly. A movie takes two hours, so you don't get to read it as often as you might want or watch it as often as you might want. But Harry Met Sally comes on and you're halfway through. You're probably in. Even though every scene you can probably do the dialogue. We're wired for story. That's why it's so important.\n\nLenny (00:14:28):\nWhy is something changing so important? Why is that so critical to a good story, someone having a change or transforming?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:14:35):\nWell, I think that actual moment of transformation lends importance to the story and allows the audience to connect to it. If I report it on my day to you, my day teaching in a classroom, I am unlikely to connect with you unless you are also a teacher and you experienced things similar to me. My wife is a kindergarten teacher. I'm a fifth grade teacher. If both of us report on our day, oddly, we will not really connect very often. She is teaching them how to write the letter C, and I am teaching them how to use the standard algorithm in multiplication. They could not be further apart.\n\n(00:15:11):\nSo reporting on the moments that you have experienced in the day is not a way to connect to people. But when we talk about change, change has a great universal appeal. So you might not be a teacher who's trying to teach someone to find confidence in their life, but you might be a person who once lacked confidence and then found confidence in the way Eileen did. Or you might be a parent or the boss of someone who is trying to bring confidence to your child or your employee, your salesperson, whatever it is. When we do change, when we're focused in on that change, we increase exponentially the universal appeal to the story and our ability to connect to an audience. Even though the content we're speaking about has nothing to do with them, the actual emotional appeal will cause people to connect to us.\n\nLenny (00:16:00):\nFascinating. So building on that same thread of change, you also have this kind of checklist for what makes a good story. What is a good story, and I think it's only a three point checklist. One is there's a change that happens. Can you talk about the other two? I think there's only other two.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:16:16):\nWell, the dinner test is probably one that you're thinking of.\n\nLenny (00:16:19):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:16:20):\nSo the dinner test is the idea that when you're telling a story in a formal way, if you're performing on a stage or delivering a keynote or even delivering a pitch to entrepreneurs or a sales pitch, essentially the story that you're telling should be very closely related to the story you would tell someone if you were having dinner. So there should be no performance art included within your story or within your talk. So weird things that people do should not be done. Like opening a story with unattributed dialogue. So you're standing on stage and you open your story with, \"Jim, it's time to come in for dinner.\" My wife said, that's just weird. We don't talk like that as regular people, so you should not speak like that ever. In the history of the world, you should never speak like that. But people do it all the time.\n\n(00:17:12):\nIt's this weird appendage from childhood when bad writing teachers thought that this was a good idea, or you start with a sound, which is very popular in first grade. You teach kids to start with sound, mostly because teachers are not writers, so they don't understand what writing actually is. And so they open with stories, with things like, bang, the door opened. But if you and I were having dinner and you said, \"Hey, how was your day, Matt?\" And I said, \"Well, let me tell you Lenny. Bang, the door opened.\" You would not have dinner with me again.\n\n(00:17:41):\nSo you have to be thinking that this is a slightly elevated version of the dinner story. Meaning you're probably not going to be interrupted in the middle of your story. And you want to have a little more shape to it, and you want to avoid some of the verbal detritus that tends to fill our lives. You don't want to be saying, you know, and like I said, all of that nonsense should get pushed to the side, but essentially people should feel like you're kind of speaking in a very natural way. So the dinner test is pretty important in that regard.\n\nLenny (00:18:09):\nAwesome. Yeah, so the lesson there is when you're telling a story, make it sure that it's something that you could potentially tell at a dinner party. Slightly elevated is the way you put it.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:18:18):\nSlightly elevated. Exactly.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nI think the third point you make is that it has to be your story. You can't be telling a story on behalf of someone else. Maybe chat about that briefly?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:18:25):\nSo if you're telling a story about someone else, essentially, you might as well be telling fiction. Because that person's not in the room, and to the audience, they don't really exist. If they can't see them, that person is just another human being who supposedly lives somewhere in the world or once lived in the world. And because of that, you are almost unable to express any vulnerability in your story. You can't reveal anything about yourself. And one of the key parts of storytelling is to be vulnerable with your audience. Meaning I'm going to say stuff in a meaningful way. I might say stuff that most people are unwilling to share in a public way, but I'm at least going to offer up a little bit of my heart and mind. If I offer up the heart and mind of someone else that doesn't really require any vulnerability.\n\n(00:19:09):\nThe only vulnerability is I have to stand in front of people and talk, which I know is challenging for some people, but that doesn't mean anything to the audience. We don't care if you're having a hard time presenting, if it's making you nervous. That doesn't mean much to an audience. What we really want is someone to open up their hearts and minds. So stories have to be about you in some way. There's tricks where you can tell stories about other people by taking that story and centering on yourself.\n\n(00:19:36):\nOne of the examples, I work with the children and grandchildren of Holocaust survivors, and in the past, what they would do is they would just tell the story of the Holocaust survivor who has often at this point passed away, and it really does feel like fiction. A long time ago in a place that wasn't this a terrible thing happened. And there's a certain level of empathy and sympathy that you might feel. But what I teach them to do is to tell stories about themselves. And then at some point in the story about themselves, they're going to talk about how the experience of their parent or grandparent during the Holocaust has informed or changed their own life too. So they get to dip into some history, but that history is relevant to the storyteller. So it's no longer history. It's now something changed in me because something terrible happened to my parent or grandparent.\n\nLenny (00:20:24):\nJust as a tangent, you also have this funny, useful checklist for how to tell vacation stories?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:20:30):\nWell, first try not to, right?\n\nLenny (00:20:32):\nI think that's step one. Do not tell vacation stories.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:20:34):\nMost vacation stories are just simply a recounting of your vacation at the expense of another person. So unless something happened on that vacation where you experienced one of these five second fundamental moments of change, nobody cares about your vacation. And if something did happen, only be talking about the moment when it happened. So if I had a moment of change that took place on a Thursday night at dinner, that story is now going to take place on the Thursday night at dinner, and it's irrelevant that I'm in Aruba.\n\n(00:21:07):\nThe fact that I am on vacation is almost completely irrelevant to the story, other than I may want to offer my location. But I'm not going to talk about the beach the day before or the scuba diving or the plane. All of that goes away. We're telling moments in our lives, and it doesn't matter where they happen. If your location is paramount to your story because you want people to know you were in Aruba, then you have to understand, no one actually cares that you were in Aruba and you're just a terrible person for trying to dump that on someone and use up their time so you can relive your vacation and perhaps humble brag about how much fun you had.\n\nLenny (00:21:46):\nThis will be a good segment for people to send their friends if they want to tell them their vacation stories. And here's a tip for how to do this better.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:21:51):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:21:52):\nAnd just understand why it needs to be on a Thursday in that dinner, is the advice there? Keep it very focused and small, unless there's some really essential reason to share the context around the dinner.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:22:03):\nYeah, exactly. The shortest version of every story is the best version of every story. Starting as close to the end of a story is always the best place to begin. So if I had a moment of realization during dessert in a restaurant in Aruba, I may never tell them I'm in Aruba. I might start my story with, the dessert hits the table, and my wife says something that causes me to begin thinking, and that would be the beginning of the story. The fact that I'm on an island in the Caribbean may never come up in the entire story because it doesn't turn out to be relevant to the story.\n\nLenny (00:22:39):\nThere's a lesson that another guest shared, West Cow about... She calls it, When The Bear Starts Eating Your Tent, or something like that. Jump to when the bear is eating your tent. Don't do this whole introduction to why or how you got to this tent. It's just like the bear is eating our tent. That's where the story should start.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:22:54):\nYes, Kurt Vonnegut said that. Kurt Vonnegut said, \"Start as close to the end as possible.\" He was talking about short stories written on the page, but it is a true notion in oral storytelling too. And it is, of all the things I help people with their stories, the most frequent suggestion that I make for revision is you've started your story in the wrong place.\n\nLenny (00:23:16):\nI want to shift to business context advice. But before we do that, there's another really important element of storytelling, which is having stakes and having important stakes. So could you just talk about what is a stake and why is it important to have stakes? And then just what are examples of adding stakes to your story to make them more encouraging?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:23:32):\nSure. So stakes are essentially what your audience should be worried about, what they should be wanting for you, what they should be concerned about, what they should be wondering about. If your audience isn't wondering what you're about to say, they're no longer listening to you. And you have to internalize that in a deep and fundamental way. When I work with people in business, they are constantly under this misconception that people want to hear what they have to say. Some vice president of marketing thinks that because they're a vice president of marketing and everyone is sitting in a chair and looking at them, that they automatically have that audience's attention. I assume all the time, 100% of the time, that no one wants to hear anything I have to say. And so I am relentless in my attempt to get the audience to be constantly wondering what the next sentence is.\n\n(00:24:17):\nAnd stakes are a big part of that. Stakes are, I wonder what's going to happen next. I'm worried about this guy. Will he get what he wants? Will he get his comeuppance? Because he seems like a kind of a jerk in this story. All of those things are stakes. What is at stake for the storyteller, the company, the product, whatever it is, and therefore what the audience is worried about as well.\n\n(00:24:39):\nIt's why Star Wars opens with a big spaceship shooting at a small spaceship. We don't even know who's on it yet, but we're already on the small spaceship side. We're already worried that a small spaceship is being shot at by a big spaceship, right? That's why stories start this way. Alfred Hitchcock has a movie where it opens with a police officer is chasing a man across a roof. We don't know who to root for, but something is at stake here. And now we're wondering what's going to happen next. We have to do the same thing with our ordinary true life everyday stories. We have to put stakes into stories.\n\nLenny (00:25:12):\nThere's something that you teach around surprise and the power of surprise as a part of stakes. I forget exactly what that is, but does that ring a bell?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:25:19):\nWell, I'll separate them really. So with stakes, there's lots of ways to insert stakes. I always say you should have, what I call an elephant at the beginning of the story, which is actually a big spaceship shooting at a little spaceship or a police officer chasing a guy across a roof. We have to immediately know that something is at stakes. We have to be worried about something. In my little Eileen story that I told you, I said, I'm teaching math and I've got this student and I'm worried about her, because I want to call her to the board, but I know she might lack some confidence. Right away, I have to make it clear what kind of story we're at. In a movie, you get a trailer. You don't often go to a movie and not have any awareness about what's about to happen. But when you open your mouth to begin telling a story, nobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that...\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:26:00):\nNobody knows what you're going to say. You need to land something immediately that causes an audience to go, \"Oh, okay, well what's going to happen here?\" So that's an elephant. That's like plant some big thing in the beginning of a story. It doesn't actually have to be what the story's about either. Sometimes it takes a little time to get to what the story's about, but you plant something there to at least get the audience to be worried, and then you can use some other tricks. I call something called a backpack, which is, you tell the audience what your plan is before you carry out your plan so that they sort of have your hopes and dreams packed up with them as well. If you watch an Ocean's 11 movie, you know what the plan is before they go into the casino. So as the plan goes awry, you can go, \"Oh no,\" because you know what the plan is.\n\n(00:26:42):\nIf you didn't know what the plan was, you would not be able to go, \"Oh no.\" So that's loading your audience with your hopes and dreams so that they can feel those stakes. They can actually be hoping for you as well. There's things like breadcrumbs where you offer a little bit of what's going on, but not the complete idea, sort of drop a hint. The classic one is sort of the gun. There's a gun in the room, and there's a gun in the room, and it seems like it's not going to be relevant, but if you have a gun in the room, it's going to eventually go off. There's something going on there. That's like a bread crumb. Eventually we're going to get to that gun. Don't worry, it's going to happen. There's hourglasses, which is when you get to the moment where everyone is about to discover what's going to happen. That's the moment to slow time down.\n\n(00:27:28):\nYou load your story with details because suddenly you know have the audience on the edge of their seat, and you want to leave them on the edge of their seat as long as possible. When I know my audience wants to hear the next sentence, that is when I prolong the arrival of the next sentence by I say turning over an hourglass and letting the sand run for a while, and making them wait for it. There's crystal balls where you can predict a future. You don't have to predict an accurate future. You can just predict any future. So I could have said something in the Eileen story like, \"If I get this wrong, Eileen is going to begin to cry. She's going to cry in front of 22 kids, 22 kids who for the rest of the year will continue to stare at this girl, and remember the moment she cried.\" That's a crystal ball.\n\n(00:28:10):\nThat's me predicting a terrible future. Because I put that terrible future in the audience's mind, now they're worried. So that is a stake. I have planted a false stake, a false future, but they're going to be worried about it because it's also a realistic future. So all of those things are used to continue to get the audience to wonder what's going to happen next, which is a little different than surprise. Surprise is just that beautiful, delightful, amazing moment where the audience didn't see something coming, and then it was almost like it was inevitable. Surprise happens, and they understand why it happened. I think it's the best thing you can ever offer an audience, is a moment of surprise. And every story has a surprise, at least one. Because whenever we suddenly realize something for the first time, I hate the word suddenly, but what happens is we used to not think something, and then we think a new thing, and that's often a surprise for us if we make it a surprise for the audience too, that's a delightful thing. So surprise is so powerful, and wonderful, and always ruined by storytellers.\n\nLenny (00:29:11):\nI was just listening to an interview with, I think his name is David Mamet, and he made this point that endings of books and movies always has to be both inevitable, and also complete surprise.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:29:21):\nYes, both of those things. So inevitable means there has to be enough information placed earlier in the story so that when the surprise happens, the audience goes, \"Yes.\" But also you have to be clever enough to plant that information in such a way that the audience doesn't see the surprise coming. You build information into the audience's mind that will allow the surprise to land in an inevitable and yet surprising way. That is the best surprise you can offer someone.\n\nLenny (00:29:51):\nEasier said than done.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:29:52):\nYes, well, there's lots of tricks to do that as well, but it takes some time. But essentially what you end up doing is, you're hiding the information that they need to know in a multitude of ways so that when it lands, they go, \"Oh my gosh, ABCD.\" They don't connect it until the surprise hits, and then they go, \"Of course, ABCD.\" So you place ABCD in a story, but you don't place it in such a way that they can connect the dots until you want them to connect the dots.\n\nLenny (00:30:20):\nI feel that's a whole other hour of podcast conversation to figure that out.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:30:23):\nThat's like ninja level next level storytelling, which is very teachable. Everything I say is very, very teachable and doable by anybody, but yes, it's a trickier thing to accomplish.\n\nLenny (00:30:35):\nOkay, that'll be for a second podcast episode. Just to summarize, you shared I think five ways add stakes. Just to summarize; one is crystal ball. You basically predict the bad thing that'll happen if you don't do this thing. Hourglass, which is when something is about to happen slow time down. I think of Pulp Fiction and Tarantino in this often of just like, you know some violence is about to happen, and they go next door, and like, \"Let's just eat a cheeseburger,\" instead for a while. And then this backpack idea of they know exactly what you're trying to do, and it's on you and the entire movie. Breadcrumbs where you give them a little bit of information along the way. I think maybe that's it. Maybe there's one more.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:12):\nAnd then the elephant at the beginning.\n\nLenny (00:31:14):\nOh, the elephant, just like the big ol', here's the steak. I wish-\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:16):\nYou got to have something.\n\nLenny (00:31:18):\nI heard some advice in either your book, a different book about adding stakes is just drop a dead body. Every new dead body is additional stakes that are added to the story. I don't know how often people can do that in random stories.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:31:30):\nBut what you can take from that is, so often people load the front end of a story with all of the stakes because they're worried that the audience will not pay attention to them. So they think I'm going to throw everything right in front, and that'll hold an audience for the rest of the story, and that's a mistake. What we want is stakes continually to build throughout a story. So dropping a dead body really means, drop a new steak, don't load it all, don't front load it, give us something to wonder about, and then gauge when we need the next thing to wonder about, and spread out those stakes. We need most of the stakes to occur within the first half of a story. Ideally, the second half of the story is now the rollercoaster to the end. So we might drop one in there at an appropriate time, or just through plot. Sometimes they just happen to need to be in a place. But so often I hear people front load stakes because they're worried about audience attention.\n\nLenny (00:32:21):\nJust to give people something concrete to think about when they're thinking about this area. Is there a story of yours that's online that we can point people to see an example of really good stakes in action?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:32:31):\nSo the one that I reference in my book, which you can go watch online is, Charity Thief. It needs a lot of stakes because two thirds of the story nothing really happens. Two thirds of the story is explaining how I end up on a porch. So that's not super entertaining unless I build in lots of stakes along the way. I'm not inventing anything, I'm just presenting the actual events in a way that makes you wonder what's going to happen next. So there's an elephant at the beginning of that story, which is actually not what the story's about because I say the elephant can change colors along the way, but I give you something to wonder about along the way. I know I use a backpack, and I use a breadcrumb, and an hourglass, and a crystal ball. I do it all in that story mostly because it's not super entertaining.\n\n(00:33:19):\nSome stories you don't have to worry so much about. I perform as a stripper in the break room of a McDonald's restaurant when I'm 19 years old for a bachelorette party. There are stakes in that story, but I don't need to put any of them in because everybody wants to know what's going to happen already. Sometimes you just have a story that the stakes are already pre-built because the ridiculousness of the moment. But most of our stories are not like that. Most of them are far more benign, and we have to jack up the stakes by using some tricks to get people to the point we want them to be in.\n\nLenny (00:33:50):\nThat stripper story I've also watched, and I'll point to it, and I love, it's connected to another piece of advice you always shared. People just say yes to stuff, at the power of yes. I don't want to get into it yet, I want to come back to that.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:34:00):\nTrue.\n\nLenny (00:34:00):\nWe'll leave that breadcrumb but I love that point. Okay, so let's transition to helping people in business learn all these skills, and translate them to becoming better in their work. And maybe actually to add some stakes, what benefits do people get/what problems do they run into if they aren't great at storytelling versus if they learn the skill, and can implement it at work? What happens, what good things come out of that?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:34:25):\nWell, if you don't tell stories as part of your business, whether you're looking for investment, or speaking to your people, or speaking to customers, or clients, anything, if you're not telling stories, the good news is, you're just like everybody else. The bad news is, you're mediocre just like everybody else. You're in a lane that everyone else is in, which means that you're going to be forgettable. I often say most communication in business is round white and flavorless intentionally so because a lot of people are afraid to stand out. When I try to get people to tell stories, everyone loves the word storytelling in business. It's a huge buzzword. They love to think of themselves as storytellers, but when they come to me, they don't really want to be storytellers because to be a storyteller means you have to separate yourself from the herd, and in their mind that risks them getting picked off, getting picked off by some predator.\n\n(00:35:18):\nBut the alternative is, you're in the herd, which means you're forgettable. How many times have you gone to a conference, listened to someone speak, and by the time you're pulling into the driveway you really can't remember anything that they said? My wife and I actually attended an educational conference recently. She's a teacher, I'm a teacher. There was a bunch of speakers. The first person came out with his childhood lunchbox, put it on a table, and told a story about how his parents had nothing while he was growing up. And yet they somehow kept him in new shoes, and a new backpack every year, and sent him to school with a lunch every day, and how much it meant to him, and how as an educator today he thinks about every single kid in his class like he was, a kid who had nothing except for all of his parents' hopes and dreams.\n\n(00:36:04):\nI'll never forget that story. It was a story. It was a story of vulnerability, and humor and meaning. There was another person who spoke, a sort of executive we'll say, and he did a great job in terms of being fluent, and presenting ideas, and speaking well, and speaking confidently. And 15 minutes after the conference I said to my wife who is a teacher and understands storytelling because we do it together.\n\n(00:36:27):\nI said, \"What'd you think?\" She said, \"Well, I'm never going to forget that guy with the lunchbox.\" I said, \"I will not either.\" I said, \"What'd you think about the other guy?\" And she goes, \"He was great.\" I said, \"So what did he say?\" Five teen minutes after, and she went, \"I actually can't tell you a single thing he said.\" This is a woman who's a teacher, and invested in storytelling and communication. Her impression was, he was fluent, he was amusing, he said some numbers, he said some things that seemed to mean something. But it was all forgotten because that's what happens if we don't speak in story. Our minds are not designed to remember a pie chart, or facts, or statistics, or platitudes, or ideas that are not attached to imagery. So the risk you take if you're not telling stories is that you will be forgotten, 100% you will be forgotten.\n\nLenny (00:37:18):\nWhen people hear this, they may think, \"Oh man, there's this guy at work, and he's always telling stories.\" And we're like, \"Shut up.\" Just tell me what we need to do to make it a little more real of just what does storytelling look like where it's not annoying. It's not like, \"Okay, everyone, gather around. Let me tell you the story of our vision.\" What are some simpler ways, and maybe non-annoying ways to think about what storytelling looks like in the workplace that's not just like a public speaking like, \"Hey, everyone, I'm going to give you.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:37:43):\nLet me give a couple of examples. I have a storytelling book coming out next year on business. So there's a couple of heroes in that story. One of them is named Boris. His name's Boris Levin, he is a factory owner here in Connecticut. He's the one who convinced me I could start working with businesses. I thought it was just a storyteller who spoke about himself on a stage. Boris one day saw me for some fundraiser and said, \"Listen, I want you to come and help me.\" I said, \"I can't do that. I just tell. I'm using stories about myself.\" He said, \"No, no, you can help me.\" And it turns out he was totally right. So Boris has done it the right way. Boris has decided to become a storyteller who will then translate his stories into his business.\n\n(00:38:19):\nSo a great example was, one of Boris's early stories, he came to me, and he said, \"My son was at bat in the Little League Championship game. The bases were loaded, if my son got a hit, the team was going to win the championship. And if my son struck out, the team would lose the championship.\" It's a three and two count. It is like the ultimate baseball moment, and his son strikes out. He watches his son drag that bat back to the dugout. He's devastated. His son's devastated and Boris is devastated. So he is trying to collect himself so he can figure out the right thing to say to a boy who's just lost the championship for his team. By the time he makes it onto the other side of the field to catch up with his son, he sees his son running up a hill with his friends, and they're already laughing.\n\n(00:39:09):\nThey're heading to the cars so they can go to ice cream, and they can enjoy themselves. So Boris is falling apart. He's still devastated, but his son has already moved past the failure. Boris takes that story, and he crafts it as a beautiful story that he could tell on a stage, and perform and make, an audience laugh and cry. Once the story's done, he says to me, \"So what are we going to do with it? How are we going to apply this to business?\" And ultimately what happens is this, he's got a sales team. And quite often salespeople do not land the big account they're hoping to land, and Boris knows that when his salespeople fail to achieve what they want to achieve, they will often sulk for days. They'll wander around the office, and be useless because they're still trying to get past the fact that they just lost the million dollar contract.\n\n(00:39:56):\nSo he tells the story about his son, and he says, \"Listen, there's nothing wrong with being sad, being upset with failure, but we cannot allow it to slow us down as much as we are right now. We have to think about my son. My son dragged his bat back to the dugout. He sat down, he sighed, his buddies patted him on the back, he collected himself, and he moved on. That's what we need to do. When we fail we're going to take a moment to collect ourselves, to think about the mistakes we made, to decide what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to move on.\" That becomes a really important moment in his company.\n\n(00:40:32):\nIt's much better than him standing up in front of his people and saying, \"Listen, every time you guys fail to land a big sale, you wander around this office like you're dead, and you're wasting our time. It ends today. Today from now on when you fail, you're going to move on.\" The story becomes something meaningful to everyone because it reveals something about Boris. He's a father, he's a father who cares about his son. He's the kind of father that most of us are in life. He shares of himself with his people, and he creates a tangible vision of what the sales team can do. He does that all the time. He comes to me, and he's not looking to solve problems through story. He's looking to develop stories that he can then deploy into his business. So I compare it, I say, band-aids versus bricks. If you're building bricks, you're a storyteller that's capturing stories and building bricks, then you can eventually deploy into business. If you're a band-aid person, which is fine, that happens. \"I have a problem, Matt, and I need a story to solve it.\"\n\n(00:41:34):\nEssentially what I'm doing there is I'm putting a band-aid over a problem, but you're not becoming a better storyteller. You're just using me as a consultant to help you generate a story that will solve a problem. That's fine, but you're going to need me the next time too. You're going to keep needing me because you're not really becoming a storyteller. Boris is building bricks. He is building a vault of stories that he can then deploy into his business. He understands how to tell them, and how to connect them to business. So that's something that you can do very easily.\n\n(00:42:02):\nAnother example, the other star of my book is a woman named Marsha Rakofsky. She used to be the director of corporate communications at Slack, and now she's sort of doing work on her own. But when she was with Slack, she and I were working closely together, and she had to create the narrative that was going to compete against Microsoft Teams. Essentially, Microsoft came along and said, \"Hey, we copied your product and it's free, and everybody already has it.\"\n\n(00:42:25):\nSo Slack had to find a way to combat that, and Marsha was the one in charge of doing it. That's why we connected. She found me and said, \"I need to tell a good story. Please help me tell a good story.\" So she crafted a brilliant narrative that worked fantastically. We worked really closely together, and it came out great. The way she came up with that narrative was a Tuesday night. She had broken up with her boyfriend, she was alone. She was feeling pretty lonely. It was in the midst of the pandemic. She had two glasses of wine in her, sitting alone on a Tuesday night, she suddenly had an inspiration. She wrote three words down on a napkin, and those three words become the story that we develop that allows Slack to compete against Microsoft.\n\n(00:43:04):\nWhen it comes time to her present that narrative, I say, \"You're going to include the Tuesday night and the two glasses of wine, and all that, right?\" And she's like, \"No, I'm not. That's not what we do in the corporate world. We do not insert ourselves into our narratives.\" And to her credit, she didn't put it in, and it still worked brilliantly. She was fine. But about a month later, she was presenting that same narrative to a smaller group, lower stakes. I said, \"Let's just put it in, just try it this time.\" And to her everlasting credit, she did. She put in a 30-second anecdote about Tuesday night, two glasses of wine, feeling lonely in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n(00:43:42):\nShe said to me later, \"I can't believe the difference that that 30 second anecdote meant to the narrative. Because suddenly when I reached the end of the narrative, people wanted to talk to me. People came up to me, and the first thing they said was,\" \"Oh God, I remember I was feeling the same way during the pandemic.\"\n\n(00:43:59):\nPeople connected to her because instead of being a corporate monolith, sort of like Slack spokesperson without personality, which is what we tend to be in business, she was an actual human being who had an inspiration on the Tuesday night, and then was bringing it forth in a meaningful way to an audience. And from that point on, she always has been doing those things in storytelling. She's always looking for a way in her narratives to insert herself, or if she's working with a client, let's find a way that we can work the client into the story as well. Because people don't want to hear spokespeople present information. They want to hear human beings connect with you, and then offer you something that perhaps will have value.\n\nLenny (00:44:41):\nThat is a really interesting lesson. So is your advice just when you're telling stories in business, try to find a way to make it personal about you as the person telling the story?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:44:50):\nYeah. I have this tool I use with corporate folks called, a personal interest inventory. It is a list of all the things that you should be saying about yourself in clever and strategic ways that I teach. Each one of them has an addressable market. So how many people could this potentially hit? And then the intensity of the connection. So for example, if you're married, you should always make it clear to people you're married, especially if you're a man. Because if you're a man, and you're married, you're safer in the world because men are inherently just dangerous human beings. We just are. If you hear that there was a shooting, you never think, \"Oh, I wonder if that was a twenty-three- year-old blonde woman.\" You know who did the shooting almost all the time. So if you're married, what you're essentially saying to people is, someone has agreed to spend theoretically their life with me.\n\n(00:45:41):\nIt's like a validation that I have, at least hygiene and some decency. Most people are in a committed relationship so that means that a total addressable market is large. If I say I'm married, you're either married also, or you're in a committed relationship. So the connection is going to be large. The total addressable market is large. The possible connection, probably moderate. I say it's like, \"It's okay.\" But weird ones are like runners. I'm not a runner, and there's not a lot of runners in the world. But if you're a marathoner, your total addressable market is very small. There's not that many marathoners. But if you happen to find a marathoner, the intensity of that connection is enormous. Marathoners are almost automatically friends upon meeting what I've discovered. If you're just, \"Oh, you ran a marathon? I ran a marathon.\" They're best friends already.\n\n(00:46:32):\nSo if you've run a marathon, and you're in a room and you discover someone else's run a marathon, you have to find a way to bring that out because the possibility of that connection is incredibly intense. So as a person in the corporate world, you should not be seeking to be round, white and flavorless. You should be seeking to be full of color, and full of edge, and full of flavor. You want to be an individual that people remember as opposed to what most people are trying to be, which is, I am just operating this corporate, or this business sphere, and I'm not trying to stand out, which is just a foolish thing to want to do.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nI could see why people wouldn't naturally do this. If I'm a head of comms for a company, the last thing I want is to make it about me. And what you're saying is, you actually should, because people will find it a lot more interesting.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:47:20):\nYeah, you don't want to make it all about you, but there's just little tricks. The easiest trick is, if someone asks you, \"How are you doing today?\" If you say, \" I'm doing great,\" you've just really screwed it up. That's the stupidest answer you can offer. If you ask me, \"How am I doing today,\" I'm immediately going to think to myself, elementary school teacher is probably my best personal interest inventory item. Because if I'm an elementary school teacher, everyone loves me. They think I'm doing God's work, even though they don't want to pay me a dime to do it. So if you say, \"How are you doing today?\" I will say to you, \"Pretty good. My fifth graders were actually decent human beings today. They didn't try to kill me.\"\n\n(00:48:01):\nSo in that way, I'm going to slip in the fact that I'm an elementary school teacher by answering your question, I'm going to demonstrate a bit of amusing content in the process, and maybe a little self deprecation. But whenever I'm asked a question, I am trying to include an item of my personality, my life, something that might be of interest to people while also answering the question. You don't want to walk into a situation and say, \"Hi, I'm a married elementary school teacher with two kids and two cats.\" But that's what I want to do because I know that that's going to make people feel connected to me. So I have to find strategic ways to work it in. I teach people to do it all the time. But it starts with understanding what about you might mean something to other people, and how can I get it in there without me sounding like I'm only talking about myself?\n\nLenny (00:48:48):\nWhat else? So we're basically talking about ways to become a better communicator and storyteller in business. You've shared a few tidbits here. One is, think of this personal inventory about yourself that makes you relatable. Try to share it in stories you tell, and presentations, and things like that. What else can people do to become better storytellers in business? I know this is a big question, but let's see where it goes.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:49:07):\nLet's go back to the idea that in business, you have to accept the fact that nobody wants to hear anything you have to say, that is not accepted by most people, even after I say it. So once you understand that, and once you truly believe it, there's essentially four ways to keep people listening to you in any story really, but especially in business, because really no one wants to listen to you in business. So the first is stakes, which we've really talked about already. You have to have stakes. In every good product story and every good PowerPoint... Everything, there are stakes, and they're set out and exactly the way I've described. All five of the stakes that I've described to you that I use in that story, Charity Thief can also be used in every business story, every PowerPoint deck, every entrepreneur pitch, everything. So stakes is one of them.\n\n(00:49:52):\nAnother one we've talked about is, surprise. I should absolutely be surprised in every talk that you give. Steve Jobs was a master of it. We could look at one of his talks, and I could show you how he planned it perfectly. Some others include suspense. So keeping an audience in suspense, and often suspense leads to surprise. So mastering the ability to be suspenseful. And then humor, daring to be funny, which no one in corporate America can do. Everyone wants to be funny. Every person I've ever met, who I've worked with, every business person in some way wanted to be funny, but that's really not actually what they want. They want to have been funny, because being funny means you must take a risk. You must say something that you believe is funny, and you expect an audience to also feel it's funny, and if it doesn't happen, that hurts.\n\n(00:50:43):\nSo people oftentimes tell me they want to be funny, but when I tell them how they need to be funny, they say, \"Well, I can't say that.\" And then I say, \"Well, that's the part that's funny.\" So I was working with a guy, sort of an executive at a company that you interact with every day. He was delivering a talk at the Javits Center, and he was going to be funny. We built in a talk, lots of jokes. He was ready to go. He went to the Javits Center, and four hours later he called me, and I said, \"How'd it go?\" He said, \"I pulled out all the jokes.\" I said, \"Why did you pull out all the jokes?\" He said, \"The first two speakers weren't funny at all. I felt like if I went on stage and I was funny, I was going to stick out like a sore thumb.\"\n\n(00:51:27):\nI said, \"No, you were going to rise from the ashes like a phoenix that everyone has been waiting to hear all day.\" It's the best thing in the world to follow two terrible people, and then go out there and land some jokes. But again, he thought, I have to stay within the confines of the herd rather than doing something different. But humor is a brilliant, and beautiful, and simple way to differentiate yourself from other people, but you have to be willing to try to do it. It's a scary thing for people. But I say it stakes, it's surprise, it's suspense, and it's humor. Those are the ways that you're going to.\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:52:00):\nStakes, it's surprise, it's suspense, and it's humor. Those are the ways that you're going to hold people and keep them listening. And if you're not engaged in one of those four things while you're speaking, people are not listening to you anymore.\n\nLenny (00:52:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

To follow this thread on humor which I was going to ask, what do you tell people to become more funny? What are some tricks?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:53:17):\nWell, I have currently 26 strategies to be funny. Some are better for business than others. I will give you two that we can use in business all the time. The first one you can use is nostalgia, because nostalgia is always funny. The fact that the first VCR I had was 22 pounds and had a remote control attached by a cord that was thick enough that I could trip my brother as he walked through the living room is funny. The fact that I grew up and no one was allergic to anything and we all ate bread, packed with gluten and baked in asbestos factories and no one ever wore a helmet while they rode their bike. All of these things can be made to be funny. And it's so easy in business because oftentimes you are rolling out a new product or a new service or you're updating a product or service in a way that allows you to speak nostalgically about the past.\n\n(00:54:09):\nI was working with this company and they failed me. They did not listen to my advice which was a mistake. They're like an Indeed company. They're helping find employees for companies they're one of these people. And I wanted to start their narrative with the idea of in 1983, the primary source of employment was a 16-year- old kid riding on the back of a Schwinn, throwing newspapers at doors. And in that newspaper, which was like a paper version of the internet, you would turn to the back page and on that page there was the help wanted ads. And that was essentially all you had to find a job in 1983. Everything was geographically based, meaning you only could look into three or four towns around you to find a job. And it had to be in the paper and you had to own a phone connected to a wall so you could call a company within business hours and hope to get an interview.\n\n(00:55:03):\nAll of the power lived with the employers in 1983 and a 16-year-old who was dropping a newspaper off at your porch every day. That's funny. Again, I didn't even try to be funny with it. I just stated the facts. We could have punched that up and made it really funny. And then we flip the script again, the opposites in story. In the beginning, employers had all the power. Today, employees have all the power. Because today you can work in Singapore or Chattanooga, while you're living in Orlando. And today you don't have to wait for a 16-year-old to deliver the paper with all of your job opportunities. Every single job opportunity on the planet is now accessible to you on the internet. And you can work basically anywhere from anywhere. So that's why we need companies like Indeed or the company I was working for, because they have to actually gain some power for the employers.\n\n(00:55:57):\nSo that was the narrative we were going to tell, and the beginning would've been funny. And the CEO of the company said, \"I don't like it.\" He said, \"Nobody cares about the 1980s.\" Which was the dumbest thing he could have said because Stranger Things was the biggest television show on television at the time, which was nothing. But in 1980s. And if he just looked around, he would see that 1980s fashion is coming back. 1980s music is being popularized again. We're remaking 1980s music all the time. Taylor Swift put out an album called 1989. Whether or not the 1980s are relevant or not, it's relevant to talk about the past as a company to demonstrate your expertise in your field. To understand that we know the market backwards and forwards for the last 50 years. We have expertise and we can demonstrate it by telling a story. So that's the power of nostalgia and we can use that all the time in business to make people laugh.\n\n(00:56:50):\nThe other one I'll give you, again, there's a whole bunch, but a simple one is a game they used to play on Sesame Street, which is one of these things that's not like the other. Essentially it's three things. Two of them are expected and one is unexpected, and the unexpected one will be funny. So you can say like, well, my competitor, they have this. My hardware competitor, the guy down the street, he does sell shovels just like I do. That's true. And he does offer a wide selection of nails just like I do. But there's a nameless, faceless machine at the front of the store that you have to swipe your own stuff through and your credit card, there's not actually a human being in the store. And we can make that funny by showing that the third one is unlike the other two. So it's essentially a simple game once I've told it to you, you'll see every comic do it all the time. They just say thing that's expected, thing that's expected, unexpected thing, and you make it funny. So it's a simple trick that we use in business all the time.\n\nLenny (00:57:52):\nThis is awesome. This list you're talking about, is this going to be in your new book that you're writing?\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:57:58):\nNot all 26 of them because some are not the best business ones in the world, but a large number of them. I think I maybe have the top 12 that work best in business in terms of humor. But you can just take a humor class. I teach humor all the time. I teach all 26 strategies. It's something that can be practiced. The beautiful thing is so often many of the strategies that I offer in business, if it doesn't end up being funny, you're still telling a story. It's not a ba-bum-bum-ching joke. We're not telling those jokes. We're telling humor in the confines of a story so that if this joke doesn't land we're still telling a story. And oftentimes people don't even realize we were trying to be funny.\n\nLenny (00:58:44):\nI'm going to come back to where story can help you in your work. So obviously giving a public talk is the classic way to use this, maybe giving a PowerPoint deck in a meeting. Is there any other maybe non-obvious places that you think this skill can help you in that's not just like, \"Hey everyone welcome to my...\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (00:59:02):\nWell, I've worked with a lot of scientists in biotech and places like that. I worked with a biotech company. Five of their scientists were going to a conference. And essentially it's a company that sells tubes. All of their competitors sell a tube for experiments and you have to retrofit the tube to fit your needs. The company I was working with, they sell 12 different versions of the tube. Better sized so you don't have to retrofit it, much more expensive, but the reliability of your experiments are improved by using their properly sized tubes. So I prepare all the scientists and they all do a good job. They all tell stories of some sort and they go off to their conference.\n\n(00:59:43):\nOne guy though doesn't present any data whatsoever. He just tells a story. He tells a story about going to the grocery store and when he goes to the grocery store, his family is really annoying when it comes to apples. Because everyone likes a different apple. So he's got to go and he is got to buy three Honeycrisp for his wife and two Gala for his daughter. And they're baking a pie this week so they got to get some McIntosh and he likes Red Delicious. He said, \"It's a nightmare buying these apples.\" So he tells that story about the nightmare of buying apples, and then he says, \"That's what my company does.\" There are companies that say, \"We offer McIntosh, make do with it. You're going to make your pies, you're, you're going to eat it. All of the things that you want to do with an apple, all you get is McIntosh. Good luck. We believe you should have access to all the apples. We believe that you have particular needs and specific requirements, and we're going to make sure you have it. Just like my family gets all the apples they want.\n\n(01:00:42):\nIt's all he said. A longer version of it, but that's it. No data. He got more leads at the conference than the other four scientists combined. Now the vice president of marketing was not happy about this at all when I met I met with her. Because she's a scientist. She's 50 years old. For her entire life, she's been sending scientists to conferences and presenting data. And she said to me, \"So what am I going to do? Send scientists to conferences now and not present data?\" And I said, \"Well, I mean maybe because it worked\" And she said, \"Well, what about the data?\" I said, \"Now that he has the leads, you don't think they're going to want the data?\" He's going to get on the phone and they're going to say, tell us about the data. But now they've established a connection.\n\n(01:01:22):\nAnd the best thing about that story, the thing she didn't even understand was, every single time someone at that conference goes into a grocery store now and they're looking at apples, they're going to think about that company. And it's a positive feeling that they're going to have about that company. If they have forgotten to call, but they meant to call, when they're picking out a Honeycrisp at the grocery store, they're going to make a note. Oh, right, I got to call that company and look into the tubes that they sell. We create positive connections with items in the world related to our company by telling stories, and that means we've built advertising into people's lives without them even being aware that we've done it. So there's a billion ways to add storytelling into business. It's just another one.\n\nLenny (01:02:07):\nYou touched on this two-way approach. One is, you have a problem. Let me think of a story to help me solve this problem, versus I'm going to become a storyteller, come up with this whole brick wall of stories and then I'll deploy them. You said that the first approach is not something you'd recommend. I imagine most people are probably going to be in that bucket like I don't want to be a storyteller. I just want to solve my problems and stories can sometimes help me there. So maybe in that bucket, do you have any advice for how to find a story that somehow helps you with that problem on demand, or is it just like that is not going to work? You're not going to think of a story every time you have some problem?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:02:40):\nI think sometimes you will. I have a company that calls me metaphor man. They call me essentially and say-\n\nLenny (01:02:45):\nI get that.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:02:46):\n\"... we've added a boring feature to our boring platform and we need to make people understand what it does. Will you give us the metaphor we need?\" They don't understand that I'm not really generating metaphors. I am just taking stories from my life, pulling myself out of the story. And if you take yourself out of a story, often what's left is a metaphor, a simile, an example. And then I just offer that to them. And I tell them, if you just use some of my storytelling generating techniques, you could do the same thing. But they're a bandaid company. They just want me to fix things. And I understand that. If you're trying to do it, the best way to tell a story about something that you want people to understand is to do what I call speaking with adjacency, which means we're not going to match content to content. Instead, we're going to match theme, meaning or message.\n\n(01:03:33):\nSo that scientist, for example, he wasn't talking about tubes. He was talking about how people deserve to get what they want in life. His family deserves to get the apples they want, and you as a business deserves to get the tubes that you want. But so often in business what people think is content to content, well, I got to find a way to talk about these tubes to make people understand how important they are. And I say, well, let's not talk about the tubes. Let's talk about something else instead, and then we're going to move what we were talking about over two tubes. We are going to snap it in place. That snap when someone realizes, you were telling me about apples, but really you were telling me about tubes. That snap is so powerful. I use it with students all the time.\n\n(01:04:21):\nA student acts like a fool, gets in trouble sitting at my desk. I'm not talking about their behavior. I'm telling a story that they have no idea why I am telling them the story. They're like, \"I'm in trouble. Why is he telling me about his dog? Why is he telling me a story about his dog when he was 12?\" Because I'm going to snap it into place. Because I'm not talking about content, theme, meaning or message. So when they come to me and they say, \"Here's what we've got.\" I'm not thinking about the thing. I'm thinking about, what is the theme they want to convey or the meaning that they want to convey or the message they want to convey. And what story do I have that will match that or what story can I get out of them?\n\n(01:04:58):\nThe scientist did not come to me with the apple story. The scientist came to me with the tubes and I said, \"Well, it sounds like you're a company that wants to give people what they need. Let's find a story in your life about a time when you have to give people something that they need.\" And we brainstormed it. And when we landed on apples, I knew we had it. Because he was going to be able to talk about, I'm a father. I'm a husband. I'm the husband who takes apple orders from his family before going to the grocery store. I'm going to be able to be funny, because befuddled husbands in grocery stores are always funny. So it wasn't that he came to me with a story. I came to him with the idea of let's look at theme, meaning and message and then snap it over to the tubes. That's what we want to do when we're putting a band-aid on. We don't want to think about what we're talking about. We want to think about the feelings we want people to have about what we're talking about.\n\nLenny (01:05:52):\nAmazing. Okay. So the advice here essentially is you're trying to find a story to tell about something, to help you convince someone of something. You want to think about what is the theme of this problem that I have? What is the meaning behind it and what is the message?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:05):\nYeah. Usually one of those. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:06:07):\nAnd then you also touched back on make something in the story relate to something personal about you so that people are like, oh, I'm a runner too. I got to pay attention to this guy. Or I'm shopping. I shop all the time for apples.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:18):\nYes. See, so we're stacking strategies, which is a really good thing to do. So we're pulling in all of the things I've talked about and it really makes for a powerful moment for people and a memorable moment. Because the most important thing is that we're becoming memorable. We are in a conference amongst other scientists and we're actually the one who's being remembered.\n\nLenny (01:06:37):\nSo that was the band-aid approach. Then there's the way you recommend it was just build a bank of stories. I imagine this is where the Homework for Life framework you recommend comes from. So maybe let's transition talk about that. Because I think that has a lot of benefits beyond even just coming up with a bunch of story ideas.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:06:53):\nYeah. It's the most important thing that I teach. Whether or not you're ever going to speak in your life. If you plan on being a hermit and going off into the woods and never speaking to someone again, you should be doing Homework for Life regardless. It's a process I came up with maybe 15 years ago now. Essentially when I began telling stories on stages, I fell in love with it immediately, and I got worried that I was going to run out of stories. I saw a lot of storytellers on stages performing, and they would tell the same 6, 7, 8 stories every time, and I didn't want to be that guy. I wanted to have a brand new story every time I took the stage.\n\n(01:07:25):\nSo in a fit of panic, I decided to assign myself homework being an elementary school teacher, it's natural for me to have that inclination. So I just decided every day before I go to bed, I'm going to look back on the day and find one moment that would've been worth telling as a story. Even if it wasn't really worth telling, I was going to write it down. Now I don't write the whole thing down. That's crazy. It's not doable. What I do is I took an Excel spreadsheet, two columns, the date, and then I stretched the B column across. And in that B column, essentially the length of the computer screen, that's where I write my story.\n\n(01:07:59):\nMy goal was I find one new moment per month. 12 new stories per year. That would be amazing. Instead, something far more amazing happens. I discovered that my life is filled with more stories than I will ever have time to tell. And I'm not a unicorn. Thousands of people all over the world are doing the same thing right now and discovering that their lives are filled with stories. Moments like Eileen, which 20 years ago, I would've forgotten that moment within days, and now I've held onto it because it's going to be a Homework for Life moment.\n\n(01:08:29):\nSo I start writing those moments down, and I discovered that I'm developing a lens for storytelling. I see the moments that I did not see before. In fact, I just did some analysis for my new book. In the first year I did Homework for Life I found 1.8 moments per day. So you can find more than one. Eventually I started recording more than one. So 1.8 moments per day. I now find 7.6 moments per day. It's not because my life is more interesting. It's because I have a better lens and I understand what to look for, what to see, and what is worth remembering. So I've become a person who has an endless number of stories like Boris.\n\n(01:09:07):\nBoris does Homework for Life. It's why whenever we meet, he's got three new stories to tell me. And then we work on the stories and then figure out the business applications for them. So it's so important because what we do is we throw our lives away. People say that time flies and it doesn't. What happens is it goes by unaccounted. If you can only remember 89 days of 365 in a year, of course time flies. Because you had 365 and you only remember 89. It's going to feel like it went by quickly. It's not going by quickly, you're just failing to account for each day. And each day has something worth remembering. Homework for Life is the acknowledgement that every single day should have something.\n\n(01:09:48):\nThe prompt that I actually use for myself is this. I say, if someone kidnapped my family and said, \"You can't have them back until you stand on a stage and tell a story about something that happened today, what would you tell?\" That was what I would think in my head every night, and then I would write it down. To be honest, nowadays, I'm not sitting down at the end of the day and writing them all down. I'm recording them as the day goes on. My laptop is around me, my phone is around me. When I hear something. My son says a bit of dialogue I can't believe he just said. I see something for the first time or the last time, or a stray thought enters my mind. I have a new thought that I had not occurred before, all of those become moments for Homework for Life.\n\n(01:10:28):\nNot everyone becomes a story. I did some analysis on this too. About 10% of the things that I write down ultimately either become a story or a part of a story, but the other 90% it's just as valuable. Because I'm holding onto my days. And the other amazing thing that happens is once you start doing this, you'll crack open. And all of the stories that you've left from the past, the ones you've forgotten, they'll start to rise up. They'll bubble up. And I include those in my Homework for Life too as memories. Because once you start looking through the lens of storytelling, you see something like you see Eileen find confidence, and suddenly your brain connects to other students or moments in your life or moments in your children's life, where confidence was an issue and you think, oh, that's right. It's just like that kid.\n\n(01:11:11):\nAnd now I have another moment that I've recovered from the past. A day has returned to me. It enters my Homework for Life, and suddenly I have more stories than I ever have time to tell. And it's not just me. Like I said, thousands of people all over the world, my own children and my students do Homework for Life. And all of them will tell you it's the most valuable thing that you can do.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nAnd I think you touched on this. It's not just to collect a bunch of stories. There's a therapeutic element to this too, that you talk about.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:11:37):\nYeah. Absolutely. Many therapeutic elements. First is you're recovering your time and slowing time down, which is beautiful. My kids are 14 and 11. Thank goodness I started Homework for Life just about when Clara was first born. Because they feel 14 and 11 to me. They don't feel like they were just born yesterday, which for a lot of parents, they do. Lots of parents say things like, \"Oh, my God, you're not going to believe what my kids said. I got to write it down.\" But nobody writes it down. You're not going to believe what my kid said is in Homework for Life for me. So I'm holding onto the moments, stretching out time. You also start to do things like you start to see patterns in your life that you don't realize, unless you really think about your life. And I think you should. Storytellers tend to be slightly self-centered in a positive way, meaning we afford ourselves time to think about ourselves.\n\n(01:12:22):\nYou start to see patterns if you start doing this. So I think what I talk about in my book is I always tell people, my wife and I never fight. We've never raised our voices to each other. We really don't ever argue. But I noticed in my Homework for Life a moment when she had asked me to put in the air conditioners before I had central air in the house, and I hated it. I hated it because we agreed to never buy a house without central air. And every year the air conditioners somehow get heavier. I don't understand the physics behind it, but every year it's worse.\n\n(01:12:50):\nAnd she always asks on the 98 degree day, \"Hey, can you put the air conditioners in?\" And there was a day when I was like, \"No, I'm not going to do it. It's really hot.\" And she was like, \"Okay, no problem.\" And then 10 minutes later, I'm in the basement pulling them out, complaining, grumbling, arguing. Only to myself banging them on purpose so she can hear. She's like, \"What's going on?\" I'm like, \"I'm putting in the air conditioners.\" So that becomes a Homework for Life moment.\n\n(01:13:13):\nAnd then a month later, she asks me to mow the lawn, on a 98 degree day. And I said, \"I'm not going to mow the lawn. I'm busy and it's really hot.\" And she goes, \"Okay, no problem. Maybe tomorrow.\" And then I sit for a while and I stew. And then I'm mowing the lawn, but I'm doing it aggressively. I'm running and just angrily mowing the lawn. And when I see these patterns, I suddenly go, \"Oh, I do fight with my wife, on my own.\" I fight in a way that she's not aware I'm doing it. I yell at her through chores and she's not aware that it's even happening. That becomes a story that couples love. They think it's hilarious.\n\n(01:13:48):\nYou also start to see stories that you would've never seen. So it was a day last May when the neighbors to my left and the neighbors to my right came over to the house and had a cookout, the first one of the year. And that was a day when I didn't find anything in the day. I had one moment, which is very unusual for me. And I remember thinking, \"Really, all you got is you had a cookout with the neighbors, that's the best you got?\" It's not even really a story. But it was the best I had so I wrote it down and I moved on. About four months later, the neighbors to our left announced they were getting divorced. It devastated us. Because they have two kids. We've got this big communal backyard with the three houses. Three boys to the right, two kids to the left, friends. Couldn't believe it that they're getting divorced. Known each other since high school. We just never saw it coming.\n\n(01:14:33):\nOne day later, neighbors to the right announced they're getting divorced. Left and right within a day of each other. And it becomes a story about how you never understand what's going on in a marriage unless you're in that house. But I don't have that moment in May when there were three couples on a porch, one of them was happy. I thought all three were happy. I don't get that moment unless I'm doing Homework for Life, and I write it down, and now I see a trajectory of a story. I have the opposite. Now I actually have an opposite moment which is I'm serving hot dogs to people I think are happy, but they're only pretending to be happy for our sake. And then they're returning to their homes, to discord and eventually to disillusion of a marriage. So Homework for Life gives you all of that that you don't normally have in life because we tend to live day by day, and we leave that last day behind.\n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI got tingles listening to that story. For someone that's now motivated to try this. I know there's a template that we'll link to in the show notes where you give people, it's very simple, but I think seeing it will be helpful. But what's something someone could do tonight to start on this process and maybe set a habit to do? How do you actually go about doing this?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:15:44):\nWell, they have to start Homework for Life. And I have a TED talk about it that I go on for 17 minutes about. So I suggest watching it because you'll just get more than what I just told you and I think that's important. And you have to decide to do it every single day, even on the day when the best you have is a cookout. If that's all you got, that's what you got, and you write it down. You have to have some faith too, that it's going to happen over time. Remember, I started with 1.8 and now I'm up to 7.6. And that's over more than 12 years it takes for me to make that jump.\n\n(01:16:12):\nSo in the beginning, you're not going to be very good at it. You're not going to see the right things, and that's just the way it is. If I go back to my original Homework for Life, I see myself looking for stories. And you're not really looking for stories. You're just looking for moments that touch your heart, touch your mind. That's all you're really hoping for. And some of those will become stories. So you've got to start Homework for Life right away. And then if you can just find some people who are willing to listen and begin telling some stories, that's really helpful because most people are unwilling to listen. There's not a lot of good listeners in the world. Everyone says they're a great listener, but active listening is a skill that most people do not possess in any way whatsoever. But if you find people who are willing to listen, you got to start telling stories. You got to start practicing in meaningful ways. And your first stories aren't going to be great. But the good news is most people's stories are terrible. Most storytelling in the world is not very good. So if you put a little thought into what you're about to say, you're going to be better. Because storytelling is not about facility with the language or your vocabulary. It's all about decision-making. That's all it is.\n\n(01:17:14):\nStorytellers are people who think before they speak. They make strategical tactical decisions before they speak. And ultimately, they make enough good decisions to entertain people. Ultimately, no matter what you're doing, whether I am teaching a fifth grader how to behave better, or presenting a new product for a large company, or helping someone deliver an all hands, the first and most important thing you have to be is entertaining. You have to entertain or people will not listen to you. So you got to practice, you got to get reps.\n\nLenny (01:17:47):\nI want to talk about public speaking skills, but just to close the loop on that. So if someone was trying to do this Homework for Life exercises, the idea, would you recommend at night before they go to sleep, open up Google Sheets on their phone and just add something? Is there something else you'd recommend?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:18:00):\nNo. Yeah. That's what I would do. Although ideally, as you go through...\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:18:00):\nNo. Yeah, that's what I would do. Although ideally, as you go through the day, things get forgotten quickly. Your son says something hilarious and by the end of the night you can't remember what it was. So if you can start sort of tracking it through the day a little bit, maybe you make it a habit where at lunchtime you're going to ask yourself what happened that morning? And when you get home from work, you're going to say what happened in the afternoon? And then in the evening you're going to say what happened since then? And then sort of take a whole view of the day and then be open to those memories, allow them to come back. I record them in my Homework for Life as memory, sort of a capital M-E-M-O-R-Y. Because what happens is you start to build up so many homework for life memories that you get confused.\n\n(01:18:39):\nYou're like, what? When did I see a deer? And then I go, oh, that's a story from when I was 14. But you get confused because it's sitting on when you're 38 years old. So you mark them as memories. You hold onto them, you put them into spreadsheets because eventually you're going to want to move that data around and keep track of it in some meaningful way. But yeah, get started today because if you don't, you will lose today. Every day that you don't do homework for life is a day that is going to be lost to you forever.\n\nLenny (01:19:06):\nAnd just very practically, you recommend like Google Sheets, I imagine is what you use?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:09):\nI actually use old-fashioned Excel, but yes, Google Sheets would work too, because I started so long ago, right, Excel was the thing I used, and Excel is the thing I still use. I mean, it's backed up in 19 places because it's the most precious thing I have other than my wife and children, cats. But yeah, that's what I would suggest to use.\n\nLenny (01:19:26):\nAwesome. Okay. Just a couple more questions before our very exciting lightning round. In your book, you say that you've only been nervous twice on stage giving a story. Most people, I don't know, is that [inaudible 01:19:36].\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:26):\nYeah, that's true. I'm like,-\n\nLenny (01:19:26):\nOkay.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:37):\nI can remember the two times. It was yeah, it was PTSD related and Seth Meyers cost of ticket related.\n\nLenny (01:19:44):\nOh, I remember that story.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:19:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:46):\nOkay. So most people are not like you. Most people are nervous, including me, every single time I get on stage, tell a story. What advice do you give people to help them get better with the nerves of getting on stage and telling a story? Classically, it's the thing people fear most in life.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:20:00):\nWell, the first thing you have to understand is that 98% of your nervousness is actually before you begin speaking. Once you begin speaking, almost all of your nervousness falls away, and that is the experience of most people. So what you're really suffering is from pre-talk nervousness. And when you find that out, that's kind of a relief because if you do it enough. Someone just spoke in the Netherlands, and today I'm waiting to find out how it went. He spoke it for the Florida State Legislature, same topic, and he was really nervous about going into today. He was also really nervous speaking to a bunch of scientists in the Netherlands. But I told him, I said, \"After you began speaking in the Netherlands, once the talk began, how nervous were you?\" And he said, \"Oh, actually, when I began speaking, I was pretty okay. I was incredibly nervous before the talk.\" And I said, \"Well, that makes sense.\"\n\n(01:20:49):\nSo if you own the fact or you believe the fact that, oh, most of my nervousness comes before the talk, but once I start speaking, I'm pretty good. That's really relieving for a lot of people because what we imagine is that we're nervous while we're talking, which is often not the case, particularly if you're kind of prepared, if you know what you're talking about. So be aware that most of your nervousness happens before you speak, and that's a normal thing, and you're just going to have to accept that until some day when perhaps it starts to go away through repetition, through continued performance on a stage. For some people, they're always nervous. I was performing with, I won't say her name, but someone who you have watched on television before, and we were both backstage and I was chatting up the room and she finally said to me, this very famous person, \"Would you stop talking? Because the rest of us are trying to keep information in our head and stay calm.\" I'm a terrible person backstage because I'm always calm, I never care.\n\n(01:21:45):\nSo I have to sort of sequester myself from these people because I torture them. But once she began speaking, all of her nerves fell away. So that's a good thing to know. The other thing to know that's really great is everyone's nervous, except for me. I'm the only monster in the world. So if you're feeling nervous, you're just like everyone else, including a very famous person who you see on TV all the time. That person was nervous, you're nervous, you're in the same camp, right, you're in the same boat. And then preparation is going to reduce your level of nervousness. One of the things that I tell people to do that is most helpful is it's good to practice your talk or practice your pitch, whatever you're doing, but one of the best ways to prepare for it is to record it and listen to it.\n\n(01:22:26):\nListen to it passively, listen to it while your grocery shopping, listen to it while you're folding laundry, doing the dishes. What happens is, I really believe this, as you start to listen to it over and over again, it just sort of seeps into your soul, and so it becomes part of you. I have done this technique. I've told a story a decade ago, haven't told it since. Someone hears it on YouTube and says, \"Hey, can you tell that story at our event?\" I say, \"Yes\". I can listen to it once and it comes right out again because I allowed it to sort of sink into my memory in the same way that When Harry Met Sally has sunk into your wife's memory. She can replay that movie in her mind probably perfectly. If you listen to your talk enough, you will get to the point where you can retell it with ease.\n\n(01:23:09):\nThe other thing you can do is some active listening with it. Most people don't forget their talk. They forget the transitions in their talk. So I'm talking about this, but then I got to transition to this, then I got to transition to this. So when I'm listening to my stories or a talk that I'm going to give, I'm playing a game with myself.\n\n(01:23:26):\nSo I'm listening and I go, oh, okay, this is closing out and the next thing I have to talk about is this, and then the next thing I have to talk about is this. And if I don't know what I'm going to, if I'm like, Ooh, what am I going to next? That's where I go, oh, I got to create a mnemonic there. I got to create a bit of memorization there to train myself for that transition. Once you're in a new section of a talk, even if you're following it up a little, you're going to be okay because you're like, oh, I got to talk about the data related to the this or the that. And if it doesn't come out perfectly, you still know what you're talking about.\n\n(01:23:55):\nBut what happens when you're done with the data related to this or that, you go, ah damn, what am I supposed to do next? Right. So we're working on building those transitions. Before a talk or before a story let's say I will do something like I'm going to start in the car and then I'm going to get out into the store, and then I'm going to head out to the parking lot, and then I'm going to be in the park, and then it's three weeks later. I don't tell myself the story. I'm just bouncing between the scenes because once I know the scenes and I know, okay, there's seven scenes, and here they are, and here's the transitions. Again, if I follow up each scene, that's okay because I'm going to get the information out. It might not come out as perfectly as I hoped. You also, if you can avoid memorizing, that'll save you a ton of suffering because memorizers, they're the most tortured souls in the world. So avoid that if all possible. Remember your talk without memorizing your talk.\n\nLenny (01:24:43):\nReminds me, a friend of mine gave a TED Talk and he shared that they give you this advice that people are different kind of learners. Some are audio learners, some are visual. So if you're like an audio learner, listening to it is the most helpful. Some it's seeing the script.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:24:55):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:24:55):\nAnd looking at it,-\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:24:56):\nAnd I'm very much an auditory learner. The other thing though about listening to it is you just get sick of practicing. It gets so frustrating to practice. So at some point you don't want to say it anymore. So rather than saying it, you start to listen to it. You listen to yourself, tell a story about yourself to yourself, which is the most narcissistic thing you could probably do in the world. But even if you're a visual learner, because it's so annoying to practice eventually, I think listening to it can be really helpful.\n\nLenny (01:25:26):\nOkay. Last question is I want to talk about, I mentioned I bring this up, is the power of saying yes, something that you recommend people say yes to stuff versus no. It reminds me, David Sedaris in a, I don't know, Dave Masterclass video or something, said the same thing. He's just like, \"I just say yes to everything because it creates great stories.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:41):\nReally?\n\nLenny (01:25:42):\nYeah, it's in his Masterclass talk,-\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:44):\nAnd I just finished Sedaris's Happy-Go-Lucky, which is a great book. I love him.\n\nLenny (01:25:48):\nYeah, yeah. So I'd love to hear your advice here for people just to give them a little bit of a final takeaway.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:25:53):\nSure. So I'm going to disagree with Sedaris a little bit. Nah, I won't disagree with him by saying, yes, you do end up with some great stories, but that's not the purpose of the yes. There's actually a book, a storytelling book in the world that I'm not going to mention, and it talks about how to find great stories and it says, go do crazy things and you'll have great stories. I disagree. Fundamentally first, that's a foolish way to live your life. And also some of the best stories I tell, I think the best stories I tell are about tiny moments in our lives where nothing extraordinary happens except everything in our head, right? Most stories that I tell, if you had actually witness the moment of transformation or realization, you would've never known it was happening because most things that happen to us happen in our heads.\n\n(01:26:34):\nIt's not while we're hanging from a cliff, right, for our dear life that we suddenly have a revelation. It's usually like we're walking across a parking lot and suddenly something hits us that's been building up for three weeks, but now it's hit us walking across the parking lot. So the reason we say yes to everything is if you don't say yes, what you're essentially saying is, I am so presumptuous that I understand what's on the other side of that door already even though I've never set foot beyond that door. Right. I just know so much about the world that I know that what's behind that door is not for me. And I think that's foolish and arrogant and full of hubris that is not helping anyone in any way.\n\n(01:27:19):\nSo I say when someone offers you an opportunity, as crazy as it is, as ridiculous, as much as you don't want to do it, which many times in my life, the yeses that I have said about something I did not want to do, but forced myself to do it because of my belief system have resulted in the best and most extraordinary opportunities of my life. A yes can always become a no, right? Yes, I will try that. I step through the door, I give it a try, I spend some time with it. I look around and I say, you know what? Not for me. I step back through and I close the door.\n\n(01:27:54):\nBut so often in life, people don't step through the door. They're too afraid. They've already prejudged the opportunity in some way. They fail to see the benefits of it or the value because they can't see that because they haven't gone through the door. And then there's this ridiculous belief in the world that we're supposed to learn to say no so that we can sort of sequester our time and make it as meaningful as possible, which sounds really terrible to me. The problem is you're going to be 100 someday, and when you're 100, no one is going to be asking you to step through any more doors, and at that point, you're going to look into the past and you're going to say, there were a lot of doors I didn't step through, right, and you're not going to be thinking, I'm so glad I didn't because I allowed myself to stay on the one path that I knew was going to be good for me.\n\n(01:28:46):\nI just think that there is no one good path that's good for you. I think there's a multitude of paths, and they're all great, and a few of them are terrible, but you find out which ones are terrible by stepping through the door, deciding this is not for me and coming back. So I think most of the time people say no because they're afraid. And when someone asks me to do something that scares me, that is when I run to that thing as quickly as possible with all of my might as terrified as I am, because I know that it's the things that frighten me are often the things that are the best for me.\n\n(01:29:19):\nSo we say yes with the acknowledgement that we can say no eventually, but a yes can lead to extraordinary things. And if you watch my TED Talk on saying yes, you'll see that yeses just lead to these extraordinary chains where you said yes to something you didn't want to say yes to, and suddenly it forced you to meet someone who you never would've met, who opened a different door for you. And I mean, the causal chain that you can sort of create by saying an odd yes is extraordinary.\n\nLenny (01:29:47):\nThere was a quote I often come back to around this, which is, \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\"\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:29:51):\nYeah, that's really good. I mean someone, I do standup now quite frequently. I was just in the New York City Comedy Festival, and I do standup because six years ago, one of my buddies sent me an email saying, \"Hey, we should do standup.\" And I replied to him and said, \"No, I'm not interested in that.\" Hit reply. And then I said to myself, \"Whoa, why did you just do that?\" And I said to myself, \"I'm terrified of it.\" I can tell funny stories and if it's not funny, still telling a story, but if I'm doing standup and I'm not funny, I'm failing. And that's a terrifying thing.\n\n(01:30:24):\nSo I immediately sent a second email that said, \"Okay, I'm in. When are we doing it?\" I have now done standup many, many, many times. That guy who initially asked me to do standup with him has never done it. Not once in his life. He wanted to do it, but he's afraid to step through the door. He's too afraid to do the thing that he challenged me to do that I now do on a regular basis because he challenged me and it's still the thing that probably scares me the most. And therefore, it's the thing that I'm relentlessly trying to do at all times because I know the things that scare me are the things that are the best for me.\n\nLenny (01:30:56):\nAmazing. Matt, is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to your very exciting lightning round?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:04):\nNo, I've said enough. They've heard enough from me. Let's go to the lightning round.\n\nLenny (01:31:08):\nWe've covered a lot. Let's do it. Well, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:12):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:31:14):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:31:18):\nOh, so Nathaniel Philbrick's, Heart of the Sea, which is a non-fiction account of the whale ship Essex, which is the origin of the idea for Moby Dick. The sinking of the Essex is what gave Melville the idea for Moby Dick. It's an extraordinary non-fiction account of the whale ship Essex. So that book for sure. If you have children, but even if you don't, because this is one of those children's books that reads well for adults as Kate DiCamillo's, The Tale of Despereaux. It's a young adult novel. It'll take you two hours to read. I've read it 20 times. It is beautiful and extraordinary and fantastic. And then anything by Jessie Klein, she has two books. The only thing I don't like about her is she only has two books. Actually, Sedaris too, Jessie Klein and David Sedaris. Go read those two people too. I'm actually right now reading Bamford's book, the comedian, what's her first name? Bamford. I have Amy stuck in my head for Amy Sedaris. Maria Bamford's memoir right now I'm reading. Also, extraordinary. So there's four that I am now recommending.\n\nLenny (01:32:26):\nAmazing. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:32:32):\nWell, for TV shows I enjoyed The Last of Us, which is based on a video game I've never played in my life. Pretty extraordinary as a TV show, both because filled with stakes. Yeah, it's one of those shows they'll kill anyone at any time. And so you're on the edge of your seat. No one is safe, which is fantastic. And then it has this beautiful bottle episode in the middle of the season, which is one of those things where you're in a zombie TV show, which oddly is unlike any zombie TV show I've ever seen. And then there's a beautiful, fantastic episode. There's another one later on that's sort of very similar. It's just great storytelling in a multitude of ways. It's great. And for a movie, the Barbie movie is better than I ever expected it to be, quite frankly, and is proof positive that you can make stories about just about anything, and if they mean something, it's going to do extraordinarily well.\n\nLenny (01:33:35):\nMy next question, I don't know if it makes sense to ask you, it's usually for product people and founders, but the question is, is do you have a favorite interview question you'd like to ask people when you're hiring? Is there anything that comes up when I ask that?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:33:44):\nI guess I'll say it's the question I like to ask people most often maybe when I'm playing golf and things. I don't like to ask people what they do. I like to ask, how did you get into the job you currently have? It's a dangerous question because occasionally I ask people it and they realize they're in their job for weird happenstances that don't relate to what they dreamed of doing. So I've had two people in my life cry while they answered the question because they suddenly understand, I'm doing this because my sister got me into the company 16 years ago. And I go, \"Oh, well that's great. Is that what you always wanted to do?\" And they say, \"No, it's actually still not what I want to do.\" But I do think that most of the time, how you get a job is more interesting than the actual job you're doing. The answer to that question is more interesting.\n\nLenny (01:34:33):\nYou have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, whether it's an app or something you bought?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:34:38):\nWell, if you celebrate Christmas for years, I have had an idea on how to design the best Christmas tree stand, and I finally said, someone must've done it. And they did. So I wrote it down for you. It's the Krinner tree stand. The Krinner Tree Genie is extraordinary. It's exactly what I would've designed if I had any ability to design it. It holds up the tree like none other. It takes two seconds. It is everything that the research told me it would do. It's fantastic. If you don't celebrate Christmas, I will tell you that a Power POD, which is a small, it attaches to your keychain and it will charge your phone twice and it just lives on your keychain. So I am never a person who's going, oh no, I don't have any charge left. I have two charges on a Power POD, which lives on my keychain.\n\n(01:35:29):\nYou forget it's even there. And then one day you need it and it's fantastic. It's the best one. There's lots of versions of it. The Power POD is the one you want. And then I just bought a hot dog toaster that toasts the hot dogs and the buns at the same time. It's called the Nostalgia Hot Dog Toaster. It looks like it's from the 1950s. It's really beautiful actually. It's the kind of thing you want to put on your counter because it looks fantastic. My son and I love it because we like hot dogs and it'll put two buns and two hot dogs into the toaster. You pull it down, three minutes later you have a hot dog ready to go. You didn't dirty anything. It's not the best hot dog in the world, but hot dogs are pretty great no matter how they're cooked. So I fully support the Nostalgia Hot Dog Toaster.\n\nLenny (01:36:10):\nThese are amazing selections. There's also call back to our nostalgia trick for getting to be funny.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:36:15):\nRight. That's true. Yes. Unintended, but I'll take credit for it.\n\nLenny (01:36:19):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends, either in work or in life?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:36:25):\nYeah, it changed my life really. When I was in fourth grade, a teacher who, and I don't remember which teacher it was, which kills me. I was having a bad day and I was being the way that most people are, frankly. And the teacher said to me, \"Listen, a positive mental attitude will be your key to success.\" And I don't know why it's stuck in my head, but it did. I have said that to myself 100,000 times.\n\n(01:36:48):\nAnd today there's one human being in the world who I think is more positive than me, one human being who I've met, who has more positivity than me. I am a relentlessly positive almost, my wife says offensively positive person. She's like, \"You know what? Some days you can have a bad day.\" And I said, \"I just don't. Because a positive mental attitude is my key to success.\" And it's really the way I frame so much of my life, is looking to the positive, looking to the good. And I do it for people whenever I can. And sometimes it frustrates people. But I really believe that most of life is the mindset that you bring to it. And for me in fourth grade, \"A positive mental attitude will be your key to success,\" for some reason, hit me at the right moment in the right way and has stayed with me ever since.\n\nLenny (01:37:30):\nWhat's interesting about that is it's not even like that well, cleverly put. It sounds like a fortune cookie,\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:37:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:37:36):\nYou get and you're like, yeah, sure. But I love that that really had so much impact on you, it stuck with you.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:37:41):\nYeah, I think it was probably timing really. I think I was really having a hard time, and I know at the time two of my friends were not being my friend anymore, and they were my only two friends sort of at the time. And I think I was just open and ready to hear something that I could do to make my life better. And that was the one, and I'm probably predisposed to being an optimist anyway, so it probably landed just right for me.\n\nLenny (01:38:05):\nA positive mental attitude will be your key to success. Amazing. Final question, maybe just to leave listeners with one tactical thing they can do to become better storytellers. What would that be?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:38:17):\nSo two things should start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life. So you start with location, where are you? Location activates imagination, right? If I say I'm standing in the kitchen, you've already automatically applied 1000 adjectives to my story. You see the kitchen with great clarity. You probably put me in your own kitchen or your parents' kitchen or a kitchen you see on TV. But if the particularities of the kitchen are relevant to the story, that's what I want you to do. I'm not interested in reproducing locations with some kind of visual accuracy in your brain. I want you to see a fully realized location. So I love location because it's one word that comes imbued with 1000 adjectives.\n\n(01:38:59):\nSo you start with location and you start with action, meaning something needs to be happening right away. Literally, I am in a place and I'm doing a thing. It indicates to the audience that you're actually going to tell something that's moving forward. It's why there's a big spaceship shooting of little spaceship in the opening of Star Wars. It's why there's a police officer chasing a guy across a roof. Something is already happening.\n\n(01:39:27):\nWe didn't start with nonsense. We started with something happening that grabbed us right away. That's what people want from story. Also, if you're a person unlike me, which is to say anyone who isn't sort of a white straight American man with no physical or mental disabilities, who thinks, I've always thought every room I walk into, I have the right to speak. But if you are unlike me in those regards, you often find, and I know this is true, that it's harder to make space, to get people to hear you if you're from any marginalized or discriminated against group in any way. But what I've been told by women and people of color and members of the LGBTQ community, they've discovered that when I start a story by going, I'm in a place doing a thing, it's a signal to people that I am now telling a story.\n\n(01:40:12):\nAnd when you can signal to people, I'm now telling a story, they will get quiet for you and they will afford you the opportunity to speak. I didn't know this was going to be the case, but I have had many, many people who I teach this skill to come back to me and say, \"My God, people listen to me.\" And they've said they think they listen because I tell a good story, but they've told me because I start with that location and action, it just tells people, the movie's on. Nobody talks during the movie. You can eat popcorn, but you're not allowed to talk. It silences the room for you and affords you some space to then start doing the work that a good storyteller does to hold those people's attention. So start every story you ever tell for the rest of your life with those two things, and you're already going to be like 50% better than you were before you heard this.\n\nLenny (01:40:57):\nWow. Well, the hits just keep on coming. Matt, you're much more of a philosopher than I imagined you were when we started this conversation. I learned a ton. I'm really excited for people to learn from you. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more or continue learning from you and work with you potentially, especially companies? And then finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:41:17):\nSure. So you can find me at matthewdicks.com or if you're a business oriented person or someone who wants to learn, I also have storyworthymd.com, my initials, MD, and that's where I sort of have courses and online training and things like that. So either place you'll be able to find me and contact me. In a non-self-serving sort of version of your second part of the question, I think if you just tell stories, but more importantly, if you ask people to tell you stories, again, creating that space, listen for people who say things like, oh, something like that happened to me once. What they're really saying is, I wish someone would want to hear what happened to me once.\n\n(01:41:59):\nAnd so I am always someone who's willing to say, oh, tell me that story. Offer someone five minutes of your time so they can finally speak the thing that they've been waiting to speak to someone. So if you just do that, there's going to be more opportunities for storytelling in the world, and ultimately, perhaps that will funnel down to me where they will want to buy my book or visit my website or take some training with me, but just create space for storytelling. I think that'd be a beautiful thing.\n\nLenny (01:42:25):\nI love it. What a beautiful way to end it. Matt, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMatthew Dicks (01:42:29):\nThanks so much, Lenny. I really appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:42:31):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
