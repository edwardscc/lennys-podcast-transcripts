The other person's going to say, \"Oh no, everything's fine.\" The question that I like to ask is, \"What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?\" Do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.\n\nLenny (00:00:33):\nToday my guest is Kim Scott. Kim is the author of Radical Candor, which is the single most referenced book on this podcast. The book has sold over 1 million copies, has been translated into twenty-three languages. It was such an honor to have Kim on the podcast. Prior to this book, Kim was a CO coach at Dropbox, Qualtrics, Twitter and many other tech companies. She was a member of the faculty at Apple University. Before that, she led AdSense, YouTube and DoubleClick teams at Google. Prior to that, Kim managed a pediatric clinic in Kosovo and started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow. She's also working on a new book that you can pre-order now called Radical Respect. In our conversation, we get very practical and very tactical about practicing radical candor. Kim briefly describes the core idea, shares, language and phrases and words you can use to get better at practicing radical candor.\n\n(00:01:24):\nShe shares tips for people-pleasers like myself. Also, a lot of very concrete advice for how to get feedback. Also, what to do if your culture is on the ruinous empathy side of the spectrum, or even worse, obnoxious aggression and so much more. I guarantee listening to this episode will make you a better leader and a better employee. With that, I bring you Kim Scott after a short word from our one featured sponsor for this episode.\n\n(00:01:50):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

I'm excited for our conversation.\n\nLenny (00:03:20):\nYour book, Radical Candor is the single most recommended book on this podcast. I don't know if you know this podcast well, but at the end of the podcast, I ask every guest, \"What are two or three books you recommend most to other people?\" And your book has come up the most of any book mentioned on the podcast.\n\nKim Scott (00:03:37):\nAmazing. Well, tell your listeners I love them and I'm grateful to them.\n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nOkay, they'll hear this. So I'm really excited to have you on chat about all the things that you teach and your book. For people that have heard the term Radical Candor, have maybe skimmed the book, maybe even read the book a while ago, but don't truly remember or understand the concept. Could you just spend just a few minutes giving a high level overview of the concept of Radical Candor?\n\nKim Scott (00:04:04):\nAbsolutely. Radical Candor is just what happens when you care personally and challenge directly at the same time. And I think it's probably best understood by what it's not because we all fail on one of those two dimensions or both of them multiple times a day. So you can think about it as a two by two framework. On the vertical axis is care personally, the horizontal axis is challenge directly. What happens when we remember to challenge directly, but we forget to show that we care personally. That is what I call obnoxious aggression, and it's really important to distinguish between radical candor and obnoxious aggression. I think one of the mistakes that people often make about, and I've gotten a lot, you write a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it, and I've heard a lot of feedback that sometimes teams will be rolling out the idea of Radical Candor and someone will charge into the room and say, \"In the spirit of Radical Candor,\" and then they act like a garden variety jerk.\n\n(00:05:00):\nAnd that is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That's the spirit of obnoxious aggression. And obnoxious aggression is a big problem. It's a problem because it hurts other people. It's also a problem because it's inefficient. If I'm a jerk to you Lenny, then I'm going to send you into fight or flight mode and then you literally cannot hear what I'm saying, so I'm wasting my breath. But I don't know if this is true for you, but for me, there's a third problem. And the third problem is that when I realize I've acted like a jerk, when I realize I've landed in obnoxious aggression, it's not actually my instinct to go the right way on care personally. Instead, it's my instinct to go the wrong way on challenge directly and to pretend that I agree when I disagree, and then I wind up in the worst place of all, manipulative insincerity.\n\n(00:05:48):\nAnd it's kind of fun to tell stories about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. If you watch The Office or any show about problems at work or problems in any kind of relationship really, you're going to see a lot of episodes about obnoxious aggression and manipulative insincerity. But I think the real rub comes and the fact that these, even though this is what we like to talk about, these two problems are what we like to talk about, these are not the most common problem. By far and away the most common problem occurs when we do remember to show that we care personally because you know what? Most people try to be nice people. So we do remember to show that we care personally, but we're so worried about not hurting someone's feelings or not offending them, that we fail to tell them something they'd be better off knowing in the long run. And that is what I call ruinous empathy. So that is Radical Candor in a nutshell. That's the TLDR. But please do read.\n\nLenny (00:06:40):\nAmazing and we'll link to a diagram of this two by two for people that aren't visual thinkers and want to actually see it. So just to make it super clear, if you're challenging directly, basically being very candid with feedback, but it's not clear you care deeply about the person, you call that obnoxious aggression.\n\nKim Scott (00:06:40):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:06:57):\nAnd if you make it clear, you care a lot about the person but aren't actually giving them direct candid feedback, you call that ruinous empathy.\n\nKim Scott (00:07:05):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:07:06):\nWhich of these buckets do you find most people fall into? Is there a percentage of people or companies?\n\nKim Scott (00:07:11):\nYeah, I mean, I would say 90% of us make 90% of our mistakes in that ruinous empathy bucket. It's by far and away the most common problem. But I think all of us make mistakes in the other quadrants as well. And very often we kind of, I think one of, if I'm going to offer some self-criticism of this framework, it's much easier to notice when one has been ruinously empathetic. It's almost like, give yourself some critical feedback. \"I work too hard.\" But it's much harder to notice when we've been manipulatively insincere and obnoxiously aggressive. And maybe I could have named those things because very often manipulative insincerity is sort of self-protective insincerity. Very often obnoxious aggression is just extreme frustration. So I want people to use this framework not to judge themselves or other people harshly, but like a compass to guide specific conversations with specific people to a better place and to help us understand when we're going in the wrong direction, which we are all bound to do on a daily basis.\n\nLenny (00:08:26):\nI want to talk about all those things and also how to get better at these things. But before we do that, it's very hard to change. And it's also hard just to challenge directly innately, it's hard for people to be candid, just to give people a little motivation to invest in this skill. What sort of impact do you see when people develop the skill of being better at radical candor?\n\nKim Scott (00:08:48):\nWhen we get better at radical candor? I mean, I'll tell you a story in fact about the impact it had on my life, some radical candor, but the sort of abstract answer to your question is we build better relationships and we do better work and we're more successful and we're happier. You ready for a story? Let's do it. Love stories. Okay. So shortly after I joined Google, this was now a very long time ago, 2004, I had to give a presentation to the founders and the CEO about how the AdSense business was doing. And I walked into the room and there in one corner of the room was one of the founders on an elliptical trainer wearing toe shoes and a bright blue spandex unitard, super tight, not what I was expecting or frankly wanting to see in the room. And there in the other corner of the room was the CEO doing his emails like his brain had been plugged into the machine.\n\n(00:09:49):\nSo probably like you in such a situation, I felt a little bit nervous. How was I supposed to get these people's attention? Luckily for me, the AdSense business was on fire. And when I said how many new customers we had added, the CEO almost fell off his chair. \"What did you say? This is incredible. Do you need more engineers? Do you need more marketing dollars?\" So I'm thinking the meeting's going all right. In fact, I now believe that I am a genius. And I walked out of the room, I walked past my boss and I was expecting a high five a pat on the back. And instead she said to me, \"Why don't you walk back to my office with me?\" And I thought, Oh gosh, I screwed something up in there and I'm sure I'm about to hear about it. And she began not by telling me what I had done wrong, but what had gone well in the meeting, not in the feedback sandwich.\n\n(00:10:37):\nI think there's a less polite term for that. I'm not sure how you feel about cussing on your podcast.\n\nLenny (00:10:37):\nIt's acceptable, fully acceptable.\n\nKim Scott (00:10:43):\nNot in the shit sandwich since the word, but really seeming to mean what she said. But of course, all I wanted to do was hear about what I had done wrong. And eventually she said to me, \"You said um a lot in there, were you aware of it?\" And with this, I braved a huge sigh of relief if that was all I had done wrong who really cared. And I kind of made this brush off gesture with my hand. I said, \"Yeah, I know, it's a verbal tech. It's no big deal, really.\" And then she said to me, \"I know this great speech coach. I bet Google would pay for it. Would you like an introduction?\" And once again, I made this brush off gesture with my hand.\n\n(00:11:14):\nI said, \"Oh, I'm busy. I don't have time for a speech coach. Didn't you hear about all these new customers?\" And then she said to me, \"I can tell when you do that thing with your hand, then I'm going to have to be a lot more direct with you. When you say um every third word, it makes you sound stupid.\" Now she's got my full attention. And some people might say it was mean of her to say I sounded stupid, but in fact, it was the kindest thing that she could have done for me at that moment in my career because she knew me well enough to know that if she didn't use just those words with me, and by the way, this is a really important point, she never would've used those words with other people on her team who were perhaps a better listener than I was.\n\n(00:11:56):\nBut she knew me well enough. She cared personally enough to know that if she didn't use those words with me, I never would've gone to visit the speech coach and I wouldn't have learned that she was not exaggerating. And this was news to me because I had raised millions of dollars for two different startups giving presentations. I thought I was pretty good at it. And it really got me to thinking sort of why had no one told me. It was almost like I suddenly realized I'd been marching through my whole career with a giant hunk of spinach in between my teeth and nobody had had the common courtesy to tell me it was there. So why had no one else told me. But what was it about her leadership style that made it so seemingly easy for her to tell me? And as I thought about that, I realized it really came down to those two things.\n\n(00:12:41):\nShe cared personally and she challenged directly. She cared about me not just as an employee but as a human being. For example, when my father was diagnosed with late stage cancer, I was devastated and she could tell that I was devastated. And she said, \"Kim, look, you go to the airport, fly home to Memphis, you need to be with your family. Your team and I will sit down and write your coverage plan.\" That's what great teams do for one another. And those were the kinds of things, that was the kind of thing that she did. She couldn't do, of course, for all 5,000 people in her organization, no matter how talented you are, relationships don't scale. But she did do those things for her direct reports and the people who she worked most closely with, all of us.\n\n(00:13:27):\nAnd when a leader treats their team, the people who they interact with on a day-to-day basis with that kind of real care, then it's much more likely that their direct reports in turn are going to treat their teams with real care. And that creates a culture of caring. And even though relationships don't scale, culture does scale. So that was part of it. But of course there's also this challenge directly part which is equally as important. And I learned very quickly beyond a shadow of a doubt that if I screwed up, she was going to tell me and she was going to keep telling me until it penetrated my sometimes thick skull.\n\nLenny (00:14:07):\nI had a manager that was also very good at this. He was very good at just giving me very direct feedback, and I knew that he was only doing it because he cared about my future. To kind of follow this thread and get a little tactical, is there language or phrases or ways of communicating that you recommend people use to either challenge directly and avoid people getting defensive or make it clear you care deeply?\n\nKim Scott (00:14:31):\nPeople always want me to give them a script. And the problem with the script is that if I write it, you're going to sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself. And then people won't really think you mean what you're saying. But I do think there are some important things to consider when having these conversations. I think you want to go into the conversation, and by the way, everything I'm about to say applies to praise as much as it does to criticism. And I want to pause for a moment. That story is helpful because that's the kind of thing that has happened to so many of us, that's not unique to me. However, praise is even more important than criticism in terms of radical candor. Radical candor is not all about the boss giving the employee criticism. It should always start with soliciting feedback and it should include more praise and criticism, but anyway, way without offering up shit sandwiches.\n\n(00:15:31):\nSo anyway, I think that the important thing for these conversations, these sort of two-minute impromptu moments of management, is to go into the conversation being humble. To me, I call it candor and not truth because if I march into a room and I say, \"Lenny, I'm going to tell you the truth.\" I'm kind of implying I've got a pipeline to God and you don't know anything. And that's not what this is all about. This is a dialogue, not a monologue. So to me, candor implies here's how I understand the situation. I'm also curious to know how you understand the conversation. So you want to go in being humble, you might be wrong, and that's totally fine. Omniscience is not a requirement for radical candor, thank heavens. So you want to be humble. You want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to remember in your own head and you want to make it explicit to the other person that you're telling them this to help them.\n\n(00:16:25):\nYou're not trying to be dominant or kick them in the shins or anything like that. You're telling them this because you care about them. So you want to state your intention to be helpful. You want to have these conversations right away, almost immediately. I mean, there's exceptions to everything I'm saying. None of this is absolute. But usually if I'm telling myself and Lenny, you can tell me if you have the same problem, but if I tell myself, Oh, I'm going to wait for a better moment to tell this person this thing, what I'm really saying is I'm never going to say. So if the purpose of praise is to tell people what to do more of, and the purpose of criticism is to tell them what to do less of, why wait. So you want to do it immediately unless you are so upset that you're going to say it in a terrible way or the other person is so upset that they can't hear you. But usually that's not the case.\n\n(00:17:16):\nYou also want, and in the before times I used to say have these conversations in person. Now I say have these conversations synchronously and I'm going to recommend phone over video. There's a lot of evidence coming out of University of Chicago and probably other places, but that's the article I've read that there's more noise than signal in facial expressions and body language, especially if somebody is just a little square on a computer screen. But it also may be true in real life, like the phone actually may be one of our best communication innovations of all time because when you're talking to someone on the phone, you're listening to the words that they are saying to you, and that is really what you want to do in this moment. So make sure that you're having these conversations synchronously, because what you want to do next is gauge how it's landing.\n\n(00:18:15):\nSo I'll talk about that in a minute. And you can't gauge how something is landing if you're sending an email or a text, and Slack is just a feedback train wreck waiting to happen. I once coached someone who kept giving feedback over Slack and I finally just quit coaching him. I was like, \"If you keep making this mistake, I can't be your coach.\" So don't do that. Take a moment to pick up the phone and call the person. Go back to those old AT&T commercials when I was a kid. Reach out and touch someone. You want to show you care.\n\n(00:18:52):\nSo let's review. You want to be humble, you want to be helpful, you want to do it immediately. You want to do it in person or at least synchronously. If you can't do it in person. You also want to praise in public and criticize in private, and you don't want to give people either praise or criticism about their personality. So if you want to remember all that, it's HHIIPPP, two H's, two I's, kind of three P's depending on how you count.\n\n(00:19:21):\nAnd so let's double-click though on this not about personality point. I think it's really important to remember that for both praise and criticism, you want to use sort of context, observation, result, next step. So context, in the meeting, observation, when you said um every third word, result, it made you sound stupid. Next step, go to the speech coach. Also is important for praise, in the meeting context, when you offered both sides of the argument, observation, result is it earned you credibility. Next step is do more of that. So you can call it CORE, you can think about that as CORE. I used to call it CORN, but I got some feedback that corn is like some shorthand for porn on TikTok. So I call it CORE instead, HIP CORE.\n\nLenny (00:20:16):\nWow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing all that. So the E at the end stands for?\n\nKim Scott (00:20:20):\nNext step, big E.\n\nLenny (00:20:21):\nOh, I see the E is the next, you skipped the N, clever.\n\nKim Scott (00:20:26):\nYes. I don't know, clever or ridiculous. Maybe I should just call it HIP CORN,\n\nLenny (00:20:31):\nRight? No, I think either one's great. So you share this example of the speaking example. Maybe if we can do another example just to reinforce this framework.\n\nKim Scott (00:20:43):\nLet's do a little ruinous empathy.\n\nLenny (00:20:47):\nOkay, great. Let's do it.\n\nKim Scott (00:20:47):\nHow about that? That is the mistake. I think that I am really focused in the book Radical Candor and also in my next book Radical Respect. That's the mistake I really want to eliminate.\n\nLenny (00:21:00):\nLet's do it.\n\nKim Scott (00:21:00):\nBecause ruinous empathy creates this false harmony, which is really bad. So here's my ruinous empathy story. I had just hired this guy, we'll call him Bob, and I liked Bob a lot. He was smart, he was charming, he was funny. He would do stuff like we're at a manager offsite playing one of those endless get to know you games. And everybody was getting more and more and more stressed out. So start up, we've got a lot going on. And Bob was the guy who had the courage to raise his hand and to say, \"I can tell everyone is getting stressed. I want to get to know all of you. I've got an idea. It'll help us do that and it'll be really fast.\"\n\n(00:21:41):\nWhatever his idea was, if it was really fast, we were down with it. And Bob says, \"Let's just go around the table and confess what candy our parents used when potty training us.\" Really weird but really fast. And then for the next 10 months, every time there was a tense moment in a meeting, Bob would whip out just the right piece of candy for the right person at the right moment. And we all remember that was the weirder thing. Like Hershey Kisses right here. That was what my parents used to potty train me.\n\n(00:22:16):\nAnd so Bob was quirky, but he brought a little levity to the office. Everybody kind of loved working with Bob. There was one problem with Bob. He was doing terrible work. He would hand stuff into me and there was shame in his eyes. He kind of knew it wasn't good enough. He was very creative, but riddled with sloppy mistakes. And I would say something to Bob along the lines of, \"Oh Bob, this is such a great start. You're so awesome. We all love working with you. Maybe you can make it just a little bit better.\" So let's pause for a moment. Why did I say such a banal thing to Bob? I think part of the problem was that I liked Bob and I really didn't want to hurt his feelings.\n\n(00:23:05):\nSo that was the ruinous empathy part of why I said that. But also part of the problem was something more insidious, a little bit of manipulative insincerity, because Bob was popular and Bob was also sensitive kind of. And there was part of me that was afraid if I told Bob in no uncertain terms that his work wasn't nearly good enough, he would get upset. He might even start to cry and then everybody would think I was a big, you know what? So the part of me that was worried about my reputation as a leader, that was the manipulative insincerity part, the part of me that was worried about Bob's feelings, that was the ruinous empathy part. And this went on for 10 months, 10 long months, and I was so puzzled the whole time I couldn't understand what was going on. I learned much later that one of the issues perhaps was that Bob was smoking pot in the bathroom three times a day, which maybe explained all that candy that he had at all times.\n\n(00:24:11):\nBut I didn't know any of that at the time. All I knew is that Bob was consistently doing bad work, but I wasn't really dealing with it. And eventually the inevitable happened. I realized that if I didn't fire Bob, I was going to lose all my best performers because not only had it been unfair to Bob not to tell him, I also had been unfair to everyone on the team. And they were frustrated. Their deliverables were late because his deliverables were late. They weren't able to do their best work because they were having to spend so much time redoing his work.\n\n(00:24:46):\nAnd the people who were best at their jobs were going to quit because they wanted to be able to do their best work. They were going to go to a different company where they could do their best work. And so I sat down to have a conversation with Bob that I should have begun frankly 10 months previously. And when I finished explaining to him where things stood, he kind of pushed his chair back from the table. He looked me right in the eye and he said, \"Why didn't you tell me?\" And as that question was going around in my head with no good answer, he looked at me again and he said, \"Why didn't anyone tell me? I thought you all cared about me.\" And now I realized that by not telling Bob, thinking I was being so nice, I'm having to fire him as a result. Not so nice after all. But it was too late to say Bob because at this point even he agreed he should go because his reputation on the team was just shot.\n\n(00:25:46):\nAll I could do in the moment was make myself a very solemn promise that I would never make that mistake again, and that I would do everything in my power to help other people avoid making that mistake. It was so painful. It was painful for me. It was painful for Bob, much more painful for Bob actually, and it was bad for the whole team and it was bad for our investors. We weren't getting results because of my ruinous empathy and ruinous empathy slash manipulative insincerity. It's much harder to admit the manipulative insincerity part. And that is really why I'm here talking to you because I want all of your listeners to avoid making that mistake because it's the most painful and the most common mistake that I think leaders and not just leaders, I mean all of us make this mistake in all of our relationships.\n\nLenny (00:26:41):\nI love that this also gives an example of the impact of getting better at this point of you'll lose not just the people that are not necessarily great, but also other high performers on the team because they're seeing people slip through the cracks that aren't amazing. And if you're not practicing this early, your team basically becomes not high performing.\n\nKim Scott (00:27:00):\nYeah, exactly. You're going to lose your top performers. And I think very often people are afraid to tell someone on their team when their work isn't good enough because they're afraid of losing them. But that's not a good reason. You should be helping this person to improve. This person deserves to have a job where they can excel and you either help them excel on this team or you help them find a different job where they can excel, because everyone can do great work somewhere. And Bob could have done great work. Maybe I would've helped him keep it to the weekends because he's very creative and very smart, but the floppy mistakes just got in the way of his ability to do his best work.\n\nLenny (00:27:50):\nSo following that thread, I imagine the reason you didn't tell him early, and most people don't do this well, is many people are, you can maybe call them people pleasers. I'm a recovering people pleaser, I'll say. It's just hard to give people hard feedback. You want people to like you. It's not a natural state for a lot of people. What do you find helps people get over this kind of need to be liked as a leader and helps them be more candid?\n\nKim Scott (00:28:15):\nI think that one of the things that was helpful for me anyway, so you can tell me if it's helpful for you, was realizing that my job was not to be liked. My job was to care about other people and to get out of my own head and to become others focused is what helped me kind of let go of the need to be liked. I think that also as a woman, I think there was something extra, as my teenage children would say, there was something extra for me because the sort of likability- competence bias that a lot of women face pushed me, especially early in my career, in the wrong direction on challenge directly.\n\n(00:29:04):\nAnd it made it much harder for me to, because often I would say something and I would say it even more gently than my colleagues who were men, but people would say, \"Ah, Kim is a real whatever.\" And they weren't saying, Kim is obnoxious. I was being unjustly accused of obnoxious aggression and it wasn't obnoxious or they were accusing me of being bossy or or abrasive or whatever. And it's really hard. I would also say when it comes to eliciting feedback, it's really important to be open to it and it's really important to separate the wheat from the chaff from the feedback you're getting.\n\nLenny (00:29:41):\nSo in this example of Bob, say you were to do it now, what would you do differently other than give him feedback earlier? Is there something you've learned about just how you would've phrased it or approached it?\n\nKim Scott (00:29:58):\nI think probably what I would do, and I would love to hear what you would've said to Bob too, I certainly don't have all the answers, but probably what I would've said is let's go back to the first time Bob handed work into me with shame in his eyes. I would've said, \"Bob, maybe I'm misinterpreting the expression on your face, but it looks to me like you are not happy with this. What's going on?\" And so I would've asked him to diagnose it himself and I want to pause on that because that can be very risky. He might have said to me, \"I think this is awesome. This is my best work,\" and now I've kind of made my job of giving him feedback a little bit harder. So it's not always the right thing to ask questions, but I would've tried to ask it before I had examined the work when I noticed that he looked uncomfortable himself.\n\n(00:30:47):\nAnd I think also another thing I've learned about noticing, I said earlier that there's a lot of evidence that we often misinterpret each other's facial expressions and body language. So I would've tried to say that with some humility, it seems like you're not, maybe I'm wrong, but you don't look to me like you're happy with this. And I would've given him an opportunity to say, \"Yeah, maybe I need to do it again.\" Let's imagine though that he said, \"Oh no, it's awesome. It's ready.\" So then I get it and I look at it. I would have not been shy about pointing out very specifically every problem that I saw in that piece of work, every single one. Sometimes it can be tempting when you're giving someone feedback to say, \"Oh, there's a number of careless mistakes here. Can you go back and look at it again,\" and the person will notice a few of them and then you got to go, sometimes it's useful to show someone a pattern.\n\n(00:31:53):\nAll of the careless mistakes, especially if someone is defensive or if you think they're likely to be defensive, if you think they're likely to do to you what I did to my boss, oh no, everything's fine. It's no big deal. You need to move out on the challenge directly dimension. You need to be prepared to keep going until you have communicated with a person. And that was really the problem with Bob. He probably would not have started to cry. I think my fear around his tears was probably more about my fear than what was actually likely to happen. But I think we do fear someone else getting upset more often than they actually get upset. We have kind of a negativity bias when it comes to part of the reason why we're reluctant to give feedback.\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\nAnd I think to your point, that we want to be liked, like you said, that you should get over that. I think that's obviously very hard just to be like, \"Nah, I'm not going to worry about that.\" But I think your point is really important that you'll be liked later if you don't do the hard thing now. It'll only get worse if you just let it continue happening.\n\nKim Scott (00:33:01):\nAnd I think also for me to say to myself going into that conversation, it's more important for me to demonstrate care, that I care about Bob than it is for Bob to like me, and if I demonstrate that I care about Bob, then I'm going to do the right thing that will ultimately create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob. Me pulling my punches did not create the conditions for a good relationship with Bob.\n\nLenny (00:33:31):\nI actually did that and I learned this from a manager of mine is just almost work backwards from ask them, what do you want to achieve in your career? Where do you want to go in this company and make sure they know you know what they want, and then basically work backwards from to get there. Here's the things you need to get, and here's the thing you did recently that isn't necessarily on the track and here's what we should be working on if you want to get to the skull that you have.\n\nKim Scott (00:33:57):\nYeah, I think one of the really important things that all managers can do for their direct reports to show that they care is to have real meaningful career conversations, where you talk about their life story, sort of their past, whatever part of it they're comfortable talking to you about so that you understand what motivates them at work. And I would have three separate 45 minute conversations, so one about their past, one about their future, their dreams for the future, and it's not just the next couple of years. It's like imagine at the height of your career you have everything you want. What does it look like? And give me three or four different pictures of that because very few of us know what we want to do when we grow up.\n\n(00:34:40):\nThen the third conversation is to sort of sit down with your director report and come up with a career action plan. So given what motivates you and where you want to go, what are the skills that it would be useful for you to develop so that you can get where you want to go and who can I introduce you to? What are the educational opportunities? Can we tweak your job so that you're gaining those skills so you're at least taking a step in the direction of your dreams, even if you're not there yet?\n\nLenny (00:35:11):\nAwesome. I have a post about this. I'll link to in the show notes that gives people a guide to having these conversations, and there's a spreadsheet I share with people like, here's an action plan you can come up with your teammate and here's what you're going to work on these next six months.\n\nKim Scott (00:35:24):\nDid you read the book When they Win, You Win by Russ Laraway?\n\nLenny (00:35:24):\nNo.\n\nKim Scott (00:35:29):\nOh, he has a hundred pages on career conversations and he's also built sort of some tools that help people. So check that out.\n\nLenny (00:35:39):\nAnd it's called When You Win... When They Win, You Win.\n\nKim Scott (00:35:41):\nWhen They Win, You Win.\n\nLenny (00:35:42):\nAmazing.\n\nKim Scott (00:35:42):\nYes, by Russ Laraway, he and I worked together at Google and then we started a company together.\n\nLenny (00:35:48):\nOh wow. Okay, cool. We'll link to them in the show notes. Maybe I'll get him on the podcast too. Great.\n\nKim Scott (00:35:51):\nYeah, he'd be great.\n\nLenny (00:35:53):\nOkay, so we've been chatting about ways individually to get better at some of these skills. Another area that I think people struggle with is the company culture often isn't welcoming of direct feedback. So there's a question, so you probably saw this on Twitter. I asked people, what should I ask you? And a lot of people came in with a lot of questions and there's one that came in from Pete, so I'm just going to read it along these lines. So this question is just how do you practice being radically candid in a culture? And most cultures are like this where people aren't ready for direct feedback. Since company culture is often closer to ruinous empathy and being radically candid is more of a long-term good than a short-term good. You could potentially risk retention with your employees if you're too direct with them. So how do you think about finding this balance of being candid but not pissing people off, or do you just hire people that are open and ready for direct feedback and that's kind of how you solve that problem?\n\nKim Scott (00:36:45):\nI don't think you can only hire people who are open and ready for direct feedback because it's hard for all of us. I just want to acknowledge that, it's hard for me. I mean, I wrote the book, I believe in it to my core and sometimes it's still hard for me. It's hard for me to hear it and it's hard for me to deliver it. This is a really difficult thing to do. The good thing about that two by two is it makes it look easy, which is useful, but it's not easy. So anyway, I think there are, to answer Pete's question, I think there are a few things that can help. There's really an order of operations to radical candor, and if you begin with soliciting criticism, then you take the first and most important step to improving your relationship with that person enough that it becomes easier for you to give it as well as to get it.\n\n(00:37:35):\nSo I want to leave folks with some sort of steps on how to solicit feedback, and this is true, especially if you're a boss, but it's true in all your relationships. You can use this at home as well. So if you say, \"Do you have any feedback for me?\" You're wasting your breath. The other person's going to say, \"Oh no, everything's fine.\" Nobody in your life accepts your teenage children. If you have teenage children, they'd really want to give you some criticism, but nobody else in your life really wants to give you criticism. And so you want to think about how you're going to ask the person that's going to be most likely to elicit a response. The question that I like to ask is, \"What could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me?\" But do not write down my question because if you sound like Kim Scott and not like yourself, then other people are not going to believe you want the answer. It needs to sound authentic to you.\n\n(00:38:33):\nI was working with Christa Quarles when she was CEO of OpenTable and she said, \"Kim, I could never imagine those words coming out of my mouth.\" She said, \"The way I like to ask is tell me why I'm wrong.\" Okay, that's fine too. It demands an answer to her question. But of course there were a couple of people on her team who felt that that was too aggressive, that shut them down, so she had to adjust her question. Being authentic does not mean ignoring the impact you're having on others. So you want to think about your question, you want to think about who you're going to ask that question of, and if everybody can write down their question, who they're going to ask it of and then pop it into their calendar right now, this will be one of the most productive podcasts in all of podcast land.\n\nLenny (00:39:22):\nLet's spend more time on this actually. So what is it you recommend, that they pick? How many people would you recommend they pick, and ask feedback from?\n\nKim Scott (00:39:28):\nWell, I think if you are a manager, you need to be soliciting every week feedback from each of your direct reports, and you need to sort of, I would budget five minutes at the end of your one-on-one to solicit feedback. So mostly a one-on-one should be your employees setting the agenda and your employee's time and don't by the way, save up when you have to give feedback. Don't save it up for your one-on-one and definitely don't save it up for a performance review. You want to give that in the moment. We can talk more about that in a second, but when you're soliciting feedback, save five minutes at the end of your one-on-one and ask that go-to question. And you also want to ask that go-to question of your cross-functional peers who you work most closely with and of your boss. And I think you don't want to ask the same question every single time. It'll start to sound like you don't really want the answer, but you want to make this part of your daily weekly routine with the people who you interact most closely with.\n\nLenny (00:40:34):\nSo you added to the end of this your one-on-one agenda, and two versions of this question are, what am I doing wrong? Which is that one I guess you iterated.\n\nKim Scott (00:40:43):\nTell me why I'm wrong or what am I doing wrong or what could I do or stop doing that would make it easier to work with me? Or what should I stop doing? What should I start doing? What should I continue doing? Those are some common ones. What do you like to ask Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:41:00):\nI think it was something along the lines of like, what's one thing I could be doing better or what's one way I could be helping you be more successful?\n\nKim Scott (00:41:07):\nThat's a really good one. What's one way I could help you be more successful? Or Jason Rosoff, my co founder at Radical Candor likes to ask, \"What could I have done this week?\" So he time, he time bounds it. \"What could I have done this week to better support you in your work?\" In fact, Jason told me after we had worked together for about a month, he was like, \"Kim, I really hate your go-to question.\" He said, \"It's too open-ended for me. If you can tell me what you're working on and ask me at the end of a meeting specifically what I noticed then that is much better.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:48):\nHow often do you accept no answer? Just like, no everything's great.\n\nKim Scott (00:41:52):\nNever,\n\nLenny (00:41:53):\nNever,\n\nKim Scott (00:41:53):\nNever. I mean, there are some people who really don't like to be put on the spot. So if I can tell that I'm inflicting a cruel and unusual punishment on the person, I'll say, \"Look, you know I'm not perfect. I know I'm not perfect. Next time we meet, I want you to think of something, notice something. It's the thing that you can do that would help me more than anything else that you could do is to tell me when I'm wrong because I need to know that.\" In fact, Andy Grove, who was the CEO of Intel said he used to at the end of his one-on-ones say to people, \"There's one more thing. And he explained to me that that was coded Intel for like this is the most important thing.\" I was working at Apple at the time and I said, \"Oh, did you get that from Steve Jobs?\"\n\n(00:42:47):\nThat was always how he introduced, \"Just one more thing, the iPad.\" And Andy got immediately very grumpy and very offended, and he said, \"No, we both got it from Colombo. The detective show.\" You can get tips from anywhere. So you want to make sure that you're though letting the person know that you really do care about what they say and that it's really when they give you this critical feedback that you're going to reward it. But that's not the end. Asking that question is only the first step, the bad news about your question, no matter how hard you think about it, and no matter how good a question it is, the other person is still going to feel uncomfortable. There's no such thing as emotional Novocaine. That's why I don't believe in scripts. People believe if I just say the magic words like the door will open, that's not how it works. It's a give and take. So you want to sort of be prepared to embrace that discomfort. The only way out is through. Simplest way to embrace the discomfort is to close your mouth and count to six.\n\n(00:43:59):\nOnly made it to three just there, and your eyes were popping out.\n\nLenny (00:44:03):\nThat is so long.\n\nKim Scott (00:44:04):\nSix seconds is a really long time. Almost nobody can endure six full seconds of silence. So they'll probably tell you something. So now you've dragged this poor soul out on a conversational limb that they never wanted to go on. They're probably going to say something. The third step is to make sure that you listen with the intent to understand not to respond, because you're probably going to feel defensive and that's okay. It doesn't mean you're a lesser mortal or that you're shut down the feedback. All it means is that you're human. And that's all part of this. You want to figure out how to manage your natural defensive reaction to critical feedback, which you're probably going to have. The simplest tactic I can offer folks there is to think of some follow-up questions.\n\n(00:44:56):\nSo at breakfast, my daughter not too long ago said to me, \"Mom, I wish you weren't the Radical Candor lady.\" And immediately this wave of parental guilt washed over me and I thought, ah, I'm spending too much time at work. She wants more of my time. I shouldn't be traveling so much. But then I thought, well, I should ask her, make sure I understood. I'm jumping to conclusions here. I'm not listening with the intent to understand. So I asked a follow-up question. I said, \"Well, who do you wish I were?\" And she said, \"I wish you were the lady who minded her own business,\" so I could go spend a little more time at work as far as she was concerned. So you want to make sure you really understand what a person is telling you. And once you feel certain that you really do understand and that you've been open to it, the last and most important step is to reward the candor.\n\n(00:45:46):\nA person takes a huge risk, especially if this person is your employee. A person takes a huge risk to give you critical feedback. And if you do not reward that risk richly, you're never going to get any feedback again. So if you agree with the feedback, fix the problem and make your listening tangible, be loud. So-and-so told me that the tea in the break room is terrible, and now we have thirty-five different kinds of tea. Thank you for telling me. And that can demonstrate to people that they're not wasting their breath to come to you. That if you become aware of a problem, you'll fix it. And you also want to, by the way, you want to ask for feedback after you fixed it. Did I over-correct or did I under-correct?\n\n(00:46:31):\nMy boss at Google, the same boss from the um story also told me when she gave me some feedback that I tended to move too fast. And she said, \"Kim, until people and giving you feedback that you're going too slow. You won't have corrected this problem.\" So you kind of want to shoot to over-correct if you get some critical feedback. I also want to though pause on what to do when you get some critical feedback that you disagree with because it can be easy to feel wedged here. And if all you do is say thank you for the feedback, the other person is going to hear something much less polite than a brush off or worse.\n\n(00:47:10):\nAnd so what you want to do is you want to look for that five or 10% of whatever the person said that you can agree with, and you want to give voice to that. And then what you want to do is you want to say, \"As for the rest of it, I want to think about it and get back to you.\" And then you've got to get back to them. You got to offer a respectful explanation of why you disagree. And it's tempting to feel like a disagreement poses a risk to our relationships, but it's not disagreement that poses a risk to our relationships. It's unspoken disagreement. Many, I don't know about you Lenny, but a lot of my best professional relationships began with a good respectful disagreement.\n\nLenny (00:47:51):\nInteresting. That reminds me of just watching Squid Games, the reality show on Netflix. Yeah. Have you seen this at all?\n\nKim Scott (00:47:56):\nI haven't watched it, but it's on my list.\n\nLenny (00:47:59):\nThere's this guy who makes a huge bad decision on behalf of his whole team and they hate him in the show. And then on TikTok, he shared that they're best friends now, even though they called him a big idiot.\n\nKim Scott (00:48:09):\nYeah, no.\n\nLenny (00:48:09):\nSo funny.\n\nKim Scott (00:48:10):\nIt can happen for sure.\n\nLenny (00:48:12):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined.

Wait six seconds potentially or try to, it's very hard. Ask a few follow-up questions to make sure you understand what they're saying and then find a way to reward them. Say thank you.\n\nKim Scott (00:49:53):\nDo more than say thank you.\n\nLenny (00:49:55):\nEspecially if you disagree, which is a really interesting nuance of this. I had Jules Walter on the podcast. I always think of him when I think of getting feedback. He shared this advice. When you get feedback, just be so appreciative so that people keep giving me just like, \"Thank you so much for that feedback.\" The way he phrases it. Even if you're melting inside and really hate this feedback, just like, \"thank you, I really appreciate it.\" But I think your nuance there is really key is if you do disagree, I really like this tip of just like, let me think about this element of it and then actually follow up.\n\nKim Scott (00:50:25):\nEven if you're melting inside, if you say thank you and you're melting inside, I mean maybe it's a terrible actor, but usually people know. And that's why I say it's not enough to say thank you. You got to fix the problem and then show what you did to fix the problem and get more feedback. Did I over-correct? Did I under-correct. And if you disagree, you got to say that you disagree, but you got to say, so respectfully.\n\nLenny (00:50:48):\nAs a leader, this sounds like a lot of work to be doing every week. If you have a one-on-one following up correcting things. Is there anything you'd recommend there? Or is it just, this is really important, you got to make time.\n\nKim Scott (00:50:58):\nIt's not as much work as failing to do this as we saw from the Bob story. So I think that the important thing that I have found is that this is part of why it's so important to do it immediately. It's important for the other person, but it's also important for you. If you're doing this in a one-on-one, which you should be having anyway. So you're saving some time in a one-on-one. So it's not adding time necessarily to your day. And when you hear about problems, you should fix them. Yes, it takes time, but that is your job. And when you disagree with something, you can disagree in your next regularly scheduled one-on-one. So I'm not talking about adding meetings to your calendar, so it doesn't actually take more time. I have found that in fact, it saves tremendous amounts of time, but it does take emotional discipline.\n\n(00:51:52):\nAnd I think it also requires you, especially when it comes to giving it, which we talked about before, where the humble, helpful, those are impromptu two-minute conversations, giving the feedback that you should be having in between your meetings. In the um story, walk to my meeting with me, it didn't take any extra time for my boss to give me that feedback. She had to walk to her meeting anyway, and I had to go in the same direction. So it didn't even take extra time from me. But it is, I think one of the most common reasons why people don't do this in addition to fear of retaliation and just sort of existential dread, which are both factors, which hopefully we've helped alleviate, but is that you're scheduled back to back to back and you don't have those two minutes in between meetings.\n\n(00:52:42):\nAnd that's why I think it's important either to schedule slack time in your calendar, make your 30 minute meetings, 25 minute meetings, make your hour-long meetings, 50 minute meetings, maybe give yourself a few breaks in the day. But if it's not possible, and often it was not possible for me in my career to sort of schedule my time that way, I just decided that these moments of management were more important than being on time to my next meeting. And so I was just late sometimes. So I wish I had a better answer than either control your time, which is really annoying advice because it's impossible to follow or be willing to be late to your next meeting. But those were the things that I tried to do.\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nThat was super helpful. I think your point of just, if you're not making two minutes to do this thing now, it'll be a lot more time intensive later.\n\nKim Scott (00:53:40):\nOh yeah. It's stitch in time takes nine on all these two minute, and really it should be brushing and flossing. This is not like a root canal. These are like, this is relationship hygiene that you should be doing all the time.\n\nLenny (00:53:55):\nI was just reading Charlie Munger's book and there's a quote that he references of just the classic, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nKim Scott (00:54:03):\nYes, absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:54:04):\nSame idea. So we've talked about a leader getting feedback. What if you're the employee? Do you also recommend the same thing in the one-on-one, have an agenda item and ask this question? Or is there a different approach you'd recommend?\n\nKim Scott (00:54:16):\nI think yes, if you're the employee, you should also be soliciting feedback on a regular basis from your boss. So there's sort of an order of operations you want to solicit at first, no matter who you are, it's the same up, down, and sideways, even though it feels very different, the order of operations is the same. So start by soliciting feedback. Then you want to give both praise and criticism. I think sometimes it feels like you're kissing up if you give your boss praise, but bosses need praise too. And if there are things that your boss does that you appreciate and you want your boss to do more of those things, praise is a better tool for that than criticism. When it comes time to offering your boss some critical feedback, you want to make sure, and by the way, this is also true when it comes time to give your employee critical feedback or your spouse or anybody else in your life, you want to be sure that you are prepared to gauge how it lands.\n\n(00:55:09):\nSo you want to start in kind of a neutral place. You don't want to go to the outer edge of challenge directly because then you're going to wind up in obnoxious aggression. So if we go back to that story, my boss started, \"You said um a lot, were you aware of it?\" \"Nah.\" That was my response. And then \"I know this great speech coach, would you like an introduction?\" \"Nah,\" was my response. So she had to keep going out on that challenge directly. She didn't start out by saying, \"When you say um I'm every third word, it makes you sound stupid.\" But she realized she had to go that far. So you want to keep going out if you think they're brushing you off. But if you find that your boss looks either sad or mad, that is your cue to move up on the care personally dimension.\n\n(00:55:51):\nAnd so to take a moment, and if you find your employee looks sad or mad, if they look sad, pause and say, \"I feel like maybe I didn't say that in the best possible way. How could I have said it differently?\" And so that means you're going up on the care personally, dimension, but you're not going the wrong way on challenge directly. I don't know about you Lenny, but if I say something to someone and they look sad, it's so tempting for me to try to pull the words back. \"Oh no, it's no big deal. I didn't mean it,\" but it is a big deal, and I did mean it, that's why I just said it. And so if you go the wrong way on challenge directly, you wind up in ruinous empathy, and then you leave the person both sad and confused, so you make it worse.\n\n(00:56:34):\nSo you want to take a beat to pay attention to the emotions in the moment, but not to go the wrong way on challenge directly. Same thing if they're mad, although if somebody's mad, that maybe is even harder. If somebody starts yelling at me, it's tempting for me either to start yelling back and wind up in obnoxious aggression or to crawl off to a self-protective, manipulative insincerity. And so instead, what I try to do is get curious, not furious, and why is this person so mad? So say like, Look, maybe I didn't say that in the right way, but this is an important issue and we need to resolve it.\n\nLenny (00:57:14):\nThis comes back to the point you made about when you're giving feedback to try to do it in person or on a phone call to do exactly what you're saying, to read them as you're giving this feedback and figure out which axis you want to go down.\n\nKim Scott (00:57:25):\nYeah, you want to gauge it. I mean, when we communicate with other people, we communicate on an emotional level and on an intellectual level at the same time. And if we ignore the emotional signals that are coming at us or say don't take it personally, then we're just not going to communicate very well.\n\nLenny (00:57:43):\nAlong these same lines, another question that came in is from a coach of yours that works I think for you or somehow with the program. She asked this question of many top leaders have very low self-awareness. They believe obnoxious aggression is the only way to give feedback, or they just ignore the problem and fire people with no feedback. Is there something you've learned about how to change their mind about this is the way to operate?\n\nKim Scott (00:58:05):\nYeah, I think the most important thing with leaders like that, that you can do is to explain to them the impact that they're having and to also show them that there is another way that is going to help them succeed. Very often the leaders who are low on the care personally dimension, they do care about their results and they do care about their own careers. And so when you sort of explain this to them in terms of enlightened self-interest, they tend to get better at it. And also, I mean there I can think of maybe one or two people I've worked with who are truly low on care, who truly don't care. Very often people are bad at showing they care, but they do actually care. And also sometimes there are leaders who think they're not supposed to care. And so unleashing that capacity that they innately have to care and telling them this is actually part of the job can make them a much better, more effective leader. But look, if someone is a psychopath and they truly don't care, they shouldn't be a manager. That's the solution.\n\nLenny (00:59:27):\nI totally get that one. So I really like that takeaway. Just basically show them the impact they're having because to your point, they want the company to succeed. They want their team to succeed. And if they're not realizing there's downsides to the way they're operating.\n\nKim Scott (00:59:38):\nAnd they want themselves to succeed. That's why I say part of the problem with obnoxious aggression is that you harm other people, but it's also inefficient because when you act like that, people can't hear what you're saying, so you're wasting your breath.\n\nLenny (00:59:56):\nAnd the way you show them that impact. Do you recommend interviewing people, getting stories, seeing, I don't know, how do you collect this impact so that they're like, oh, wow, I didn't realize this.\n\nKim Scott (01:00:07):\nI think that the best thing to do is, for me anyway, is I start by sharing stories from my career and stories when I was a jerk. I've acted like a jerk too, plenty of times, unfortunately. And I show the impact that I've had and then I ask them for a similar story. And usually sort of me holding up the mirror to myself is useful for them to be able to hold the mirror up to themselves to realize you want to help these people adopt a growth mindset around this stuff. I am not telling you that you're an asshole. I'm telling you that we all behave like assholes sometimes. And it's a big problem for us as well as for the people around us. And here's my story, when I acted like a jerk, what's yours? And people, that kind of self-awareness, sometimes people talk about inflicted insight like it's some kind of burden, but usually that kind of self-awareness makes people feel lighter. They're like, \"Ah, now I know what's wrong and now I know what I can do about it.\"\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\nYeah, I've definitely noticed that about your stories. They always are you making the mistake, which I think is very disarming.\n\nKim Scott (01:01:20):\nWe all make mistakes.\n\nLenny (01:01:22):\nYeah. Maybe the extreme of this obnoxious aggressiveness is Bridgewater. Their whole approach is like theirs.\n\nKim Scott (01:01:31):\nOh my gosh. Did you read the book The Fund?\n\nLenny (01:01:34):\nNo, not yet.\n\nKim Scott (01:01:35):\nYou must read it. It's all about Bridgewater. I always thought it was problematic. I had no idea just how problematic it is. Put that book in the show notes one of the best business books I've read in the last decade.\n\nLenny (01:01:48):\nWow, that is high praise. Yes, I will read that. And so I guess for people that aren't familiar, like Bridgewater, they encourage, they have a system called Dots where they tell people, you must give hard critical feedback after every meeting, publicly.\n\nKim Scott (01:02:01):\nNot after the meeting, in the meeting, publicly. And it's recorded on, it was, I think they changed it since, but it was recorded for posterity on video. And sometimes, in fact, true story, shortly after I left Google, I was approached to work at Bridgewater in a management capacity, not in an investment capacity. And so I called someone I knew who worked there and he said, \"Let me give you an anecdote.\" He said, \"The other day there was a meeting and there was a woman who in the meeting who had made a mistake and everybody just piled on. The criticism was very personal. There was no core about the criticism. It was like, these are your personality attributes that make you a useless human being. Kind of terrible feedback until she started to cry and the whole meeting was recorded and then they emailed a recording of the meeting out to the whole company, including all the people who were not in the meeting saying, this is an example of how to have...\" So I would say that is deep, dark, obnoxious aggression. That is not radical candor. That is horrible.\n\nLenny (01:03:24):\nSo it's safe to say you're not a fan of that approach?\n\nKim Scott (01:03:26):\nNo. In fact, I did an analysis of Dalio's book Principles and it's like a, I don't know, 3 or 400 page book. And there were I think four or five pages about caring about people. There's very low care personally.\n\nLenny (01:03:44):\nI imagine many people see that, they see Elon, they see Steve Jobs, and the perception is they're very challenge directly people, they're not clearly care about you people, but they're very successful. What do you say to people that are like, but it works. Why wouldn't I be that if that's the way I want to do it?\n\nKim Scott (01:04:00):\nWell, first of all, I would not put Steve Jobs in the same category as Ray Dalio and Elon Musk. I mean, Steve Jobs could be obnoxiously aggressive, but mostly I would say he built such good relationships with his direct reports that when he got cancer, Tim Cook offered to give him half his liver. And I don't know of a word to describe that other than love. These were real human relationships. When I worked at Apple, you could see Steve and Johnny talking. You could tell these people cared about each other. Now, radical candor gets measured not at the speaker's mouth, but at the listener's ear. And I think that Steve had built a team around him of people who didn't mind rather what other people would consider obnoxious aggression. But I think in the context of their relationship, it was understood as care.\n\n(01:05:03):\nI'll give you an example of that from my own career, not that I am comparing myself to Steve Jobs, I think I'm a much gentler person, but sometimes I develop relationships with people. And part of that relationship is that we push each other pretty hard. So there was a person who I had worked with for a long time, for many years. He had followed me from one company to another, and we were localizing a product and he kept conflating Slovakia and Slovenia, and I corrected him once. I corrected him twice the third time, I was like, did Slovakia, not Slovenia dumb ass.\n\n(01:05:44):\nAnd he started laughing, and that was fine in the context of our relationship, but I realized that the people around me, I was silencing them. They were like, \"Oh my gosh, I don't want to make a mistake. Kim's going to call me a dumb ass.\" So I had to pause and say, \"Look, I respect this person enormously, and I like this person enormously. We work very well together.\" And so I think that sometimes people have relationships with others and they have those relationships in public and other people misinterpret those relationships.\n\n(01:06:19):\nSteve Jobs was not perfect. He made all kinds of mistakes, but he was no Ray Dalio or Elon Musk, who I would say make far more and worse and more egregious mistakes. And I think you're raising a really important point. You're raising a point, which is that there's this false dichotomy. In fact, the new biography of Elon Musk falls into this category. I like Walter Isaacson's work a lot, but he falls prey to this in his biography of Elon Musk, which is there's this notion that we have to choose between being a total jerk but really competent or really nice but incompetent. And those are not our two choices. That's the whole point of radical candor is that there's this other way that works better and doesn't hurt people.\n\nLenny (01:07:13):\nI think that's the key takeaway there is you can be even more successful if you lean into the care deeply. In theory, they could have gotten more out of their people if they made it clear they really care about them.\n\nKim Scott (01:07:26):\nAnd there's plenty of counter examples of incredibly successful people who are very caring leaders, and it's not as much fun to tell stories about that. And so we don't as often.\n\nLenny (01:07:40):\nAlong the same lines, there's someone that you worked with that suggested I ask you about investing in your authentic leadership style, Melissa Tan. I don't know if you remember her.\n\nKim Scott (01:07:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:07:51):\nOkay, great. And she was on the podcast in the past, and she just said how when she met you, she was a very people-pleasery person and just wanted to be like, and you helped her develop her natural leadership style. Can you just talk about what you suggest to people to figure this out and how to find that for yourself?\n\nKim Scott (01:08:06):\nI mean, I wonder what Melissa would say, but my memory of conversations with her, and this is an issue that I talk about a lot because a people pleaser too. I grew up in the South and I'm a woman. I was not brought up to challenge directly. That was not part of the culture that I was brought up in. I was brought up to be polite but also brought up to be kind. And for me, the thing that is most important to hang on to is that fundamental kindness and to realize that it's actually unkind not to say the thing. And so that is part of the reason why I encourage people. I tell the Bob story so often and I encourage other leaders who I work with to think about what their Bob story is that you realize it's not nice in the long run.\n\n(01:09:00):\nIt's unkind in the long run, not to tell someone if they're making a mistake. There's nothing nice about that in the long run. And so that I think at least for me, that's been helpful. And then another thing that is helpful is again, to get others focused, to focus not on pleasing people, but on doing the right thing for those people, on truly caring about those people more than you care about your own discomfort in the moment. And that is something that is easier for people to do than just to challenge directly. I think in many ways it's about what is getting in the way. That's why I call it ruinism. Empathy is a good thing, but sometimes empathy can paralyze at least me because I'm so acutely aware of how what I'm going to say might impact the other person, might hurt their feelings that I don't say it.\n\n(01:10:01):\nAnd so when I push myself to be, and you can call it compassionate candor if you like that better than radical candor. But when I push myself not to feel so acutely what I think the other person might feel, and by the way, I could be wrong about what I think the other person might often, they're like, it's no big deal. They're like, oh, thank you for letting me know. But when I can let go of that and think about the other person and what I care about and what they care about for their future, going back to your point, if you know that it's really important for someone to get promoted and they won't get promoted if they keep talking to people in a particular way, then you're focused on what they want. That is really helpful to move past that.\n\nLenny (01:10:47):\nJust a few more questions before we wrap up. Your book sold something like half a million copies.\n\nKim Scott (01:10:47):\nA million now.\n\nLenny (01:11:00):\nA million copies.\n\nKim Scott (01:11:00):\nMillion copies. Million in 23 languages. Yes.\n\nLenny (01:11:00):\n23 languages. I had a stat of 20 languages. Jesus Christ. So a lot of people have read it, a lot of people have been using it. What's something that people often just get wrong that super frustrates you about the system, the recommendations that you just wish people come on, here's what I really wanted to say, or here's what you should change.\n\nKim Scott (01:11:17):\nThere's two things. I mean, as I mentioned earlier, when you write about a book about feedback, you're going to get a lot of it. One is this, in the spirit of Radical Candor and then the person acts like a jerk. That is not the spirit of Radical Candor. That is the spirit of obnoxious aggression. But shortly after the book came out, I was giving a talk at a tech company in San Francisco and I got some feedback from the CEO of that company that was so impactful that it caused me to write my next book, which is called Radical Respect. And in many ways, Radical Respect is kind of the prequel to Radical Candor because if you don't respect the other person, it's impossible to care about them and you're not going to bother challenging them directly. So what happened in this meeting? I walked in, I was really excited to give this talk.\n\n(01:12:04):\nThe CEO had been a colleague of mine for the better part of a decade. She's a person I like and respect enormously, and she's one of too few black women CEOs in tech or in any other sector. And when I finished giving the talk, she pulled me aside and she said, \"Kim, I'm excited to roll out Radical Candor. I think it's really going to help me build the kind of career I want.\" But she said, \"I got to tell you, it's much harder for me to roll it out than it is for you.\" And she went on to explain to me that as soon as she would offer folks even the most gentle, compassionate criticism, they would call her an angry black woman. And I knew this was true as soon as she said it, and I knew how unfair it was because she's like one of the most even keeled, cheerful people I've ever worked with.\n\n(01:12:49):\nAnd I realized a bunch of things at the same time when she told me that, the first was that I had not been the kind of colleague that I aspire to be, that I imagined myself to be. I had failed even to notice the extent to which she had to show up unfailingly, cheerful and pleasant in every meeting we had ever been in together even though she had what to be ticked off about as we all do at work. So I had failed to be an upstander, a good colleague. The second thing I realized was that I had also failed to acknowledge when I was experiencing different versions of bias, prejudice and bullying. And I think part of the reason it's kind of hard for the author of a book called Radical Candor to admit she was in denial. But I had been in denial about a bunch of experiences I had had in the workplace.\n\n(01:13:41):\nI had pretended that a whole host of things were not happening, that were in fact happening. And I think part of the reason why I did that was that I never wanted to think of myself as a victim, but even less than wanting to think of myself as a victim did I want to think of myself as the culprit. So I'd been even more deeply in denial about the times that I had said or done things that hurt other people who I worked with, said or done things that were biased or worse. I had bullied people before. And by the way, when you become a leader, you're much more prone to bullying even if you don't think of yourself as a bully, which I certainly don't think of myself as a bully, but that doesn't mean I never bullied anyone. And then the last thing I realized was that as a leader, I imagined that I was creating these BS free zones, but I had allowed all manner of BS to pass. So that was what prompted me to write the next book, Radical Respect, which you can pre-order right now and please do.\n\nLenny (01:14:41):\nThat was my next question. Talk more about this book. What is it about? Where people find it?\n\nKim Scott (01:14:46):\nRadical Respect comes out in May. You can pre-order it now. Anywhere you buy books, at your local independent bookstore, I'm speaking at a conference of independent bookstore owners soon you can pre-order it on Amazon or Barnes Noble or anywhere else you buy buy books.\n\nLenny (01:15:05):\nAnd who would you say it's most for?\n\nKim Scott (01:15:08):\nSo there are chapters in that book about things leaders can do. There are chapters in the book about things you can do if you're harmed by bias, prejudice, or bullying. There are chapters in the book about how to be a great upstander, how to be a better colleague, and there are chapters in the book about how to become part of the solution, not part of the problem when you're the culprit. And I think we all find ourselves in all four of those roles at different moments in time, and I don't think there's any one group who can solve this problem. Everyone is responsible for creating a more respectful work environment.\n\nLenny (01:15:48):\nAwesome. We'll link to that in the show notes.\n\nKim Scott (01:15:50):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny (01:15:51):\nTo leave people with a very tactical next step. What's one thing they could do this week today to get better at Radical Candor, to start building that muscle?\n\nKim Scott (01:16:00):\nI would love it if everyone would write down their go-to question what are the words that will come out of your mouth and practice it. Practice it in front of the mirror and then practice it with a friend and refine it. Just figure out what, because it is uncomfortable to solicit feedback from others. They don't want to give it to you and you don't really want to hear it. So if everybody can write down their go-to question and then put five minutes in your calendar of someone you're going to ask that question of.\n\nLenny (01:16:31):\nAnd that calendar entry, I was going to come back to it actually. So you do the one-on-one agenda, adding the question, the calendar entry is for people you don't have a one-on-one with, pick someone that you're going to ask that you're not meeting with regularly.\n\nKim Scott (01:16:42):\nAbsolutely. Or add it to the bottom of your next one-on-one agenda. That's fair too. Either one.\n\nLenny (01:16:44):\nAmazing. Kim, is there anything else you want to leave folks with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKim Scott (01:16:52):\nI think just remember, you do not have to choose between being successful and being a jerk. You can be a successful kind person.\n\nLenny (01:17:00):\nOh, I love that. Amazing. Okay, well with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKim Scott (01:17:07):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:17:08):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people? You've already mentioned a few but what do you want to share?\n\nKim Scott (01:17:14):\nYes, I've mentioned a couple. Please do buy Radical Respect, I believe that the more novels people read, the better. People often ask me, what can I do to move up on the care personally dimension of Radical Candor and read more novels? This is the best way I know of to build compassion for other people, to understand the emotional signals that might be coming at you. I mean, some of my favorite novels are Middlemarch. I try to reread that all the time. Anything that Toni Morrison wrote, the Bluest Eye is one of my favorite, but also Song of Solomon. It just such a brilliant writer and will help you enter into the lives of people that you haven't entered into. I think that Orlando by Virginia Woolf is another one of my favorites. And Robertson Davies, the Deptford Trilogy is an incredible set of novels to read. I'm cheating now and giving you three.\n\nLenny (01:18:27):\nThe more the merrier.\n\nKim Scott (01:18:27):\nYes, Alice Walker, the Color Purple is another one of my very favorite books, so I recommend reading more novels.\n\nLenny (01:18:34):\nI love this leaning into fiction that doesn't come up often on this podcast, so this is great. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nKim Scott (01:18:47):\nI watched all 19 seasons of Grey's Anatomy with my daughter during and after COVID. That was really fun.\n\nLenny (01:18:55):\nActually. I did the same thing with my wife. We didn't do all the seasons, but we watched a lot of Grey's Anatomy.\n\nKim Scott (01:18:59):\nWe watched every single one. It's still coming out.\n\nLenny (01:19:04):\nYeah, it's funny to see which characters continue and which I die off, leave.\n\nKim Scott (01:19:07):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (01:19:09):\nOh man. Okay. Funny\n\nKim Scott (01:19:10):\nAnd Shonda Rhimes, I mean, watch her TED Talk, amazing person.\n\nLenny (01:19:14):\nAll right, we'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people that might be helpful to folks interviewing?\n\nKim Scott (01:19:22):\nThe question that I like to ask is just tell me the story of your career. And I know that's kind of, maybe it's a hard, it seems like a softball, but it's actually can be unfairly hard or not. I don't know, unfairly hard, but I always learn a lot about people from how they tell the story of their life and their career. And then what I try to do is they'll say a couple of things that really interest me and I sort of double-click down into the details of a couple of aspects. I love people's life stories, so that makes it a more fun conversation for me. Often people like talking about themselves so it's not too painful for them, but you also learn all kinds of unexpected things.\n\nLenny (01:20:13):\nAnd is there anything you're looking for in an answer that's like, this is a good person to hire or is it mostly information? I'm just gathering a lot of background.\n\nKim Scott (01:20:22):\nI find that I learn how the person approaches setbacks from a story, from the way they tell a story. I learn whether a person is able to identify mistakes they made. I mean, if you say, \"Tell me the story of your career,\" if there's not a couple of mistakes in there, I also find that when they talk about accomplishments and then I double click on it, I learn a lot about what a person really did. Sometimes a person will claim credit for something that just happened that they had very little to actually to do with, and I learn about very often. I find that a good way to learn about people's skills and depth of knowledge.\n\nLenny (01:21:10):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nKim Scott (01:21:14):\nYes. I love my new it's called Attitude, and they're shampoo bars and conditioner bars, so it comes in cardboard, wrapped in paper. There's no plastic. It's much more environmentally friendly, and I have long hair. It gets very tingly and the conditioner works, so I recommend.\n\nLenny (01:21:35):\nVery unique suggestion. Is there a favorite motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with people, find useful to come back to in work or in life?\n\nKim Scott (01:21:46):\n\"It's not mean. It's clear.\" This is something someone told me on the streets of Manhattan. It's actually the origin story of Radical Candor. I was walking my dog, almost got hit by a cab, and this man, a perfect stranger, looked at me and he said, \"I can tell you love that dog.\" That was all he had to do to move up on the care personally dimension, but he says, \"You're going to kill that dog if you don't teach her to sit.\" And he pointed at the ground this kind of harsh gesture. He said, \"Sit.\" The dog sat, had no idea she even knew what that meant. And I kind of looked up at him in amazement and he said, \"It's not mean. It's clear.\" And then the light changed and he walked off leaving me with words to live by. So I think about that stranger all the time.\n\nLenny (01:22:30):\nSuch a good story. Final question. I read online that you started a diamond cutting factory in Moscow at some point in your life. Can you please explain this part of your life?\n\nKim Scott (01:22:41):\nYes. So I studied Russian literature in college, very practical major. And then I moved to what was then the Soviet Union in 1990 when I graduated from college, and I wound up taking a job with, first of all, I was with an investment company and then they pulled out of Russia and put the money in China. And so I wanted to stay in Russia and through a friend of a friend, I got a job working for this diamond company called Lazare Kaplan, new York-based diamond company, and they were trying to figure out what they should do in Russia. And I found out there was an opportunity to start this diamond cutting factory. And it was actually my first management job because I had to hire these diamond cutters and I had to hire them away from these Russian diamond cutting factories and I knew nothing about management or business or anything.\n\n(01:23:44):\nI'd studied Russian literature. I knew a lot about Dostoyevsky, so I thought it was going to be easy though. I was like, well, the ruble is collapsing. I'm going to pay them in dollars. Of course they'll come work for me. But they didn't take the job right away. To my surprise, they wanted to have a picnic. And at the picnic we brought a bottle of vodka, and there's a rule in Russia, if you open a bottle, you got to finish the bottle.\n\n(01:24:07):\nSo by the end of the bottle of vodka, I realized that what I could offer that the state could not offer them was to give a damn about them. They wanted to know that I would be a manager who would get them out of Russia if things went sideways there. And as you can imagine, I've been thinking a lot about, they were all men, about these men because I haven't been able to get them out. And I'm devastated by what Russia has done to Ukraine, but that was the moment when I realized that management really matters, and that to be good at it, you have to care about other people. And that was what made it interesting to me.\n\nLenny (01:24:53):\nMan, that is a heavy first job as a manager.\n\nKim Scott (01:24:56):\nYeah. Yes, it was.\n\nLenny (01:24:58):\nWow, Kim, this was awesome. I think we're going to help a lot of people become better leaders. I think we're going to help a lot of companies change their culture. I'm so honored that you agreed to do this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up and learn more about your stuff? And then two, how can listeners be helpful to you?\n\nKim Scott (01:25:18):\nRadicalcandor.com is our website, and I'm not much on Twitter slash X anymore, but you can find us. We do a lot of posting on LinkedIn. I think that the thing that people can help me do is to send us a note. You can also email us radicalcandor@radicalcandor.com and let us know what could we do in podcasts like this or in our materials? What could we do that would make it easier for you to put these ideas into practice? Because Radical Candor is, it's about behavior change, and it sounds easy, but it's really hard, and we're always trying to figure out how to help people walk the talk here.\n\nLenny (01:26:02):\nI think doing this podcast is going to make a dent in that goal.\n\nKim Scott (01:26:05):\nOh, good.\n\nLenny (01:26:06):\nKim, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKim Scott (01:26:08):\nThank you. I really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny (01:26:11):\nSame. Bye everyone.\n\nKim Scott (01:26:12):\nTake care everyone.\n\nLenny (01:26:15):\nThank you so much for listening.

We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons.\" I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, \"Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms.\" But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.\n\nLenny (00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today, my guest is Kristen Berman. Kristen is the CEO and co-founder of Irrational Labs where she and her team use behavioral science to help companies like Google, Airbnb, PayPal, Microsoft, Fidelity, and TikTok build better and more successful products.\n\nLenny (01:15):\nIn our conversation, we cover a ton of real-life examples of product changes that have her and her team helped craft that led to significant impact at the companies. We talk about what biases and psychologies they find most commonly get in the way of people achieving what they want achieve in your product, her biggest surprises and insights about human psychology and how it relates to product design, a couple of real-life case studies including our work with TikTok and the change they made in the product as a result, and so much more. I found this conversation super fascinating and super tactical, and I can't wait for you to hear it. And so with that, I bring you Kristen Berman.\n\nLenny (01:55):\nHey, Ashley, head of marketing in Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (02:02):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (02:04):\nAnd how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (02:07):\nWell, based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So, if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (02:26):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (02:41):\nTotally. It's credible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:50] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (02:58):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (03:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by Whimsical.

You're on something called Irrational Labs, and so, to set a little context for folks, can you just talk about what it is you all do at Irrational Labs?\n\nKristen Berman (04:08):\nYeah, so Irrational Labs, we are a behavioral science consulting and design shop. So, we think about all things behavior change. We work on understanding psychologies that drive users, and then designing and testing ways to change behavior and drive engagement.\n\nKristen Berman (04:28):\nI started it in 2013 with Dan Ariely, who's a famed behavioral economist. We started just working with a handful of companies, and now we have a team of 20 behavioral scientists working on behavior change across industries.\n\nLenny (04:43):\nCan you talk about some of the companies that you've worked with, just to give us some examples? And then, what kind of stuff have you actually helped them with?\n\nKristen Berman (04:50):\nWe started a lot of our work at Google. We were actually embedded within Google for around three years. I even had a bus pass. And we started their behavioral economics team. We worked with over 25 teams from like self-driving cars to YouTube. And so, that was a big piece of the early work. And then recently, we've done work with TikTok where we've tried to... It actually accomplished decreasing misinformation share by 24%. We worked with one medical on how to increase setting doctor's appointments right away during the onboarding, and that worked and drove it up by 20%. We worked with Credit Karma on basically helping them increase set up for reoccurring deposits. We did that and increased it by 18%. So, basically a variety of ways to drive behavior change. Done stuff with Intuit, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and obviously, a variety of startups as well.\n\nLenny (05:45):\nWow. Okay, we're definitely going to talk about some of those examples. I'm super curious to hear what you did with TikTok, big company and story these days. Before we get to that, what exactly is behavioral design, and can you just define this space for us?\n\nKristen Berman (06:00):\nLet's start with what is behavioral economics? So, basically, behavioral economics is a reaction to economics. So, economics says, \"Look, people are rational. We make decisions with no emotion. We use lots of computational energy, weigh the pros and cons.\" I mean, obviously, that's just not true. It ignores the whole field of psychology. And so, in behavioral economics, you combine the field of psychology and economics and say, \"Look, people make decisions with lots of emotion. We are present bias. We over-weighed our present selves. We follow social norms.\" But the good news is that we do these things in predictable ways. And once you understand how and why people behave, you can start to change it. And so, behavioral science and behavioral design basically uses those insights on psychology to actually apply it within real world problems.\n\nLenny (06:51):\nWhat are some of the biggest surprises, or maybe unintuitive results that you've come across working with companies using these insights in behavioral design, behavioral economics?\n\nKristen Berman (07:02):\nYeah, great question. One story that recently happened is actually a surprise that happened to the client. The partner was shocked. It actually didn't surprise us. And so, this was with a popular FinTech app and their most requested feature was budgeting. So, it came through all the support forums, interviews, felt like a table stakes feature; people wanted budgeting. And so, if you're the PM there, you're probably like, \"You may talk to a few other users. You may get some confirmation, but you're likely building budgeting.\" And that's really where they were when we came and started working with them. We couldn't move them in another direction, but we did convince them to do an experiment. So, we convinced them to test, and there was three conditions. One was the control, which is just telling people how much they spend, and the other two were variations on budgeting. So, two different ways to do budgeting.\n\nKristen Berman (07:57):\nSo, big experiment. This is with 10,000 people, so we can really trust the results. And what happened? Nothing. So, they were shocked. The team was shocked. Remember, this is a big investment of time and effort, took a lot of energy to build. Zero change in average spend, zero change in spend variability. And so, the question is: Why weren't we surprised? Why were they surprised? The thinking here is if you map out every single step that it takes to do this behavior, and the behavior would be reducing your spend, it's pretty clear that budgeting just isn't going to pull the weight. And this is what we call a behavioral diagnosis, where you map out every single step. So, you'd have to know what your budget is. You'd have to know where in the month you are. You'd have to make a plan to do it. You then have to do it multiple times during the month. Incredibly difficult to do this one behavior. And once you do that behavioral diagnosis and you map out... We try to understand what people actually do versus what they say they will do. And by doing that, it becomes wildly clear that we should all be skeptical that budgeting would actually work to change the behavior that you're trying to get to.\n\nLenny (09:03):\nYeah, I'm also not surprised that didn't have a big impact. I have so many apps with budgeting features and I've tried many times to use them and it never sticks. It's like, \"Eh, I'm just going to...\" It's too much work.\n\nKristen Berman (09:15):\nIt's way too much work. And so, sometimes, any kind of work that we put on the user, we should be skeptical. We have to really prove that it's worth their time, and then measure if they actually do it.\n\nLenny (09:26):\nIs there a better approach to that specific problem that you've found, or is that too broad of a question?\n\nKristen Berman (09:33):\nThe first line of defense in any problem solving would be, how would you make it easier for somebody to do? And so, in the personal finance world, really, the answer to most things is just default. So, it worked for automatic enrollment 401(k). The reason we have retirement savings in America is because people are defaulted into saving from their paycheck. So, that would be first line of defense. Obviously, difficult for product teams to execute on, takes a lot of backend infrastructure. So, if we were just solving the personal financial management stuff of like a budgeting alternative, we'd actually go to making it not just logistically easier, but cognitively easier. So, we call them rules of thumb; instead of having to decide in the moment, do I do this thing? And you're weighing the pros and cons. It's kind of typical econ, like, how much is this $3 worth to me? You'd actually make a rule of thumb that says, \"Do I do it, or not?\" So, instead of deciding, do you take a Lyft when you're coming home from work, you'd have a rule of thumb that says, \"I don't take Lyft on the weekdays. I take it on the weekends.\" Very simple now to actually make this kind of decision. It's a heuristic . It's not going to be perfect, but it's going to help you reduce your spend in an easier way, at least, in a way that you'd stayed adherent to.\n\nLenny (10:46):\nIt reminds me a bit of James Clears' idea of creating this identity for yourself where he is like, \"If you're like, 'I am a person that doesn't take Lyft on the weekdays', that becomes kind of this identity component and that makes it easier for you not to do that.\" Is that related?\n\nKristen Berman (11:00):\nYeah, basically. Sometimes, we think behavior change is driven by our attitudes, our preferences like, \"I really want to be a runner\" or \"I really like this thing.\" But in reality, our behavior is driven by what we do. So, in order to change behavior, you have to do something different. It's not enough to have a goal objective to do it. And I think, maybe that's the big annoying thing about the self-help industry. It kind of just tells you it's enough to have a goal. It's not enough. You actually need to redesign your environment to change your behavior.\n\nLenny (11:35):\nIs there any other examples of big surprises or unintuitive results from work you've done?\n\nKristen Berman (11:40):\nOne big one is actually... And I'm sure people listening have worked on signup flows before. This is kind of a common question and challenge in product world. And the common thinking is, and most often correct, that if you reduce friction to the signup flow, your conversion will increase. This is kind of the law that we all live by. And yet, there is one example, one time, where this is just not true, that you can actually increase friction and increase conversion. So, actually Lenny, have I ever told you about my mother?\n\nLenny (12:12):\nNope.\n\nKristen Berman (12:13):\nOkay. So, now you're thinking about my mother.\n\nLenny (12:16):\nOh.\n\nKristen Berman (12:16):\nBefore, you were not thinking about... There's nothing about my mother, but I just made you think about my mother by asking you a question.\n\nLenny (12:22):\nSon of a gun.\n\nKristen Berman (12:23):\nSo, when you ask a question, you can insert an idea into someone's head, you can get them thinking about something different. And so, in a sign up flow, what would you want people to be thinking about? You probably want them to be thinking about the benefits that you offer. So, if you ask them a question they can think about the benefits, it's going to increase their motivation to get over the hump of the future friction you're going to put in front of them because now they understand the benefits. So, as an example, if you go to Apartment List, they ask you questions during the signup flow that's like: What kind of apartment do you want? Do you want a studio, or a one-bedroom, a five bedroom? Do you want a patio, a basement, a view? Now, all of a sudden, I'm thinking, I'm engaging with the benefit. I understand how much supply that they have. So, if you Stitch Fix, or... Actually, Trunk Club has come out and said they did this and it increased conversion by 133%.\n\nKristen Berman (13:16):\nSo, asking these questions can really drive conversion. We actually did something where we put a quiz on a partner's website. It's TytoCare which is basically a device that lets you remotely connect to a physician. It's a little bit hard to use, but we wanted to help people understand the device, and we asked them questions about their medical behavior, their frequency use of technology. And for people who completed a quiz, 53% of them went on to purchase versus 37% who didn't complete. So, these type of questions can have a real impact.\n\nLenny (13:51):\nAnd so, very tactically, the idea here is you add a step to your flow that asks the user some question that isn't actually something you need an answer to, but may get them to be more excited by finishing. Is that right?\n\nKristen Berman (14:04):\nExactly, yeah. And I would say probably most teams can do this. You can replace the carousel. The carousel is something where it tells you the benefit, but we want people to actively engage with the benefit so that they're thinking about how you can improve and affect their lives.\n\nLenny (14:22):\nSo, you said it's worked a couple times. It probably isn't something that usually works. Is there experience like sometimes it may work, maybe worth trying, but usually probably won't work. Is that generally right?\n\nKristen Berman (14:32):\nWe want to remove the field that was like an open text fields where we're asking people an open-ended question and we improved conversion by 40% page over page. So, for sure, some questions are harder and you should not ask them. When questions are easier and it's a drop down multiple choice, this is when you should be trying it. But definitely, the recommendation is not to ask a hard question where people have to think about it.\n\nKristen Berman (14:58):\nBy the way, for the question that we did, that was open text, the folks on the team thought that it was an easy question. But most questions when you're asking people with an open text field, it's just not an easy question.\n\nLenny (15:10):\nRight. I hate those open text fields. And then, just one last, because I imagine people listening to this are like, \"Oh, maybe I should run this experiment.\" Is the general best practice to ask a question that gets you to think about something that motivates you by finishing? What's like the rough mental model there?\n\nKristen Berman (15:26):\nI think each product, obviously, will be different. One example would be, if I'm a bill pay app, you could tell me that I could pay my bill once a week, every day, every month, I could time it, but a better approach would be to ask me, \"Do you want us to pay your bills immediately, or every week, or every month?\" And so, what you're doing there is engaging people in the setup and actually implicitly telling them, \"We can pay your bills immediately.\" So, would think about combining those two is showing people the benefit, like, how fast you want us to pay your bills, which gets you to think about how fast they are, and the settings which is actually you're really doing something to help the app work.\n\nLenny (16:09):\nAwesome. Before we dive even deeper into more examples, I wanted to zoom out for a moment and I'm curious just how did you even get into behavioral economics? You said you worked with Dan Ariely. How did all this come about?\n\nKristen Berman (16:22):\nYeah, great question. So, I met Dan around 2008 and if you don't know Dan Ariely, definitely worth a Google. And at that time, he had just written his first book, Predictably Irrational, and I was a product manager at Intuit working on QuickBooks online. So, first use, customer discovery, and really after reading the book, hearing the talk, it's just like this light bulb went off and it was like... I'm talking to five to 10 customers to inform a feature, a product, and trying to come up with some insight on human behavior. And yet, there's this whole field that studied this, that has papers in thinking and studies why we behave the way we do. And so, this was like, \"Wow. I can't believe we're just missing out on it in the product community.\" And so, I started working with Dan. We started and now, 14 years later, it's what I do; bring behavioral insights to product teams.\n\nLenny (17:19):\nAnd you said you were running an embedded team within Google to work on this sort of thing?\n\nKristen Berman (17:23):\nYeah. So, basically, Google... It was kind of our first mover in thinking about how important understanding behavioral science was to product and marketing development. And so, it was Dan and I in the beginning, and over the course of the three years we hired internal Googlers, we brought in more people on our team, and really were an internal consultant where we'd be pitched to other teams, work with them from start to end on a project. And now, Google has one of the bigger behavioral science teams that's out there.\n\nLenny (17:50):\nWow. Okay. So, you've worked with how many companies at this point, roughly?\n\nKristen Berman (17:56):\nI'd say hundreds.\n\nLenny (17:58):\nHundreds, okay.\n\nKristen Berman (17:59):\nI mean... Yeah, hundreds.\n\nLenny (17:59):\nOkay. So, there's hundreds of companies. There's also, I imagine, hundreds of these kind of biases and heuristics and kind of behavioral expectations of people. I'm curious, out of the work that you've done, what are the most common biases, heuristics of people that you find most useful in improving product experiences in product design? What's kind of the handful that ends up being most useful?\n\nKristen Berman (18:21):\nTotally. And there are so many mistakes that humans make and we can call them biases, heuristics. Our team uses psychologies. What are the psychologies that drive us? And so, to tackle this, our team basically has created a model of behavior change. We call the three Bs. And this summarizes the most important psychologies that drive user that are important to the product manager and the marketers. We've used this at Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, so all the companies that we work with, and they now use it. And so, the three B framework, first B is actually not a psychology, but it is the most important part of behavior change, and it should be obvious if you think about behavior change, behavioral economics, it is behavior. In order to change behavior, you have to pick a behavior that you want to change. So, companies are really good at outcomes, but just not as sharp at picking the behavior.\n\nKristen Berman (19:13):\nWhen I say behavior, I mean action. The thing that you want someone to do. By the way, the only wrong answer here is log in. It's not about logging in, it's about what you do after you log in. And when we're consulting teams, it would be like... We need to get uncomfortably specific, we say. Just really specific in the behavior. So, example, if I'm Peloton PM and I'm working on the app, I would say something like, \"Within seven days of somebody starting the app, they do two 10-minute workouts with two different instructors.\" Now, obviously that is wildly specific and you'd probably be very happy if they did one workout with one instructor, but the reality is if you don't define that behavior you're going to change. You can't actually define the psychologies that affect someone's decision making when doing that behavior. So, that's the first B.\n\nKristen Berman (20:01):\nSecond B, again, is probably pretty obvious and is very critical. It's just barriers. So, we need to reduce the barriers to doing the behavior. And there are two types of barriers we look at. One is logistical. So, this is just the stuff in our way; could be entering a credit card, could be any form field. And then, the second is cognitive. So, the cognitive barriers get in our way as well. These are things like uncertainty aversion. This is optimism bias, information aversion. These are the things that would prevent... Status quo, big one. It's just you do the same thing today that you did yesterday. Your job is-\n\nLenny (20:37):\nPlease. Can you talk about those three? Just through out there, just briefly. I'm curious about the specific biases while we're there.\n\nKristen Berman (20:42):\nYeah. So, uncertainty aversion, when something is uncertain or we're not... I'll give you an example of your Lyft. There's logistical friction which is wait time. But then, there's also this uncertainty of is it going to come on time? When is it going to come? And with this uncertainty, you're probably going to look for other options. You're going to open up Uber and say like, \"Maybe it'll come faster.\" And so, when there is uncertainty in our life, we either look for other options, or we just don't make a decision at all. Right? This is, by the way, very big in healthcare where when you're very uncertain about something, you may not even go to the doctor, or you may just make the wrong decision.\n\nLenny (21:22):\nGot it.\n\nKristen Berman (21:23):\nAnd same with status quo effect where... Underlying status quo effect is this idea that we always take the path... Not always, but majority. You don't really say always when you're talking about human behavior. Human behavior is very complex. More often than not, we take the path of least resistant, that we do the thing that's easiest, and typically, the thing that's easiest is the thing that we've done yesterday and the day before. And so, when you're asking someone to do something different, which is what most product, especially startups, are trying to do, you actually have to increase their motivation or make it easier, reduce the barriers to get them to do that. And so, status quo effect is a big, big one that folks are fighting.\n\nLenny (22:02):\nAwesome. Thanks for sharing those. Let's keep going.\n\nKristen Berman (22:05):\nCool. So, the third B is benefits. This is where you want to increase the... Not just benefits, but the immediate benefits of doing something. We are all present bias, which means we prioritize our present self over our future self, so there are plenty of reasons that somebody, your customer, your user should take an action, but you actually have to give them a reason to take an action today.\n\nKristen Berman (22:30):\nSo, as an example, if you're Asana, and if you're trying to get someone to log a task, the right thing for them to do is log the task because it's going to get their project done on time. You're going to have a collaborative and communicative team that you're going to want to be on. But one of the real reasons we may log a task is because of completion bias. We want to see the checkbox. We may log it because of social desirability bias where other people see that we're getting our work done. There's a notification that goes to my teammate when I complete something. So, these are the immediate benefits that we have to build into products and features to drive use.\n\nLenny (23:07):\nAwesome. I definitely have completion bias. I love checking those freaking checkboxes. I know Asana is famous for that little unicorn confetti thing, right? For making you feel really good when you complete something.\n\nKristen Berman (23:17):\nYeah. I don't know how much emphasis to put on these kind of confetti stuff. I think the idea of being done is... That psychological understanding that you completed it, confetti or not, is very powerful.\n\nLenny (23:33):\nI love confetti. Okay, so just to recap, there's the three Bs. Behavior, what is the behavior you're trying to change? And the way you described it sounds like the activation milestone. That's the way most companies think about that. Is that right?\n\nKristen Berman (23:46):\nYeah. I would say the activation milestone and the novel thing here is just getting really specific about this behavior, so much that if you're not arguing with your teammates, you're doing it wrong.\n\nLenny (23:59):\nAbout which behavior and...\n\nKristen Berman (24:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (24:01):\n... I imagine this often comes... Similarly to the activation kind of moment, it comes back... Working backwards from what is most likely to keep this person around long-term, kind of to keep them retained, right?\n\nKristen Berman (24:12):\nYeah, exactly. So, what correlates with retention and what provides an immediate value to them by doing this behavior.\n\nLenny (24:18):\nAwesome. Okay. So, behavior, then barriers. How do you break down barriers, logistical and cognitive. And then, benefits. The point about being an immediate benefit is a really interesting one because, yeah, you may be like, \"In a year from now I might earn some money, but I'm not going to do anything hard right now if I'm not going to make any money right now.\"\n\nKristen Berman (24:36):\nExactly. And so, this is a tough one because we want to believe that people really do and use our products for the end benefit, but we really need to give people the reason to do it today.\n\nLenny (24:47):\nAwesome. I want to dive into a of couple case studies of companies that I know you've worked with. Maybe before that, I thought it'd be good to ask this question about the dark side of this stuff. I imagine people often worry about, \"Hey, are you just tricking people into doing things they don't want to do? That's not good.\" How do you think about that line?\n\nKristen Berman (25:06):\nYeah, it's a great question. I think, the answer to this really, with many things in life, comes down to incentives. So, what are the incentives of the product teams, of you, your manager, the team, working on this? I like to say we are what we measure, and it really matters what you measure. I'll give you a personal example.\n\nLenny (25:27):\nYeah.\n\nKristen Berman (25:28):\nLendingClub, a while ago, hired me to increase their conversion flow for borrowers. They're a lending app and they wanted to get more borrowers in the flow. The novel thing here was that they would pay me a lot of money if I hit a bump. It was like a five-point bump and zero if I didn't hit anything. [inaudible 00:25:47]\n\nLenny (25:47):\nThat was that. That's your incentive structure.\n\nKristen Berman (25:50):\nRight. So, my incentive structure was to increase the conversion flow, and over the course of working with them, I became a predatory lender. I was suggesting things that the legal team was like, \"No, Kristen, of course you cannot do that.\" Setting some contacts, I was at that time leading a Duke University lab called Common Sense Lab. It was focused on low to moderate income Americans thinking about their financial health, building savings apps for them. So, here I am, this kind of do good, non-profit, very focused on financial health of Americans, and my other hat was predatory lender for LendingClub. And so, it's really about the incentives that we're giving ourselves and our team that will drive how anything is used. Much less behavioral economics of these tactics, but generally, the success of your team.\n\nLenny (26:46):\nYou may not have a clear answer to this, but any advice for setting those incentives correctly? Anything you've seen work well?\n\nKristen Berman (26:52):\nYeah. I think for us there's two tips. One would be to set the incentive on the behavior because the behavior is going to align more with the customer outcomes than the active use or the retention. And of course... And I'm not suggesting we don't measure active use and retention in these things, you should definitely measure them, but setting the incentive, and the KPI, and the product, and the marketing team on the behavior is going to result in a more customer-friendly product and outcome.\n\nKristen Berman (27:18):\nAnd then, second would be increasing the duration of the incentive. So, if you're trying to hit a quarterly outcome, you're likely going to do things that will impact the short term to give that a bump. If you're trying to hit an annual or even longer outcome, you're going to be looking out for the best interest of the company and the consumers in a little bit different way.\n\nLenny (27:39):\nAwesome. For the LendingClub example, what did you end up doing in the end, by the way? Did she just like, \"Nah, let's not do this.\"\n\nKristen Berman (27:44):\nI can't actually reveal the intervention that we did, but I did miss it. So, there was a five... Wait, by the way, point, not percentage bump, which is a lot, and we got 4.5. So, we almost hit it, but it's a clip, it doesn't work that way.\n\nLenny (27:59):\nAlmost sold your soul for that bump, and you didn't get there.\n\nKristen Berman (28:02):\nI know.\n\nLenny (28:02):\nIt seems like [inaudible 00:28:03]\n\nKristen Berman (28:02):\nIt was a good lesson in incentive [inaudible 00:28:05]. And by the way, at that point, LendingClub was offering good rates to borrowers. There was efficacy in the idea of it, which is LendingClub lending to people who have lower FIGO and with better rate. And yet, you still want to have... You don't want to become the predatory lender in that situation.\n\nLenny (28:23):\nOkay, awesome.\n\nLenny (28:25):\nAre you hiring, or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity?

One is TikTok, and then the other's One Medical. It'd be cool to just hear what you did for them, what they wanted your help with, and then just kind of what you took away, how it went, all that.\n\nKristen Berman (29:32):\nGreat, yeah. So, TikTok is obviously a big platform, and with any big social media platform, they have misinformation on it. This is not just a problem with TikTok. Facebook and Twitter have it, and misinformation is growing. And so, they asked us to help decrease the spread of misinformation on their platform.\n\nKristen Berman (29:51):\nThere's lots of ways that we could take that, and the first thing that we did, as we kind of do with any company, is think about what is the behavior that you want to change. And so, we narrowed on decreasing shares. So, we could have said likes. We could have said comments, or general engagement which is a broad thing, but we narrowed on decreasing the shares. So, when you're actually going to see a misinformation video, we want to decrease the number of people that share it.\n\nKristen Berman (30:18):\nSo, that was the first step. The second step is, this three B model, how do we think about the barriers? With TikTok, the thing that you want to do is get people to do something less. When you want to get somebody to do something more, you make it easier. When you want someone to do something less, you make it...\n\nLenny (30:36):\nPut up barriers.\n\nKristen Berman (30:38):\nPut up barriers, yeah. Actually, a nice example of it's an elevator study where basically, you want people to use the stairs. And so, what the researchers did was make the elevator door close 16 seconds longer. So now, you get in the elevator, you're annoyed. It's harder to use the elevator, and people went to the stairs.\n\nLenny (30:55):\n16 seconds, interesting number.\n\nKristen Berman (30:57):\n16 sec... We can't wait 16. And then, it's actually kind of long, though. You're standing there [inaudible 00:31:02].\n\nLenny (31:01):\nSo long. I'd use the stairs, yeah.\n\nKristen Berman (31:03):\nYeah. And so, that's kind of what we did for TikTok, which is, basically, you're in a very hot state. TikTok is a very fast platform, and so we just slowed people down. Two things. There was a label on the video, which is kind of classic in the misinformation world where you tell users that it's unverified information. And the second thing was, once you click the share button, we popped up something that said, \"Are you sure?\" And this was basically slowing people down. So, logistical friction, and actually cognitive friction because we're asking people to reconsider a prior decision and question their self. And so with that, both those things, the label on the video and the popup, reduced shares by 24%.\n\nLenny (31:42):\nWow.\n\nKristen Berman (31:43):\nAnd these are tactics that Facebook and Twitter are also using to slow people down. This was actually one of the first [inaudible 00:31:48] published studies that showed that this drove down misinformation.\n\nLenny (31:51):\nCan you talk a bit about how you came to those two conclusions? I know you work really closely with the product team and there's this whole process you go through. How do you come up with these ideas? How many ideas did you test? Is there anything more you could share on that?\n\nKristen Berman (32:03):\nYeah. It's actually a pretty involved process. First, we did a literature review which is basically saying like, Look, we're not the first people to think about this. Let's talk to the expert and understand what has worked and what hasn't.\" So, with that, actually, one of the insights was that reminding people about their value of accuracy. So, most people want to be accurate. Most people actually don't want to share this information. And so, if you can remind people at the point of sharing... By the way, it doesn't work if you remind people before or after. It's at the point of sharing, that this is unverified information, studies have shown that this could decrease share. So, we took that piece. We also took the hot and cold state literature that says, \"If you actually don't want to get someone to do something, how do you intervene?\n\nKristen Berman (32:46):\nSo, we did this literature review. We came up with a hypothesis, and we had probably 30 different ways to implement this because the hypothesis is just a starting point. And then, we put it into quantitative research. So, we actually put five different version of the popup in front of over a thousand users, which... We got users from Prolific, which is a platform where you can easily test things.\n\nLenny (33:09):\nProlific? Cool. I haven't heard that.\n\nKristen Berman (33:11):\nWe didn't measure the idea, \"Do people like this?\" We measured a condition against another condition. So, relatively, what condition is more likely to work than the other condition, and that would increase our intuition than it would work in market. We're not saying that studies outside of the product are end-all be-all, but it's going to drive our intuition up a lot more.\n\nLenny (33:34):\nFor the research that you did, I imagine that's a lot of the value that you and your team bring to a group. For folks that are just on their own maybe, is there any advice for how to find research on problems you're trying to solve?\n\nKristen Berman (33:46):\nYeah. I would say, basically, if you're looking at a new problem, it's very tempting to talk to [inaudible 00:33:53] users in the beginning. We would basically say, \"Look, go spend a day on the internet googling to see what else has been done.\" Google Scholar is a great place to start. Hot tips would just be making sure you're searching the right keyword. So, if you're looking at something in healthcare, you'd want to know what are the buzz words for chronic care and things that would actually drive you to a meta-analysis that would summarize what's already been done. So, Google Scholar, a great place to start. And then, coming up with the hypothesis and putting them to test. We never do a UX study where we're just showing people one thing because they could really like it or hate it, but they could really like or hate all the designs. We have no idea. So, when we're doing this, we always present multiple options, and then relatively look for which one is going to drive the behavior we're intending to change.\n\nLenny (34:44):\nIs there a reason you did UX-oriented test versus testing the product? Is it just because they weren't ready to build an experiment in product yet?\n\nKristen Berman (34:52):\nYeah. We actually only got two conditions in product, which for us is we would like more and it was... We don't know if we're going to get a second bat at this. So, we said, \"Well, two conditions plus the control.\" But what should those two conditions be? So, for us, we want to de-risk the launch as much as possible.\n\nLenny (35:11):\nAwesome. And is that feature in the product today?\n\nKristen Berman (35:13):\nIt is.\n\nLenny (35:14):\nAmazing.\n\nKristen Berman (35:14):\nYes, it is in the product, and they've done more global launches as well.\n\nLenny (35:19):\nSweet. I am clearly not sharing misinformation because I haven't seen it yet.\n\nKristen Berman (35:26):\nYou may not be searching the right thing. If you search medical, COVID, politics, you may get it.\n\nLenny (35:32):\nOh, boy. Here comes the decline of me. Okay. So, next case study that I thought would be fun to talk about is One Medical which I'm a happy customer of. What did you do with them?\n\nKristen Berman (35:44):\nYeah. Basically, One Medical asked us to increase engagement. This is a classic question. How do you increase engagement in a product or service, right?\n\nLenny (35:54):\nEngagement, meaning just using it more often?\n\nKristen Berman (35:56):\nRight, exactly. That's the real question, what does engagement mean? Actually, a have fun exercise that people could do with their teams is if you ask everyone on the team what engagement means separately, you can compare answers and most likely, people are saying different things. And if you guys can't agree internally on what to do or what engagement means, it's very difficult to build a product by which your users understand what to do.\n\nLenny (36:19):\nYup.\n\nKristen Berman (36:20):\nYeah. So, after lots of debate, we came up with a key behavior to target. Basically, somebody setting up a doctor's appointment right after signing up for One Medical. This is really important because more likely than not, you're going to sign up for One Medical, six months later, you're going to get a fever and get sick, and are you going to remember this app that you signed up for six months ago? Probably not.\n\nKristen Berman (36:44):\nYou're going to do the same thing you did before, which is call the doctor that you've normally gone to. So, really important for One Medical upfront, during onboarding, to set the mental model of what they can be used for in going to that doctor's appointment. Then, we looked to the barriers. One of the barriers, like, who is going to be your provider, your doctor. Picking somebody is hard. Finding an appointment time is hard. We're all busy people. How are you going to fit it in? Knowing actually what One Medical can help you with, also difficult. Like, what is this company thing and what should I go to them for? And then, the benefits. What are the benefits? And the benefits for using One Medical is you get your questions answered immediately. It's very simple, but you can really get your health questions and issues addressed. And so, the simple intervention we did was, just during onboarding, we asked people a few questions about their health; mental, sleep, physical. We then recommended a provider. So, instead of having lots of choice, we decreased the choice, recommended them one provider, told them why, and then recommended appointment times. And limited the amount of appointment times. It was for tomorrow. We recommended a virtual appointment so it'd be a quick thing that you could do from your home. And then, that intervention, the onboarding intervention, increased bookings by 20% during onboarding.\n\nLenny (38:06):\nOf appointments?\n\nKristen Berman (38:07):\nOf appointments, yeah.\n\nLenny (38:08):\nWith this-\n\nKristen Berman (38:11):\nOnboarding. I don't know if I went through that when I joined One Medical.\n\nKristen Berman (38:13):\nThis is recent.\n\nLenny (38:14):\nOkay, cool. Yeah. By the way, One Medical's awesome. As you're talking, I'm thinking if you could think about what are the five most commonly successful changes to a flow. One right now you just shared was reducing options, which is interesting.\n\nKristen Berman (38:31):\nYep.\n\nLenny (38:31):\nAnd then, another you mentioned earlier is just reminding you of maybe what you're going to get out of it at the end. I don't know. Is there anything that comes to mind of here's a subset of things that seems to often work when you're trying to improve, say, activation or conversion of a flow?\n\nKristen Berman (38:46):\nI would caveat all this with behavior is contextual. Why we are religious about testing is because it's hard to drag and drop from different contents. So, I'd caveat with that. And of course, there are some rules of thumb. So, one thing, really, is about showing people the benefit right away, really not under or overestimating that people understand the benefit of your app. So, how do you get them to experience it immediately? I would say that that's one.\n\nKristen Berman (39:17):\nAnd then, the other is really just the reducing... I hate to sound so simplistic, but a lot of it is about making things easier logistically and cognitively, and making the benefit much more clear, salient. We say moving it from abstract to concrete. You really want to move something from the world of people can't really imagine how it would fit in their life to how does it actually fit in their life and keeping them going.\n\nKristen Berman (39:45):\nIf it's a long signup flow and people need to drop out, how do you send them reminders to pull them back in, and then when they are back in, land them on the spot that they were at. So, Wealthfront has said one of their key insights was when people dropped out of the flow, normally they would just put people back at the beginning. That's really frustrating. If you can put people back where they landed, they're more likely to continue.\n\nLenny (40:11):\nThat makes sense. Reduces barriers. I'm learning.\n\nKristen Berman (40:13):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (40:14):\nSo, there's two really interesting things you just said that I'd love to dive into a little bit. One is showing the benefit of something right away. Is there an example of that that comes to mind where you did that and it worked out really well? What's an example of showing a benefit?\n\nKristen Berman (40:30):\nThere's two ways to do benefits. One is the actual one that a consumer has. So, Asana and the collaborative communicator versus maybe one that's more immediate. When we're thinking about more immediate benefits, this could actually be things like social norms where you're telling people everybody else is doing something, and to them the benefit of doing this is following the herd. We all, by the way, don't like to think that we're part of the herd, but we all will succumb to this at some point in our lives.\n\nKristen Berman (41:00):\nAnd so, one example is where we worked with a company called Study. This was a FinTech app and we're helping people to sign up or sync their bank account. Syncing their bank account is a required step in any kind of FinTech app, and yet so difficult, big drop off point. Just by reframing the choices of getting someone to think about completing a step versus the benefit that would come to them after... So, the benefit of syncing their bank account was actually huge. You'd get to see your income. You're really actually changing someone's financial picture by doing it, and they're signing up for it. They know it. But the small immediate benefit is how you're framing each step. Each step is going to give you the immediate benefit. So, for this one, it was a completion bias thing again where people are motivated to complete something. Sometimes we'll do an error message if it's really important for the app to work. And again, you shouldn't do that all the time, but if it's really important, the benefit is actually decreasing that error message on the screen. We call this Right for Wrong, doing the right thing for the wrong reason, where the right thing may be completing the flow, but the wrong reason is seeing that error message go away. Again, I would use that with caution. People will not use and love your app if you're putting error messages all over it.\n\nLenny (42:17):\nThat makes sense. I think you mentioned this. I haven't mentioned, but you wrote a guest post for my newsletter. It's one of the most read posts of the newsletter on just using...\n\nKristen Berman (42:25):\nCool.\n\nLenny (42:26):\n... a lot of the... Yeah. I don't know if I told you that.\n\nKristen Berman (42:27):\nYeah. That's awesome.\n\nLenny (42:29):\nAnd it's about using these insights to improve conversion in general. So, we'll link to that in the show notes. And I think, in that post, you mentioned this concept of Right for Wrong. It might be worth spending a little more time on this, just like what does that mean and what's an example that?\n\nKristen Berman (42:42):\nWhen we think about Right For Wrong, we're helping people again do the right thing... So, this is a behavior that they want to do, but the reason is actually probably not related. So, if you think about just vaccines and what we saw here, the reason to get a vaccine is to help my neighbor and prevent them from getting sick. And yet, what happened? We gave people donut, give people free pot or marijuana. There were lottery tickets in Ohio. So, this is the Right for Wrong idea where you're really substituting... By the way, one of the bigger voting interventions is just having pizza show up at the poll line. You're motivating people to go vote not because they want to contribute to democracy, but because there's pizza in the poll line. So, at some level, we're pretty simple human where we want an immediate benefit. Clubhouse actually was an interesting example of this at some level where you saw two levels of status in Clubhouse. There were the people who were friends with the people on stage, and then there was everyone else. So, that was a motivator to be friends with more people and start following people so that you could be in that little bucket of friends with other people.\n\nKristen Berman (43:56):\nSo, we're giving people kind of some other reasons to do a thing that they may want to do, but they don't necessarily have the motivation to do it right away. If you think about Peloton, yes, I want to work out. Yes, I want to have a healthy person, but maybe I want to go to the class because the instructor making a shout out, or there's some streak that I'm trying to continue. So, their right for wrong here is the real reason to work out is to improve my physical health, but while I just want that instructor to give me a shout out.\n\nLenny (44:29):\nSo, the key there, just to kind of come back to the dark side of some of this stuff, is you want to make sure the end mean is good and right, whatever it is.\n\nKristen Berman (44:38):\nExactly, yeah. And so, again, all these things... The possibility of using anything for negative outcomes exist, and really it's about the incentives. It's what is your incentive to drive the customer benefit, and that's really where we say you have to be measuring the customer outcomes. You have to be focused on the customer outcomes.\n\nKristen Berman (44:58):\nSome of the toughest teams we have understanding this are non-profits. We worked with one company a while ago. We tried to get them to add a deadline because they were trying to help people sign up for interviews. So, they were basically filtering people before Staples would get them for an interview. They'd do the interview prep. They'd help them show up for the interview. But the reality is that sometimes people miss this stuff. It takes a long time to get to the interview. And so, our push to them was to add a deadline to help people show up. Sometimes we say deadlines are a gift. You're just helping people kind of prioritize this. And they said, \"No. Absolutely not. We cannot add a deadline. This is just too hurtful.\" And the reality is when you add deadlines, and we've done this in multiple companies, where you add a deadline, more people do the thing, right? Because you're helping kind of create the right for wrong reason, giving people the wrong reason to do the behavior that they actually want to do. We added a deadline to Kiva's flow for when their borrowers were signing up and we increased their conversion. So, obviously, you can use this in ways that are unintended and it really has some upside to help people.\n\nLenny (46:07):\nI imagine you're building this just like toolbox of ideas that end up working often at flow. I know you said that you can't just copy and paste. Rarely is it just like, \"Oh, this worked at 10 other companies, it'll probably work here.\" But that's kind of a cool thing that your team's probably doing just making this big list of here's 10, 20 things that we could start with these ideas and talk about them.\n\nKristen Berman (46:27):\nYeah. Once you understand the psychology of human behavior, you really start to understand and see patterns. We started with the idea that behavioral economics shows that people act in irrational ways, but we do it in predictable ways. And so, once you start understanding this, you can really start designing for the behavior change at this kind of predictable level.\n\nLenny (46:47):\nFor a product team that's listening to this and they're like, \"Oh, we can't work with you guys right now. We can't afford it. We don't have time, just generally, but I want to think about this stuff and maybe implement it on my team.\" What would you suggest to say a PM leading a team that wants to implement some of these principles?\n\nKristen Berman (47:06):\nYeah. I would probably start from the process angle. We have the three B framework, which again, the most important step is defining the behavior. So, if you were to do a workshop with your team on what is the uncomfortably specific behavior that you want to change and you align everyone to this, it's going to be much easier for you to change that behavior because the psychology that drive that behavior will be a better conversation and more obvious.\n\nKristen Berman (47:31):\nSo, first in starting with the behavior, to get everyone in a room do a small workshop. The second would be the behavioral diagnosis. And this is the toolkit in behavioral science where we study not what people say they will do, but what they actually do. And so, the behavioral diagnosis, I'd say, it's like a journey map on steroids where you're really trying to map the steps that get people to the behavior change. And again, just doing this, teams have light bulbs. And this is one of the main things that we work with teams on; we help them do the behavioral diagnosis to have those light bulbs, and then we help diagnose and design the intervention.\n\nLenny (48:07):\nCan you talk a bit more about this behavioral diagnosis step? What actually happens there?\n\nKristen Berman (48:11):\nThere's kind of two steps. One, you can outline the full high level flow where you're saying maybe there's 50 steps in getting to the behavior, and you can do this before they hit your product, too. But when we're working with just a very kind of... We want to help a team grow their product versus develop a new product, if it's just about growing and improving the current product, we'll do a deck of 200, 300 slides of screenshots where it's just very detailed analysis of the steps that it takes to get to the behavior change. And then, we overlay the psychologies that are driving people at each step. This actually takes a really long time, but the light bulbs of how you actually get to that beha... As I said, behavior change isn't easy. It's complex. It's hard. It's noisy. And so, you have to understand the steps that get you there before you're trying to change it.\n\nLenny (49:04):\nWow, that sounds really useful. So, you go through the product, make a screenshot of every little step, and then connect what barrier's keeping them from progressing. Is that roughly right?\n\nKristen Berman (49:15):\nExactly, yeah. So, maybe in a health app, it's information aversion. They don't actually want to see their test result. That's a step, and then we attach that psychology to that step and now we can have a brainstorm about, \"Well, what would help decrease information aversion to get them over the next hump?\"\n\nLenny (49:33):\nWhat's cool about this is you could just... As a team, you have all these things you're trying to improve, all these flows and steps and things like that, and basically, these psychologies, as you call them, are useful to just anything you're trying to optimize. I imagine there's just like a list on Wikipedia of all these human psychologies and biases. I imagine a better way to learn about this is to take your course. So, maybe it's a good time to just chat about the course that you teach versus coming in house and working with the team. Can you talk a bit about that? Or are those the same thing?\n\nKristen Berman (50:02):\nNo, that's perfect. Yeah, so we have a... Thanks for the tee up, Lenny. Appreciate it. We have a bootcamp course, which basically is a self-paced online course that you can go in and understand. It has a lot of our case studies, many of them I didn't talk about here, and we walk you through the process. You'll have an intro call with us. There's a Slack group. There's office hours really trying to help people go through the process of behavioral design yourself, and it really brings these concepts to life and helps you apply them to your product. So, I think, starting with that bootcamp is a great place for designers, product managers, marketers, researchers to start. I can send you this. We have a Sweet 16, some of the 16 biases that we refer to most. The three Bs is an easy way to evaluate a product if you're just starting, but as you get deeper, these different psychologies will pop up.\n\nLenny (51:02):\nAwesome. Please send that and we will link to it in the show notes. Just a couple more details in this course, how often do you run it? How long does it take generally for folks to take?\n\nKristen Berman (51:10):\nYeah. So, once a year we'll do a cohort course that's a little bit more in depth, but the best way is this kind of self-paced course. It's a eight-week course and we give you a month extra to go through it. There's 16 modules and there's homework throughout it that you can post in Slack and get feedback from behavioral scientists. So, a pretty interactive course, but you can go through it on your own and even share with your team. We do group things. We'll do like a team of 10, and then we can give you a private office hour where we just riff with you on your product challenges.\n\nLenny (51:46):\nAwesome. And folks can find that at irrationallabs.com. Is that right?\n\nKristen Berman (51:49):\nYeah. Thanks again for this.\n\nLenny (51:50):\nirrationallabs.\n\nKristen Berman (51:50):\nYeah, irrationallabs.com is the spot, and if you... Probably signing up for a newsletter is also... We publish all of our research there and other kind of fun behavioral insights.\n\nLenny (52:01):\nSweet. Well, with that, we've reached our exciting lightning round.\n\nLenny (52:05):\nSo, I'm just going to ask you a bunch of quick questions. Whatever comes to mind, fire away and we'll just go through them real fast. Sounds good?\n\nKristen Berman (52:11):\nGreat.\n\nLenny (52:12):\nOkay, cool. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nKristen Berman (52:17):\nI would be [inaudible 00:52:17] not to say Predictably Irrational. I think this is a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Influence is also a great starter book for people getting interested in the field. Many times you read Influence and you change Your Career. It's a really powerful book. And then, the under-talked about one is [inaudible 00:52:35] author Robert Frank. He wrote Darwin Economy, and he talks more about kind of status, and social norms, and how this drives a lot of our behavior. So, I'd recommend Robert Frank as an author in Darwin Economy.\n\nLenny (52:48):\nWhat's another favorite podcast other than the one you're currently on?\n\nKristen Berman (52:51):\nScience of Change is my actual podcast, so a little self-promotion. We interview product leads and talk about what they've done in their product. And then, the other one is, No Stupid Question. This is by the Freakonomics. Stephen Dubner and Angela Duckworth come together and just answer questions about behavior change.\n\nLenny (53:11):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nKristen Berman (53:14):\nI love The Rehearsal. This is-\n\nLenny (53:16):\nI can see you loving it.\n\nKristen Berman (53:17):\nYeah. So, it's basically made me feel that it's rehearsing life. And I think, sports, it's so obvious you want to practice. I just started ping pong lessons actually, and I'm doing the same stroke for an hour. But in life, we don't rehearse as much. I don't write an email a hundred times, and then practice sending it. And so, I think there's probably an opportunity for us all to learn some lessons from that.\n\nLenny (53:42):\nHave you seen Nathan For You, his other show?\n\nKristen Berman (53:44):\nI have, yeah. The Rehearsal was just so compelling and I'm not usually somebody who watches media, so this was mind blowing. I loved it.\n\nLenny (53:52):\nI actually like Nathan For You better.\n\nKristen Berman (53:54):\nOh, interesting. Okay.\n\nLenny (53:54):\nYeah.\n\nKristen Berman (53:54):\nI'll give another...\n\nLenny (53:57):\nWhat a weird show, but I love it. Okay, next. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nKristen Berman (54:03):\nSo, interview for... I'll take this as interviews for people when we're hiring. I would caveat to say, interviews, actually we know, don't predict job performance. So, very little to no evidence would say interviews will predict how I perform on the job.\n\nLenny (54:19):\nShush. Just kidding.\n\nKristen Berman (54:20):\nWe use skill assessments and trials as ways to predict job performance, but interviews are good at predicting affinity and culture fit. And so, if you want to ask a question about that, one of my favorite questions is just, what is a personality trait that defines you? So, really, one that you are filled with strength, but that also can be seen as something you're working to improve. So, for me, I may be confident, but that may mean that I'm not listening. And so, we have really strong personality. People are really quick at answering this question. They really know the thing that they do good but also could hurt them, and I find that it helps understand a person a little bit easier and faster.\n\nLenny (55:04):\nLast question, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?\n\nKristen Berman (55:08):\nI don't know if people will know him, but Chris York. He is a behavioral scientist, designer. I would go to Chris and ask him a question, and just accidentally, in the last year, had done full research on the question and has a very thoughtful answer. Chris York wins for me.\n\nLenny (55:32):\nAmazing. Have not heard of him. We'll look him up. Kristen, thank you so much for being here. I feel like you're going to change a lot of people's behaviors. You're going to break barriers for a lot of products. And there'll be many benefits that come out of our chat. Thank you again for doing this.\n\nKristen Berman (55:47):\nWonderful. Thanks for having me, Lenny. This is super fun.\n\nLenny (55:50):\nThank you so much for listening.

I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, \"Oh, ChatGPT.\" It's like, why do you need marketing?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:00:18):\nEveryone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, \"I don't know what to use it for.\" The work of marketing ended up becoming creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, \"I had no idea ChatGPT can do that.\" A lot of marketing metrics tend to be vanity metrics about the number of clicks that you got, number of views, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nIf your advice is, \"Don't just copy what other companies do,\" what should people be doing?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:00:50):\nPut together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nToday my guest is Krithika Shankarraman. Krithika was the first marketing hire and VP of marketing at OpenAI, the first marketing hire at Stripe where she was the only marketing person for three years. She was also an early marketing leader at Retool and at Dropbox. She also did marketing for Android at Google. Currently, she is executive in residence at Thrive Capital where she supports their portfolio and founders on all things marketing and helps hire early marketing leaders for their startups.\n\n(00:01:21):\nIn our conversation, we talk through all of the biggest lessons that she has learned about how to market your product from her time at OpenAI, Stripe, Retool, Dropbox and other places, including her four-step diagnostic approach to marketing, her anti-playbook playbook, what B2B companies can learn from consumer marketing, career advice for people looking to get into marketing, and also just what people that don't want to get into marketing should know about marketing to be successful.\n\n(00:01:46):\nA big thank you to Kevin Garcia and Kelly Sims for suggesting questions and stories to get into.

Krithika, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:04:29):\nThank you so much for having me. I'm excited to be chatting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:32):\nSo you were an early and the first marketing hire at some of the most iconic companies in the world. What I want to do with our chat today is basically go through a lot of these companies that you've worked at and see what lessons we can extract about your time leading marketing at these companies. And I want to start with OpenAI. No big deal. You were the first marketing hire at OpenAI. Things seem to have gone really well over there. I believe ChatGPT is the fastest-growing product in history. Does that resonate?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:05:03):\nIt does. Not that I can take credit for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):\nWell, we'll talk about that. Either way, nice job. Let me ask you this. A lot of people might be hearing like, \"Oh, ChatGPT.\" It's like, why do you need marketing? It's like the most magical thing in the history of the world. How much value does anything add to making it as successful? Can you just talk about just the value that a marketing person adds to a product like that that's already incredible?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:05:25):\nYeah. When you think about all of the different stages of the funnel, awareness was clearly not the problem that ChatGPT or OpenAI had. Everyone knew of ChatGPT, but when you clicked one zoom level further, the thing that came up was, \"I don't know what to use it for. I don't know what it replaces. Should I be using search for this? Should I be using ChatGPT for this? How can it even help me?\" And so the work of marketing ended up becoming, creating this sort of use case epiphany where people could say, \"I had no idea ChatGPT can do that. And yeah, maybe I should be using it for X, Y, Z reason in my own life.\" And so I think you have to be very diagnostic in terms of what can marketing be doing to help, rather than just going off of the typical top of funnel, and then middle of funnel and conversion-oriented tactics that end up being in a playbook.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:14):\nSo for folks that listen to this podcast, it's a lot of product managers, product builders. A lot of them don't have a lot of experience with marketing. I think it's an important insight there of just, this is a thing marketing can help you with is helping people understand how to use your product, understand use cases, understand examples, things like that. So I think as we go through this, I think this is useful for folks to understand of, here's what you may not be good at and may need marketing help with.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:06:38):\nYeah. When done right, product management and product marketing should be best friends, right? And you are working together at every stage of product development. Rather than thinking of it as a handoff at the end of the conveyor belt when the product's been built, you sort of hand it off to marketing to take it out the door. If you can think of it as sort of a three-legged race from the very beginning of product development, then you go to market with the right thing in the first place. You get these insights from customers, you hear the language that they're using, which can be the sort of cheat code for how to message and position the product in market. And of course, there's a creativity angle on how to differentiate your product in the market, but ideally, you're doing that in lockstep with the product management side.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:18):\nThe other element of ChatGPT's marketing success, I know that you spent a lot of time on the enterprise side, is just consumerish marketing tactics for enterprisey products. Can you just talk about that? And it feels like that's emerging more and more just like consumer tactics for enterprise products.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:07:35):\nIn typical organizations that I've been a part of and leading marketing for, the enterprise side of the house, the B2B side of the house usually fits the mold of demand generation where you're creating demand for the sales team and you're bringing new customers and prospects into the fold and into the orbit of the company. That again, was not the problem at OpenAI. When we turned on the contact sales form for ChatGPT Enterprise, which was one of my first launches at the company, our lead volume 40 X-ed overnight. It was unanticipated even beyond our wildest expectations. And so some of the things that I had to do are not typical to marketing at all. I sat down with ChatGPT and I coded up a Python script that ended up functioning as our first lead qualification, lead-scoring model. That was used in production for way too long, longer than I'd care to admit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:25):\nIt's so funny. I think about when ChatGPT first launched and OpenAI just launched, everyone was just like, \"How will you make money? How do you make money with something like this chatbot that's pretty smart, but sort of not that smart?\" I remember there's a video of Sam Altman being asked, \"How do you make money with something like this?\" And I don't know if you just saw this, he just like, \"At some point we will ask ChatGPT, how do we make money?\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:08:47):\nYes. And I think the reality is it's not a solved problem. And a lot of folks, a lot of companies in the AI domain are trying to figure out the right pricing model. And it's something that you've talked about in your newsletter and so on, but there is a value creation aspect to using AI that doesn't kind of neatly fit the mold of SaaS-based pricing or seed-based pricing, or even usage-based pricing. So, I think there are still some frontiers to figuring out where is the value, how do different types of organizations and companies and consumers find value? And again, it's not the typical sort of KPIs that you would typically try to optimize and maximize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:27):\nI will say, though, in terms of pricing, it feels like ChatGP, it works. It's just like a monthly fee, talk to it up to a certain limit. It's wild to think back now, there was a sense, \"We don't have no idea how will this make money.\" Now it seems so obvious.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:09:41):\nTruly was a research preview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):\nAnd I remember Sam Altman just launched, \"Here, check out this chat thing that we are trying with,\" and then the fastest product growth in history. No big deal. I want to come back to this point you made about this playbook, anti-playbook kind of a thinking. You kind of pointed out that with ChatGPT and OpenAI, there was no playbook, and you find that often people following playbooks don't work. Talk about that insight.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:10:08):\nIn my current role in my career, I've spoken with a lot of founders, and typically, the founders reach out because I've worked at companies that they look up to and they're looking for that playbook. They're looking for, \"Hey, just tell me how Stripe did it. Tell me how Retool did it. Tell me how OpenAI did it.\" And I really hesitate to share any such detail because there was a combination of context, competitive landscape, and the overall sort of zeitgeist of when the company's operating, how the company's operating, that really adds a lot of nuance to what works in the market.\n\n(00:10:43):\nAnd so doing the same things, like if you're just kind of copying the outcomes or the outputs of the strategy and trying to follow in the footsteps of the tactics, you're not paying enough attention to the inputs and, what were the variables and the deciding factors which led to that strategy in the first place? So what I like to do is try to unpack more of a framework for how do you get to become more of a diagnostician to understand the right strategy or tactic in the first place, rather than saying, \"How do you copy something that led someone else to success?\" Because those criteria may not apply to you at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:17):\nSo let's follow that thread because everyone's like, \"Goddamn, I need a play. Just tell me how to do this.\" Okay, so there's no playbooks that you... If your advice is, \"Don't just copy what other companies do that have done well,\" what should people be doing? How do they approach figuring out how to market their product and help it grow faster?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:11:35):\nYeah. So I was an engineer before I became a marketer, and so I have brought a little bit of an engineer's framework to the marketing side of the house. And so something that I've tried to do is put together a four-step process that has served me pretty well. The first step here is diagnosing. So, diagnosing the actual problem. Again, this usually means taking a zoom back when a founder comes and asks, \"Hey, we really need to hire a demand gen leader. Who do you know in your network that we should be thinking about?\" And I'm like, \"Let's talk about your funnel. Do you have a lot of people coming in at the top of the funnel? And when they do come in at the top of the funnel and you start talking to them and having a sales conversation, how likely is it that you close them? How likely is it that you win that deal?\"\n\n(00:12:20):\nThat usually tells you very astutely, do you have product market fit? Once you're already in the room and people are converting, you have found that problem statement that is critical to them that is hurting them the most, and your solution is resonating as a solve to that problem. And so that means yes, probably throwing in more at the top of the funnel is a very good move to make at that time. But on the other hand, if you say, \"Yeah. I mean, we get a lot of interest, but once they're in the room, they have a bunch of questions. They're asking about, how do you compare to X competitor and Y competitor? And why does it cost so much?\" and et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(00:12:59):\nThat probably means that there's more to be done in the product market fit zone rather than throwing in more at the top of the funnel because you have a leaky funnel at the bottom. And so hiring a demand generator may be the worst thing that you can do versus thinking about more of a product marketer who's thinking about the competitive differentiation, the positioning, the sales enablement that gets more people through at the bottom. So that's that diagnostic step at the top.\n\n(00:13:24):\nSecond to me is analyzing your competitors' approaches. So to me, this is not about being super laser focused on your competition because that leads to these local maxima rather than thinking about face shift changes and breakthroughs that you can make as a company. But when you analyze your competitors' approaches, evaluating what others do in the space can kind of give you a useful baseline and identify opportunities and gaps and niches that your company can take in instead.\n\n(00:13:51):\nAnd then, this is the critical step. The next one is you have to intentionally take a different path than what everyone else is doing. And so driving a strategy that sort of sets the company apart is really critically important. I think it's so core to the discipline of marketing, ensuring that differentiation in the market. And you don't have to go into a cave to come up with these ideas and strategies. You can usually go and look at domains that are far outside of your own rather than your direct competitors and come up with some great ideas that you can cross apply and bring in and steal into your own domain or vertical instead.\n\n(00:14:28):\nAnd then the final piece is just experiment, test, validate all of that, and then scale what works and kind of discard what doesn't. So you really have to have a lot of that ability to throw away work when you might have spent a ton of calories on this wonderful piece of content. But if it's not working, don't double down on it. That bias of the sunk cause fallacy really comes into play, especially when you've poured your heart and soul into creating artifacts for marketing. So experiment, test, validate. Give people that psychological safety to fail, especially your teams and organizations. And then, yeah, once you find what works, really double down on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:06):\nLet me summarize what you just shared here. So essentially if you think you're like, \"I need help with marketing,\" or, \"I have a problem and I think I need to hire a demand gen person or a paid growth person or a SEO person, or I don't know, content writer,\" something like that, before you do that, first of all, go through these four steps.\n\n(00:15:24):\nSo step one is diagnose. Spend time understanding what's the specific problem you want to solve, then analyze. This is so interesting, I've never heard it this way. So then it's analyze what your competition is doing so that you can then, one, find inspiration and see where gaps exist. And then it sounds like the core part of it is just make sure you differentiate and choose a different path versus just try to be the better thing or the cheaper thing. And then the final piece is just like, \"Okay, here's our path. Let's test run some small scale tests to see if this would work.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:15:54):\nYeah. I'm a marketer through and through now. So I mean you got diagnose, D. Analyze, A. Take a different path, T. And experiment for the E. So it's the DATE framework. I've just kind of coined it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:05):\nOh, beautiful. Okay. We got a new framework hot off the presses. I love it. DATE, okay. So with differentiation, what's your thoughts on saying you're just a lot better or a lot cheaper?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:16:19):\nBeing cheaper is a race to the bottom, especially when you think about sort of scaling laws and how things are playing out. Every company is sort of becoming an AI company at this time. And so as models get cheaper and more capable, being cheaper is not going to be the thing that really is a durable approach in the market. And I think in terms of doing things differently, it's not just for the sake of it. I think it's really that novelty and that differentiation is something that people are craving for. They're not looking for yet another tool in the market. They are looking for something that aligns with their values, aligns with what their goals are. And so if you can be really crisp on understanding the user need, understanding what is the problem space in which they're operating, I think that one-two punch of a fantastic product experience, and then the marketing experience to match, can be a superpower for your company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:11):\nAwesome. Okay. So let's go through an example of a company you did this with, and then this may take us to another company you worked at in the stories there.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:17:19):\nYeah. One that comes to mind is definitely Retool. Retool was very different from both my experiences at Stripe and at OpenAI because both Stripe and OpenAI, for better or for worse, were inbound companies, right? There was so much latent demand that we were fighting off people breaking down the door trying to get to our products. With Retool, marketing was between the company and revenue. And we had fantastic product market fit with the enterprise space, with the developer community, but awareness was a challenge. And so how do we go out, not just wait inside of our house waiting for people to knock down the door, but rather step outside of our house and start introducing ourselves to the neighborhood?\n\n(00:17:57):\nSo, thinking about outbound channels and building demand engines was the name of the game. And here, one of the ways to think about that is, \"Hey, should we just scale the paid marketing channels that we already have working for us?\" And that's when the diagnostic really came into play, which is, what are the leads that are coming through the funnel? Are they turning into sales-qualified opportunities? What kind of pipeline are they driving? A lot of marketing metrics, again, tend to be vanity metrics. They tend to be about the number of clicks that you got, number of views that a tweet got, number of impressions. I think those are all bullshit numbers.\n\n(00:18:35):\nReally, what you want to be looking at is your impact on either signups if you're a self-serve product, PLG, or in terms of a B2B company, sales leads and revenue that you're driving, pipeline and opportunity that you're driving. So we diagnosed that and we found that for the most part, our paid social channels were doing not much for us. And so we had to invest in net new engines. So that was the diagnostic. When we looked at some of the competitors, we saw that they were doing a lot of content marketing. They were doing a lot of events programming. And we could've kind of followed in those footsteps, but there was the ability to take a different path.\n\n(00:19:13):\nAnd so what we decided to do was double down on customer marketing and customer storytelling because the thing that differentiated Retool from a lot of the copycat competitors in the market was that we had terrific traction with true enterprises who were paying for the product, who believed in the product, who were expanding within the product. And so having them tell the stories on our behalf was so much more compelling, and no other company could replicate the kind of customers that Retool had in its bench. So, we wanted to make sure that we were using those logos, we were using those companies to the best impact possible, and then we experimented. We tried to put together webinars, different types of sales dinners, different types of event formats to see what actually worked best for us, and scaled the ones that worked and discarded the ones that didn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:02):\nOkay, there's so much here. So in the diagnose step, I think in kind of a between-the-lines piece of advice here is look at what's already working. So you looked at, okay, maybe paid growth, maybe this, maybe that. And then it's like, \"Okay, what seems to be working is people find us through maybe another logo, another customer that's fancy, and they're like, 'Oh, Netflix is using Retool. Oh, maybe I should check it out.'\" So I think that's a really important lesson there is don't try to like, \"Hey, we need to start expanding our top of funnel to all these different channels.\" There's one more-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:20:32):\nAnd really litigate some of those channels, too, because on the surface they might be working, but are they actually driving pipeline and revenue?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):\nGot it. So they may be showing vanity metrics. Numbers are nice at the top, but they're not sales qualified potential. They don't actually stick around. Okay. And then, the analyze competition is really interesting. So again, it's just like, \"What are they doing? What can we be doing differently?\" Does it ever make sense just to do what they're doing but do it better, or is that rarely a successful path?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:20:58):\nYou still have to do something a little bit different. I recall a very specific example at Stripe where our product, Stripe Connect, which was made for marketplaces like Uber and Airbnb, where not only are you accepting money as a platform, you're also paying out people on the seller side of the marketplace. The competition truly was to become a payment facilitator. So rather than using another off-the-shelf service, instead of using Stripe Connect, you might go off and become a PayFac yourself. And a lot of the services, organizations, the consulting groups that were helping companies become PayFacs, the things that they were doing was really leaning into that old school terminology, the jargon of the legacy systems and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:21:43):\nAnd Stripe kind of figured out, \"Hey, we need to rank higher for the SEO terms that people are searching for. So how do we help rank for PayFac without actually talking about ourselves as a PayFac solution?\" So we decided to kind of do a reverse RFP system where we created a piece of content that said, \"Hey, if you want to be a payment facilitator, here's the secret playbook. Here's all the things that you have to do. And by the way, if this feels onerous or annoying, it is, and you should use Stripe Connect instead.\" So there was still a little bit of a zigging where others were zagging. Yeah, but I think if we had done the same thing in terms of becoming a consulting service to become a payment facilitator, Connect would be nowhere near the sort of run rate or revenue that it drives for the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:29):\nOkay. And this is a great segue to Stripe, which, another company you were the very first marketing hire at. You were also, I believe, the only marketing person for three years at Stripe.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:22:38):\nI do not recommend that to anybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:41):\nThere's a lesson there. Okay, so let's talk about Stripe. What are some of the biggest things you learned marketing at Stripe that you think might be helpful to other marketing people and founders?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:22:51):\nOh, man, there are so many things to choose from because I was Stripe for almost eight and a half years. Joining as the company's first marketing hire, building that marketing function from the ground up, it really gave me the privilege of working very closely with our founders, John and Patrick. I would say actually I was not the first marketer at Stripe, John and Patrick were the first marketers at Stripe because they were developers themselves. They truly understood the developer community. And when that audience for Stripe was squarely developers to begin with, they knew exactly how to authentically reach that audience.\n\n(00:23:24):\nAnd so I had to unlearn a lot of the things that I had learned at Google and Dropbox coming into Stripe in order to reach developers authentically. The experience really taught me the importance of deep product understanding as well. You couldn't really play act at understanding the product, especially when developers are trained to spot bugs, right? So not only do they spot those bugs in code, they spot those bugs in marketing and in blog posts.\n\n(00:23:51):\nAnd so if the marketing pieces are your first impression of the product, they're an extension of the product itself, you have to hold yourself to a very high bar in terms of how you communicate about the product. And so we did a lot of investment in design work, in polish in terms of how the marketing came together. And yeah, the value of creating marketing artifacts that were deeply integrated with the company's mission and the craftsmanship that went into the product was another lesson that I learned very deeply at Stripe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:23):\nSo kind of along those lines, again, people may look at Stripe and be like, \"Okay, it's the best thing ever for payments. Why do we need marketing? It's just like, engineers build it and integrate, it works.\" What is it that marketing most adds to a product like Stripe?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:24:40):\nAcross my time at Stripe, marketings are very different purposes. And so I kind of see it in different epochs or chapters of my time at the company. The first chapter when I joined, our head of partnerships at the time, Cristina Cordova, handed me a Hackpad at the time, which is like a notion-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):\nI remember Hackpad.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:25:00):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nIt turned into Dropbox Paper.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:25:02):\nThat's right. And so she had kept a Hackpad, a secret Hackpad away from the engineering team, which was all of the features and products that we had shipped but had never communicated to our customers about. And so the launch sort of ended with shipping the feature rather than communicating with the user. So the first chapter at Stripe was really just getting through that backlog and making sure that the ethos at the company changed to say, \"Hey, your launch isn't complete if you're just code complete. You have to actually ship it to the customer and make them aware of it.\" So usage became the north star, engagement became the north star rather than just the binary, has it launched or not?\n\n(00:25:41):\nThe second chapter at Stripe was really starting to expand what a launch meant, right? So, going from just putting out a blog post for people who were already subscribed to the RSS feed of the company versus thinking through, \"Hey, how do we reach out to them through an email, through other channels? How do we really invest in this fanatical community that is getting so excited about the product experience?\" So we pulled together developer experience as a function, built out developer relations to really have that community feeling and vibe.\n\n(00:26:13):\nAnd then it was about starting to think through the multi-product ecosystem. So Stripe went from a single-threaded payments processing company to one that had multiple different products and features for the audience and the user base. So then the work of marketing became, how do you help people understand and navigate potentially this multi-product ecosystem and platform to figure out what's the right set of features and solutions that they should be using for their needs?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):\nAnd so this is, again, a good example of marketing can do a lot of different things and depends on the stage, depends on the needs. It almost starts again with diagnose. Where do we have a need for marketing and growth?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:26:53):\nAnd especially in hyper-growth companies, I think you have to run that diagnostic every three months, every six months in order to stay adaptable and flexible because those top level goals do change. At some point, we really have to figure out how to scale our sales function. We have to figure out how to scale internationally. And so being adaptable to that meant constant reprioritization and making sure that you were also hiring people who weren't super deep in particular disciplines, but having a team structure that was T-shaped, people who could be flexible to those needs of the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:24):\nComing back to your point about how there's no playbooks, is Stripe another example where it's like, this has never been done before, we shouldn't copy what other payments companies have done in the past?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:27:34):\nYeah. If we did, we would still be talking about PCI compliance and payment gateways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:40):\nThere's so much of what you share that reminds me of Raaz from Wiz, who also, you were an engineer originally, she was a product person. Yeah, I think. I don't know if she was an engineer, but a product person. So it's your-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:27:52):\nHer first PM, actually. Yeah, Raaz is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:54):\nOkay. And I think there's a few things that are so interesting here. One is you both have non-marketing backgrounds, you went from another function. And I think, you tell me, it gives you a whole new perspective on marketing, not just the traditional education of marketing. Is there anything there?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:28:09):\nOne thing it's definitely made me is very skeptical of most marketing channels and strategies and tactics. And so I would be one of the first people to say, \"Is that really going to work? What developer is clicking on paid ads? Isn't a better thing that we could be doing for them telling them to install ad block?\" So I think that skepticism means that you just have a higher bar for the quality of the content, the substance of the content. You want to make sure that the marketing is as substantive and as crafted as the product experience itself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):\nThe other really interesting corollary here is she was very big on avoiding the generic acronyms and classic industry norms, I forget what they were, for cloud security. But it's just like, \"We're not this thing. We're Wiz. Here's what we do.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:28:53):\nThey are definitely a company that zags when others zig. I still have my Wiz socks, which have these beautiful 8-bit characters on them. Their branding really stands out in the sea of sameness in SaaS conferences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:05):\nOkay. There's something I heard that you did at Stripe that I wanted to ask you about that worked really well. When you came into Stripe, you looked at all of the biggest customer support issues and you turned those into docs to help people serve themselves. Can you just talk about that insight and the power of doing something like that?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:29:22):\nYeah, and this was a great practice that existed at Stripe even before I joined, which is all new hires would do a support rotation just to build empathy with our customers. So, users first was a very core operating principle for the company, and we spent about 20% of our time collectively talking to customers, talking to users, talking to non-users to understand their needs, their gripes about the product. And that tradition, I think, continues to today. The support rotation specifically was such a fantastic fountain of understanding, \"Hey, these are the areas that people are confused about.\"\n\n(00:29:54):\nAgain, I kind of mentioned this sort of cheat code of talking to your customers and using the language that they use to describe their problems as a shortcut to fantastic product marketing and messaging, because it really tells you what are their pain points and how can you meet them where they are. You want them nodding their heads along as they're reading your landing pages. And so when I was doing the support rotation, there were thematic things that kept coming up. People were asking, \"Hey, do you process subscription payments or recurring payments?\" Or, \"Can I pay people out with Stripe?\" And I was like, \"Of course you could, but there's no reason you should know that because we don't tell you anywhere.\"\n\n(00:30:30):\nAnd so that ended up being a stacked rank backlog of landing pages that we produce that just educated people. And this is really important when you have strong top of funnel demand, and potentially not as many people and you're not trying to scale your teams linearly. Having those educational resources, especially for developers, a fantastic marketing funnel sometimes doesn't look like talking to sales. It often never looks like talking to sales. It looks like a self-directed educational experience. Even the sales process ends up being very consultative typically with very technical folks on the other side. So yeah, that was a great way and a great program to figure out what content we should focus and prioritize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:12):\nThese are really cool just little ways as a new marketing person. You can add value really quickly is kind of what I'm taking away.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:31:21):\nTalking to customers is at the top of the list.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:24):\nToday's episode is brought to you by LinkedIn Ads. One of the hardest and also most important parts of B2B marketing is reaching the right people. I'm constantly getting ads for products that I will never buy, and I almost feel sorry for the money that these companies are spending pitching me on their spend management software or some kind of cybersecurity solution that my one man business just does not need. When you're ready to reach the right professionals, use LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn has grown to a network of over 1 billion professionals, including 130 million decision makers, and that's where it stands apart from other ad platforms. You can target your ad buyers by job title, industry, company, role, seniority, skills, even company revenue.\n\n(00:32:08):\nAll the professionals that you need to reach in one place. Stop wasting budget on the wrong audience and start targeting the right professionals only on LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn will even give you $100 credit on your next campaign so that you can try it for yourself. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. Only on LinkedIn Ads.\n\n(00:32:32):\nThere's something else that I know that you're a big advocate of which is internal reviews and just making sure everyone's aligned, which I think a lot of people and especially startups try to avoid. Like, \"Let's just move fast. We don't need to have all these meetings where people review stuff,\" but I know you're a big advocate of that. Talk about why that's so important.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:32:48):\nYeah, this is a hill that I would die on, which is that good process or sufficient process is actually something that speeds up a company rather than slow it down. It stems from this idea that we talked about a little bit, which is that marketing is an extension of your product. It's the first touchpoint your customers have with your product. And ideally, you're setting expectations there in terms of what they should expect once they sign up for the product or commit to a contract and start using it within their companies. And when I think about that, consistency is really, really important.\n\n(00:33:20):\nThe other part, the other facet of why process is important is because especially as you're in hyper-growth companies, scaling teams is part and parcel like what you're trying to do. And when you bring in someone new, you want them to be just as self-sufficient as somebody who's been at the company for two years. So in your second week, can you be as successful as someone who's been at the company for two years? And the reason that I have that principle in mind is because it makes you kind of break out of your shell of, \"I've been at this company for some time now. I understand the sort of unspoken rules of the organization. I've built up enough social capital that I can withdraw from to get something done. And I know which conference room to stand outside of to get the founder to review a piece of content before it goes out the door.\"\n\n(00:34:09):\nThat is not scalable, that is not sustainable. And so if you want somebody to be successful and contributing member of the organization very, very quickly, setting up some of these processes with the intention of trying to help them navigate how to go from idea to execution can be very empowering and powerful. Nobody wants to do the wrong thing. They want the guardrails to understand what great looks like at the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:33):\nCan you speak more about what this looks like? Say a startup wants to start implementing something like this.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:34:38):\nTwo simple processes that you could put into place today is, one, set up a forum called Marketing Review. This can be a live meeting that you host for an hour a week or it can be a Slack channel where people are posting things async, or even an email alias where things get sent to. Have that be transparent to the rest of the organization so anyone in the marketing team, anyone in the product organization can join that forum. What that does is it creates a fishbowl where you see sort of, what are the themes that come out when somebody reviews a piece of content? Are they looking at the strategy? Are they looking at the audience? Are they looking at the words? Are they looking at the sort of design approach? So you learn through osmosis of looking at some of these discussions.\n\n(00:35:20):\nAnd then I would say don't overdo it. I would say there are probably two checkpoints in a program that are really important to get aligned at. One is the 20% review. A 20% review is a strategy review. What are we trying to accomplish? Who are we trying to do it for, and what is the rough approach that we're going to take? If everyone feels comfortable with that, you come back at the 80% mark where you've done a lot of the work on the artifacts, the different types of teams that have to be involved and how do you take something to market it in the first place.\n\n(00:35:49):\nAnd the reason that I say 80% is sort of critical because if you come in at the 99% mark and you're just looking for a rubber stamp of approval, and you don't really have the slack in the system to be able to make any changes, then that review was worthless. So come in at the 80% mark where you can still make some substantive changes before it goes out the door. And that serves the purpose of consistency so that your brand is showing up in a consistent way to the audience. And two, it helps the rest of the organization learn from each other.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):\nThere's almost this unspoken element of what you're describing that I want to dig into a little bit, which is the need and value of having consistent and high quality marketing, communication. Why is that important? There's always this talk of just move fast break things. \"We're going to be scrappy. We're not going to be obsessed with perfect quality of our, I don't know, websites and emails.\" Just, why is that important? Why do you value that? Why should companies maybe value that more?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:36:45):\nIt's funny because with the companies who value velocity actually do value their brand just as much, but oftentimes they think of these as two siloed separate initiatives that they have to put their headspace and calories towards. And I actually think they are not mutually exclusive. They are actually very interconnected. And so when you understand the consistency of your brand, it actually empowers the organization to move faster because you kind of understand how you want the brand to show up in the world. What is that experience that you want your customers to come away with when they interact with your brand?\n\n(00:37:25):\nAnd the brand is not just marketing artifacts, it is your product experience. It is how your customer support team talks to them, how they resolve tickets. Are you getting passed between a bunch of different teams or is someone just resolving your ticket right away? It's the experience that they have for candidates when they come to recruit your company. So all of these variety of touch points that touch so many different organizations and teams within your organization, they are the amalgamation that makes up your brand. And so if you think of these two things as separate silos, you are optimizing for entirely the wrong thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):\nI've very viscerally learned the power of brand doing my newsletter. I so fear doing something very wrong in my newsletter. It's like, saying something that's completely off or having something broken, or sending an email by accident to everyone that's not ready. I just feel like once I break that, just there's so much power and trust that people have built for what I share and there's so much power that comes from that trust. If I launch a new podcast, people will assume it will be good if they trust what I do and I maintain high quality. And so it's just like a constant fear I have now of breaking that trust.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:38:40):\nYeah, I mean whether it's fear that drives you is questionable because I think it's also a commitment to your craft.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:38:51):\nBut I think that's exactly right. A brand is an expectation that you create within your audience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:57):\nAnd to what you said, if you have a strong brand that people trust, everything gets easier. You pitch them a new product. Like if Stripes like, \"Oh, we have a new billing service.\"\n\n(00:39:08):\n\"Oh. Oh, I bet it'll be awesome because it's Stripe.\" Or if OpenAI launches something. So it just makes life easier if your brand is strong, if there's trust.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:39:17):\nYeah, and you got to take that responsibility seriously because even with something like Stripe, we know that people are going to come try out things that we put out the door. And so we wanted to make sure that that met up to people's expectations. And same thing with OpenAI. When we launched something, even though we were trying to be first to market and that velocity was so important for the company, oftentimes it also came with sometimes putting the brakes on to kind of understand, how can we improve the quality of the experience? How can we make sure that it is safe? So there were different criteria at the two companies, but a similar ethos overall for the brand experience that we wanted people to experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:55):\nLet's actually come back to OpenAI. How long were they around before you joined? It was like many, many years, right?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:40:01):\nMany, many years. So OpenAI had been around for almost a decade as primarily a research organization. They had launched ChatGPT about a year before I joined. And so that was the first foray into saying, \"Hey, our work is not just announcing research breakthroughs, it is about putting products into the market.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:19):\nSo there's a few questions I want to ask here. When is a time to bring in a Krithika? When is it like, \"Okay, we need help here\"? Or, \"A bunch of smart people doing great work, people have the product, but I think we need a marketing person that knows what they're doing.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:40:33):\nI think the first criteria is having tremendous product market fit, which is really important because you're throwing fuel on the fire, and you might be throwing different types of fuel on your particular fire. So one pillar for marketing that you have to think about is product marketing. So, if you have a high velocity engineering organization and product organization that is putting out a lot of different features and your customers aren't able to keep track, maybe the engagement's not so high for some of the newer features versus some of the core features that you had in the past, a product marketer can really help bring a discipline of launch excellence and customer engagement, differentiation in the market. How are you positioning the product?\n\n(00:41:15):\nThe second pillar for me is demand generation. So if you have much more of a sales driven buyer journey in motion, how are you bringing the demand engines to bear so that your lead generation, your pipeline generation is staying really strong and solid? Or you might want to think about brand, right? You might want to think about community development as a big part of what you're doing as a company. So it really depends, but I think in all of these, you found a spark of product market fit before you're really going for it.\n\n(00:41:43):\nThe second for me is that you're distinguishing enough between capital and marketing and lowercase and marketing. And there's an important distinction I've learned over the years, which is capital and marketing, the marketing team, the marketing function at the company is responsible for those channels and artifacts and engines that are driving the funnel for the company, but they are not the end all be all of the discipline of marketing.\n\n(00:42:08):\nAnd that's where the lowercase and marketing comes in, which is, what do you stand for as a company? What is the storyline that you're telling as a founder when you're talking to the press, to the larger business community? And then it really is a whole company motion where the product team is thinking about, \"How are we going to market? What are we going to market with?\" The sales team is figuring out, \"What is the right ICP, the right customer profile that decision makers, that we need to be reaching?\" And then it is this entire joining of the organizations to make that happen really effectively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:47):\nYeah. I think along these lines, there's a reason Brian at Airbnb merged marketing, or product marketing and product management. However much of that actually happened or not, but the intention-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:42:58):\nI would be so curious to see a follow-up a few years on on how that's been going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:01):\nYeah. Okay, let's have Brian back to talk about that. That'd be really interesting. I wanted to actually ask, an interesting thing is happening with ChatGPT versus Claude, and it's so interesting. Claude is arguably better at many things at code, at least at this point. Things are always changing. It seems to be a better writer in a lot of ways. People prefer it for writing, but it's just like ChatGPT is just dominating. It's like, that's what people associate with AI now is just ChatGPT. It's just caught mindshare globally. What is it, do you think, that allowed ChatGPT just to be that? Is it just first mover advantage? Is it some kind of other element? Has it been better longer? Something really interesting is going on there.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:43:46):\nOne of the things that comes to mind is the orientation when it comes to large language models, and AI in general, is that we're just at the very beginning innings of this whole paradigm shift. And so every single week there is a new breakthrough in AI that comes out from some lab or the other. There's this one-upmanship on point changes and eval numbers and so on and so forth. But I think to customers, the users of the product, the things that make it delightful are the same things that make any product delightful. And there's a sense of loyalty that builds up over time when there is a shorter and smaller delta between your expectations and your reality.\n\n(00:44:30):\nAnd where those expectations are exceeded, it is accretive to the brand and your loyalty to the product. And where there is a negative delta, that tends to be something that it really detracts. I guess, long story short, what I'm trying to say is that all of these companies have to think in a much more long-term oriented fashion because it's not about a race of the best chatbot and the best outputs. It's about, how does AI become a positive force for humanity?\n\n(00:44:58):\nAnd so that's going to take a lot of change management and a lot of collaboration between a variety of different organizations rather than just the companies themselves and the product experience itself, because it's going to permeate every aspect of our lives. Our personal lives, our academic lives, our work lives. And so to make that transformation happen, my hope is these companies are not super focused on just their competition and one-upmanship, but rather thinking about the paradigm changes that need to happen for our society at large.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:31):\nIt does feel like they are taking that responsibility really seriously, but it is a massive responsibility. Before we leave OpenAI, it feels like it may be the most impactful, important company in the world right now just because they seem to be at the furthest edge of where AI is going. And so it's just such an interesting place to study. So let me ask you this. Just as a person working there, what's something people may not know that's a wonderful, positive element of how open AI works that's just like, \"Oh, that's super interesting\"? And then, what was maybe a challenge of working at OpenAI?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:46:08):\nA surprising thing that surprised me at the company was just the warmth and intellectual curiosity of my peers and leaders at the company. And truly, the sort of commitment to the mission of making artificial intelligence that benefits all of humanity was not just lip service. It was something that was embodied day to day. The sort of questioning that happened, the sort of pressure testing that happened, the rigor with which products were developed, go-to market strategies were developed, was bar none.\n\n(00:46:38):\nAnd so that's something that I really admired, and it was a privilege to be a part of that organization. I think challenging, of course, is just being at the eye of the storm, right? The eye of the hurricane. So, all eyes are on OpenAI at all times, and I think that is a good thing because of the ramifications of the product. But it also really raised the stakes in terms of how we operated and with what scrutiny, everything that we did was looked at with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:09):\nDo you recommend that sort of experience for people? Because I imagine work-life balance wasn't great. I imagine there was a lot of stress and worry constantly. Who's the right... When in your career is this a sort of gig to take on versus not?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:47:25):\nI'm a big believer of what Claire Hughes Johnson, who was COO at Stripe, used to share with us, which is there is a concept of a work-life blend and sort of making sure that you're working at a company that has three components. I think first and foremost is always people. So, are the people that you're surrounding yourself with ones that push your thinking, who are kind, who are genuinely interesting people to spend your hours with? Because you're spending a vast majority of your time with them.\n\n(00:47:54):\nThe second to me is product, right? Do you go to sleep thinking about the product, waking up, wanting to put it into the hands of more people because you know it is going to be good for them or useful to them? I'm not one of those marketers who can pick up any product and market it. I have to have that conviction behind the product itself.\n\n(00:48:15):\nAnd then third is sort of potential, right? Not just potential for the company to do well, but potential for your discipline to have an impact on the trajectory of the company. And so when you have that kind of potent combination, it can really change your perspective on what's draining, what's energizing. But being very self-aware of what gives you energy is also very helpful to align with the needs of the company, also.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:41):\nLet's shift to talking about Thrive, which is where you work now, and talk about what your role is. And what's interesting, I think, about this role is you get to work now with a bunch of different startups instead of go really deep with one. So share what you do there. And then, what are some things you've learned there so far from a perspective for marketing?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:48:59):\nYeah, surprisingly, more people know about Thrive these days than used to even just a few years ago. Thrive's a very unique type of investment company. And sometimes, when I made the leap, people used to ask me, \"Oh, was this always in your ambition to make the leap into the investment side of the house?\" And I can honestly say it wasn't. But I think being at a firm like Thrive really gives you a very different perspective and it strengthens your ability to be a stronger operator, whether that's in marketing or go-to market or strategic finance, or whatever other pillar within the company there is.\n\n(00:49:32):\nYeah, Thrive's mission is to be the most meaningful partner to founders. And so there's a lot of high-concentration, high-conviction investments each year. And Thrive is also unique in that it's a network of builders, and so they are really pulling their investment strategies from having been founders themselves. So my role at the company is to help our entire portfolio with all of their marketing needs, so sometimes it means being interim CMO for some portion of time until they find a great leader to fill that seat. Sometimes it means pressure testing their strategy and making sure that their growth targets are ambitious enough. Sometimes it means looking at a Figma file for a landing page that's going out the next day and making sure the words are as good as they can be.\n\n(00:50:14):\nAnd that variety across a bunch of industries, a bunch of stages of companies, everything from a company that hasn't even been incorporated yet, all the way to Databricks and Stripe and OpenAI when it comes to the types of organizations that we work with. And in the end, the variety of domains can range from consumer to healthcare, to defense, to B2B SaaS, to AI. So it is a variety pack in the best way possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:43):\nAnd so what are some things you've learned so far? Because I imagine this is a very different experience. I don't know, especially things that you've changed your mind on even, working with a bunch of companies, early stage versus, what can I say?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:50:57):\nIt's a really different method of operating. And so when you're in the leadership role for marketing within a single organization, you have at least a medium term north star in terms of what your teams are trying to drive for the company. And as much context switching as there might be, there is still one company, ideally one product, one buyer journey. That hasn't always been the case, especially with OpenAI and Stripe, but it can span B2C, B2B, B2D.\n\n(00:51:27):\nThrive is very different in that if you want to be a meaningful partner to the founders, you cannot just jump from 30-minute call to 30-minute call to 30-minute call. You have to go deep to understand the context. And if anything, it's really underscored my ethos that you as a marketer, the best thing that you can bring to the table is your adaptability and flexibility. So, to really diagnose and not just try to spot patterns and themes and playbooks for these companies, but rather be very deep in the trenches with them to understand their unique context, their unique concerns, their unique characteristics, and their values and what they want to bring into the world.\n\n(00:52:05):\nThe reason that they want to work with Thrive is not because we are bringing our past experiences to the table, but rather because they're trying to do something new that has never been done in the world. And so those are engagements that are the most exciting is that you are building and going into uncharted territory alongside these founders.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:26):\nI bet they're all like, \"Krithika, what is the playbook for growing this B2B SaaS company?\" And you're like, \"Nope.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:52:30):\nAnd I say, \"There is none.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:31):\nDamn. But we got the framework that we talked about. Okay, I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about just career advice for marketing people, whether it's early stage or later stage. You have this concept, the chameleon CMO. Talk about that and why that's important for marketing folks to think about.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:52:48):\nYeah. The conventional wisdom for many CMOs is to be like a T-shaped marketer. And what that means is go deep in one of these pillars that we talked about, product marketing, demand marketing, brand marketing, and that kind of becomes your calling card in the world. If a company needs brand expertise, they go for this kind of flavor of CMO. Or if a company needs to really grow their pipeline or their demand gen or their consumer growth, they go for more of a demand and growth-oriented CMO. And I think this chameleon CMO concept is a bit of a novel one in that, again, I think modern marketing leaders have to be really good at a bunch of different things.\n\n(00:53:30):\nThey have to be very analytical. They have to be best friends with the data science pod because they need to understand the impact of their marketing. They, of course, have to bring creativity, but it is in service to the buyer journey. It is in service to revenue goals and goals that they share with the sales team or the product team and so on, so marketing operating in a silo is no longer a real possibility. So the ability to diversify your interest, maybe going from T-shaped to comb-shaped is probably the right approach here so that you can go deeper in different domains when it is useful for the company through the diagnostic that you do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nThat sounds very hard. I love this beneficial of the comb shape. It sounds like I have so much to learn, so many little skills to build.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:54:16):\nBefore AI can come in handy. Some of the most brand marketers can become very analytical with the support of a tool like ChatGPT. If your eyes glaze over when you look at giant dumps of CSVs, it's nice to have a partner that is nonjudgmental to kind of push your thinking and to help you understand the details of the data behind the brand work that you might be doing, or vice versa. If you're a very creative product marketer, a very analytical growth marketer, you can work with ChatGPT to be more of a brainstorm partner and really push your thinking on the creative side. So I think becoming a non T-shaped marketer is getting a little bit easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:00):\nThat's such a good point. A good segue to an AI question. Hey, we got to talk about AI. One of your former colleagues, Kevin Garcia, wanted me to ask you something. He suggested I ask you about taste and creativity in AI. So he said that you're one of the best writers that he's ever worked with. You combine technical backgrounds with creative taste. You do pottery, you should. And you're a voracious reader. And he wanted just to poke at what you think about just how taste and creativity and writing change in the era of AI.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:55:31):\nI think it's going to become so much more important. First of all, I will say I am not a ChatGPT hyphen person. I was an em dasher well before it became a ChatGPT thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:41):\nMe too. Me too. I hate that. But just for people don't know, people are filtering out em dashes, right? Because they think ChatGPT is the only thing using em dashes?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:55:49):\nYeah, and I don't know what to do about it because this is such a core part of my identity, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:55):\nThat's a big statement, the em dash.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:55:58):\nTo take a step back though, I think if anything, taste is going to become a distinguishing factor in the age of AI because there's going to be so much drivel that is generated by AI, can be generated by AI, that power is at anyone's fingertips. But truly, the companies that are going to distinguish themselves are the ones that show their craft. That they show their true understanding of the product, the true understanding of their customer, and connect the two in meaningful ways. If they can use AI to augment their efforts to make that happen, that's better than them subsuming their efforts. So to build taste, there's plenty of past episodes that you yourself have recorded that get into building that work. But to me, that is going to be a real differentiator for not only great marketers but great companies to stand out in the field.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):\nThere's a concept that I love that recently I learned from Guillermo at Vercel. He calls it exposure hours. That's when I asked him how to build taste, and that's kind of a value they have at their company is just increase your exposure hours to great stuff, because that is how you build taste. I love that. It's such a simple actionable thing you can do.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:57:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:09):\nYeah.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:57:10):\nAnd at Thrive, we have this share channel, which is just sharing things that we're seeing out into the world. It's not particularly deal flow news or competitive news or anything like that, but it is things that we have seen that resonated with us for whatever reason.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):\nAlong these lines of not over-relying on ChatGPT, AI tools for writing and creativity, it feels like there's going to be a big issue with people just starting early in their career where they just never learn how to do the thing, and they just rely really heavily on ChatGPT and tools like that to write, to email, to communicate well. I guess, do you have any advice for folks that are early career, just how to find that balance of not over-relying but still leveraging these tools?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:57:53):\nI think there's two schools of thought here. One is that sort of the domain, the discipline itself stays static and the way that you approach it changes over time, whether you're going at it in a manual way or an automated way or an AI augmented way. But I think the other school of thought, which I more believe in, is that the discipline itself is changing. And so what it means to market a product, what it means to show up as a fantastic operator is in and itself changing. So if you're not leveraging some of these tools, you will be putting yourself at a disadvantage. But understanding the underlying mechanics, this is why I would still be a very firm believer in STEM education, is that you understand the fundamental concepts. And then you can have a choice and optionality in how you decide to apply those concepts, but the concepts themselves have to be there in the foundations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:46):\nYeah. Easier said than done because there's all these tools now and you're just like, \"Hey, I need to write a report for school. I guess I could just, maybe this time I'll just ask ChatGPT to help me with this one.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:58:56):\nYeah, the mindset of learning has to be maybe the one that we have to really imbue as a value. Because being of that growth mindset, if you go to school just to earn the grades or to finish the coursework, it's a very different mindset than if you go to school to learn those concepts and to understand how to apply them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:20):\nThat's something that stuck with me from my chat with Toby Lutke from Shopify. We were chatting about just what is the most important things to incubate in your child? And his answer I loved, which is just, \"Curiosity.\"\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:59:32):\nI love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:33):\nYeah, and that's what you're kind of speaking to is just if you're curious about learning, you'll almost avoid some of these things or you'll use these tools in a really interesting way just to learn things more deeply.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (00:59:43):\nAnd that stays with you into your career, right? Because you can either go into your career trying to get to that next ladder in the promotion rung or you can get there to bring a genuine curiosity to, what makes us different? What makes our customers tick? And how do we find those unique insights that can unlock something that nobody else has?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:04):\nThat reminds me. To sort of close out our conversation, I wanted to come back to pricing strategy. I have that in my notes here and I haven't gone back to it. So let's focus on the AI and pricing strategy. Just say someone is trying to figure out pricing for their product and they have some kind of AI product. What are some tips, some piece of advice to think this through? Any general frameworks you use?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:00:25):\nAgain, there's no playbook. I feel like it's such a non-answer, but I think the real answer is experimentation. And we found this firsthand multiple times at Stripe, but also at Retool. I think there was a very visceral example where we decided to bring our free product into the hands of more users and sort of what was available in the free plan. And then there was another one that we tested out as a pricing function where we decided to do something quite controversial, which is to take the thing that our sales team was gated on, a self-hosted version of Retool, and made that available self-serve to anybody who wanted it. They didn't have to talk to a salesperson. And that kind of blew up the funnel, right? Because the amount of pipeline that the sales team saw had diminished considerably, but it also helped them focus up market, on higher ACV deals.\n\n(01:01:13):\nAnd so that trade-off is really hard to make, so the only way we could do it was through experimentation and piloting to build conviction. So I would say AI is no different in that you kind of have to test the market to see what works. Is it a seed-based model? Is that where people are deriving value? Or is the way that they speak about the value of the product something quite different? Is it hours saved? Is it the amount of things that they could do now that they couldn't do before? And so there might be a metric there to go off of, and I don't think anyone solved it, especially with agents coming into play. How you pay for AI workers is going to be very different. What is that unit of completion for things like code generators? It's going to be a Wild, Wild West before we come up with something that is as internalized now as seed-based pricing or usage-based pricing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):\nWild indeed. I want to actually follow this insight you had around Retool. That's really interesting. Yeah, so you opened up self-hosted Retool. What was the insight there, because this might be useful to people, that convinced you to play with that? Seems like a big deal change to how you price and do trials.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:02:30):\nThere were two guiding principles here. One is, do people actually want to talk to sales before they get a self-hosted thing? It's sort of like the SSO attacks, right? Is that really the thing that you want to gate your value on? So, that was one. And so we saw a lot of demand from smaller customers that still wanted self-hosted for a variety of reasons, because they worked in regulated industries or they worked with very private data and PII. And so it wasn't just something that was, \"Hey, if you have 10,000 employees at your company and you're an enterprise, you want self-hosted.\" It was that for a variety of different reasons, regardless of your company size, you might want self-hosted. So that insight kind of led us to say, \"Hey, where is the delineation here? Because the sales team should be talking to larger customers, landing larger deals.\" And so to align those two was one of the driving principles.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:19):\nAwesome. Okay. Two final questions before we get to our very exciting lighting around. I'm going to take you to a couple of recurring segments on this podcast. The first is AI Corner. And with AI Corner, what I try to get to is some way that you have figured out to use an AI tool in your work to do better work or do faster work, to be more efficient. Is there something there that you could share? And if not, that's also totally cool.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:03:46):\nOoh, it is hard to pick because there's not many things I don't use AI for these days, and oftentimes it's a catalyst and an accelerant to the work that I'm already doing. But I think I can actually unlock my ability to talk to dozens of companies across the Thrive portfolio in any given week, and the ability to get deep on their context, their environment, their competitive landscape. We can do that because of the tools and the products that Thrive has invested in from an engineering perspective. So we have internal tools that are driven with AI that give us a lot of insights and access to expertise for these companies so we can show up as more meaningful partners in a day-to-day basis.\n\n(01:04:29):\nSo I think the ability to mix AI tooling then accelerates work that you're already doing, and then AI-based tools that unlock superpowers that wouldn't otherwise be available to you unless you're going deep into Google Groups archives or talking to people across the organization to pull out things that are inside of their brain. That kind of institutional knowledge being made more accessible by AI is actually more powerful sometimes than the tools themselves. And in fact, even at OpenAI, it's one of the things that we advised most enterprises to invest in first is their own operational efficiency rather than just the AI magic dust they could sprinkle on top of their product experience for their customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:15):\nAwesome. Okay. Final segment of the podcast we call Fail Corner. And the idea here is we have all these amazing guests, all these super successful people on the podcast, all these stories of epic wins and nothing but success. And I think in reality, that's not the case. And it's important for people to hear that things aren't always up and to the right and always win, win, win. Is there a story from your career you can share where things didn't work out and what you learned from that experience?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:05:44):\nAnd again, this question's hard because there's so many things to choose from as potential examples here. And you're absolutely right, Lenny, in that most careers are not the sort of linear journeys that are reflected on somebody's LinkedIn profile. No, I'll talk about a fantastic success, which is called Stripe Relay, which you probably... Oh, I'm just kidding because nobody remembers it. It was ahead of its market. We launched it back in 2014. It was supposed to be the platform with which e-commerce companies would tap into social commerce. The buy buttons if you remember that. And it launched to a lot of fanfare, but then eventually failed. It didn't produce the sort of revenue or the numbers that we had expected.\n\n(01:06:28):\nAnd the understanding here was that as much as one side of the marketplace, or you might have some conviction that you need to put something into the market for a particular moment in time, the timing of the market really matters. And the timing of multiple parties coming together to make a platform work really matters. And so the learning here was we hadn't gone deep enough into the market dynamics. We hadn't done enough user research. Did people really want this? And if they did, what were their alternatives? What was the stacks that they were operating in? And would they adopt a net new tool versus one that integrated into existing systems directly like their e-commerce inventory management systems and so on? And so for that reason, I think, again, it was ahead of its market and ahead of its time, but a clear flop regardless of the effort that we put into that launch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:22):\nThis reminds me of when Kevin Weil was on the podcast talking about Libra, which was his cryptocurrency project that Facebook ran, and he's just like, \"Okay, that was a terrible time to launch something like that where people trusted Facebook the least in our history.\" And now may be a good time to try something like that. Basically, a cryptocurrency platform to send money internationally for free. What a dream that would be. Okay. Krithika, is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe something you wanted to remind people of from what we've talked about? Just to leave folks with a final nugget before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:07:55):\nIf there's one thing that folks take away, I hope it is that they know that there isn't one clear answer to any of the marketing problems. It seems like there's a playbook for everything, there is a framework for everything, but the reality is the work is hard. You have to spend the hours and the time to really understand your customer, and there is no replacement for that, and there isn't going to be even with the advent of AI. And the other part of it is to deeply understand your product as well. What are you bringing to the table? And not just your product, but your company's values, your unique approach that you're bringing to the table. And really be intentional and thoughtful about that because in the absence of that, nothing is going to be a substitute to bring that combination of ingredients together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We have five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:08:51):\nHit me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:08:57):\nOn the professional side, one book that I recommend to most people is April Dunford's book on positioning called Obviously Awesome. She does a great job breaking down how to position a product from scratch if you've never had to do that, and she's just so great for her real talk. So, really highly recommend that. And then I love fiction, so I would say one of the best reads in the last couple years has been Madeline Miller's Circe, which is a retelling of a Greek myth. Lyrical prose, beautiful writing, highly recommend.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:32):\nLove the combo. April Dunford, we're huge fans of her on the podcast. She's been on twice. I think her book is in my background. We'll link to her episodes.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:09:40):\nAnd mine.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:41):\nOh, wow. Okay. So cool. Yeah, she's the best. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you have really enjoyed?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:09:48):\nI'm really late to the game, but I'm finally catching up on Severance. So, no spoilers, but I'm about halfway through the first season.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:54):\nWow, okay. It's hard to weigh the spoilers, but yeah, keep going. It's amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:10:03):\nGranola for meeting notes because, all right, I love taking meeting notes as a way to stay engaged in the conversation and to pay a lot of attention, but I also know I'm furiously typing away. And so the ability to augment my notes and bullet points has been a game changer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:20):\nThat's two guests in a row that said Granola, and I'll give a plug. You get a year free of Granola if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter. For not just you, but your whole company up to some limit. Check out lennysnewsletter.com and click Bundle, and sign up and get Granola. So cool. I love that.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:10:36):\nHappy to help, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:38):\nIt's helping Granola, and me, I guess. Yeah, it's great. Okay, thank you. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:10:49):\nMy teams have now gotten tired of me saying this, but I say it all the time, which is the delta between expectations and reality is the function for unhappiness. And so it is much easier to change expectations than it is reality, so I tend to spend a lot of my energy making sure that expectations are set. Not just with customers when it comes to our external marketing, but internally with stakeholders, project partners, and even within the team so that they understand what are some of the trade-offs that we're making, or why we're making certain decisions. So I could not espouse that philosophy enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:25):\nI love that this isn't, because I think when people first hear that it's about your own happiness, but I love that it's about other people perceiving how a something did and setting their expectations correctly. Final question. Okay, we've already talked about the em dash, but I want to ask you again. What I'm finding is, so the story here is basically people have discovered ChatGPT's using em dashes a lot, which are these long dashes that you have to use special couple letters on the keyboard to use. I'm a huge... I use these all the time, and people are starting to filter them out on Twitter because they're assuming it's generated by ChatGPT. There's content that has em dashes they assume isn't real. Will you continue using em dashes in spite of all this?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:06):\nI have begrudgingly reduced my usage of em dashes-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:10):\nSame.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:10):\n... but you will not pry them out of my cold dead hands if you tried.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:15):\nOh, man, me too. I don't even know. It's like command, options, dash or something to even put it in there.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:20):\nNo, it's option, shift, minus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):\nOption, shift, minus.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):\nI have to type it. I can't conceptualize in my head. Yeah, and then there's actual rules for when an em dash is the right thing versus, there's a middle-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:32):\nEm dash and the Oxford comma, the two core tenets of my toolbox.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):\nIs an Oxford comma where you add the comma at the end or you don't? Is that the-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:36):\nYou keep the comma at the end. You must.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):\nOkay. I'm all for that, too. It looks so weird without it. But there's also another, like a shorter not em dash. I guess it's called something else, right? There's like-\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:48):\nThe en dash, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nEn dash.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:12:49):\nThat's for ranges of numbers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:51):\nOkay, okay. I love that you know all this. Okay. Well, with that, Krithika, this has been so fun and so awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe work with you, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:13:05):\nKrithix.com is where you'll find links to all my online presences. And one of my personal missions this year is to meet as many of the up-and-coming marketing talents in the world. So anyone that you know is earlier career, ambitious, but really showing their impact at their organization, please introduce them to me. I would love to chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):\nAnd then what's the best way for them to reach out to you? Is it just on your website?\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:13:29):\nYes, please.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:30):\nAmazing. We'll link to that in the show notes. Krithika, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKrithika Shankarraman (01:13:34):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:35):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

Starbucks, the CEOs of these companies were all born in India and immigrated to the US.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:08):\nA lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the “dharma” of the founders quite well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:13):\n“These are the principles that were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:16):\nI want to keep talking about India and how it's different and how to build products that are successful in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:21):\nNo Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:24):\nThe concept of time is not the same.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:27):\nWhat do you see as the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:30):\nIndia is changing because now, for the first time, we are seeing founders being respected and unicorns being celebrated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:36):\nWe have a National Startup Day, and probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:00:42):\nI wouldn't want to be anywhere else building.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:48):\nToday my guest is Kunal Shah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:51):\nKunal is one of the most well-known and respected entrepreneurs and product leaders in India and around the world.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:00:58):\nHe shares endless wisdom on Twitter and LinkedIn where he has over 1 million followers.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:03):\nHe's the CEO and founder of CRED, a FinTech startup based in India, which was last valued at over $6 billion and as of couple years ago processed over 20% of all credit card bill payments in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:16):\nPrior to CRED, he founded three other startups including Freecharge, which he sold for over $400 million to Snapdeal.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:23):\nKunal is a deep thinker, both about product and about life.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:27):\nHis background is actually in philosophy, which comes across very clearly when you hear him share his advice.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:34):\nIn our conversation, we get deep into what makes working and building in India different from the US markets and other markets, including why trust is so essential and why so many people are so much more risk-averse in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:46):\nWe talk about the biggest challenges and opportunities within the India market, why there are so many successful Indian immigrants in CEO roles across tech, and what we can learn from that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:01:56):\nAlso, why companies in India can quickly grow DAUs but not ARPUs, and what that means for building products in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:03):\nWe also talk about how to stay curious and open-minded and the power of second order thinking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:07):\nAlso, stories of failure, lots of contrarian takes and so much more.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:13):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow this podcast on your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:18):\nIt's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:23):\nA big thank you to Cyan, my ET, for making the connection to Kunal.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:27):\nWith that, I bring you Kunal Shah after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:33):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:36):\nIf you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:45):\nThat's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:02:51):\nTheir APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features, and hundreds of other companies are already powered by WorkOS including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow and Loom.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:03):\nWorkOS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:09):\nIt's essentially a modern alternative to Auth0, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:15):\nAuthKit's designed is stunning out of the box and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:21):\nIt's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:26):\nBest of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:31):\nCheck it out at workos.com/lenny to learn more.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:35):\nThat's workos.com/lenny.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Orb.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:42):\nAs a business, you care about revenue, but as a product team, the last thing you want to do is delay a product launch or a pricing change because your team has to rebuild billing from scratch.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:52):\nOrb is a flexible usage based billing engine that lets you evolve your pricing with ease.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:03:57):\nThe fastest growing product teams at companies like Vercel and Replit trust Orb to

SHAH (00:04:35):\nAnd like I said before, India is a huge beneficiary of what you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:40):\nWe are all people who have learned the art of product by just figuring it out, and watching some content here and there and reading some stuff.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:49):\nSo kudos to everything that you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:04:51):\nAnd like I said earlier, you do a fabulous job of taking the information asymmetry of the art of product and  making it accessible to many of us across the world.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:02):\nSo thank you.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:03):\nWow, I really appreciate that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:04):\nThis is already feeling great to me.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:06):\nI have a huge.. so it turns out this podcast has a huge audience in India, as do you.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:12):\nAnd so I feel like this conversation is going to be really special and really meaningful to a lot of people.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:18):\nI wanted to start with something very tactical.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:21):\nThere's a product framework that you came up with that I absolutely love, and I've shared it with at least 30 founders over the last couple years. And this is actually how I discovered you initially; I heard about this thing, and I'm like, who's this guy Kunal Shah?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:34):\nAnd look at us now, chatting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:36):\nCould you explain this framework briefly and then just how you've used it or how you recommend people apply it?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:43):\nOh, and by the way, it's called Delta 4.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:05:44):\nI don't know if I even said the name.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:46):\nYeah, it's called the Delta 4 framework, but I think it's actually quite simple.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:51):\nIf you think about it, a lot of people say that your product has to be 10x better and it's not very measurable.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:05:57):\nYou don't know if you are 10x better or not unless you're delusional.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:01):\nAnd the trigger for me was actually, I'm the unusual tech founder in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:06):\nI'm the only humanities/philosophy major founder in India who's got into tech.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:12):\nAnd I often wondered if most people who were my peers, or people who were ahead of me, were significantly smarter academically or otherwise.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:21):\nAnd why did I become successful with my first startup, Freecharge, which I exited in 2015 for nearly $450 million?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:28):\nAnd I was like, “What would make this happen?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:31):\nBecause I would not qualify into this super league of really top IIT rankers that exist in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:38):\nAnd that got me onto this philosophical quest to find out what makes things successful.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:43):\nSo the simple framework is, an example I give often is that, imagine the old way of taking a cab ride and an Uber. And if I asked you to give me the score of efficiency on Uber and let's say getting the old cab, what would you say, Lenny?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:58):\nI'm curious.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:06:59):\nOut of 10?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:00):\nYeah, give a cab three and then Uber like a nine.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:07:04):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:05):\nSo every time you see that the product efficiency delta is greater than or equal to four, three things happen.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:14):\nIt is irreversible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:16):\nSecond is that you have a very high tolerance for it to fail.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:21):\nIf Uber fails a little bit, will you say, “Oh my God, I'm going to really stop using it?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:30):\nNo.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:31):\nAnd the third thing is what I call the UBP, ‘Unique Brag-worthy Proposition.’\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:37):\nEvery time humans unlock a Delta 4 product or service, they cannot stop talking or sharing about it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:46):\nAnd therefore all Delta 4 products will naturally have lower CAC or sometimes zero CAC because people, humans.. and think about it, Lenny, how you discovered Google, definitely not through an ad, definitely not through some performance marketing here and there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:07:57):\nSomebody showed you the demo and you were like, “Oh my God, this is crazy.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:01):\nAnd that's what I'm seeing right now, what's happening with everything on OpenAI and everything that is happening around LLM feels like magic and it's Delta 4 because the efficiency of doing things before and after is now showing that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:12):\nBut failure is the real problem.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:15):\nAnd making everything tech does not make things more efficient.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:19):\nLet's take an example.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:21):\nBuying a suit for yourself online versus offline, all tech, cool stuff, all the features built in.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:30):\nWhat would you say the efficiency of buying a suit online is versus, let's say, buying a suit offline?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:35):\nI've actually done that and it was a terrible fit. It did not fit at all.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:39):\nAnd so it's efficient, but the end result was not, it's probably often not great.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:45):\nSo it's probably-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:46):\nOverall efficiency score, what would you give?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:48):\nOf buying a suit online?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:50):\nYeah, versus offline.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:53):\nI'd probably give it five and five.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:56):\nOffline is actually probably a better experience.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:08:58):\nI give it a seven.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:08:59):\nThat's crazy because you've broken the principle, this is a tech product, but the efficiency is better offline.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:06):\nAnd therefore when the delta is less than four, what you will discover is that it is reversible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:15):\nYou will not see people bragging about it and you have zero tolerance for it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:21):\nSo you're never going to buy a suit online. I can tell you that right now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:25):\nSo I think it's a simple framework.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:28):\nI believe that if many companies applied..  I know now many VCs in the US use this as part of the training program for analysts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:36):\nomebody in Sequoia mentioned this to me that they have this as part of the thing, but in India we are not still applying many of these things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:46):\nI think it's a simple framework to at least know. You can apply this to features, you can apply this to products, you can apply that to business.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:55):\nAnd oftentimes this is a longer concept.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:09:57):\nWe can talk about it in many ways because it's derived out of some study around entropy and evolutionary biology, which is the root of how I discovered and thought about Delta 4, that “When does a species get disrupted ” or “what is entropy and why does low entropy require growth of high entropy?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:18):\nIt's a day long podcast on its own.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:10:19):\nSo some other time.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:21):\nWe'll save that for a future follow-up, just diving in on the psychology of Delta 4. Just to kind of summarize this, because I think it's such a powerful framework and I find it useful to convince founders why their product isn't taking off.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:32):\nThey may feel like this is better than. The classic example, is a better Excel.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:36):\nLook, this is so much better than Excel.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:38):\nIt can do all these things.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:39):\nYou don't have to learn all these formulas.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:41):\nBut the trick here that I love is just what people rate the existing solution 1to 10, what would they rate your solution 1 to 10?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:48):\nIt has to be four points higher, otherwise no one's going to pay attention.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:52):\nAnd I think it's pretty simple.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:10:53):\nPeople are busy, they have enough things to do, they have enough products and apps, they're not going to take the time to really dig into something if it's not that much better.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:00):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:01):\nI'm going to go in a totally different direction.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:03):\nI want to talk about Indian CEOs in the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:06):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:07):\nSo today the CEOs of Microsoft, Alphabet, Adobe, which is a $250 billion company it turns out, IBM, which is a $170 billion company, Palo Alto Networks, which is a $100 billion company, even Starbucks, also a $100 billion company, I was looking that up.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:25):\nAnd then also Twitter before Elon took over Twitter. The CEOs of these companies were all born in India and immigrated to the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:32):\nAnd I might be wrong, but I think this is the largest ethnic group of CEOs of tech companies other than just white dudes in the US.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:41):\nSo I'm curious why you think Indian immigrants are so successful in business and in tech in the US, especially in these very high positions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:50):\nAnd I'm most curious, just what can we learn from that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:11:53):\nWhat can we learn from their success?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:55):\nIt's a great question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:11:56):\nI often wonder about it and I have had the good fortune to meet a fair bunch of these individuals, and had a chance to really explore with them what really went on.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:07):\nSo there are a few things that pop out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:10):\nAnd again, these are all conjectures, which I can't prove in any way, but it's a thought experiment to talk about these things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:18):\nFirst is in general, immigrants that get out of the country usually have a chip on their shoulder in a very different way.  And the struggle that they have to go through to just get out and be successful, and that hunger that got them there. There was no privilege.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:37):\nThey came from very, very humble backgrounds and literally no money to start with.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:42):\nSo I think that this force is real.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:12:46):\nYou can say that for many immigrants in general as well. But appreciation for math in general, or logic which came to society in a big way, kind of gave. Let's say for example, lots of engineering graduates come from only a few countries because society was bent towards early exposure to mathematics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:04):\nAnd I think that kind of helps create status that will get appreciated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:10):\nFor example, being an engineer, a doctor...  As a philosophy major, I was a write-off for society.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:16):\nSo the reason I'm the rare commodity over here, because you are not considered to be very bright unless you break into these very hard exams and do very, very hard things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:25):\nSo the filtering criteria on its own is big.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:28):\nBut there's another interesting framework altogether, which I have actually learned from this gentleman, Devdutt Patnaik. He applies Indian mythology and management principles together.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:39):\nAnd it's an interesting thing. There are three major Indian Gods.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:43):\nOne is Brahma, the God of creation, Shiva the God of destruction.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:49):\nI'm  generalizing here, but that's the classification.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:52):\nAnd the third is Vishnu, the God of sustenance.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:55):\nAnd their avatars-the word “avatar” comes from Vishnu who keeps changing avatars.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:13:59):\nSo we have Rama, Krishna, all these Gods are avatars of his.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:04):\nSo what you notice is that if you take a two by two of people who are high on values and low on values, are high on obedience and low on obedience, you make an interesting two by two.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:19):\nNow, Lord Krishna, who is one of the very popular avatars, which suits the entrepreneurial category,  is high on values but very low on obedience. He was known to be the naughty God and he could actually create lots of things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:36):\nAnd there is Rama, who is known to be the one who follows principles and is obedient.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:41):\nSo they will follow ‘dharma’ and scale on that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:45):\nAnd then there are these notorious characters, there is Ravana who is low on values, low on obedience, and there is Duryodhana which he says that he is high on obedience but low on values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:55):\nSo these are the people that you don't want to be.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:14:57):\nAnd what you notice is that a lot of CEOs have done well because they follow the ‘dharma’ of the founders quite well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:05):\nThey have not diluted the dharma of the founders who have started these companies, and managed to sustain that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:13):\nAnd a lot of CEOs have this need to say, \"Oh, I'm going to change the company forever and it'll be my identity and I will change the logo and I'll change the name and I will do all sorts of things.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:25):\nBut maintaining ‘dharma’, where I will say that “These principles were given to me and I'm going to sustain this and make it even bigger,\" comes from the humility of saying that there is something that was built with some pure form factor, and I think therefore that character stays on.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:41):\nAnd therefore we have the characters of Brahma and Shiva, the founder and destroyer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:47):\nThat's the thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:48):\nBut sustenance is the harder one.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:51):\nAnd therefore our avatars keep happening over time and different hurdles come and then different levels come.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:15:57):\nBut when you think about the archetype of, at least the Indian CEOs, I've seen that they are fabulous at moving between Krishna and Rama all the time.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:07):\nThey can play this consistently, and therefore they keep evolving and keep making these companies bigger and bigger.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:14):\nAnd I think we'll see a lot more of this in years to come, because now they have the role models of these individuals who have done well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:22):\nBut the key principle is that if you ask the founders, they will love these CEOs if they're around because they maintain the dharma.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:16:32):\nFor example, what Tim is doing is maintaining the dharma of Steve Jobs because if he had tried to change the dharma of Steve Jobs and the values of the company, it's very hard to imagine it sustaining itself forever.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:45):\nWow, what an answer.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:47):\nWhat I love about this is this combination of using a two by two and Indian mythology. It is like the microcosm of you, which is philosophy and tech.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:16:58):\nAnd so I love that and it makes a lot of sense that that's where your mind goes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:02):\nSomething else this makes me think about is, I read this book a long time ago, Jim Collins ‘Good to Great’ or one of his early books about leadership, and he talks about level five leadership I think. Here level five leaders are ones where it's not about them, it's about the business and they can disappear in the future and things will work great.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:19):\nYes.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:20):\nAnd I feel it is very hard if you believe that your identity needs to have its own position and legacy, and therefore a lot of time chasing status causes disruption because you will say that “Oh, this doesn't have my signature in it.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:37):\nAnd therefore accepting the religion and trying to be the Pope of it or the father of it is better than trying to say, \"Oh, I need to have my variant of religion.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:17:50):\nAnd that's where the creative destruction starts happening.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:54):\nInteresting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:55):\nSo you said that there's this good balance between Krishna and Rama that happens.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:17:59):\nCan you just summarize where they are in that two by two?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:02):\nRama is high on values and high on obedience, and Krishna is high on values and low on obedience, but they both are high on values, which means they'll follow dharma, and they'll change sides.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:17):\nFor example, let's say Satya during the OpenAI crisis played Krishna and got things out, but he'll switch back to being Rama and continue to keep scaling it up.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:18:29):\nAnd just to close the loop on here, is your sense that they're actually thinking about this and they're religious, or is this just in the ether of growing up in India and this is just part of the culture?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\nIt's a great question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:40):\nI don't think they consciously think about it, but I think if they ever heard this, they would agree with it, because that's what they grew up with and value systems are much more long-term.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:18:51):\nFor example, I believe all bad behavior in humans comes from being short-term, and being long-term is a big choice to make.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:04):\nAnd a lot of times a lot of people argue that we have a 95% arranged marriages and less than 1% divorce rate, comes from this whole long-term thinking that people are married through values versus attraction or lust and all of that stuff. They’re more long-term oriented and about building a family, building values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:31):\nOr low divorce rate is about “we'll fix along the way” versus trying to say “I need to evolve” and “I need to move forward.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:19:38):\nSo I think being long-term about that mindset, and that's why some cultures last for thousands of years, because of this need for everybody to be more long-term versus short.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:52):\nThe US could use a lot of that these days.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:19:55):\nYou mentioned this interesting fact about how in India, most startups fail. You said, I think, the classic stat is 90%, and that the risk is a lot higher to start a company and then fail.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:08):\nCan you just talk about what impact that has?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:11):\nHow do people try to avoid that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:20:12):\nBecause that'd be amazing if you can reduce the risk of starting a company or is it just that it happens and people get super in debt?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:20):\nI think long-term societies are naturally more risk-averse. And not all great CEOs can become great founders for the same reason.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:32):\nIn fact, I would say that it actually makes it very hard to be a founder if you've been a great CEO because you've turned into this sustainer versus destroyer or creator.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:20:45):\nThe nuance I'm talking about is when you are thinking about risk appetite, India is changing, but now for the first time we are seeing founders being respected and talked about and these unicorns being celebrated and our Prime Minister talks about startups quite openly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:02):\nWe have a National Startup Day and so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:04):\nSo I think there is a thing that has changed this, but let's understand the core human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:11):\nIndia still has a large number of arranged marriages.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:16):\nAnd if you are a founder and a failed founder, your chances of getting a person to marry is still hard to achieve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:26):\nSo if this is all true, then the appetite to take risk will be curtailed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:32):\nSomebody gave me an interesting example that there's a very large, let's say CPG company in India, and let's say you do a zero to one over there and the CEO changes in four or five years and your zero to one fails, but you were the best person, that's why you were given the zero to one.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:49):\nThe next CEO is like, “So what have you done in the last five years?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:52):\nHe's like, \"Nothing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:53):\nI just tried to launch it but failed.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:21:55):\nAnd you are neither given a promotion in the company, nor a new company will say, \"Oh my God, I'm going to hire this talent.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:00):\nSo the guy who stayed on this stable brand within the CPG company kept growing, but that has natural tailwinds.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:07):\nAll he has to do is nothing in that brand.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:10):\nAnd then suddenly what you see is that he or she's managed to do well and this guy has done a zero to one has not done well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:16):\nSo we do not celebrate risk-takers as a country yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:21):\nAnd I think we'll change that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:23):\nI think it's changing already, but we have a long way to go.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:27):\nOne of the beautiful things I often talk about is that when I was in Portugal once and I saw, I don't know if you've ever been and seen this, but in the church normallyonly the Royalty are allowed to be buried or cremated. There is only one more category that is allowed-  the explorers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:47):\nVasco da Gama, all of these guys who explored the world and took risks and took the country forward, were given the same position as the royalty.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:22:55):\nSo when we give the highest status to risk-takers, the country appreciates it because ultimately we're all looking for markers of social validation.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:05):\nSuper interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:06):\nI want to keep talking about India and how it's different and especially what may surprise people about the market, both building there and then how to build products that are successful in India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:15):\nI saw in a different interview, you talk about how there's this big difference between DAUs and ARPUs. In India it's really easy to get DAUs, basically get lots of users, it's really hard to make revenue per user, and that changes the way you build products broadly.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:30):\nCould you just talk about why this is the case?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:23:32):\nWhy is it so much easier to get DAUs versus ARPUs?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:37):\nI think ARPU is a function of per capita income of a country.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:41):\nYou cannot make $100 per user from a country for a product when their income is let's say $2,500 per year as an average for the whole country.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:23:52):\nSo what happens is many global companies love to come to India because we have the cheapest data, and very high smartphone penetration.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:01):\nSo if you look at a lot of global giants, they'll have 500 million users from India, sometimes a billion users coming from Asia and they don't have huge ARPUs, but they help you show the user growth which helps you in your public market and therefore improves your valuations.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:16):\nFor example, my guess is that, I don't know if this data is public or not to talk about, my guess is that Meta would not have more than $3 or $4 per user per year monetization in India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:28):\nBut if you look at the user growth in India, it is huge.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:33):\nSo a lot of times for global companies, India becomes a great MAU farm but very low on ARPU. Therefore a lot of Indian founders who tried to copy the Western market saying, “I'm going to have a few hundred million users” make a terrible mistake because they will need to then go abroad to find their ARPUs to balance the act.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:24:52):\nYou talk about how Netflix is a good example of that, where they launched in India, they got lots of users, but just couldn't make a lot of money.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:24:58):\nBecause forusers to find relevant content, pay for content, when we have tons of free data, tons of free content all over the place, like short videos that are competing with time, so much going on over here, people actually paying for that by design is going to be less.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:17):\nAnd I'm not saying that it'll not change in 10, 20 years, but the expectation that many global companies come over here saying that, “I'm going to have these tens of millions of users who start paying me as soon as I come”, for Spotify, for Netflix, or Amazon Prime for that matter has not panned out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:25:37):\nSo one of my takeaways here is just when you look at a startup as an investor especially, and you see “We've got 100 million users,” don't treat that the same as say 100 million users in the US or other markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:49):\nAbsolutely.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:50):\nOne more thing is the value of time as a concept.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:25:53):\nSo one of the things you'll notice, Lenny, is that no Indian has ever been paid an hourly salary in their entire life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:00):\nBut let me ask you a question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:01):\nWhat was your first ever job and how were you paid?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:04):\nMy first ever job, I was tutoring women about computers and passing Microsoft certification tests.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:26:10):\nAnd I was paid, I'm pretty sure it was hourly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:10):\nNow most likely you'll remember what the hour rate income was.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:16):\nAnd even though you've started making a lot more, you still have the concept of what the value of your one hour is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:23):\nBut if you ask most Indians, and if you ever come to India and do this exercise when you meet them, ask them “What's your income per day or income per hour?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:34):\nNobody will be able to answer, no matter what their job is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:36):\nThey could be staff, at the restaurant, to somebody who's doing really basic work, to anybody in any fancy job, because we've never ever been paid an hourly salary.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:47):\nSo when you're not paid an hourly salary, the concept of time is not the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:53):\nAnd when the concept of time is not the same, paying for time is hard to do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:26:59):\nAnd therefore you'll see a lot of Indians who make, let's say, I don't know, maybe $100 an hour, but still spend an hour to spend $10 on a flight ticket because that's what it is.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:10):\nAnd if you discuss that with many of the Indians in the West also you'll realize that this is a common joke that they will still fight for the $10 because the value of time is something that is harder to get used to unless from your childhood the unit of time was moved smaller and smaller.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:29):\nThat is really interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:31):\nAnd you're saying that comes from just the fact that people never get paid hourly?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:34):\nIt's always a salary, and so people don't write down-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:36):\nThe concept of valuing time.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:40):\nMany Indian languages do not have a word for “efficiency.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:44):\nWow.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:45):\nAnd that's true for many Asian languages, the word for “efficiency” does not exist.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:27:50):\nSo then how do you value it if it's not in the vocabulary?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:54):\nFascinating.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:27:56):\nThere's something else along these lines of DAUs and ARPUs and efficiency that you talked about that I love, which is this idea that focus is a curse in Asian markets, that in the US there's often this advice.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:09):\n“Focus, build one thing that's amazing that everyone loves, try to make that work, scale that, and then, only then, build a new product or build something, build a new big feature.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:18):\nAnd your advice is in India and Asian markets in general, it's the opposite.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:22):\nAnd I think it's because you make so little per user.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:28:24):\nCould you talk about that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:25):\nYeah.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:26):\nI think one is you make very little per user, so you have to do many things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:30):\nBut also all low trust markets, and let me define low trust markets as where consumers are a lot more wary of trying new things because there are no institutions that protect you against bad behavior done by a company.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:44):\nSo for example, if I ever had a fall in a coffee shop in the US, I can think about suing them and making money off it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:51):\nIn India, you're only worried about “I'm going to pay for my thing.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:53):\nYou don't even think about suing the coffee shop or even hoping that you'll get any money for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:28:57):\nSo what happens is in a low trust country, and all developing nations are low trust by design, because the institutions are not strong enough to really, really take care of many things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:09):\nWhat happens is there is concentration of trust.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:11):\nSo you will see that super apps, superstars, super companies all exist in low trust markets because the lack of trust creates concentration of trust, and therefore you will see one app can do 400 things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:24):\nFor example, we have a company like Tata that can do salt to car to jewelry to anything and people will buy it because it's a Tata brand, because it comes from a low trust society trusting the brand and not being, “Oh, I'm going to prefer this new brand.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:42):\nThe joy of trying new things is not so high in low trust nations.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:47):\nWow, I'm learning a lot here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:48):\nI didn't know all this.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:29:49):\nSo essentially the brand is even more, exponentially more important in Indian markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:29:55):\nIt's funny, but the oldest brand in the world is a brand called Chyavanprash.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:00):\nIt's a guy named Chavan who built a “prash” which is a sort of paste that you can have for good health, and it was built in India many, many, many, many centuries ago.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:14):\nAnd lots of Indian businesses still have the name of the person behind it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:19):\nEven the US is like that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:21):\nJP Morgan, all these guys are not some fancy name.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:23):\nThey're the names of people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:25):\nAnd therefore in India, trust still comes from a lot of names of people who had a lot of trust behind them and reputation behind them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:33):\nI want to zoom out a little bit before we go in a different direction.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:36):\nWhat do you see as either the most pressing challenges in India right now for tech and/or the biggest opportunity for Indian startups?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:30:47):\nAnd then just generally where do you think things will evolve in the next few years?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:51):\nSometimes I wonder if the challenges and the opportunities are exactly the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:30:56):\nFor example, one of the biggest challenges we have is, we have very low female participation of labor compared to many markets.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:04):\nBut I also believe it's an opportunity because you can, let's say, use AI and create many new types of business and opportunities because now work from home is not an alien concept anymore.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:13):\nYou can actually create very interesting businesses for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:16):\nNumber two is we are low on per capita income.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:23):\nSo what AI can do instead of taking our jobs away, is just make us brighter.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:28):\nSatya talks about how expertise is now available in the air. So you can actually just ride on that and really make the world very equal in many many ways.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:40):\nSo that's a massive opportunity and also a challenge, because I often make this joke that the largest employer of the world is ‘inefficiency’, and if you take that away too quickly, we'll have a very, very jobless world.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:31:52):\nSo the thing is that it can be an opportunity for a country like India and also potentially a threat because if we don't start becoming great at AI.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:01):\nI was actually just telling somebody today that maybe all of our interviews should be about giving a task that they can only perform if they are very good at AI.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:11):\nAnd no matter what the job is, you make that the minimum criteria that if they cannot use that, leverage that, they'll become a liability in 5 years anyways.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:23):\nAnd the last one is, we have a very young demographic, very well positioned with access to technology, access to smartphones and so on and so forth, a lot of hunger.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:34):\nBut our challenge is that it's also the first generation that is truly learning what entrepreneurship is, what risk is, and we'll make all sorts of mistakes to get there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:43):\nAnd I hope we don't go into a shell after having these large scale failures that we have not seen before.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:50):\nIndia is not used to layoffs.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:32:53):\nLike the startup world is used to layoffs, but in India, if startups do layoffs, it becomes the national news and all sorts of discussions happen over here.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:01):\nSo we are not there yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:03):\nSo we are stuck between being somewhat of a collectivist or somewhat of an individualistic society.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:10):\nWe are somewhere.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:12):\nIndia is a great remix of everything.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:15):\nI love this line you just shared of “inefficiencies is the largest employer in the world”.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:22):\nI totally get that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:23):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:24):\nSo let's talk about CRED for a bit.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:27):\nSo you had, I think three startups before CRED?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:31):\nAnd then you've been building CRED for about six years now.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:33:34):\nI'm curious just on this journey of CRED, what you've learned or changed your mind about, during this phase of your career versus previous phases.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:45):\nI think CRED's insight was actually quite simple.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:47):\nWe realized that unfortunately the value of time and per capita income is concentrated with 25 million families and therefore focusing on them is important.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:33:56):\nAnd they are a lot more global in their approach versus the rest of India.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:01):\nSo you have to build for them very differently.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:05):\nAnd I realized that the ability to focus on a customer set, which is not historically possible to do because every investor expected us to be the next China, and the only similarity of India and China was the population and nothing else was similar.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:19):\nSo I think having that conviction that, “I'm going to build only for these folks and this large enough market.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:27):\nThankfully I had one success for somebody to bet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:30):\nSo our series A was $25 million.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:32):\nI would've not had that luxury if I had no success in the past because I had no product with any monetization to prove that I'm doing the right thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:39):\nIt turned out okay, but I think I could get a lot of people to take a risk behind my insight or my thesis because I focused on the right customer category and built on it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:34:51):\nBut I think the few things I've learned differently is that companies that are very, very good at zero to one will not naturally become great at 10 to 100.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:00):\nThere are lots of different lessons to learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:01):\nThe founder has to evolve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:03):\nThat’s the biggest thing that has to happen.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:05):\nMost people at CRED are people who have not seen a bigger business than CRED, which comes with its benefits and costs.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:12):\nSo you have to gentrify the org every now and then to make people understand the value of many of these reliable things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:19):\nAnd I often tell people that entrepreneurs are uncertainty absorbers for everybody- for employees, for investors, for customers- and therefore they get rewarded for being those people who remove uncertainty from people's lives.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:37):\nBut the kind of expectations keep changing at companies of scale.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:41):\nFor example, if you have, let's say a seed stage investor, they are very used to very high uncertainty and they're happy with some absorption.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:35:51):\nBut as you get a growth investor, and let's say you have sovereigns on your cap table, the amount of stability you need to provide is significantly more, and therefore you need to evolve very, very differently.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:01):\nSo I think those are the few lessons that I've learned.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:02):\nTalent, you start realizing that not everybody can scale into everything.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:07):\nAnd you cannot expect that you can give up the 0 to 1 DNA just because you're building 10 to 100.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:12):\nSo how do you kind of coexist with those things?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:15):\nHow do you react to big changes in the market and not become this slow company?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:19):\nAnd every company goes through that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:21):\nI mean if you look at what Zuck went through in the last three or four years was that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:27):\nI often say that he had to play the Shiva, come and do a lot of destruction to become big again.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:34):\nSo I think that's what founders can do, and it's not easy to do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:39):\nOne of the things I've learned is that profit pools of a country tell you a lot about what the country values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:48):\nAnd trying to copy somebody else's profit pool to your country will not be a wise idea because the country's values are demonstrated in what profit pools exist.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:57):\nLet's take an example.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:36:59):\nIn the thousand most profitable companies in India, the number of retailers would be probably two or three.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:06):\nBut if you look at the Western market, you'll see a bunch of them because it's a consumption market, plus a very high divorce rate which means you're always peacocking again in the market, you're trying to be fit and be cool and all of that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:19):\nIndia has a very low divorce rate, less than 1%, are arranged marriages.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:24):\nFashion spends, and because we have a lower female participation of labor, India is probably the only market where female fashion spends is less than men's fashion spends.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:33):\nEverywhere else, it's probably five, 6x more for them.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:36):\nSo what happens is you start appreciating what the country values.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:40):\nFor example, I have noticed that many patriarchal societies have a very significant market cap in financial services versus consumption.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:37:50):\nAnd these broad patterns, you start thinking about very, very differently.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:55):\nSo many lessons there.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:37:56):\nI love this idea of a founder being an uncertainty absorber.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:00):\nThis other point you made about Zuck becoming the Shiva and destruction touches on something Brian Chesky and I chatted a bit about, how founders often start in control, very micromanaging, just driving the ship.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:13):\nAnd then as the company grows, they delegate and empower and then things start to slow down and then they come back, play the Shiva and take control again.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:23):\nIs there anything there that you've seen-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:25):\nYeah, but that's the universe.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:26):\nThe universe goes through the exact same phases.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:38:28):\nSo if you study Indian mythology, you'll see that there's a Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh cycles and every yugg As it’s called, goes through these three phases all the time.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:38):\nBeautiful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):\nI see.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:39):\nSo this is just inevitable.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:41):\nThis is the circle of life.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:42):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:43):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:44):\nI love how this all just ties back to your philosophy background.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:47):\nIt's beautiful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights hub for product teams.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:54):\nAre you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:38:59):\nProbably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:07):\nLet's change that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:08):\nProduct managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come over one day in San Francisco.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:18):\nThe product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:25):\nIt's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch Meta and Netflix as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty and balancing customer centered work with business needs.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:39):\nAnd here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:43):\nJust go to dovetail.com/lenny to register.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:47):\nThis is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:52):\nCheck it out at dovetail.com/lenny.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:56):\nSo, on CRED.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:57):\nSo here's a funny thing that happened.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:39:58):\nI asked people on Twitter what questions to ask you on this podcast, and one of the most common questions was “When do you think you'll become profitable?”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:06):\nWhich is interesting because when I have other CEOs that are founding a company that is, and most companies aren't profitable, nobody's asking that question.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:40:14):\nSo I'm just curious, why is that such a common question that comes up?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:17):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:19):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:21):\nAs a country, most businesses were of trading, you buy something at low cost, sell at a higher price and you make profit.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:30):\nMost of our businesses, most of our family businesses were trading.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:35):\nBut building a CapEx heavy distribution, monetizing it later on, focusing on high revenue growth rate versus trying to get profitability first, is not known to us.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:47):\nSo when they see these large numbers of losses, there's a shock. “Why would somebody give you this kind of money?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:40:56):\nAnd  by the way, my own dad wouldn't respect me till I was building a profitable company.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:01):\nSo it's not surprising that people in India have these comments, but it also comes from not understanding how businesses are built in the internet world, where VCs are giving you the capital to build distribution, unique product edge, brand, all of that stuff, and then monetize later on and monetize big and then have very large profit pools to go after.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:23):\nBut a lot of times this comes from not understanding this business, and I feel it'll change because many internet companies are now getting very profitable and public listed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:36):\nSo we'll have a decade.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:39):\nLet's understand one thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:40):\nIn the US, maybe 27-30% of the US market cap is now tech companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:46):\nIn India tech companies would probably make less than 2- 3% of the market cap.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:51):\nSo we are mostly, and I'm not saying India has this fabulous history of building very, very profitable tech companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:41:57):\nWe are probably the first generation that will have to prove ourselves to be very large profitable companies.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:02):\nBut we are still figuring out what this means.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:05):\nAnd the fact that this question, by the way, I can tell you one thing that, I have been asked this question by people on Twitter way more than any of my investors have ever asked me this question. This also creates an arbitrage for entrepreneurs who can actually build businesses and have the ability to raise capital and prove their business model with very high revenue growth rate and build large brands and so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:29):\nBut I find it fascinating as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:32):\nAlso, one thing we see fascinating in India is that there is an immense amount of trolling and doubt that will come in your comments no matter what you do.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:42):\nSo if you see any founder in India, they'll post something about the thing, the comments will rarely have appreciation.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:42:50):\nSo it feels sad because, when you see global companies do stuff, Indians will lose their shit on Apple Vision Pro and all this stuff and Twitter will go gaga over it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:01):\nBut I think when it comes to...and I believe envy is hyperlocal.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:08):\nWe do not envy Elon Musk for all the stuff he does because he's so far away.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:13):\nBut we envy our own because they were just like us not many years ago.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:19):\nAnd therefore envy is like wifi.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:23):\nIt's like a hyperlocal service.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:25):\nHow do you stay positive and focused and not let that stuff bring you down?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:43:31):\nAnd do you have advice for founders in India that are dealing with the same sort of feedback?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:35):\nIt's funny the number of calls I've got from founders who start getting hate. I’m the go-to person to get these call because they've seen me get it for many more years.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:45):\nAnd I tell people that we couldn't have made it this far if we cared about criticism of everybody versus people who've done better than us.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:43:58):\nIf somebody who's done anything better than me gives me any amount of criticism, I will absolutely flip and make all the changes and evolve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:08):\nAnd I seek feedback all the time from people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:12):\nBut if I start taking feedback from everybody who does not understand the nuance and empathize with what I'm doing, I'm not saying that we should not take customer feedback, that's very different.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:19):\nBut let's say somebody commenting about your business, who does not understand the nuance of it, you can't be reacting to everything.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:27):\nAnd I often tell people that there's a reason elements with lower valencies are called noble gases because they're hardest to get reactions from.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:38):\nThat's over my head, but I love it anyway.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:42):\nIt's so interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:43):\nI love all these elements you're pointing out of how different building in India is. I think people in the US have no idea about it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:49):\nAnd so I appreciate you getting into all these little elements.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:44:53):\nIs there anything else around the Indian market that may surprise people before we go in a different direction about building a startup there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:44:59):\nFor all the challenges, India remains the most promising market that one can be building for right now because everything is going our way.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:07):\nWe have all sorts of digital public infrastructure, government support, all these great people doing extraordinary things, apart from the Twitter noise.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:17):\nAnd Twitter is designed for outrage getting likes.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:21):\nSo I wouldn't read too much into it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:23):\nBut I think all of us are doing well because we have an audience set, an evolved ecosystem that is fully supporting us and really taking it forward.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:34):\nSo I think I wouldn't want to be anywhere else in building because of this extremely vibrant, crazy opportunity that one can learn from.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:43):\nHowever, I often wish that I could get a one month internship with Brian and learn how to do things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:51):\nAnd I've never had the luxury.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:53):\nI can only watch his podcast with you to learn a few things, but what if I got a chance to be there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:45:58):\nAnd I miss that part where I've never been really trained by these extraordinary product brains or even observed them make decisions.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:08):\nSo I recently posted one thing that the word ‘operation theater’ comes because operating used to be a public process and people used to pay money to watch surgeries and see all the bloody gory stuff and even before anesthesia was born.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:21):\nAnd there's so much joy in seeing somebody do their action.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:26):\nAnd I wish there was a theater for Brian taking a product decision, Zuck taking a hard call on killing a product or seeing Tim rejecting all the ideas that they have before the GTM of a product.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:42):\nI think we could benefit so much from that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:45):\nAnd unfortunately it remains in very small circles.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:47):\nAnd like I said, the reason I said you do a fabulous job of removing some of the information asymmetry and kind of making it more democratic.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:54):\nBut there is so much more that we all could learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:46:57):\nAnd I feel extremely envious of many people who have the opportunity to work with the best of the best because, many of us from India never had the luxury. We had to figure out everything on our own.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:10):\nHow cool would that be just to have a camera in some of those meetings just as a learning experience, because very few people are in those rooms and there's so much to learn.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:21):\nI think though people will find, “Holy shit, one, this is how decisions are made, what is going on?”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:26):\nAnd two is , “I don't want to work for this person.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:29):\nThis sounds very difficult and stressful.”\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:33):\nThose are probably some takeaways that will emerge.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:36):\nKind of along these lines, something that comes up a lot in your talks and work is curiosity.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:43):\nYou have a show called CRED curious.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:46):\nYou often talk about the power of curiosity.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:47:48):\nI'm just curious, why is curiosity so important to you and why is it important for other people to always stay curious and what value is there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:47:57):\nI think a curious person is somebody who is constantly demonstrating that they are not proud of their expertise, and they will demonstrate extraordinary amounts of excitement when they face a problem which they have no clue how to solve.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:17):\nAnd therefore a lot of people stop growing because they want to constantly demonstrate their expertise versus demonstrating their curiosity.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:27):\nBecause, curiosity should come from security because imagine- I'm the founder, CEO of this company and this group of 60 people on WhatsApp, somebody posts something and asks a dumb question, “What does this word mean?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:41):\nYou need to have the security to feel okay with it, but a lot of people out off insecurity try to demonstrate expertise and do it or Google to not ask these people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:48:52):\nAnd I think that slows down the compounding growth and I think it keeps you from being very good at adapting.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:02):\nSo it's funny, I was recently. GPT is my favorite thing to keep asking random questions because now I don't need to really worry about Google having those questions answered around because I can ask the GPT.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:12):\nSo I recently asked the question: which species or animals have survived for more than 100 million years without changing too much and what is common in all of them?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:22):\nSo GPT came up with an interesting answer which says that sharks, horseshoe crabs, crocodiles, and all of these animals have survived to do this thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:34):\nSo three distinct traits were, one, ability to reduce metabolism at will.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:43):\nIt's fascinating.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:45):\nI can bring down my metabolism by 1:20 or a crazy, crazy scale that they can bring the metabolism down.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:49:54):\nBy the way, ancient yogis have demonstrated this as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:00):\nIt comes from the same yogic practice.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:02):\nThe second thing is about, and if you think about companies, the context is the same.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:06):\nIf COVID came, you could slow down your metabolism and survive, right?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:12):\nOr you burned your way out and disappeared.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:16):\nThe second thing that was interesting was the very high conversion rate on every attempt to secure food.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:25):\nThey don't go around chasing randomly and doing things.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:27):\nThey have a very high conversion rate, which means high judgment and the deadliest bite.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:35):\nSo they'll not chase many options, but if they chase something, they will have the biggest bite and they'll convert it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:41):\nAnd the third thing that was more interesting was that they have survived all sorts of crazy environmental changes, just adapting. And adaptation comes from curiosity.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:56):\nAnd you could see those people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:50:57):\nIn COVID, there were two sets of people, who were completely gone into a shell and there were those who were curious.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:03):\n“Okay, so what do I do with this?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:05):\n“What happens now?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:06):\n“Do I need to change something?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:07):\n“Do I need to tweak something?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:09):\nSo the ability to change very quickly.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:13):\nI often feel that curiosity is that demonstration of the ability to adapt and learn, and you only create more information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:25):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:27):\nAll the best companies in the world have unfair information asymmetry.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:33):\nAnd that comes from curiosity. Because you're constantly collecting dots, connecting dots, collecting dots, connecting dots, and end up creating this unique edge for yourself and information asymmetry for yourself.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:48):\nAnd if you assume that “I have collected enough,” no human life is going to be enough to connect and connect all the dots.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:56):\nWe'll never be able to get..\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:51:58):\nAnd sometimes I envy the stuff that you do because you are efficiently connecting and collecting dots by having the luxury of all these people to talk to, and you are making more dots getting connected.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:52:12):\nSo your information asymmetry is growing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:14):\nWait until you IPO, and then someday maybe leave CRED and then you could start this podcast with everyone like this and connect all the dots.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:22):\nAnd I think that's a reference to Danny Meyer who's the founder of all these fancy restaurants and big on hospitality and has this phrase “Always be collecting dots”, I think ABCD, I’ll link to that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:33):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:35):\nWait, this is really interesting, this list of what are the common traits of the most long-lasting animals?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:41):\nThey can lower their metabolism at will, they have a high conversion rate to get food, and they've survived many types of environments.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:49):\nAnd I think there's a lot you can transform as you've done, to startups and leaders.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:54):\nThis could be its own…\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:55):\nif you haven't written about this, this would be a cool blog post.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:52:59):\nI'm curious who you look up to in business, either in India and outside India.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:53:05):\nWho comes to mind where you're like, I really inspired, I'm inspired by these folks?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:10):\nI often tell people that I hate the word ‘favorite’ because it tells me to become limited in my mind.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:16):\nSo I stay away from ‘favorite’, but I learn all the time from everybody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:22):\nAnd there are so many people to learn from across the world and in history, in the recent past and every time you'll discover fascinating, extraordinary things about them.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:35):\nSo I don't think I have a person.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:38):\nI am this person who thinks about about: ”How did they solve this hard problem.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:53:42):\nSo one of the things that we started doing recently and not very ritualistic about it so far is, I ask myself and my key reportees every month, we go around the table and ask ourselves, ”What are the hardest problems we solved last month?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:00):\nAnd it's very hard to come up with an answer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:04):\nAnd if you do this to the product leaders, just go around and ask, “What are the hard problems you solved last month?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:11):\nYou'll realize that we all stay very busy and displacement is hard.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:15):\nBut if you notice extraordinarily successful people, they'll have a lot more content to talk about every month, every quarter because they're obsessed with making that big displacement and it does not come by being busy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:35):\nAnd that's another thing that you cannot chase the big thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:37):\nYou don't see a crocodile being busy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:40):\nYou see a crocodile just waiting patiently at the watering hole for that best meal and have the deadliest bite for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:49):\nSo the beautiful definition of predators I read was “one who burns the least amount of calories to earn the most amount of calories.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:54:59):\nSo how do you become that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:00):\nAnd I think when I meet people who are extraordinary at that, and it comes in all shapes and forms, I learn something from them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:07):\nSo in these meetings you have, are you judging people's success based on how many hard problems they solve?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:13):\nNow that they've heard this, they're going to be like, I need more.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:17):\nBecause if you're a senior, what is the role of a senior person?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:21):\nYou have to be the chief problem solver.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):\nI love that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:24):\nI often think of leaders as professional firefighters who have just endless fires to put out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:31):\nKind of along the lines of people and where you learn from, are there any sources of content?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:36):\nThis is actually an audience question on Twitter.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:55:38):\nAnurag Verma asks this, “What are your favorite sources of content to learn from in terms of what's happening in the world and what to pay attention to?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:47):\nI wish I could think of an answer.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:55:50):\nMy method of collecting information is mostly about, I come up with conjectures in my head and then I go all over the place to find out if there is proof if what I'm saying is true or not.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:04):\nFor example, I recently came up with a conjecture that everybody who has been successful in the history of business of vices, historically has done a lot of philanthropy to create a good image for themselves, and therefore is being treated as a respected citizen versus being treated as a person who did vices to make wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:24):\nAnd then I asked GPT to come up with 50 people who did that and what were their vices?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:30):\nHow did they change the reputation by doing lots of philanthropy and all of that stuff?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:36):\nThen a thing happens.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:37):\nAnd then I research in all sorts of directions. And I have no boundaries if I go to chemistry or physics or human behavior to discover some universal principles.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:56:48):\nSo my method of learning is to constantly come up with conjectures from the dots that you have connected and then absolutely work hard to find proof of it and then use that to connect to the next dot.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:01):\nSo I often tell people that every book you read makes your brain poorer to read the next book.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:10):\nThat's the purpose of books, but that's true for every single thing we learn.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:13):\nIt makes our brain poorerfor the next thing that we are supposed to learn.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:57:17):\nIs there a recent example of that where you got super sucked into some topic?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:20):\nWell, it's my daily life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:22):\nI get sucked into topics every now and then.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:26):\nFor example, I've been thinking about second order effects of AI and what happens to countries and jobs and how to expect some of these things to change, not change, rate of change, rate of skill change.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:39):\nI got recently obsessed with what happens to lab grown diamonds if they become big?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\nDoes it kill diamonds?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:44):\nDoes it make diamonds bigger?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:46):\nAnd then I looked at parallels.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:48):\nSo, the pearl industry was very big before culture.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:53):\nCultured pearls  came and the high status of pearls disappeared because everybody could have pearls.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:57:59):\nBut not too long ago, pearls were a very royal thing . Every prince and princess used to have pearls around them, but as soon as it was easy to manufacture in a lab, it lost its value.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:13):\nSo then  I think should I be shorting or going long on diamonds thinking about what happens?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:19):\nBut there'll be a temporary period of making a lot of money on lab grown diamonds, which will kill... it'll become parasitic on the status of diamonds and destroy all of the profit pools.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:31):\nYou heard it here first, time to buy some diamond futures.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:58:35):\nI feel like there's no one in the world ChatGPT impacted more than you considering how much you want to spend digging into random topics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:58:43):\nI often wonder, Lenny, that if you took the most serious people and made their GPT searches public, a lot of people will learn because the problem of GPT is now it'll make the people with great questions do well, versus people who are looking for basic answers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:00):\nSo I think the world is going to be unfair to people who will ask great questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:05):\nInteresting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (00:59:06):\nWell, I got to ask you, is there any advice you have for asking great questions that has helped you in your work and career and life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:14):\nWhenever somebody has many choices and they make the right choice in whatever domain they have.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:21):\nFor example, let's say you could hire anybody but you hired great people, or let's say you could have married anybody, but you married a great person and so on and so forth. Everybody has many choices to make.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:32):\nHow do they make choices for that domain of expertise?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:38):\nAnd I think that is the most, and many times they're not going to be able to explain how they make great choices.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:43):\nThey'll have to really go into that because they don't really have their mental models figured out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:49):\nThey cannot articulate, they cannot coach, they cannot explain.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (00:59:51):\nBut if you can figure out how they make great decisions in general, in whatever domain of work they're doing, you'll find many interesting insights coming over there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:01):\nThe other good question to ask is about second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:06):\nWhat do they think will happen to the world and why did they come to that conclusion?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:11):\nAnd you see that full chain of thoughts is very powerful.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:15):\nFor example, second order thinking is known to be the most powerful trait to predict the success of somebody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:22):\nBut I often wonder what happened in the childhood of people who became great at second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:30):\nAnd that question is not fully discovered or discussed yet.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:34):\nAnd I've found some loose examples such as if you played strategy games or only physical games as a strong correlation to building\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:42):\nSo rigor came from physical games, but second order thinking came from playing strategy games as a kid.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:48):\nAnd if you had both, you could do really well in general because you have discipline and second order thinking together.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:00:55):\nThen did you ever have an exercise of looking at history?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:01):\nFor example, one of the things I recommend for parents to do with their kids, I call it the ‘Whyfi school’, is ask them  one ‘why’ question every meal and let them come back with answers the next day.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:15):\nFor example, “Why do humans wear jewelry” and ”Why is something a certain way?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:23):\nAnd let them go into the full depth of history and find out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:29):\nWhy is it so expensive to advertise in the Super Bowl?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:32):\nAnd so on and so forth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:33):\nYou just take one question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:34):\nAnd if you train them on why, they evolve at a very different rate because how, what are the questions which do not evolve at a much higher rate, because ‘why’ is the deep question and it breaks a lot of things in your head.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:48):\nOr another question about origin stories that “How did elevators come into being?” and \"what made your phones happen?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:54):\n“What made microphones happen and why is it called microphone and why is it called a phone?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:01:59):\nAnd if you just want to go into this depth, you'll see people build second order thinking automatically because either you go into history and see second order thinking coming along with that, or you play games that train your brain for second order thinking with the spectrum.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:13):\nBut that's a broad range of things that I think people should be asking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:17):\nI'm looking forward to Kunal’s children's raising book, like a book to help you raise kids.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:23):\nThis could be your future.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:24):\nI don't have kids so I can run experiments on everybody else's kids.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:27):\nSo it's a great thing to do.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:29):\nI feel like with these questions, I think the rule has to be you can't just ask ChatGPT for the answer if the block it-\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:34):\nActually it's not bad.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:36):\nI think you should encourage it because we have to assume that we are going to be all co-pilots of AI now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:42):\nWhat you have to do is derive the second order insight that, “Okay, this is true.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:46):\nWhere is the similarity of this in somewhere else?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:02:49):\nGive me an example of this found somewhere else, and so on and so forth.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:54):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:55):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:02:56):\nI have just a couple more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:00):\nFirst, let's visit the contrarian corner.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:03:03):\nI'm curious. What's something that you believe that very few other people would agree with you on and why do you hold that belief?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:12):\nOur understanding of wealth and what wealth is, is flawed.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:16):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but storage of energy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:20):\nAnd therefore the reason wealth is not zero sum is because energy is, and we are just finding  ways to convert energy to our advantage.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:28):\nWe are the only species that has managed to convert all forms of energy to our advantage.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:32):\nKinetic energy and fuel and sound and solar.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:35):\nNo other species has done this.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:37):\nAnd therefore, since the industrial revolution, our wealth has gone like this and continues to be like that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:42):\nAI and nuclear fission and all this stuff will kind of take us right there.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:47):\nSo I have a strong view that we will never, never have equality of wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:55):\nIn fact, chasing that is actually a bad idea.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:03:58):\nBut if you let people do well and chase wealth, they have enough wealth for everybody else and we could help a lot of people out.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:06):\nAnd I think it's complicated because we can have all these democratic arguments that wealth is concentrated and all that, but that's the physics of wealth.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:16):\nIt'll always be concentrated.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:18):\nYou change these mediums, companies, countries.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:23):\nTo me, wealth is nothing but an entropic complexity that'll keep changing its form and shape.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:29):\nYou can keep fighting it or accept its physics and reap the benefit of that physics.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:34):\nI think Elon had this interesting point that wealth is just a database where everyone's wealth I guess is just a row in the database and here's how much everyone has and you're just transferring numbers around and that's the whole economy.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:49):\nNo, but the nuance that is important is that you can actually increase the database size infinitely.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:04:54):\nThat's true.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:04:55):\nAnd therefore his vision of the sun's energy, if you really convert all the energy to our advantage, the amount of wealth we will create for humans is disproportionate.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:04):\nAnd all the species that are managed to collaborate and cooperate to create wealth, for example, let's define wealth as biomass.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:12):\nSo let's say ants and bacteria and humans are the only few things that have the largest biomass on this planet because we figured out how to make energy work to our advantage.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:23):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:24):\nI love all the directions we've gone.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:27):\nProbably the last question, is there a story of failure in your career that would be interesting to share?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:05:34):\nSomething that taught you an important lesson?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:36):\nIt's a series of failures.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:39):\nI think there is no escape for anybody who's done anything in life, not failed a lot, like every day, every thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:05:46):\nBut I would say that many initiatives, many products, companies that I've built have absolutely failed, hirings that have failed, trust broken, betrayals.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:01):\nSo I think there is no end to it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:04):\nBut I think entrepreneurs have this weird ability to forget about failures and almost turn that into a lesson that you hold, and you forget the story.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:21):\nFor example, COVID has literally no memory for me.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:24):\nI just don't remember what was COVID.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:27):\nIt's just a blank in my head right now.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:30):\nAnd I think that humans are great at forgetting the memory of failure, but remember the lesson from failure.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:36):\nBut I think I'm constantly learning, and I often believe that life is too short to make all our mistakes ourselves.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:43):\nSo we should be learning from other people's failures as well.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:46):\nAnd a lot of times we don't do that because we believe that we are special, nothing like that will happen to us, but as humans, we should be learning.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:55):\nI would say that my life started from a failure.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:06:58):\nMy family went through a severe financial crisis.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:01):\nI had to start working from age 15 and I feel till date, I'm just trying to escape that failure that happened in the family.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:10):\nSo I think many of us are just fighting that initial large failure that we've had and don't want to be anywhere near that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:21):\nAnd although we are significantly far away from that, the feeling is exactly that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:27):\nCircles back to one of our first few questions about the chips on shoulders driving a lot of motivation.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:33):\nThere's this phrase, ”Chips on shoulders drive chips in pockets.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:39):\nThat's interesting.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:07:40):\nIs there anything more you want to share about that early challenge you ran into or is that something you've shared often?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:46):\nNo, I mean I've shared that enough, but I used to not talk about it before because I used to think that I would get some sympathy for that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:07:54):\nAnd only in the recent past did I speak about it because I want people to realize that I was not some gifted kid who had some rich parents who made me extraordinarily bright and put me in great schools and colleges and I made my way through that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:12):\nI used to not talk  about it earlier because there's a lot of tendency to give sympathy to those people who say, \"Oh, this guy had struggled.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:17):\nAnd I don't want to be given any credit for playing that poverty card or this card or struggling for food card.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:29):\nThat's not an excuse.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:32):\nThere are so many people in the world who've done extraordinarily well because they had the gift of struggle.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:08:37):\nAnd I often tell people that this is the biggest curse of successful parents, that that's the only gift they'll not be able to give to their kids, the gift of struggle that they had.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:46):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\nI think about that a lot.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:47):\nWe have a kid, he's eight months now, and so I'm trying to figure out the balance of struggle versus making life easy and great, a new challenge for me to figure out.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:08:57):\nBefore we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else, Kunal, you wanted to share or leave listeners with?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\nAnything?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:02):\nAny last nuggets of thoughts?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:04):\nWell, I would love for the listeners from different fields of product to share what you're learning without being fearful of the judgment of your peers, because there are many, many people who are learning only because you share your evolution and your thoughts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:22):\nAnd I believe that a lot more could be contributing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:25):\nAnd a lot of your listeners are really bright people.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:28):\nIf they all shared, many people from many places in the world would learn and achieve some amount of success.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:38):\nThanks to your sharing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:39):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:40):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:43):\nAre you ready?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:45):\nAll set.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:46):\nLet's do it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:09:47):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:53):\nIt keeps changing a lot, but my books are usually around understanding human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:09:58):\nAnd I keep changing based on the person, but I think it's the biggest subject.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:03):\nAll our customers, all our investors, all our employees, all our relationships are all humans.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:08):\nAnd the subject that we are weakest on is human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:11):\nAnd how do we live this life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:13):\nWe are playing life on extremely hard mode if you don't learn human behavior.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:17):\nSo I would say that's one thing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:19):\nThe second thing, evolutionary biology, teaches a lot about how species evolve and how they make decisions and what are the core motivations that drive everybody.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:28):\nSo that's another one I would recommend.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:30):\nAnd I don't want to make a recommendation because I can barely finish a book to be honest.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:36):\nSo I believe in drifting and getting deeper into topics.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:39):\nSo understanding the topics versus trying to say, give me these three books and I'm going to be good.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:43):\nAnd the last one I would say, is that anything that can make you learn something about their journey versus their success.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:10:53):\nSo sometimes autobiographies are too celebratory in some ways, but if you can just kind of understand how… any book that can teach you about how people recover from a setback in great detail is a great book to learn from.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:11):\nAn audience member on Twitter actually asked a similar question along these lines, if there's one book that you could read over and over and over, what would that be?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:20):\nIs there one?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:21):\nI absolutely don't believe in reading over and over because I believe that we are evolving.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:29):\nYou might discover the same stuff coming from different books and you would say, \"Oh, I can categorize this in my brain again and again.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:34):\nBut I think we tend to become believers, and it becomes too religious if you repeat.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:47):\nYeah.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:11:49):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:11:54):\nI love Oppenheimer because of the struggles and Nolan's craft of making the movies, but nothing in the recent past that I feel is right up there.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:12:05):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:11):\nI like to ask a hypothetical second order thinking question.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:15):\nFor example, if everybody who has taken a COVID vaccine dies tonight, what happens in 12 months from now?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:23):\nCan you explain the world- from what happens to money, what happens to law?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:28):\nWhat happens to countries?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:29):\nWhat happens to the military?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:30):\nWhat happens to the stock market?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:32):\nWhat happens to the order of things?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:35):\nAnd I would say less than 10% of really smart people can have really good answers.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:43):\nSo it tells you how good they are at second order thinking.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:48):\nBut the questions can keep changing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:49):\nFor example, if you said that, what if arranged marriages were banned in India, and you got capital punishment for doing arranged marriages?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:57):\nWhat happens to the country?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:12:59):\nHow do we change from there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:01):\nLike some absurd scenarios, but then what happens after that?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:05):\nNot to give away your secret sauce, but what do you look for in an answer that gives you a sense there?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:09):\nThe range of things that they could go into and think about-  if this happens, B happens and then C happens.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:18):\nThe leaps they could make.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:13:20):\nAnd just so people understand, when you're talking about second order thinking, what's the simplest way to describe that concept?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:26):\nI think the simplest way to think about this is being able to correctly judge the butterfly effect of an event as close as possible.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:37):\nFor example, a lot of people in the stock market use that to say how stocks will go up and down.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:44):\nThere's something that has happened in the market.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:46):\n“Oh, there is a war now with Russia, then what happens to the market?”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:52):\nCan you be good at predicting that?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:13:54):\nBut in everything in life, if this happens, a lot of people hate this because it's very taxing to the brain.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:02):\nThe brain absolutely hates second order thinking unless you've trained your brain with second order thinking all the time that it looks forward to it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:10):\nSo you convert this into a hate versus a reward cycle, and that comes with probably doing it early on in your life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:19):\nLater on, people hate doing second order thinking.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:22):\nIt is.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):\nYes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:23):\nThat sounds like a lot of work for the brain.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):\nOkay.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:26):\nJust a few more questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:27):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered and that you really love?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:32):\nI'm looking forward to my Vision Pro coming soon.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:37):\nIt's a future favorite product.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:39):\nWe have actually Boz from Meta coming on as the next guest in my recording.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:14:43):\nI'm not sure when they come out in sequence, but we're going to talk about his thoughts.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:48):\nThe most fascinating thing that I saw was Zuck talking about the utility of Meta being better than Vision Pro and their product.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:14:59):\nAnd that's exactly going to work well for Apple because when you try to make the product more utilitarian, it loses status.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:08):\nAnd if you study animals, you realize that the one which gets the highest mating success is the one which can demonstrate the ability to waste resources and not be very efficient with resources.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:20):\nAnd therefore people who are known to buy a product that is wasteful will actually own higher status.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:26):\nAnd I think Zuck made it actually quite easy for Apple to demonstrate their superior positioning by saying that, \"Oh, we are not as efficient, we are not as cheap.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:35):\nWe are not for everybody.\"\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):\nWow.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:37):\nJust continue to blow minds even on our lightning round.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:15:42):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends and family, find useful in work or in life?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:15:50):\nIt's not a favorite motto, but I think we truly are transient and we are very lucky to have this life that we have and we have to make the most out of it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:01):\nAnd all these struggles will mean nothing.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:05):\nI often tell people that you should wish for your life to be so great that you have collected the highest amount of content when you are old, and you have no end to the stories that you can talk about.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:16):\nThat reminds me of a book I once read that really had an impact on me where somebody was trying to make a movie of their life and the producer was like, \"There's nothing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:24):\nThere's no good movie here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:25):\nYou have not done enough interesting things.\"\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:27):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:29):\nAnd so he turned his lens of what to do in life, by thinking what would make a great story.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:36):\nAnd so he just started to do a a great story, something where you overcome challenges and achieve something you wanted.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:41):\nAnd so that became his life motto.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:43):\n“I'm going to try hard things and overcome them.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:45):\nAnd that's going to be my life.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:47):\nI love it.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:48):\nI'll link to that book in the show notes.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:51):\nFinal question, do you have this series on Twitter that you call Monday Motivations?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:16:56):\nI'm curious what's motivating you these days?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:16:58):\nI find the internet is filled with all these people trying to give fake motivation and make money off that stuff.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:04):\nAnd it's almost like a drug for people to feel, ”Oh my God, there's motivation, I'm going to do well.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:11):\nI just wanted to remind people that all success comes from an extraordinary amount of pain and struggle and hard work, and there is no shortcut to anything material coming in life.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:22):\nAnd so the Monday  motivation post comes as the anti-motivation post because the world is filled with... I believe that the biggest profit making scheme that I've seen in recent times is to tell people to love themselves and they'll pay you money for saying that.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:40):\nAnd I think the best way to love yourself is to keep evolving.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:44):\nSo my motivation comes from evolution, connecting dots, solving harder problems than I've solved in the past.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:17:51):\nAnd I think life is ultimately a game where you want to feel that your levels have changed and your skills have changed constantly.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:17:59):\nKunal, you are wonderful.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:01):\nThank you so much for being here.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):\nTwo final questions.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:03):\nWhere can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this stuff?\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:07):\nAnd how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:09):\nYou can find me on social media.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:10):\nLook for Kunal Shah, you'll find me everywhere.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:13):\nI usually have a different personality on each social media.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:16):\nAnd in terms of being helpful, keep tagging me on interesting things that you discover that gave you that moment of, ”Oh my God, I did not know this.”\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:25):\nI would love that.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:27):\nAmazing.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:28):\nKunal, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKUNAL SHAH (01:18:31):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:32):\nBye everyone.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:32):\n78:34Thank you so much for listening.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:35):\nIf you found this valuable, you can subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:42):\nAlso, please consider giving us a rating or leaving a review as that really helps other listeners find the podcast.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:48):\nYou can find all past episodes or learn more about the show at lennyspodcast.com.\n\nLENNY RACHITSKY (01:18:54):\nSee you in the next episode."

I shouldn't be here,\" or, \"I'm under qualified to be here,\" those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, \"Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?\" And that's a very ambiguous, in my opinion, way to ask this question. A much sharper way is like, \"Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?\" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, \"It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there,\" then it may be worth digging into.\n\nLenny (00:00:51):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Lane Shackleton. Lane is Chief Product Officer at Coda where he's held the role for over eight years. Before that, he was Group Product Manager at YouTube, a Product Specialist at Google, and as you'll hear, he started his career as an Alaskan mountain guide and then as a manual reviewer of Google AdWords ads. Lane is an incredibly deep thinker, very first principles oriented, and has built an incredible product team and culture at Coda. In part, he's done that by studying the principles and rituals of great product leaders and great product teams. In our conversation, Lane shares what he's learned, what he's found great PMs and great teams do differently. He shares a bunch of his favorite rituals and principles, how you can implement them on your own team, plus a really clever and unique way of understanding if you're making progress in your career, plus so much more. I could talk to Lane for hours, but we tried to keep this to under an hour and a half. With that, I bring you Lane Shackleton after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\n\n(00:02:41):\nEppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:03:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth. Thousands of fast-growing companies like Gusto, Calm, Quora and Modern Treasury trust Vanta to help build, scale, manage and demonstrate their security and compliance programs and get ready for audits in weeks, not months.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:04:07):\nSo glad to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:09):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. I've always really admired the way that you write about product, the way you think about product, and it feels like Coda has one of the strongest and also the most thoughtful product teams out there. And so I am really excited to have you on here and learn from what you've learned over the years. My first question is completely unrelated. I have to ask. Your last name's Shackleton. Any relation to a certain very famous Antarctic explorer?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:04:36):\nYeah. It's probably distant at best. I wish it was close. I wish I could claim it was my father or grandfather. But I definitely grew up with those stories and reading a lot about him as a kid. In high school we read Endurance, which is a great book if you haven't read it. It's an amazing story. Very inspiring how he put people first and brought back all of his men from this journey to the South Pole. So have taken a lot of lessons from that, but that's as close as I can come to the greatness of Ernest Shackleton.\n\nLenny (00:05:09):\nOkay. So there's a connection. When I think of Shackleton, I also think of the ad that he ran for recruiting people to join his journey. Low chance of survival, incredibly hard, chance for glory if you succeed, something like that.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:05:23):\nIt's a wonderful ad. I think I had a mug of that when I was a kid. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:28):\nAmazing. Okay. So on that same topic, I noticed maybe your first job was a mountain guide in Alaska. Was that inspired by this legacy? And also why did you decide not to pursue that and get into product management? Completely different life.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:05:42):\nYeah. Yeah. Very, very different. Very different time. Didn't have kids back then. I think I was convinced at the time I wanted a career outside. Just loved spending time in the mountains and climbing, things like that. To be honest, I wasn't the best guide. There were a lot of amazing guides out there that just had ... They were almost invincible in terms of their ability to climb for 20, 30 hours. But I learned a lot from the experience and maybe the quick story on why I stopped guiding. I was on what is a dream trip for mountain guides, which is we were flown to a remote portion of southeast Alaska. It's an hour long flight. Mountain called Mount Fairweather. Beautiful 15,000 foot peak. And as a part of climbing on glaciers one of the things that you do for context is you're roped to another person. And the reason that you do that is because if someone falls in a crevasse, you want to be able to stop them or pull them out.\n\n(00:06:48):\nSo I was roped to a very nice client that I was guiding and he fell pretty close to the top on our way down. And luckily we were able to self-arrest and arrest that fall. But I spent probably the next six hours walking down that mountain thinking the same thing over and over again, which is I really don't want to die roped to someone that I barely know and don't trust or love. So that was the last season that I guided. But tons of great memories and learnings and I think it impacted my life in a pretty significant way.\n\nLenny (00:07:29):\nDamn. Software much lower stakes. I guess just while we're on this topic, is there any parallels or big lesson you learned from that experience that you bring to product?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:07:37):\nOne is just preparation. I think when you go climbing or when you guide climbing, you spend months and months preparing for usually a few days of climbing. So there's that kind of preparation. There's also just a million checklists. So before you go on an expedition, you may check a checklist of all your equipment, stuff like that a dozen times or more. So you ensure redundancy across all your systems. So that was definitely a parallel. The other thing I think about a lot is just how to stay calm in challenging or scary scenarios. We had another instance where I had a client pull a big chunk of rock off and break their feet and I was the junior guide on that particular instance and the more senior guide looked at me, looked at the situation and was like, \"Okay, we're getting this guy out of here right now.\" Put him on his back and we basically took turns carrying him out for a couple miles I'll just never forget instances like that where the clarity of stay calm, assess the situation, prioritize, take action. There's a mini version of that when you're building software, I think. So experiences like that, I think, even though I only did it for a handful of summers, were pretty profound.\n\nLenny (00:09:06):\nYeah. What a very different life that life path would've been.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:09:11):\nPre kids. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:12):\nOh, man. So you mentioned your writing, you mentioned that this is something you want to write about. Shifting to the core topic of our chat, it's very clear that you spent a lot of time studying how great product managers operate and how great product teams operate. You've been doing a bunch of writing on the principles of great product management and also the rituals of great teams. And so I want to spend a bunch of time trying to extract as much as I can from your learning so that listeners can learn. Essentially what are principles of great product managers, what are rituals of great teams and generally how do the best teams operate? And my first question is just why is this something that you started doing? What pulled you into spending so much time and effort trying to understand how the best teams and people operate?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:09:53):\nYeah. Yeah. I've been asking myself that question a little bit lately. There's a few reasons. One reason is I just found myself giving a similar set of advice in one on ones. And so I think anytime you find as a leader yourself repeating the same lessons, it should be a good flag to say like, oh, I should probably scale this in some way. And as you know, as soon as you write something down, you have to clarify your own thinking and so it becomes very useful for that. And I don't think I quite expected how useful it would be in that sense. Writing something down and then putting it out there, you start to get feedback back of where you might've been right or where you might not be right. And so for me it's been a good learning experience there as well. I think the second reason is I've always been pretty frustrated with career ladders. Most companies have career ladders with 10 or 15 levels and as soon as they hit some scale levels, there's levels between levels and I feel like I looked at the one at Google and you needed a PhD to decipher it and interpret how to operate within it.\n\n(00:11:11):\nAnd so that's one piece of the construct. If you think more broadly though, they aren't consistent across companies, so now you're in a situation where you're in your version of the rat race. And so I found that I basically wanted to have a broader set of principles that transcended level. So things that could be true when you are an ICPM starting your career and things that can also be true when you're the head of product or running a product team or things like that. That's one. I won't rant further on that but I think that's one piece of it.\n\n(00:11:49):\nAnd then I think the last reason I'll mention is I was pretty inspired by a talk that is by this guy named Brett Victor, who's like a prototyper thinker. May have heard of his work. He has this talk called Inventing on Principle. And in the early days of Coda, one of our first designers, this guy Jeremy Britten, showed this talk to the company and my mind was blown. And I think it was one of those examples of someone developing a clear view of what principles they should operate with and then following that principle. And it was just a meta example of how important it is and how impactful it can be when you decide on a principle and then follow it. And so ever since then I've been thinking what are my principles as it pertains to building software and other things. So those are the three reasons that led me to start writing these things down.\n\nLenny (00:12:49):\nAmazing. We're going to find that talk and link to it in the show notes. I want to ask about what principles you've come to, but I also want to understand how you actually ended up doing ladders and performance review stuff at Coda. Would it be better to talk about that later after we go through some of these things or is there something you want to share first of just how you think about it at Coda?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:13:06):\nWhen we were doing career ladders, first of all, we put it off for quite a bit of time and that was based on the advice of a lot of other leaders that said as soon as you introduce this, then the incentives flip from being company focused to being individual focused. So I think we delayed it for a good bit of time. There came a time where we decided, \"Hey look, we really do need to provide better guidance here about what it means to grow and what it means to be great.\" And so about the same time we were doing the levels thing I started writing down some of the principles that I've been publishing. One of the things that I think about a lot when talking about levels is just how to keep everyone oriented toward their team and their company. And I think that we've done a really good job of that over the years. So levels aren't by any means at the forefront of any company discussion. In fact, we don't use titles that much.\n\nLenny (00:14:11):\nYou said that it's not specific to role. Do you mean the same leveling attributes are the same from design and product and engineering?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:14:19):\nWe basically have five levels and we call them role stages and they go from apprentice to principal. So apprentice is ... Rope analogy here is learns about rope. Practitioner is can tie basic knots, shown complex knots. Given a problem, they can do it. Career is you can calculate rope strength. You know a lot about knots. Principal is basically invented nylon. So the bar is really, really high for principal in these levels and I think that that's appropriate. It should be aspirational that the bar is exceptionally high at the highest level of our role stages. I find it's a pretty good process to draw maybe a little bit of contrast with other companies. I think most other companies, especially large companies have 10 to 15 levels. I think we've made a really conscious choice to have only five. I think the other bit of contrast I would draw is basically role stages are not visible across the whole company. We're not showing levels of any individual PM or designer, and that's partially because we just don't want to put a big focus on it. And then probably the biggest difference is we have a centralized compensation committee and that's who decides compensation and so it's not the manager that drives your compensation. So those are some differences.\n\nLenny (00:15:52):\nSuper cool. I've never seen it done this way before. I think it's an awesome example of first principles thinking, which I see a lot come out from your product team. And then just to make sure I heard you right, these five stages are roughly the same across role, so designers have the same five and they're described similarly.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:16:08):\nThat's right. They're described similarly at a high level, but then the specifics if you get into it are a little bit different.\n\nLenny (00:16:15):\nOkay. I'm going to ask about what the principles are, or a few of them that you can share. But one other very tactical question. At what size of product teams, say just PMs, did you start to develop this framework?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:16:26):\nWe were probably at 20-ish PMs and designers when we did that.\n\nLenny (00:16:31):\nAwesome. Okay. So let me just ask, what are some of these principles you've narrowed it on as principles of great product managers?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:16:38):\nMaybe it's helpful to start with a little higher level context on the unifying thesis. I think the unifying thesis is the core job of a product person in general is to turn ambiguity into clarity. And if you think about the job of a product leader or a product manager, everything is ambiguous all the time. It's like what's my role on this team? What problem are we solving? Who's the target customer? What prototype is going to solve this particular problem? So it's literally everything. And so if you're going to do the job well, you really need to get good at spotting ambiguity and turning it into clarity. And so the obvious question that follows from that is okay, great, that sounds like a great Hallmark card, but how do you actually do that? And so I think the principles that I've been writing down are very personal. They're my take on how to do this.\n\n(00:17:41):\nSo the first one that I wrote about was systems not goals. And one of the ways that I started this post ... I'm a big fan of getting inspiration from outside of tech and so one of the stories that I tell is basically the story of Jerry Seinfeld. If you haven't seen the documentary Comedian, it's amazing, it's definitely worth watching. But the story goes, he's done Seinfeld the show and he's got all this material from the last 15 years and he comes in one day and he says, \"Look, I'm going to throw away all my material and I'm going to start fresh.\" And this is unheard of in comedy for someone to just throw away all their old material and start fresh. And so the question is what does he do next? And the thing that he does is he sets a goal, which is basically to build up to an hour of material again.\n\n(00:18:34):\nBut the goal isn't that important. What's important here is the system. So the system that he uses is he writes for an hour every morning, doesn't write for more if he doesn't want to, and then he goes and performs at night. And so when you rinse and repeat that system, do it hundreds of times, that's how he builds up from five minutes to 15 minutes to 30 minutes of material. And so I think that I take a lot of inspiration from that and I think product people can generally, which is instead of being obsessed with the goal, be obsessed with the system that gets you there. And so the phrase I sometimes use is goals with good intentions don't work. I really need to give a common example. A really common example is teams that are trying to learn about customers or do research. And one thing I've observed is a team may have a goal like an OKR of talking to 10 customers this quarter and they may or may not hit that OKR. And then if you watch closely, the next quarter, they may not have a goal of talking to customers anymore. And so their learning is going up and down.\n\n(00:19:49):\nAnd to draw a contrast, that's just really different than a team that has some default on system for talking to customers. Every few times a week they're talking to customers for whatever reason. And the impact of that is really hard to see until you understand that the latter team tends to have really good product instincts or really good customer instincts. It's because they've just had this default on mindset of talking to customers. And in the early days of Coda, we actually did something similar. We had a time allotted on Fridays and it was basically, it was on the calendar a customer or a potential customer was coming in and so you knew that it was going to happen and you had to have something to show. And so sometimes we'd be scrambling the three hours before to have a prototype ready for a customer. Sometimes we would've had something that we've been baking for a while. But the point is that it was default on. And so the way that we developed good customer instincts was not the goal, it was really just the system behind it. So that's one that I'm passionate about and I think it also translates into a lot of the rituals that we talk a lot about.\n\nLenny (00:21:06):\nThere's so many directions I can go with this. I really like this one. It reminds me of something I did at Airbnb where we had a lunch with a host every Friday with the team and we had a community person find someone in San Francisco that's a host. And there's no agenda, it's just let's have lunch and meet the team. Curious what you're wondering.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:22):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:21:22):\nAnd Airbnb hosts are always so nice and has such a pleasant experience. Also makes me think about this book, The Score Takes Care of Itself.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:30):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:21:31):\nHave you read that?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:21:31):\nWhere it's just do the fundamentals and you'll win?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:34):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:21:34):\nThe other thing it reminds me of is I have this quote hanging in my office here. I Believe it's from the Rick Rubin book. And the quote is, \"The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.\"\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:48):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:21:49):\nI feel like you just changed art-\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:51):\nYeah. Rick Rubin's amazing.\n\nLenny (00:21:52):\nOh my god, it's so good. Just every section is this quotable thing I want ... I need to hold onto this thing.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:21:58):\nYeah. He's got a great thing on listening. I really admire what he says about listening and I think that a lot of PMs could take that lesson, which is-\n\nLenny (00:22:10):\nYeah. What is that lesson?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:22:11):\nThe way he talks about it is essentially you want to listen and absorb every fragment of what that person is saying, including their body language and everything else, and try to turn off the side which is crafting your response or figuring out what you're going to say next or what the problem with their argument is or whatever. It's quite hard to do. Because your default mode is always the next step of the conversation. But I think if you can really challenge yourself, like he says, to pause and really try to internalize holistically what that person's saying, it's pretty powerful.\n\nLenny (00:22:55):\nI was actually just reading that chapter and the next chapter is about this idea of the beginner's mind. I don't know if you remember that. I feel like people get sniped by Rick Rubin stuff. But anyway, I'm going to go down this thread. He talks about how AlphaZero or AlphaGo, the first AI thing that beat humans at Go and how there was this move it made, move 37 in the game that was just like ... The person the AI was playing walked out of the room. He's like, \"I don't even know what just happened. This is out of anything I've ever imagined.\" And it won. And the lesson there it was trained not on what we've learned, but it trained itself and figured things out from first principles and then came up with this thing we've never even comprehended. And so it's a really good example of the power of coming from a beginner's mind and not being influenced by what's already been done.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:23:41):\nYeah. We have a walkthrough ritual that we do.\n\nLenny (00:23:45):\nTell me more.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:23:46):\nThe prompt is essentially put yourself in the shoes of someone who knows nothing about this topic whatsoever and have beginner's mind and then walk through with five or 10 people watching you and let's fix all the problems that we see.\n\nLenny (00:24:05):\nOkay. I want to talk about rituals. We're getting ahead of ourselves a little bit. Is there any other principles that you can share either just on a high level or in depth that you've come across? And I know people can go to your Substack and read this. And by the way, what's your Substack URL for people that want to check it out?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:24:21):\nJust lane.substack.com.\n\nLenny (00:24:24):\nSweet. We'll definitely link into it. Yeah. Any other principles?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:24:28):\nI think the other one is cathedrals, not bricks, and then the other one is proactive, not reactive. Cathedrals, not bricks I think is a classic one. I think I had a moment of realization and talking to Shishir in a one-on-one when I was at YouTube bemoaning the fact that my team wasn't performing to the potential that I thought they had. And he had a very pointed and unexpected question, which is like, \"Do they know their cathedral? Do they have a cathedral?\" And I'm sitting there like, \"Man, what are you talking about? We're talking about performing as a team and you're asking me about cathedrals.\" And then he explained the cathedral story, which I can talk about. In that-\n\nLenny (00:25:11):\nWhat's the cathedral story?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:25:11):\nIt was quite clarifying.\n\nLenny (00:25:13):\nYeah. Do share.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:25:14):\nYeah. The cathedral story is basically you walk up to three people, they're laying bricks. You ask the first person, \"What are you doing?\" They say, \"Well, I take the bricks from over here and I put them on that sack over there.\" You ask the second person, \"What are you doing?\" They say, \"Well, I take this little cement and I put it on top of the brick that that person lays.\" You ask the third person, \"What are you doing?\" And they say, \"Well, we're building a cathedral.\" And the core insight here is that you want your teams to feel like they're building a cathedral and not laying bricks. And I think it's really, really easy to do when PMs are really busy on a day-to-day to just be one task after the other, really execution oriented and maybe not take the time to help the team take a broader frame, open the aperture a little bit and have a view of what the cathedral is. And I think we've learned many times that one unexpected bit of this is that everybody needs to see a different facet of the cathedral.\n\n(00:26:22):\nSo very often ... And I've made this mistake before plenty of times. Very often people will do a great writeup on vision or strategy or whatever it is and the result is people can't quite see their version of what this broader arc is or this broader cathedral is. And so one of the things that we have tried to do when we go through big planning cycles is show all the different sides of this. So instead of just having a writeup, we may have a writeup, we may couple that with a metric, we may couple that with directional mocks and what the billboard might look like or how our homepage may change. And really what we're trying to do is take the mystery out of the set of broader constraints or where we're headed. I think great product teams and great PM leaders tend to always orient their teams towards a broader cathedral as opposed to laying bricks.\n\nLenny (00:27:26):\nSuch a beautiful metaphor. Reminds me of this other quote I just looked up while you're chatting. \"If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work and give orders. Instead teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.\"\n\nLane Shackleton (00:27:39):\nClassic. Classic. It's Antoine.\n\nLenny (00:27:42):\nThat is right. Antoine de St. Exupery. Okay. Something I was curious about as you were chatting also is for folks that want to develop their own principles and define how they want to think about products, is there anything you found to be useful in helping emerge these into principles that you can come to? Is it just sitting around thinking? Is there anything else you've done that has helped you define these things?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:28:06):\nProbably two things. One is reading really broadly. So I think not just reading PM style literature. Like I said, I tend to get a lot of inspiration from outside of tech. I think that's one thing. I think the other thing is insofar as you get the opportunity to mentor other people, think about what you're saying to these people. Think about, okay, this person came to me with this challenge. What was my response? Why was that my response? Am I giving that response a lot of times? Okay, maybe this is a more deeply held belief. So I think noticing those instances was helpful for me.\n\nLenny (00:28:46):\nAre there any books or topics or areas that you found most inspirational when you talk about reading and studying other non-product tech?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:28:53):\nI mean definitely sports. I would say sports is really interesting to me. Team sports. I've always been a huge fan of everything team sports. Storytelling. Go look at some of the best storytellers in the world and they're actually out there on a stage telling stories. There's a book called Storyworthy that I really like.\n\nLenny (00:29:15):\nI was just going to mention that. That book is so good. Somebody mentioned this on the podcast and I read it. It's the most useful practical book for how to tell stories.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:29:23):\nIt's so good. The insight is amazing. Just in case your listeners are interested, the insight is basically the nugget of a great story is five seconds of transformation. So if you just orient everything else around that moment of transformation, then you end up usually telling a reasonably good story. I had a conversation with the author right after I read that book because I was just totally enamored with it. And then we ended up bringing him into Coda and he gave a great talk. So yeah, big plug for Matthew Dicks.\n\nLenny (00:29:58):\nThe other thing that stuck with me also from that same ... We're just going on all kinds of tangents. From that same insight is, and I watch movies completely differently now, where basically the characters you meet at the beginning of the story, they're going to be completely opposite at the end of the story because of this transformation that takes place. So I'm watching movies with my wife now, I'm like, \"Okay, she's very shy right now. She's going to be very extroverted by the end of this movie.\" Or, \"They love each other. Oh, they're going to have a lot of problems.\" That's so interesting. Oh, that's such a good idea. Okay, I'm going to get this guy on hopefully. And he's a Moth champion basically.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:30:30):\nYeah. I would say as maybe a principal version of this, the way that you learn or the way that everyone including me learns new things is you go seek out the best at that given craft. So in this case, you go to the Moth StorySLAM you see some really good stories. If you ever watch these on YouTube. And then you just unpack what they're doing and how they're doing it. And then obviously I think the other way to learn quickly is to throw yourself in the deep end. So insofar as you can put yourself in situations that are uncomfortable or force you to do things like tell a story or force you to come up with a clear strategy, you should always opt into those, especially early in your career.\n\nLenny (00:31:18):\nThe first thing you said, that's basically the whole premise of this podcast. Find the best at all these things and learn from them, extract and share.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:31:24):\nAnd the world is much better for it. This podcast is an amazing resource.\n\nLenny (00:31:29):\nThanks man.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:31:29):\nYou've done something very special.\n\nLenny (00:31:31):\nI appreciate it. This podcast episode is already very special. The point you just made reminds me of something that I heard you talk about, which is this oh shit moment. I don't know if it's related to what you shared of just giving people a sense of whether they're making progress in their career. Can you talk about that?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:31:49):\nSure. Yeah. I think I picked this up originally from Seth Godin, the author, and it just totally stuck with me. The basic thesis is that moments that stretch you or moments that you feel uncomfortable in or you find yourself saying, \"Oh shit, I shouldn't be here,\" or, \"I'm under qualified to be here,\" those are the moments you should be seeking out. Those are the moments that stretch you and give you a new foundation. And so I have found that they turn out to be a pretty good way to calibrate whether someone is growing in their career. So oftentimes you'll hear a career question like, \"Hey, do you feel like you're growing in your role?\" And that's a very ambiguous in my opinion way to ask this question. And a much sharper way is like, \"Hey, how many, oh shit moments have you had in the last six months, year, two years, and what are they?\" I think if you ask yourself that question and the answer is, \"It's been a really long time since I've been stretched in some meaningful way or I've felt like I'm under qualified to be there,\" then it may be worth digging into.\n\nLenny (00:33:04):\nThat is so good. Making me think about this podcast where I never wanted to do podcasts. I'm like I'm not a podcast person. I just want to sit there and type out newsletters. How cool is that? And I'm like, no, I got to do it because it's hard. And I'm glad I did it. It also reminds me of this quote that I love that I always think back to. \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\"\n\nLane Shackleton (00:33:26):\nNice. That reminds me of ... Have you read the book The Obstacle is the Way?\n\nLenny (00:33:31):\nNo. Say More.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:33:33):\nIt's a great book by Ryan Holiday. And the core thesis is ... It's a bit about stoicism. But the core idea is essentially instead of running away from obstacles, you should be running toward them and that's where you experience either the most growth or the most profound moments of your life. He gives a lot of examples in that book of people throughout history who made that choice. And I think he's also given that talk to hundreds of sports teams. It's a good book. Worth reading.\n\nLenny (00:34:08):\nIt's so hard. It's so hard to do hard things, man. So we've been talking about principles of great product managers. You also spent a lot of time looking at the rituals of great product teams. And I know you're working on this handbook that I'm excited to learn more about. Can you just talk about ... I guess one, where this idea came from of studying rituals of great teams and also just how do you actually go about learning about these rituals? I know you have this really interesting process.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:34:31):\nYeah. In general, I'm a big believer in good design and good product starts with noticing. Tony Fadell has a great talk on this. So I think a bunch of us that are really obsessed with rituals, we just honestly try to be great at noticing. So see something happening with a customer, ask a few questions, get introduced to their team, hear about something interesting from a non-customer, ask for an intro, end up just probing and asking a lot of questions. And then in many cases nowadays with Coda, we're building new rituals alongside people. So someone has a creative idea about how to implement something and we're like partners or collaborators with them on that, which is honestly incredibly fun to just see people's creativity expressed in a tool and then by extension the social construct that they exist in. So that's a little bit about how we got started in that whole process. And then of course Shishir is writing a book called Rituals of Great Teams so we've been cataloging those. We've been hosting a bunch of rituals dinners where we basically get people together for a dinner and we usually have three or four presenters at those dinners. It's just a great chance to learn and think about how the engine runs in a lot of these companies.\n\nLenny (00:36:03):\nWhat are some rituals that you've learned from these dinners and these and this research you've done that have really stuck with you?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:36:10):\nThere are so many. It's hard to choose. Maybe I'll choose two that are top of mind. One is Dharmesh Shah has this ritual from HubSpot called flash tags. Have you heard of this?\n\nLenny (00:36:24):\nNo.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:36:27):\nWe've all probably been in the situation where someone gives you feedback and you either under interpret it or over interpret it. And as an organization, I think the core principle here is like you want to be calibrated on how much to pay attention to a bit of feedback. And so he outlines four flash tags. He presented this in one of our dinners. And I absolutely love the phrasing of these as someone who's given a lot of feedback on product stuff in their career. So it ranges from ... I think it's FYI, suggestion, recommendation, plea. So FYI is basically like I had a thought, take it or leave it kind of thing. Suggestion is ... And he uses this hill dying metaphor. So is this a hill I'm going to die on? And FYI is there's no hill in sight. Suggestion is there's a hill. I'm not going to die on it but this is what I would do if I were you. You can take it or leave it. Recommendation is I'm climbing the hill. I'm not going to die here, but I've thought about this a lot, so don't ignore this.\n\n(00:37:41):\nAnd then the fourth one, plea, is hopefully rarely used in the organization. It's like, I don't like dying on hills. That's not what we do here. But this is a pretty good candidate for it. You should really trust me. And so we have ended up using that. I was actually just at an offsite and someone gave a lightning talk to our team on how valuable this has been just to calibrate, hey, we got 100 pieces of feedback and there's one plea. Okay, let's spend our time on that. Or there's a whole bunch of FYIs. I think we're fine. Let's keep going. No worries.\n\nLenny (00:38:20):\nThat's amazing. It's interesting none of them are just do it this way. I imagine that's very intentional.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:38:25):\nYeah. Honestly it's a sign of ... In Dharmesh's case, I don't know him super well, but it's a sign of a really experienced leader to know that scale. But every time I look at the scale and I'm weighing where I am between suggestion or recommendation, I have to giggle to myself.\n\nLenny (00:38:45):\nAnd how do you actually use it? In the feedback you put a hashtag plea kind of thing?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:38:51):\nThe way gets used in code docs and the way I think other companies have made it a ritual is you'll have a feedback table and you'll write your feedback and then there'll just be a little select list and you can select between those four. And usually what people do is they include the description so you can as you're choosing it, think do I really feel that strongly about this? And honestly, it's good hygiene. Otherwise, every bit of feedback is taken the same. Which just fundamentally the impact of that is it slows everything down because now you're looking at a list of 100 pieces of feedback and you're going like, \"Oh man, we got to address all this feedback.\" Whereas as soon as you distinguish between what's most important, it's much easier to sort through that.\n\nLenny (00:39:46):\nWhat about if it's in person? Do you say this is a plea or this is a FYI?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:39:50):\nOh, I've definitely heard that in many meetings. Are you making a recommendation or are you making a plea?\n\nLenny (00:39:57):\nAmazing.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:39:58):\nAnd making the person think through that choice I think is just a very helpful shared language.\n\nLenny (00:40:04):\nI imagine one of the other benefits of this is I think most leaders that rise up the ranks eventually realize anything they say in a meeting is going to be taken really seriously and the team's going to rush back and be like, \"Oh, Lane told us to change this thing.\" I imagine it helps you just make it clear. No, you don't need to actually change this. It's just my thoughts.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:40:21):\nYeah. Exactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:40:22):\nAwesome. This episode is brought to you by Ezra, the leading full body cancer screening company. I actually used Ezra earlier this year unrelated to this podcast, completely on my own dime because my wife did one and loved it and I was super curious to see if there's anything that I should be paying attention to in my body as I get older. The way it works is you book an appointment, you come in, you put on some very cool silky pajamas that they give you that you get to keep afterwards. You go into an MRI machine for 30 to 45 minutes, and then about a week later you get this detailed report sharing what they found in your body. Luckily, I had what they called an unremarkable screening, which means they didn't find anything cancerous, but they did find some issues in my back, which I'm getting checked out at a physical next month. Probably because I spend so much time sitting in front of a computer. Half of all men will have cancer at some point in their lives, as will one third of women. Half of all of them will detect it late.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAccording to the American Cancer Society, early cancer detection has an 80% survival rate compared to less than 20% for late stage cancer. The Ezra team has helped 13% of their customers identify potential cancer early, and 50% of them identify other clinically significant issues such as aneurysms, disc herniations, which may be what I have, or fatty liver disease. Ezra scans for cancer and 500 other conditions in 13 organs using a full body MRI powered by AI and just launched the world's only 30-minute full body scan, which is also their most affordable. Their scans are non-invasive and radiation free. And Ezra is offering listeners $150 off their first scan with code Lenny150. Book your scan at ezra.com/lenny at E-Z-R-A.com/lenny.\n\n(00:42:15):\nAny other rituals that stand out as really interesting, either more recently you've learned or something you're just like, oh, wow, that was a genius?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:42:21):\nI guess one that I get asked about a lot on our team is called Catalyst. And I guess maybe to set some context on this one, in most product teams, the review forum is just a really important part of the product development process. And the core insight for most review forums or product reviews or decision forums is that they generally suffer from two problems that are hard to spot unless you've sat through hundreds of them. The first is they have standing attendees, and the second is they're normally single-threaded, meaning they're normally one topic at a time. So maybe I'll talk about both of those because I think they're not exactly intuitive. So when you think about what happens with a standing set of attendees, you either have the situation where you have too many people in the meeting or you have not enough people in the meeting, and both of those can cause problems.\n\n(00:43:25):\nSo if you've ever been in a meeting, I certainly have, where it's like, \"Hey, do we have the salesperson who knows most about this or do we have the engineer who's actually implementing this here? Oh, great. They're not here? They're not a part of the standing set of attendees?\" You either have to reschedule the meeting or worse, you just do the discussion without the person who's most knowledgeable, which seems crazy in retrospect. The second problem is single-threaded. So one topic at a time. So if you think about if a product development process is somewhat of a chaotic assembly line for a second, your review or your decision forum ends up being a big time bottleneck in many cases. And obviously you want to be in a situation where product people have a lot of autonomy and they can make most of the decisions themselves. And I'm a big believer in decentralized leadership and all of that, but there are things that cut across the company that need to get reviewed by a broader set of stakeholders.\n\n(00:44:29):\nAnd so what happens when those things are single threaded is either the meeting is really long, so it's a three-hour review meeting once a week, and by the end everyone is about to fall asleep, or it's really short and it's really hard to get on the calendar. You're like, \"Oh, can we get on the calendar in two weeks?\" And the downside of the not being able to get on the calendar is that now you've just slowed down the whole velocity of the company because the throughput of your review meeting is really slow. So we built Catalyst to really solve those two problems. And so the way it works is it's essentially three one hour blocks throughout the week, and the assumption is that the whole company is free. So you can get anyone in the company for those three hours. And each topic has essentially four roles. Driver, maker, braintrust, and interested. It's a very transparent system.\n\n(00:45:28):\nSo a salesperson can say, \"Oh, I'm interested in this product development review. I'm just going to mark myself as interested.\" And then the driver is the person who's actually going to drive the meeting, drive the decision, drive the outcome, things like that. And basically, this is all centralized in one doc. And what happens is the day before, that hold that's on calendar gets removed, and then you have specific topics that get added. So there may be three topics going all at the same time because they don't have overlapping attendees. And the impact of this, I think if you really watch it in progress is huge. You basically have many topics running all at the same time, so the throughput is much better and you have the right attendees every single time, and you have a clear set of drivers and roles in these meetings. So that means that we can review work much, much faster with the right people, and ideally that results in more value to our customers, more things getting shipped, just a higher velocity organization. So that's one that we get asked about a lot. And actually a couple of weeks ago, we spent a while remaking the template for that one.\n\nLenny (00:46:45):\nI love that ritual. You actually wrote even in more depth in the post that we worked together on how Coda builds product, which we'll link to if folks want to try this out and you link to actual templates people can actually use it their companies. When someone's listening to this and they're like, \"Oh, wow, this is extremely cool,\" how easy is it do you find for people to take a ritual from a company and implement it? How much is cultural and it's hard to transplant, or do you find people can take this Catalyst idea plug and play at a lot of companies?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:47:15):\nYeah. I think it depends a lot on what your role in the company is. Maybe to say the extremes for a second, if you're a brand new PM to an organization, you probably shouldn't go try to remake the whole product review cycle that the head of product is really passionate about and has crafted. But you can probably take a decision template or some interesting ritual that has facilitated a team in the past and use it with your team. Another one of my favorites there is a hundred dollar voting. We use that a lot in the context of planning, and I find that creative rituals like that are easy to pick up for teams because oftentimes it's like, okay ... And maybe I'll describe the ritual real quick.\n\nLenny (00:48:01):\nYeah. I was going to ask.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:48:02):\nThe ritual is essentially you can take any set of problems or solutions or themes or whatever you want to get people's input on, and you put those into a table and then people can basically vote with their dollars and usually you allocate $100. And so people will go through and say, \"Oh, I want to allocate $10 to this and $20 to this and $50 to this because I think it's really important.\" And I have found that especially in planning processes, little rituals like this are great at getting the elephant in the room out. So it's like, \"Oh wow, we have a huge spread on this one particular problem. You think it's a huge problem. I don't think it's a problem at all. Let's talk about it.\" Going back to the thesis of turning ambiguity into clarity, a lot of this is like we're trying to get the ambiguous stuff out there so that we can make it more clear.\n\n(00:49:03):\nAnd so I use that as an example because you can be a brand new PM, run a brainstorm, run a planning session like that, and you're probably going to get great feedback. People are probably going to go, \"This is cool. I've never done this before.\" Now to go to the other side of the spectrum, we help a lot of companies that want to remake a whole process. They want to remake a review system like Catalyst or they want to remake their decision rituals. And so in that sense, we're usually talking to a head of product or director of product or VP of product and someone who tends to have a lot more agency over the way that the team works.\n\nLenny (00:49:48):\nCoda is interesting in that it feels like you have pretty stable processes for planning and reviews. I find most companies just every six months rethink a lot of these things. I guess that's probably a sign that you found something that's really good and works and you don't have to redo it. How much are you radically changing the way you operate versus working in similar ways? How do you think about that percentage wise?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:50:11):\nPeople are always coming up with new creative ways to make their teams run better, make decisions go smoother. And we're continuously adopting those, but there's definitely a backbone of the system. The backbone of the system is Catalyst and tag-ups and the concept called Bullpen. And then there'll be a lot of iteration on top of that. And even those systems went through a lot of iteration. I talked about how the calendar hold got removed and then individual topics got added. That took us launching automations and the ability to add things to calendar in order for that whole process to really work. So in the years prior to us launching that, we did it very manually. So I think there's still a lot of creativity that I see every day.\n\n(00:51:06):\nSo I'll give one quick example. One of our PM leads on core product, this guy Nathan, he basically saw that a lot of decisions had a lot of different stakeholders because he's in the core product. And now he's leading the core product team so he's trying to figure out what guidance do I give to each of these PMs on who to involve in these decisions? Because every one of these with core product feels like they impact everybody. And so a very simple thing that he did probably in the last six months was he had a table of all the upcoming decisions and then at a tag-up ... Which I can explain if you want. But basically with a small set of stakeholders, he had all the upcoming decisions and then he let people hit a little reaction and say, \"Oh, I don't need to be involved. Just notify me of the decision after.\" Or, \"Hey, I have some opinions, but you can keep going.\" Or, \"No, I really want to be heavily involved in this decision.\"\n\n(00:52:10):\nAnd it was such a pro move. It was such a, I've been through a million of these. I don't want to treat every one of them the same because if I do, it's going to slow down the velocity of this whole organization. And so instead, the majority of those, Shishir or I or Oliver, the head of engineering will say, \"I may have some opinions, but keep going.\" That's often the default. And then there are plenty where we say, \"Just notify us of the decision after.\" And in doing that, Nathan can now give better guidance to the PMs on his team and say, \"Hey, you don't really need to involve as wide a group as you think, so just keep going and check in later.\" So I think those types of little iterations are usually based on a really good insight.\n\nLenny (00:53:02):\nIt sounds like a dream come true for a platform team to reduce how many people have to be involved in all your planning and decision making. And that process in which you call it tag-up, maybe just briefly explain it and then I want to talk about this handbook you're working on, which is going to I think, cover a lot of these things.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:53:17):\nTag-up is based on this insight that a lot of work and project work tends to get discussed in one-on-ones. And actually it's really an anti-pattern. It's a pattern you should try to avoid. So if you're talking to your manager about product work, what's not happening in that moment is your eng lead and your design lead, they're not hearing that. And so you end up with this big game of telephone where you'll have a conversation with your manager in a one-on-one, they'll go back and translate to their engineering and design lead, and of course the fidelity of the game of telephone, something is lost in all of those transmissions. And so the core idea is have a group one-on-one with the key stakeholders. And so we have this concept of braintrust that's modeled off after Pixar's braintrust.\n\n(00:54:11):\nAnd so we'll have a tag-up with a small set of people from a given team, or sometimes we have larger groups, and then they meet with their braintrust and it's once a week. It's the same mindset of a one-on-one. It's their time. So anything that they need to unblock a decision or to make progress, they should use that time for. And they often start by reviewing OKRs and metrics and things like that. But then we generally get into a table of topics. Anyone can add a topic. Those topics are up voted, so people will react and then the table will sort itself. And then we'll say, \"Okay, this is clearly the topic on people's mind.\" And that's a version of what we call Dory, which I can talk about. But essentially the principle is you should discuss that project work with the whole group there. With the whole triad there. And oftentimes with the sales person there and with the marketer there and with everybody else. So I found that that is just a really good practice to try to move a lot of that work out of one-on-ones and into a small group setting.\n\nLenny (00:55:26):\nAwesome. Okay. So you're working on a handbook that's collecting a lot of these rituals. Talk about that and then when can people maybe look for it?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:55:36):\nOne of the realizations I had the other day, probably a month or two ago when we started working on this thing, was I was talking to someone about Catalyst and a couple other concepts, and they were like, \"I get it. I'm sold. I want to implement some of these things. Where do I look?\" And so I found myself sending them a bunch of links to individual templates. So that cued us into the fact that we needed to have a better core handbook for teams that wanted to adopt some of these rituals and also learn from all the rituals that we have learned from and feel very fortunate to have partnered with so many customers on. And so what we did was started writing this handbook, and it's going to come out hopefully by the time this recording is done. And in it, we'll talk about everything from rituals like Catalyst to decision rituals to a lot of planning and strategy and roadmaps, that kind of stuff. And trying to pull out the most interesting patterns and also give people a pretty practical view of how to implement these things. I think that's what has been lacking sometimes.\n\nLenny (00:56:50):\nAmazing. We'll definitely link to that. Hopefully it's live by the time goes out. We'll make it happen. I know also you said Shishir's working on a book that's related and basically rituals of great teams and Shishir was on the podcast and he talked about Dory, so we don't have to get into that. If people want to learn about Dory, they can watch that episode. It was one of the earliest episodes actually. One of the most popular.\n\nLane Shackleton (00:57:09):\nYeah. I remember that.\n\nLenny (00:57:11):\nOkay. Cool. I have a bunch of random questions now. I'm just going to go in a few different directions. One is, you wrote this post that you call Learn by Making, Not Talking. Is that another principle by the way? Is that amongst your many principles?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:57:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:57:24):\nOkay. Awesome. So in that post, which we'll link to, you share this story of how you and the YouTube team came up with skippable ads, which I didn't realize it was such a controversial ... But in thinking about it, obviously letting people skip ads, I could see why people were not excited about that. Could you just tell that story? And basically it's like the story of how skippable ads on YouTube came about?\n\nLane Shackleton (00:57:46):\nYeah. So I moved over to YouTube shortly after the acquisition. It was an amazing tight-knit team. It definitely felt like the Wild West. We were getting sued by Viacom for a billion dollars when that was a lot of money. No advertiser wanted to talk to us. It was essentially viewed as a site of cat videos and dogs on skateboards and things like that. And then I guess the other context, the sales team was very nascent and all they wanted to sell was the homepage and for good reason. That was where you made your money as a salesperson. And so I had just been sponsored by Salar and Shishir to become a PM. It's a longer story that I'll leave out for now and we can go into. But on day one of being a PM, Shishir's like, \"Great. You're the new guy. You get the project that nobody else wants and that's called skippable ads. And we've got this crazy idea that we can align the incentives of advertisers and viewers and creatives in this really clever way by putting a skip button on the ad and then charging people per views.\" And the latter part we hadn't quite cemented yet, but it was part of the core idea.\n\n(00:59:04):\nAnd so the thing I write about in this post is as a new PM, this feels like a really consequential decision. It's like we've got this new product idea. Nobody really wants it. Advertisers don't want it. The sales team doesn't want it. And it's a very unproven thesis. And so the thing I write about is these are the types of things that you can debate for months or years. And I was sitting in a one-on-one with this guy named Phil Farhi who's an amazing product leader and was my boss at the time. And we're trying to figure out what to do and how to handle all the different dynamics. And he just stops and he's like, \"You know what? Just test the extremes. Start the experiment tomorrow. We'll figure it out.\" Essentially.\n\n(00:59:49):\nAnd I think his point was like, look, we can debate this forever. So I would rather us see the upper and lower bounds of how good this could be or how bad this is going to be immediately. And so we launched a set of experiments. This guy Jamie Kerns who's still there. Tiny little skip button on one experiment, giant skip button that covered the entire player on the other side of the experiment. And within a few weeks, I think we had developed some conviction based on some very directional data that we were onto something. And so the lesson that I took, this is many years ago and I've seen this proven out hundreds of times since, is stop talking about it and go make something. Go run an experiment. Go make a prototype, go write a doc, go make a mock. Just don't talk about it.\n\n(01:00:49):\nAnd I found that also as a leader, people really follow that concept. And I also found that it transcends level. I am not talking just to ICPMs. I'm talking to heads of product and CPOs and CEOs to some degree. You should always be out there trying to learn by expressing your ideas and putting them out there. And that's much more valuable in many cases than pontificating about it or having endless circular discussions on it.\n\nLenny (01:01:23):\nIt makes me think a little bit about Twitter where they spent years just thinking about the edit button or all these different changes. They're so scared, they did so much research and then now they're changing things left and right. Everything's fine. Everyone's still using it. It shows you that you don't have to be so delicate.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:01:39):\nYes. It's almost never as bad as you think it's going to be. So yeah, it's just a question of how much better it can be oftentimes.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\nYou mentioned in your early career ... We talked about your Alaska guide phase. Something else I saw is that you were on the AdWords approval team. You basically were reviewing ads people submitted to run on AdWords and that's how you started in tech. So I guess first of all, is that true? And then second of all, how did you graduate from that phase and become this Chief Product Officer of one of the fastest growing, most interesting companies in the world?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:02:13):\nThat was a really memorable time. There's an amazing cohort of people that started in tech. I think there was 200 or 300 of us at that time and then eventually thousands that started in Sheryl Sandberg's organization. I guess maybe some quick context. Before running ads on google.com at that time, you had to have them manually approved by a human before that was handled by machine learning and outsourced to other countries. And so there was this process where basically an ad would show up on your screen, you would mark it family safe, non-family safe, porn. And then based on that, it would either run or it wouldn't. And actually, funny enough, some of my most successful friends were terrible at the approval event. They failed the rote task of approving ads. They just couldn't handle it and they went on to be really, really successful.\n\n(01:03:08):\nSo after working on ad approvals, at that time, I moved to chat support. It was basically when AdWords was launching chat support. I remember very fondly having two chats, chatting with two advertisers at once. Moved on to phone support. That was eight hours a day of talking to AdWords customers. Really a total rollercoaster ride. It was basically one minute you would pick up the phone and it would be someone from a Fortune 100 company trying to spend millions of dollars on AdWords and then the next minute you would be on the phone with a psychic or a taxi driver that was warring with their compatriots over some really specific keyword. I think there were two lessons that I would draw from this. One is I had a mentor at the time and his advice when I was starting my career was basically you have to get customer facing from the very beginning because you're going to end up serving a customer your whole career. Even when you're the CEO of a company, you're going to be serving a customer. So you better get really good at being in any customer scenario and being able to handle it. And so I think that that turned out to be insanely good advice. And if I think about a piece of advice that I give out to people who are early in their career, I've definitely recycled that advice.\n\n(01:04:29):\nI think the other thing that I took away from that experience was it's just a great lesson in when people don't actually care about your product. So in AdWord's case, people did not care about AdWords. You were the expert on it and you're trying to tell them about ad groups and how this ad format works and blah, blah. And most of the time people are like, \"Dude, I'm a small business owner. I'm trying to get people to come to my auto mechanic store.\" Or, \"I'm trying to get people to come to my taxi service,\" or whatever it was. I don't care. Basically the product had to get out of the way and really just drive impact for the customer. It was like they just want more phone calls or they want more people in the store. So those are I think two pieces that I think about from those days still.\n\n(01:05:21):\nAnd then I worked in a variety of other roles. I worked in a role called product specialist, which is an awesome role back when there were 15 product specialists at Google. For me, that was an amazing time because I was getting to sit on seven or eight different core product teams. And in my observation, these days, most PMs don't get to sit on other people's core teams. And so I had these three or four years of just ... I call it a masterclass in PMing because I was getting to watch what was working for some PMs and what wasn't working for other PMs and just taking notes behind the scenes. So that was a really influential role. And then went on to various PM roles at Google and YouTube.\n\nLenny (01:06:09):\nComing back to noticing. It comes up again and again in our chat. This is so interesting because it feels like you basically came from the mail room of tech to the top of the product field. And so I think there's a lot of inspiration people can take from this journey. One quick question is how long was that journey from not being a PM, from I guess being at a tech company to getting your first PM role? Just to give people a sense.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:06:33):\nLet's see. I probably worked for at least four, five years before being able to move to PM and I think that was a slightly harrowing journey because at the time, you had to have a computer science degree.\n\nLenny (01:06:46):\nAt Google. Right. Cool. So I think that's one takeaway too is give it time. It's not going to happen. There's a lot of people that are just like, \"I need to become a PM immediately.\"\n\nLane Shackleton (01:06:55):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (01:06:56):\nI think that's a good example of it's not going to happen overnight. Coming back to your two lessons, I think they're really interesting and I'm curious if there's anything else that comes to mind of what you found was essential to you succeeding in this path? So the first lesson you shared as being customer facing. And in this case being in retail as customer facing, is your advice get in a tech company and work on something customers use or is even working at Starbucks or Abercrombie, does that count?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:07:24):\nYeah. I think maybe to relate it to what you just said, if I were to give advice to someone who really aspires to be a PM or trying to get into PM, I think in many cases if you're in a customer facing role, you are the expert on the customer and that is really, really valuable in tech organizations. And oftentimes it's undervalued. And so I think people who want to move into PM roles who are not currently in PM roles can often lever that experience and that knowledge of the customer in ways that are pretty profound for the organization and pretty insightful for the organization if they really are creative about it. And then I think the other thing is, regardless of where you are in the organization, you're always serving a customer. You can't just talk to one big enterprise customer and you can't just talk to the smallest customer. You have to have a diverse and continuous stream of customer interactions in order to have good intuitions about what to do next. And your engineers aren't going to really trust you unless you have good intuitions about where the customer's headed and what they want and stuff like that. And so the stakes I think are pretty high. The good news is it's easier than ever with all these tools to really get into the mindset of a customer.\n\nLenny (01:08:47):\nMy lesson touches on something a previous guest talked about, Paige Costello, where she was often the youngest person in the room and built a lot of respect and people really trusted her over time. And her lesson was know thy customer. If you know the most about what they need, and you can show, here's what I've heard again and again and again, people will just like, \"Oh Lane, tell us more.\" And they bring you into conversation because providing value, you're not just there sharing opinions. Everyone's got opinions.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:09:15):\nThat's basically how both me and ... I had a friend named Bill Ferrell who transitioned into PM at the same time and that's essentially how we got the try at being a PM inside of Google was we knew the customer really, really well and we were often in conversations bridging the gap from here's what I think they're really saying, or here's what I think we should build based on what they said.\n\nLenny (01:09:41):\nThe other thing I wanted to mention, you talked about the product and how a lot of customers don't care about the product, they just care about just I need this thing done. It reminds me at Airbnb, we hired this guy, Chip Connolly, who was a hotelier. He created the Joie de Vivre hotel chain and just is steeped in hospitality. And he came to Airbnb and started doing this worldwide tour talking to hosts. And he's just like, \"Guys, when you talk about product, you're telling hosts, 'Hey, the product's going to be updated. We're going to launch all these features.', they think their home is the product of Airbnb. They don't understand what you're talking about when you're talking about the online experience and the website. That's the last thing they think about. It's the experience of someone traveling on Airbnb and staying in their home.\" So I think it's a really good reminder of most people don't care about the product. They just have this problem and you just happen to be this website that'll help them solve it.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:10:30):\nI think most people can be way more concise with their communication. Even internally, people don't care. You should assume that people don't care. Or if you're talking to customers, writing a blog post for customers, you should assume that they don't care. When you start with that assumption, you really force yourself to be a little bit sharper in your communication style.\n\nLenny (01:10:53):\nAnd one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I heard a story that at Coda there's this moment called Tim Ferriss Day that drove a lot of traffic. Can you share that story? Does that ring a bell?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:11:08):\nYeah. There's lots of memorable days at Coda. One of them was Tim Ferris Day. So I guess maybe for context, we had built this very nascent publisher motion where we were going out and helping people publish their rituals. And this is what you see in the Coda Gallery and a lot of what we talked about today. But we had this one person on that team, this guy Al Chen, Tim Ferriss fan, and also I think had been really tenacious with the people around Tim Ferriss and basically finally got an in to him and figured out a really neat way to implement one of his rituals and wrote a doc. And so none of us really knew this, but this was all happening. And anyway, we wake up one morning and traffic is just spiking through the roof, signups are spiking, no one knows what's going on.\n\n(01:11:59):\nI'm convinced this is all spam. I'm like, \"Something's wrong with our data or something's going haywire.\" At the time, we were also in the China Basin office and the fire alarm went off. And so now we're outside on our laptops. We were in a war room trying to figure out what was happening and now we're outside trying to figure out what's going on. So anyway, make a long story short, data scientists investigate and we eventually figured out that we had been featured in Tim Ferriss' email newsletter and I think early on you hear this lesson or this adage of first time founder, build a great product, second time founder, build a great distribution. I think that was one of those early big cues to think about the importance of content distribution and the importance of these publishing flywheels. And it definitely made us double down. We're like, \"Okay, if we can do this with Tim Ferriss, what's next?\" And we definitely spent a few months trying to reach that high watermark that was set that day in traffic and sign-ups. So it was a fun memorable day and people for the subsequent one or two years would refer to it as Tim Ferriss Day.\n\nLenny (01:13:15):\nSo funny. I bet Tim Ferriss had no idea what he did.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:13:18):\nNo idea.\n\nLenny (01:13:19):\nHoping you have a Lenny's podcast day once this comes out. Everyone's going to be freaking out. What is going on here? Is there anything else you wanted to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:13:30):\nMaybe we're talking really briefly about two-way writeups.\n\nLenny (01:13:33):\nYeah, let's do it. I had that in my notes, but I skipped it, so I'm glad you mentioned it.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:13:37):\nCool. Yeah, I mean this is a concept that I wrote a bunch about and I often now get asked about, and I guess maybe the historical view of this, I got really obsessed with the history of how work gets discussed and decided upon and broke it down into three phases. And so the first phase was 1980s we had PowerPoint. It was this amazing tool. You could manipulate shapes on a screen and we were all using fancy clip art and it was really fun, but we've all had the experience of being in a really long PowerPoint presentation and someone's droning on in their slides and stuff like that. Second phase is in the early 2000s, two things converged. One was Google bought this company called Rightly that became Google Docs. So instead of having Word on your desktop and sending files around you now had online collaborative editing.\n\n(01:14:35):\nAnd the other thing was Jeff Bezos sent this very famous memo, which basically said no more PowerPoint at Amazon. And what that did was started in earnest their six pager ritual. You can read all about this in the book Working Backwards. It's a really good book. Colin Breyer's book. And so that started I think what I'll call the one-way writeup phase, which is you're writing down your ideas, you're expressing them clearly. It's in prose so you have to be really clear. That was a big step up I think from always presenting work and deciding on work via presentations. And then the thesis is that we're in the midst of a new phase, which is essentially two-way writeups and that's where it's more conversational and feedback and discussion is actually part of the content itself. So that's the broader historical arc. But if you think about it, PMs and product people are always at the brunt.\n\n(01:15:31):\nThey feel this the most because they're the ones that are driving decisions and really the ones that are driving discussions oftentimes in companies. And so I think the problem with one-way writeups I felt very deeply at Google and YouTube. And just to name them, the first one is you would always be trying to figure out who's read your write-up. So I have many memories of sending a write-up out at 11:30 PM and then waiting patiently for the avatar of the SVP in my area to show up in there. And that was a sign that they had read it, which is just totally insane if you think about that behavior. The second one is you end up having a lot of the discussion in the comments itself. So this is a space that's really built for grammar and spell checking and things like that. And you're having these really meaningful discussions in this a hundred pixel right margin.\n\n(01:16:30):\nAnd part of that I think is there are all these questions that are being raised, and so you have really no idea what the most important question is. And so if you're facilitating those discussions in one way writeups, you're often going through the comments in the 20 minutes before that session trying to figure out which one of these do I want to address. And then the other behavior, and I don't know if you've ever seen this in a doc, but in one way writeups that you see a lot is there'll be just a mega comment thread on the title of the doc. And people are like, \"I don't think we should do this,\" or you'll get into this 30 comment thread on the title because that's the best place to put your overall thoughts. And I saw this pattern all the time. So if you live that life, I think the world of two-way writeups and the way that I think a lot of our customers are doing it, and you can do this on other tools besides Coda too, I think is quite a bit better.\n\n(01:17:26):\nI guess the alternative to go down that list is you have a done reading button at the end of a writeup. So now you can say, oh, these are all the people that have read this. And I think even you see a pattern in some of our customers where if it's a particularly long writeup, you'll have three done reading buttons so you can see where everyone has gotten to. And then the second thing is making sure that you're actually addressing the most important question. So instead of pulling questions out of the comments and trying to figure out which one to address, just putting those in a table and then letting people upload those. And that's what we call Dory. And then I think probably the most valuable is sentiment or pulse, which is, well, how do you feel overall about this particular proposal?\n\n(01:18:13):\nAnd if you think about the contrast between a comment thread on the title and seeing a list of all the sentiment, how everybody feels about this proposal and really being inclusive to the entire audience is just wildly different. I think in my particular experience. I'll give you one example. I wrote this proposal, this is now a couple years ago. I thought it was going to sail through no problem. I thought it was going to get four out of five and five out of five smiley faces from everybody. That's sort of how the sentiment table works. And one of the lead designers basically said, \"One smiley face. We shouldn't do this.\" And I was like, oh man. This particular person's not really vocal in meetings. And so I would not have heard that feedback. It was very unlikely I would've heard that feedback unless they had had a sentiment table, a place to add that. And so I think the punchline on all of this is I really authentically believe that this is where we're headed and hope that a lot of PMs and product teams adopt this in general.\n\nLenny (01:19:23):\nI'm so glad that we touched on it and there's a template or an explanation of this that you wrote up that we'll link to. Yeah.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:19:31):\nGreat. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:32):\nAwesome. Is there anything else that you think that we should touch on that we haven't touched on?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:19:37):\nYeah. I think one thing that we've discussed before is just about strategy and planning and stuff like that. So it may be useful to touch on a couple of insights there. I think there's two insights in the strategy and planning thing. And this is again in the handbook that we're writing, but the first that I end up seeing a lot is just this idea that OKRs are not actually strategy. So I think the way that we plan and the way that our customers plan, the key point is it's critical to disconnect strategy discussions from OKR discussions. And it sounds really obvious, but it's I think a very common mistake. And I think a really simple question to ask yourself is do we have a separate strategy process or strategy ritual that is distinct from OKR setting and metric setting and goal setting? And I have found you can pick whatever strategy framework works for you, but I do think it's quite important to pull those two things apart.\n\n(01:20:43):\nThe other rule that we live by on the planning side is what we call a 10% planning rule, which is essentially just ensure that you're not for a given time period planning for more than 10% of that execution period. And I think this is a really easy mistake to make. I mean, this is a hard fought rule because we've made that mistake before. But you end up getting bogged down in planning or saying, planning felt rushed and so we need to make it three weeks instead of one week or whatever. And the byproduct of that over the course of a lot of time is that you end up just planning way too much and oftentimes you really don't know what's ahead until you've launched or learned something. And so I think that's a pretty good rule to follow.\n\nLenny (01:21:32):\nI love that rule. I found the same heuristic. 10%. If you're planning for a week, plan for half a day, planning for a month, maybe like three days. Yeah, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:21:46):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:21:47):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:21:51):\nOne that comes to mind is Turning the Flywheel. It's a little manuscript book. Jim Collins wrote it. It's really, I think a very succinct and very fast read about how flywheels work. We talked about Storyworthy. I recommend that book a lot. Good Strategy/Bad Strategy. Love that book. Very simple framework that I've reused a bunch. Maybe outside of tech, Waking Up is a book by Sam Harris on mindfulness that I really like. And then an old one that I really like is The Inner Game of Tennis by Timothy Galway, which is a kind of classic.\n\nLenny (01:22:27):\nAmazing. On Good Strategy/Bad Strategy, I'm working on getting Richard Rumelt on the podcast. I'm in talks with his agent and they seem to be excited. So we'll hope that actually happens. And then you inspired me to try to get the Storyworthy guy on. So what a cast of characters we're going to get on here.\n\n(01:22:43):\nNext question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:22:48):\nYeah, it's a little bit hard with three kids and a job these days to watch a lot of TV. I would say I really enjoyed The Last Dance. I love any sports documentary. All those.\n\nLenny (01:22:59):\nHave you seen Underrated, Steph Curry's new documentary?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:23:01):\nNo, I haven't. I got to watch that.\n\nLenny (01:23:03):\nOoh. It's really good.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:23:05):\nI've been rewatching Arrested Development. That's also just a timeless classic.\n\nLenny (01:23:11):\nClassic. I love that Michael Cera is in the Barbie movie, not to give any spoilers. That was a funny surprise.\n\n(01:23:18):\nNext question. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:23:22):\nThere's two I really like. One is teach me something that I don't already know. I think it's just an awesome way of seeing if someone's going to lean in and really figure out what you don't know and then how passionate they are about pitching what they do know I think is really fun. And then Shishir and I have been asking a version of teleporter question and evolving it for many years now, so I like that question quite a bit.\n\nLenny (01:23:49):\nShishir shared that question in his episode and we make TikTok clips out of some of these conversations and that clip just went crazy. People love it. It's our most viewed clip, I think on TikTok. Or just like, what would your answer to that question, so we'll try to link to it in the show notes if you want to watch just that one interview question. I think you maybe gave it away, so maybe that's why you're evolving it.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:24:10):\nYeah. We-\n\nLenny (01:24:11):\nDon't know if we screwed you.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:24:13):\nI also recently wrote a post about my favorite ref check question, which I think I would love to learn other people's favorite ref check questions.\n\nLenny (01:24:20):\nReferences check. Oh man. That's its own. Oh man, I'd love to do a podcast just on that. That is such an important skill. The first question you mentioned of asking people to teach you something, I heard the best version of that in a previous episode where Maya, the Head of Product for Spotify podcasts, asks what would your podcast be if you were to start a podcast?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:24:40):\nI like that.\n\nLenny (01:24:42):\nSo feel free to steal it.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:24:45):\nI sometimes do a version of making them explain it two different ways after, and making the candidate explain it two different ways and saying, \"Okay, now you have to explain that to your grandparent.\" And then now you just told me about sewing or some hobby of yours. Now sell it in its most technical form to someone who knows everything about this particular topic. And so it's kind of fun to also see the range that people can operate.\n\nLenny (01:25:13):\nAwesome. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love? Either digital or physical, anything that comes to mind?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:25:21):\nA few. I'm becoming a real sleep nerd, so those eye masks that cup around your eyes, I love. Obviously in the tech world, ChatGPT. I got really obsessed with tennis during the pandemic. There's a product called Swing Vision that's really good. It basically cuts up your match into different ... All of your forehands or all the longest rallies or all that and uses AI to do that. There's a corresponding meditation app to the book Waking Up that I really like. That one's a very good one.\n\nLenny (01:25:57):\nWe live not so far from each other, so we got to play some tennis and I could check out this very cool product.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:26:01):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:26:03):\nYou're on. That'll be our sequel. Just our game. Next question. What is a favorite life motto that you either repeat to yourself often, like to share with people around you, share with your kids maybe?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:26:16):\nI don't know if it's as motto as much as it's just a way of being. It's essentially the present moment is all that we have. Realizing that our attention is very often on the past or the future and in so many ways the present is where it should be always. And so I think that that is something I think about a lot. I think maybe more broadly, I had a mentor who roughly said a version of make things happen, and so I really try to apply that to anything that I do. If that's work or life or sports, I try to be the person who creates momentum and positive change and progress. And so I think that that's generally a good motto to live by.\n\nLenny (01:26:58):\nBeautiful. What is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:27:03):\nMy mom's a psychologist and a professional counselor so certainly active listening. Maybe the tech version of that or the modern version of that is steal manning someone's argument, being able to repeat back to someone what they said in a better form, more clear form. So yeah, she's an amazing woman. Taught me a lot about listening.\n\nLenny (01:27:28):\nFinal question. You were a guide in Alaska helping people climb. If someone were to pursue climbing, is there a tip or a lesson or something that you think people should know to get better at this or to know before they go down this route?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:27:43):\nThere's a saying, which is the safest climber is the one who knows when to come down essentially. And I think that there are many times that you have to put your ego in check and come off a mountain or come out of a climb because it's not quite as safe as you thought it was. So I think that's maybe one. I think the other is it's probably not a one-way door. So I think in many ways you can do climbing and you can do some of these outdoor pursuits on the side, or you can always come back from them. So it's maybe not as big of a choice as some people think it is.\n\nLenny (01:28:24):\nLane, I said at the top of this episode, Coda has one of the most thoughtful product teams out there, and I think it'll be clear to people after listening to this why that's the case and where it trickles down from. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and ask you any other questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLane Shackleton (01:28:42):\nI'm on LinkedIn and Twitter and I have a Substack. We'll be releasing that handbook for product teams that I will probably post on Substack. And in terms of useful to me, yeah, give Coda a try. Give us feedback. I love hearing from product people all over. It's one of the bright spots in my day to hear all the creative rituals that come from this community. You've created just a legendary community of people and so they always give very thoughtful feedback so I'm very open to all of that. And yeah, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:29:22):\nAwesome. Lane, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nLane Shackleton (01:29:25):\nThanks.\n\nLenny (01:29:26):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:29:29):\nThank you so much for listening.
