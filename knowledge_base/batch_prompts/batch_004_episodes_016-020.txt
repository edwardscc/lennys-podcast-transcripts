It's not that intuition is crap, your intuition is sometimes right. If you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nWhen you look at companies that have read your book, what do you find are the brainwashing tactics that really stick?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:16):\nPeople generally think the purpose of a meeting is for three things, discover, discuss, decide. The only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nSomething that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:28):\nSo a pre-mortem, it's great only if you set up kill criteria. Commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nYou have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality when the outcome is very long-term.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:00:40):\nThere is no such thing as a long feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nToday, my guest is Annie Duke. Annie is the author of the bestselling book Thinking in Bets, and also her more recent book Quit: The Power of Knowing When to Walk Away. She's also a special partner at First Round Capital, which we spent some time on and is incredibly fascinating. Prior to this part of her career, she was a professional poker player. She's won over $4 million in tournaments, including winning a World Series of Poker Bracelet, and she's the only woman who's won the World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions and the National Poker Heads-Up Championship. Currently, she spends her time helping companies make better decisions. In our conversation, we cover the many lessons that she's learned from her friend Daniel Kahneman, who recently passed away. What simple change she's found has the most impact in a company's ability to make better decisions, how to make better quick decisions when the feedback loop is very long, and also why she doesn't actually believe in long feedback loops, how she changed the way that the partners at First Round Capital make decisions, which is incredibly interesting.\n\n(00:01:51):\nPlus, why when you're thinking about quitting, that probably means you've already waited too long and you should have quit a while ago. I learned a ton from this conversation and this is definitely going to change the way I think about a lot of things. With that, I bring you Annie Duke after a short word from our sponsors.

Annie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:03:58):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:59):\nIt's my pleasure. I was telling a bunch of people that you were coming on this podcast and every single one of them was so excited that we were doing this, so I'm quite excited that this is happening. I want to start with a question about Daniel Kahneman. I know you two were very close. You did a podcast together. I know you grew to be good friends over the past few years. Sadly, he passed away about a week ago at this point.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:04:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:21):\nI'm curious, what are some lasting lessons that you took away from your time with him? Maybe one or two things that stick with you and you think will stick with you?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:04:31):\nIt's hard for me to describe properly how humble this man was, and it seems so impossible because his influence was so huge and his intellect was so huge and his insight was so change-making in the areas that he worked. But he was so humble, he really wanted to hear what you thought. He said, \"I don't know a lot\", he would change his mind. It's funny, I got asked in a class that I was teaching about thinking fast and slow and someone was talking about how there's a lot of studies in there that didn't end up replicating.\n\n(00:05:19):\nAnd what I've seen from a lot of other people in the field who really where their work is defined by some line of work that didn't replicate, where they're really arguing against the fact that it doesn't replicate. Just trying to justify or say, \"But no\", or this and that. This real lack of open-mindedness to the idea that you know what? Maybe it turns out not to be true and that should be okay. But the thing about Danny was when you talked about it, he was the first one to tell you, \"I wish priming wasn't in the book. It doesn't replicate.\" He was just so open-minded to the idea that he knows what he knows now, but he knows that he doesn't know everything.\n\n(00:06:06):\nAnother thing that people don't know about him outside of academics I think are that he was one of the pioneers in something called an adversarial collaboration. So one of his favorite things, and he in some ways invented it, was find someone who really disagrees with you and then write a paper with them and try to figure out with them what's the study that would resolve the issue. So an example of that was Danny did work on happiness as it relates to wealth. Kahneman and a collaborator, Angus Deaton, they published a result that got a lot of press about the relationship between money and happiness, and the idea was money doesn't buy happiness beyond $75,000. So that got published in 2010. I'm sure if you ran that exact same study, it would be more than $75,000 now because it would adjust for inflation. But it was like the idea being once your basic needs are met and you're not that worried about paying rent and so on and so forth, it's not going to have that big of an effect.\n\n(00:07:09):\nBut then a decade later, Matthew Killingsworth said, \"That's not true that actually money and happiness are correlated through all the income levels. The more money you have, the more happy you tend to be.\" Okay, so this is a classic example where people will tear each other down sometimes and that guy's wrong and whatever. And instead, it was Kahneman's like, \"All right, let's do it together.\" And they joined forces along with Barb Mellers to basically try to resolve that issue. He was just always seeking out, it was just like everything was like, why am I wrong? And he was eager and he was excited and he wanted to...\n\n(00:07:56):\nI remember having a lunch with him where I realized after the lunch that the whole lunch was him asking me questions about my work. Why is he asking me questions about my work? Right? He's Danny Kahneman. But he was just so curious about other people and he just made time for everybody. He just loved the people around him so much. And I think that in the end, it's hard to believe, but I just think that that dwarfs his body of work, which is spectacular. But he as a human being was just so spectacular. And I do think you hear all the time about people who are so incredibly brilliant. It's the brilliant but asshole thing, and it was just so the opposite with him. He was so kind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:51):\nThat's amazing. And it feels like there's probably a strong correlation between people that are curious, always looking for how they're wrong, and finding time to spend it with people to debate and discuss and ask. Feels like there's going to be a strong correlation with that and finding really interesting insights uncovering new things.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:10):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. [inaudible 00:09:12].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:11):\nWell, thank you. Thank you for sharing all that. I wish I had known him. Let's talk about decision-making. So there's two areas I want to spend time on. As one would not be surprised, decision-making and quitting. And I know that you've been on a lot of podcasts. I imagine many listeners have read your book or have heard a lot about the stuff that you teach. I'm going to try to come at this from a bunch of different directions and do it a little differently. First of all, I know you're a parent. As last I heard, you have four kids. I just had a kid, he's almost 10 months now.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:43):\nOh, congratulations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:44):\nThank you. I'm curious, what your frameworks you find most helpful in parenting and in raising your kids that have stuck with you there?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:09:53):\nWell, let me just first off say I get a lot of people who are pregnant who come and ask me for my advice about parenting. And I'll tell you the two pieces of advice I give people. The first is this, there's all sorts of parenting books, there's all sorts of styles. A book needs to sell, so they need to sell you something new or different or whatever, okay. But the only thing that matters really is that your kids know you love them, really know deep in their bones, know you love them.\n\n(00:10:32):\nAnd we can argue breastfeeding versus not breastfeeding or co-sleeping versus not co-sleeping or attachment parenting or sleep training, we can talk about all that stuff, right? Do you homeschool? Do you send them to private school? Do you send them [inaudible 00:10:49]? We can have lots of [inaudible 00:10:51], but it all dwarfs in comparison to your children know that you would lay down in the street in the front of a bus if it meant that they would be alive and happy. That's the number one thing I say. Number two is at some point, you will drop your baby on its head. So I bet this has happened to you already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):\nWell, yeah. Sort of. Okay.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:11:18):\nSort of, right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:18):\nKeep coming.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:11:20):\nSo here's the thing about babies, is babies can't move. And so you get very used to as a mom or a dad or you're sitting on the couch and you're folding laundry and your baby is right here next to you and your baby can't move. And then one day without warning, your baby can roll over. And you think it's fine because you put a pillow there or something, but you turn your back for a second because you're like whatever and then your baby falls on its head. It happened with every single one of my children. And they don't fall that far and whatever, but they're totally fine and you're not a bad parent. And it's just this, there are things you don't know and stuff's going to happen and it's not going to be perfect. And every little thing isn't going to have some lasting impression on your child because at some point, you will drop your baby on its head and you will not mean to, you didn't intend to.\n\n(00:12:21):\nBut in my case, it was always like, oh my gosh, my baby can roll over. I did not think that was going to happen today. And gosh, by the time I got to the fourth one, it's like I'm chasing after one baby to try to get the diaper on and this and that, so then the other baby hits its head. So I think there's just a lesson in that which is like it's a small thing, don't sweat it and don't get mad at yourself because you made a mistake. It's like the mistake would be, oh, I realize my baby could roll over now. So now you should make sure that you're taking extra precautions about your baby rolling over off the couch. But it's really just a funny way for me to say your baby's going to hit its head or walk into a coffee table or get cut or whatever. It's like they're very resilient and you didn't do anything wrong as a parent, so don't beat yourself up about that. And then I do actually have one other thing I say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:20):\nYeah, go for it.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:13:21):\nBe having four, you have very little, you have no influence whatsoever basically on what your child's personality is. What you can do as a parent is make sure they say please and thank you. So what I find with parents of one is particularly if that one is very well-behaved, they think they're a great parent and they may be. That would be resulting. They may be, but once you have four, what you realize is like, oh, my parenting really didn't have anything to do with it. But my children do say please and thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):\nThis is really valuable, good advice. I need to hear this. My wife is going to need to hear this, too. She's always worried about the soft spot on our kid's head and getting hit into some things.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:14:09):\nNo, it'll be fine.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:10):\nOkay, great.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:14:11):\nIt's actually it's part of why it's there. Really, your baby will be fine. I mean, that's the thing. We used to cart babies around in the wilderness, we were living in case. We're fine, we're built for it. We're built for a much rougher world than the world that babies actually grow up in now. I will say my oldest child when she was in high school, just for whatever reason, she had no interest whatsoever in alcohol or drugs or anything like that. And I remember just feeling so smug about how well I had raised this child and how great she was, and oh, these other parents who clearly weren't doing a good job. I mean, I didn't really but because it's hard not to. And then my next child went through high school and I was like, [inaudible 00:15:02]. That's just a temperament thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):\nIt's a good example of resulting in action.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:15:08):\nIt is a good example of resulting, but all my kids have turned out fine and they're all very different, but yeah. But as far as decision-making is concerned, which is a totally different thing, I'll actually quote Danny Kahneman on this one. Nothing is as important as it seems when you're thinking about it, that's a really important one. One of the things that I used to try to do with my kids all the time was mental time travel, which is actually a very good decision tool. So they would be really upset about something and it could be something that happened at school or it could be like they were grounded for something or whatever.\n\n(00:15:46):\nAnd the thing is when you're in the moment, it just feels like so big. And the thing that I used to say and they say all the time now is this is going to be so great for you when you're 40 at Thanksgiving. You're going to be able to tell these stories to your children and it's going to be the best, like you should be thanking me so that you can talk about your crazy mother at the Thanksgiving table. And it allowed them to get some time and space from it to realize this is going to be funny at some point.\n\n(00:16:19):\nAt some point, it's going to be a hilarious story that you tell people. No matter how horrible it seems now, it's going to be a hilarious story at some point when you're older. And it sounds like a fun thing I was doing with them, but it's actually a really good decision-making tool for us in general, right? Look, there are absolutely things that 20 years from now are going to matter, for sure. But most things, no. If you think about most things that ever happen to you, like you're 21 and your girlfriend breaks up with you or whatever and you just think it's the end of the world and you're never going to recover and all these things, but if you could get yourself like, well, how do I really think I'm going to think about this in 10 years? Am I still going to be heartbroken in 10 years?\n\n(00:17:03):\nProbably not. And I think that we need to get that perspective of time so that we can get out of the moment because in the moment it just feels so important and the feelings are so big. And it's like the focusing effect on this second and the feelings you're feeling right now are so huge that we forget the scope of time. And I think that that's absolutely one of the best things you can do with your kids, and you can do it in small ways too, right? You can choose to play this video game or you can choose to study for your task. A week from now when you get that test back, how do you think you're going to feel about those two choices? Right?\n\n(00:17:43):\nSo that was a tool that I used a ton and it's just generally an amazing decision-making tool, just generally for people. It's one that I happen to use with my kids all the time. And then I would say that the other one was using the word nevertheless, which is this is a great leadership skill, the word nevertheless. So let's say my child got caught doing something wrong. I don't know, I found a bag of red solo cups in my backyard that they forgot to throw out after a weekend that I was away. That's hypothetical. So I'm grounding them and it's a lot of argument back, right? So they think this is a debate and they're giving me all of their input and their opinions on why it's unfair and all the other kids do it and the other parents don't get mad and whatever, whatever the argument is. You have to have the balance between them feeling heard, which I think is incredibly important that your children feel heard, and following through on what you know or believe is right.\n\n(00:18:56):\nSo it's I hear you. Nevertheless, you're grounded for two weeks. I hear what you're saying and I understand. Nevertheless, this is what's going to happen. And obviously, the words that you can use for that might be different. You have so much more authority obviously over your children than you do in other places. But in the workplace, this is very good because employees gripe all the time at decisions that you make in leadership because they think they're right and they want their way. And to have the ability to say, I heard you and your input, trust me, was incorporated into the decision, nevertheless, this is the path we're going to take. Right or wrong, that's what we're going to do. So I think there's a lot of things that basically you can say. These are good things to do with kids, but they're actually just generally really good decision strategies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:47):\nI'm taking notes on all these things. These are going to be extremely useful.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:19:51):\nNevertheless is a really good one with children.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:53):\nIt connects to something Dr. Becky teaches, if you know her, of telling someone, \"I believe you.\" When your kid says something and they're upset about something, start with I believe you.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:20:03):\nNevertheless.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:03):\nAnd here's nevertheless, exactly. Fair enough. I think we're going to start having to pivot this podcast to a parenting podcast because there's so much stuff here, but I'm going to try to resist. So we've been talking about decision-making and frameworks and things like that. Something I wanted to ask you is how much better can someone get at making better decisions? So for example, say someone listens to all of your podcasts, reads your book, studies it intensely. What's the delta you find in somebody being able to make a better decision? And where [inaudible 00:20:35] comes from is Daniel Kahneman of all people. People ask him, \"Do you just live such a optimal life now that you know all of these biases we have and all these mental errors we make?\" And he's like, \"No, I can't...\" I think he said famously, \"I don't, actually. I can't use these in practice. This is just stuff that I have learned, but it doesn't actually impact my day to day.\" So I'm curious just how much better can someone get? What kind of delta have you found in terms of making decisions?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:20:59):\nOkay, so it depends on whether you actually do the things. I mean, I think that that's what the issue is. I think Kahneman did some work way back that started him on this journey. That was basically work on hiring and it was taking it from completely unstructured Lenny, saying, \"I just know a great product manager when I see one\", whatever that means, to me going to Lenny and saying, \"Okay, I understand that you think that you see a great product manager you know one when you see one\", but can you explain to me what that means? In the abstract, what are the things that you're looking for in someone that you want to fill that role? And we can then excavate that, right? And make what is implicit because you're applying some implicit model to how you're thinking about the person that you're interviewing and how they map onto the role that they're going to be, but let's make that explicit.\n\n(00:22:04):\nSo we can make that explicit, we can turn it into a decision rubric, we can create a structured interview process out of that. And then what he found was after you've gone through that process, if you then use your intuition after having done that, not before, that then you actually can really drastically improve your hit rate on hiring. And in that case, it was from about a 50% hit rate to 65. So that's pretty huge, so that's a really big difference. The problem is nobody does it. So I can tell you that most of the conversations that I had with Danny that were about my work in particular were just him saying, \"How do you get anybody to do it?\" Now that's not to say that I would be better at that than him, it's that he didn't do my job, right? So he was an academic doing research and so on and so forth, I'm living in companies embedding for years.\n\n(00:23:02):\nI've been with one client for five years, one client for four years, one client for four years also, almost four years, three and a half years. And then I just took on a new client who I've been with for six months, and that's my whole client roster because I stay with them so long. So if you do it, the answer is quite a bit. Like at least in terms of Danny's work in relation to something pretty noisy like hiring, you went from 50% hit rate to 65% hit rate, which is huge. It's enormous. The problem is that the way that you can make decisions in order to be better at them is not supernatural to the way that humans make decisions.\n\n(00:23:47):\nI think we think a lot more highly of our intuition than we really ought to. We think very highly of our ability to notice things in the moment and act rationally toward them in a way that really we ought not to. We tend to think that we have insight that other people don't have when actually the other people probably have more insight into our situation than we do. So I think the answer is a lot with a big if, with an if you can get people to do it. And I think that's where the issue comes in. Now, the good news is that you can then reverse that and say if I'm willing to do it, think about what an edge I'm going to have over people who aren't willing to do it, right?\n\n(00:24:36):\nSo we can think there's people who don't know about it, there's people who do know about it but don't do it, and then there's people who do know about it, but do do it. And it's that last group that's so tiny. So the answer is I think a lot, but nobody does it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:54):\nSo maybe following that thread, when you look at companies that you've worked with or companies that have read your book and really dove in and started to implement some of your piece of advice to make better decisions, if you could look back at the ones that had an impact, what do you find are the mental models or frameworks or tactics that really stick that most often have an impact and the biggest impact?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:25:18):\nI think the one that's easiest to implement is this. And it's so easy, and I just wish more people would do it. The best way to get somebody's opinion is independently of other people's opinions, independently asynchronously. So the way that I put is I want people to stop talking to each other so much. When we think about what did people generally think the purpose of a meeting is, they think it's for three things. Discovery, which is I want to discover what your opinions are, what your judgments are of something, right? So I want to find out what you think about something. So for example, if we're in product development and we're trying to figure out a timeline, we're trying to develop a product roadmap and we're trying to figure out how long it's going to take to release certain features or something like that, we all come into a room and we start yelling it out together.\n\n(00:26:29):\nIt's so bad for decision-making, I can't even tell you. There's cross influence, the loudest person in the room tends to then have an outsized influence on the decision, the most confident person in the room tends to have an outsized influence on the decision. And that's great if the most confident person is also right, but the problem is that's not always so. And so that's the discovery piece, right? And we tend to do that in a group. And then there's discussion, which is I've now discovered the way that Lenny is modeling this problem or what his judgments are about certain things or his forecasts are, his estimates are. And now, we're going to discuss those ideas and we're going to discuss your ideas in comparison to my ideas, and that's going to happen in the group setting. And then there's also now, we're going to decide in the group setting. So we're going to make some set of decisions about say what the roadmap is going to look like.\n\n(00:27:26):\nHere's the thing that I think is the easiest to change, is to realize the only thing that's ever supposed to happen in a meeting is the discussion part. So we should absolutely be coming together as human beings to discuss everybody's judgments and opinions and the way they're modeling the problem and their forecasts. In particular, it's really good to come in and discuss the places where people are different. So you've been in many meetings, I'm sure about 80% of the time is double clicking. Oh, I agree. And I want to now we've literally just used different words to say the exact same thing because I'm in agreement.\n\n(00:28:07):\nIf we can focus the discussion on places that people disagree, we're much better off. But so now we can take this, discover, discuss, decide. So I'm saying discuss is only supposed to happen in the meeting, that's the only thing that's supposed to happen in the meeting. So what's happening with the other stuff, the discover and the decide? Well, and this is the thing that I think I actually have been able to get people to do is discover what people think before you get in a room independently of each other. So how would you do that? Well, let's imagine that you're going to have a meeting about the product roadmap.\n\n(00:28:43):\nSo you would say to yourself in this meeting, what are the opinions that I need to get from the people in the room? It could be a brainstorm. What are all the different features that we could develop? So it could be a brainstorm. Fine. Write to them independently and say, \"Hey, free for off. Just come up with all the different features that you think would be reasonable for us to consider developing and then give me a forced rank from best to worst of your own ideas with some three to five sentence rationale as to why you have these things in this order.\" And so I could do that, but maybe we already have a list. I can send that out for a forced rank to everybody. Okay, so here's the final list of things we're really considering. Prioritize those for me, just force rank them. And then again, give me a rationale.\n\n(00:29:32):\nGive me a little bit of free writing as to why you think this should be, that you have these things in this order. Maybe we've decided now on what our top five priorities are. Great. I could, before the meeting, send the top five priorities out. \"Hey, we've decided on this stuff.\" For each thing, I'd like to understand what you think a reasonable timeline is, how many sprints it's going to take, so on, so forth, right? So we can ask for that type of information so that we can start making estimates because that's going to affect budget and what we're going back to the board with and so on so forth. But regardless, just figure out what is the thing that we're going to be discussing in this meeting? And I'm going to send it out to everybody independently and I'm going to say, \"Don't reply all, just send it back to me independently.\"\n\n(00:30:14):\nIf it's a repeated decision, you can actually create a rubric that lives on Airtable or Coda or Google Sheets or whatever, I don't really care. And people can input their decisions there where they can't see anybody else's decision. So with Google, you can use Google Forms in order to do it, and then it dumps into a spreadsheet that only you can see. That's a great way to do it. So anyway, so you do that and now you can now see everybody's opinions that you then now send out to the group and say, \"Everybody, look this over before we come in and discuss.\" So notice you're still working as a group, but you're working as a group where you're not in the same room together and talking at the same time. And there's a word for that, which is nominal group. So it's a group that at that moment is working independently and asynchronously of each other.\n\n(00:31:03):\nSo if you can get people to do that, and I do have companies where I don't consult with them, but I've just come in and talked to them briefly or whatever that do actually implement that piece of it. That is a huge piece of it, that's ginormous. And then you do the same thing for deciding. So the decision should not be made in a room, it's made either. I love the one decision maker model, but not everybody's down with that. But you can have a vote forum where people go vote in private about the way they're leaning.\n\n(00:31:39):\nYou can do a variety of things with that, but just don't do it. Don't do it in the meeting. And then just the last thing that I'll add, which is a muscle that you really have to exercise, is I think it's really important to understand that the word alignment in terms of we're all aligned as a group, right? The word alignment is stupid and it shouldn't be used. And I know I'm saying that very harshly, but it's true. It's dumb because it doesn't exist. You have 10 people in a room and they're all really different people with different opinions, and they're never going to come out of the room agreeing with each other. And it's really bad if the expectation is that they're supposed to, and it's really bad for a few reasons. One is it isn't reality, and that I don't like coming out of things without reality actually kicking.\n\n(00:32:38):\nSo it's not reality. People don't actually agree, they're not actually aligned on the decision. That's just the thing that makes you feel better, right? So I think that that's problem number one. But problem number two is that if the goal is alignment, if the goal is agreement, then the meeting becomes coercive and you never want that. So the way that I'm supposed to talk about my ideas is to convey why I believe what I do, not to convince anybody that I'm right because if I'm working to convince people that I'm right, it becomes coercive and that's horrible. So you have to get comfortable with walking out of the room. This is the nevertheless. Walking out of the room understanding that once you have that discussion, it's not that Lenny, your opinion might change. It could, right? I could say my thing and it could be just so damn brilliant that you change your mind somewhat, right?\n\n(00:33:37):\nSo you come maybe you're like, \"Oh, I'm thinking about this differently and actually\", but maybe you don't and you still believe a thing that's very different than me. And leadership has to say, \"That's fine. I've heard both of you and I know that this isn't going Annie's way. Nevertheless, trying to think about what all of our goals are, this is what the decision is going to be and it's totally fine that you ended up not agreeing with each other because it's reality. And what it allows me to do is get a better sense of what the space of decisions is.\" So those things I have been able to get people to do and they're actually quite impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:17):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10X increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision-makers, including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated two to five X higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.\n\n(00:35:14):\nAudiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply. There's an implication here you touched on a bit that there's a DRI essentially, there's one decision maker. Sometimes people start to feel like, \"Oh, my voice isn't heard. I don't have a lot of say, I can't be part of this decision.\" And you talked a bunch about just how to make people feel included, you get feedback along the way. But any advice there if you try to move to this model of making people feel like, \"Okay, I actually have impact on where this goes\"?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:35:58):\nYeah. So here's the really wonderful thing about moving from a coercive model to really, I guess you could say a model of curiosity, right? You want to be curious, not coercive, which means that the way that people in the meeting are talking about what their opinions are is in the mode of conveying information, not trying to convince anybody. So once we move away from that coercive model, and when I say coercive, I'm not saying anybody is purposely trying to set up a culture of coercion. Sometimes that's true, but for the most part, everybody's trying to do a good job and nobody's trying to set up a culture of coercion. But as soon as you say, \"Are we all in agreement? Are we all in alignment?\" And as soon as you're allowing people, and I'm sure you've been in these meetings, right? If you allow people to interrupt, if you allow people to say this, \"I think you're wrong\", \"I disagree\", \"Here's why\", those are all very coercive things to have happen.\n\n(00:37:12):\nInterrupting someone is silencing them. Saying, \"You're wrong\", well now, you become tribal and people aren't going to be open-minded and they're going to stake their ground and it's all really bad. So let's move away from that. Number one, that's already going to help. But when we think about the way that meetings normally happen, again, there's all this crosstalk and some people aren't speaking and some people are and so on, so forth. And then of course, not everybody feels equally heard. But when you work as a nominal group, let's talk about something as simple as we're going to make a forecast of how long it's going to take to launch this product feature. Okay. So I'm going to send out to everybody, what's your point estimate? What's your lower bound? What's your upper bound in terms of timeline?\n\n(00:38:02):\nAnd you could do it in some way, like how many sprints do you think is going to take whatever language you want to use? Now, everybody independently now gives their forecast with a rationale for why they believe that. And then you come into the room and you run a discussion where everybody's getting to say what their estimate was and why they believe that, and people are getting to ask questions. \"I have a question\" always is a clarification, it's just I don't understand. And as the leadership, the way that you would do it is, let me give you an example from a real one because that'll be easy. I did one of these discussions for a question about remote work, like what did the company want in terms of remote versus hybrid and that kind of thing. And so there was a lot of disagreement about whether whatever the policy was, it should be consistent across functions. Lots of disagreement.\n\n(00:39:01):\nSo let's take somebody who was on the, no, it shouldn't be consistent across functions. So they now say why they believe it shouldn't be consistent across functions and they say things like, \"Well, different functions have different requirements, right?\" So there's some functions that have to be in the office, like if you're IT as an example, but there's other functions which are more collaborative and creative and whatnot where it makes sense for people to be in the office, whereas engineers doesn't really matter, right? So there's different needs of different functions in terms of how much they need to be in the same space. So I'm not agreeing or disagreeing with this, I'm just saying what somebody said. So now as a facilitator, I never say, \"Oh, I agree.\" What I say is I just want to make sure I understood what you said and I reflect it back.\n\n(00:39:57):\nSo I say, \"So what I heard you say is that not all functions are created equal in terms of how well they work remotely or how well they work in person or what the flexibility might be. So what you're saying is there're functions that have to be in person. Period. And then other functions where that collaborative element being in the same office would be more important versus some functions where being remote is totally fine. Is that what you meant?\" And then they have the ability to say, \"Yes, that is what I meant\" or, \"Actually, I meant something slightly different. Let me say what that is\", and then I reflect that back. Okay, so literally you're just going around, you're calling on people to do that, and then you're reflecting back what they say without offering your own opinion. I don't know, Lenny. Tell me how someone doesn't feel heard in that situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:48):\nYeah. Absolutely. I would feel so good if somebody just clarified and made it clear they know exactly what I'm saying, even if the decision doesn't end up the way I want.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:40:57):\nRight, so that's the thing. And then what actually ends up happening is that the people in the room feel more, the psychological term would be endowed, more endowed to the decision. In other words, they feel like they have ownership over the decision. And whatever the decision is, they generally will see their selves reflected in it because they were heard. And they also will generally understand that nobody, no one really ends up with exactly every single thing that they wanted to see in the decision because they also get to see the true spread of opinions on the team. And what you see in that situation is that there's lots and lots and lots and lots of disagreement, which you don't see if you talk in a group. It narrows the space, right?\n\n(00:41:48):\nSo for example, particularly if you're senior, if you say, \"I think this is going to take three months to launch\" and I was thinking four weeks, you're never going to hear four weeks from me, ever. But if we get those opinions independently, you will actually hear that I think it's going to take four weeks. You may tend to be more right there being more senior, but I may have something interesting to say. You should hear what I have to say. And this also allows me to learn from you, too. But because I haven't heard your opinion first, then I'm not going to conform my opinion to yours. So it actually spreads the surface area of disagreement that you see on the team, which then makes people feel much better about the decision not being exactly what they want because they recognize like, \"Oh, this is actually a hard problem. People really disagree on this stuff.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:41):\nAmazing. I think this is going to be really helpful to a lot of people. Just to close the thread on this little summary maybe is core advice here is brainstorm separately. So I guess first, there's discover, discuss, decide. To discover ideas completely independently, basically brainstorms. You're a big advocate of brainstorming independently, sitting on your own, thinking through ideas. And then bringing people together to discuss all the things they've come up with and especially where they disagree. And then ideally having one person that makes a decision once she or he has taken all the input.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:43:12):\nYeah, you can have one person. I mean, I work with people where it's like a partnership and there's six people who are going to vote, but they still do it independently. They go to a forum. So I don't know what your vote is. And all six people don't have to agree. I mean, I just think it's really important that once you get above an end of one, you shouldn't necessarily expect the people to agree, which I think is just really important. And this is good for more than just brainstorming. It's for forecasting, any kind of project planning, budgeting. Yeah, I mean, we do this, for example, at First Round, we have a structured forum for evaluating a company in terms of whether you should invest in it because there are facts and then there are the way that you model those facts in. So it's a lot, what are the investor's opinion of the founder and the product and that kind of thing.\n\n(00:44:06):\nAnd we just have structure around how we're eliciting those opinions, which is really helpful. The other thing that I'll just add to what you said is that you can actually be in the same room together and still discover information independently. So this will happen on the fly all the time where people are talking and they start talking. Something comes up, like someone suggests some new feature or something like that, and then people start saying, \"Yeah, but that's going to take...\" And you go, \"Stop. Okay, everybody take out a piece of paper.\" So you can still get that same independence on the fly as well as doing it in advance. But yes, that was a very nice summary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:49):\nIf this is just the one thing people take away from this conversation already, I think that could have a big impact. Speaking of First Round, one, we actually just had Todd Jackson on the podcast talking about-\n\nAnnie Duke (00:44:59):\nLove Todd.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:59):\n... love Todd, talking about product market fit. That episode will have come out before this episode. Also, so I asked Brett Berson, your colleague at First Round, what to ask you.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:00):\nOh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):\nYeah, yeah. By the way, your title of First Round is amazing, special partner. I've never seen that before.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:15):\nI am. It's a title just for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):\nOh, my God.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:17):\nI adore Brett Berson.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):\nMe, too.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:19):\nSo I'm interested, I'm interested in what he said you should ask me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):\nNothing too spicy, it's along the lines of what you talked about. So you said that you have a very interesting framework for how to think about decision quality in the short term when the outcome is very long term. For example, investing. Also, many decisions we make in business, things you need to decide now that you only find out years from now. Can you talk about your advice there and your insights here?\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:43):\nOh my gosh, I'm so happy that that's the question that he asked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):\nYep, I see.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:47):\nOkay, so can I give a tiny bit of background to this?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nAbsolutely.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:45:50):\nSo prior to talking to First Round, I have another client too who, they're amazing, Renegade Partners at Roseanne Wincek and Renata Quintini. They're incredible. Before finally hooking up with them, and they work at different stages, First Round is C, obviously. Renegade is more like A B, tiny bit of dabble in C. But before running into them, I talked to quite a few venture firms who are interested in talking to me post-Thinking in Bets having come out, so this would be 2018. And there was a theme, there was a theme across them all. The first one was, well, the kind of decision-making you're talking about we don't need to do because we just know a good founder when we see one. So that is a sentence that came out of many people's mouths. And as I just said to you, okay, I have no doubt, but don't you want [inaudible 00:46:52] make that explicit?\n\n(00:46:53):\nThere's all sorts of great things that come from making it explicit, not just in terms of the increase in decision quality in the moment, but it actually allows you to close feedback loops much better. So that was one thing that I found quite surprising. But the one that I really found very interesting was being told, \"Well, what you're talking about doesn't apply because our feedback loops are a decade.\" And in poker, you got an answer right away. You won or lost the hand right away. So the way that you're thinking about decision-making doesn't really apply, until I met First Round and then Renegade where they actually heard what I had to say because I gave the same answer to everybody. So we'll just put aside that wouldn't you want to make that explicit. The first thing that I would say is, oh, poker is much noisier than you think because when I win a hand, I have no idea why.\n\n(00:47:50):\nSo I do actually have to wait a long time because I have to play many, many, many hands before I actually know, do I actually have an edge? Because I actually don't know very much. On one hand, for one thing, I almost never see my opponent's card, so I'm left in a dust of uncertainty. But separately from that, the main thing that I said was, how could you possibly think that the feedback loop is 10 years? And this is what I think really caught First Round's eye because when I was talking to Josh Kopelman about it, he said, \"Well, what do you mean? We don't get an exit for 10 years.\" And I said, \"Oh, I'm sorry, do you invest? And then you go to sleep like Rip Van Winkle? And then you wake up 10 years later and you go, 'Hey, how'd that go?' Or are there all sorts of things that happen in between?\" The simplest thing, the simplest thing is does it fund at Series A?\n\n(00:48:46):\nAnd the little pushback that I would get there is, but we're not investing for Series A. And I say, \"Well, I know that\", but have you ever had a company that exited for more than a billion dollars that did not fund at Series A? And the answer is no. And I'm like, okay. So it sounds like that's necessary. Might not be sufficient, but it's necessary. And it's certainly a signal that is actually more highly correlated with exiting out well than the investment at C. And then, oh, right, you have series B. And that's separate from all the other things that you can look at, like what you talked to Todd Jackson about. Is it achieving product market fit? We know that eventually for it to be successful, it's going to have to achieve product market fit, right? So you can look at what's happening with that, just general things about traction, what's happening with net new ARR, ability to retain top talent churn.\n\n(00:49:55):\nI mean, there's so many different things that you can look at, all of which are things that you know must happen in order for the big thing to happen. Okay, so what that means is that this is the big, I'm going to make a bold statement here. There is no such thing as a long feedback loop. You can make a decision about how long the feedback loop is. That is your choice to live in a long feedback loop, and you can choose to shorten the feedback loop. And the way you choose to shorten the feedback loop is to say, what are the things that are necessary but not sufficient? That's one thing, for getting a good exit, or what are the things that are correlated with the outcome that I eventually desire? And what that means is that when you're at the decision point, right? Like in First Round's case, I'm going to invest in a company.\n\n(00:50:51):\nWhat you have to understand is that you are making a prediction about how the world is going to unfold, how the future is going to unfold. And those things that you're predicting. You can track, and you can track them back to the decision and you can do it pretty darn fast, mind you. I mean, think about being in 2021. There were companies that were raising in A six months after seed. Today, it's a little more 16 months-ish. But even so, let's just say that that was the only thing that you decided to do. I'm going to forecast the probability that this company's going to fund at Series A. And then obviously, those companies start to fund or not fund at Series A and you're finding that out in 16 months. Here's my question for you, Lenny. Is 16 months shorter than 10 years?\n\n(00:51:38):\nSo it's probably why he said to ask me that question because I just really do. I mean, I have a very strong opinion about this. The feedback loop is as long as you choose it to be. And if I take that back to some of the things that I heard early on when I was talking to people, what I would say is that I think that there is a certain amount of psychological safety in allowing the feedback loop to stay long because really of two main factors. One is that, look, if I was early into Uber and now I'm a celebrity investor or something, I don't really want to know if I'm good or not. Do I? Right? I don't really want the world to know that. I mean, if I'm good, that's great. But it feels like they already believe that I'm good because I happen to be early into Uber.\n\n(00:52:47):\nSo since people already think I'm good, I'm just losing to that decision, psychologically speaking. Not investment quality speaking, but psychologically speaking. Okay, so here's the problem though. Why was I early into Uber? Did I have an insight into a real pain point in a developing market, blah, blah, blah? Or did my buddy start Uber and I was like, \"Sure, I'll give you some money?\" Right? I mean, obviously, I'm talking about the extremes here, but we don't actually know what the decision quality was, right? All we know is that you had a good result and given that you had a good result and people think very highly of you, what are you going to gain? Right? So it's so nice to just let that feedback loop sit there and allow people to have the opinion of you. That is really nice, feels good, right? And not actually find out the answer because why would I want to?\n\n(00:53:51):\nUnless you're really super focused on decision quality, then you would want to do that. So that's part of the psychological safety. And what that goes to is, the real core of it is that it's very, very difficult for human beings to deal with feeling wrong in the moment, even if it helps them in the long run. It's just hard. And the tighter the feedback loop, the more that you risk finding out you are wrong in the short run. Now that helps you to learn and improve your decision-making if you're focused on it and you're good at it, right? That's going to help you. And then in the long run, you're actually going to do better. But human beings are notoriously good at trading off the long run just to feel good in the short run. That's why we're all eating chocolate and cupcakes and stuff that we know is bad for us because it feels good.\n\n(00:54:45):\nAnd so much of our decision-making is trying to advance this positive self-narrative and the idea that yeah, we're going to have a more positive narrative ourselves in five years if we do some stuff. Most of us are like, \"No, I don't really want to make that trade. I'd rather just feel good now\", and I can use the fact that we are living in power law, under the influence of power law. I can use that to just confirm a lot of things that I wish to believe that are true of me. And if you take that away from me and you take the uncertainty away from me, it's going to be really hard. And I will tell you that's what I love about both Renegade and First Round is that they're just like, I want to know. It would be such a horror for me to think that I was making good decisions when I actually wasn't. And that's what really matters to me and I think that it's just so special.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):\nHearing all this makes me want to be an LP in First Round. Not that they would let me in there, but just knowing that you're in there futzing with everything and the way they're thinking is really inspiring. I'm curious if you could share an example of anything that they tweaked as a result of this analysis that you did and how they evaluate.\n\nAnnie Duke (00:56:05):\nWell, first of all, let me just say they didn't really record a lot about their decisions when I first came in. They voted and they had a record of the vote so they knew who said yes and who said no, but they didn't have a lot of other information. So the first thing that happened was just that. Okay, what do we really think is the way that you would model whether you should invest or not invest in? Very broadly, you would say you're reading the market, the team, the founder, the product broadly. We're going to make sure that those opinions aren't just like it's good or it's bad, but it's on a scale of one to seven so that we can actually get some precision and some spread among the partners in terms of, say, strength of market. We're going to make sure that we have shared definitions of those things, which you'd be surprised people don't.\n\n(00:57:00):\nSo when I am thinking about market and market quality, I might be thinking about something very different than you. So we want to make sure that we have a shared definition of that, and that's reflected in something that we would call mediating judgments, which are judgments that you make related to market prior to actually judging what you think of the market in general. So you could think of something like competitive landscape, so you would judge that. So that turns into what these mediating judgments are, which is basically an implied definition.\n\n(00:57:30):\nSo you create that, and then you also think about what are the forecasts that are important. One thing that you already know is you're going to forecast the probability the company funds at Series A. So that was a huge change, just a very different way of making decisions. What we've been able to do with that now because I've been there for five years is we now can actually look, say the partnership as a whole, and look at these ratings that they're making of the component pieces of parts of how they're modeling, like what makes a good investment, these forecasts that they're making.\n\n(00:58:03):\nAnd we actually know how these companies have now unfolded. So in the simplest sense, we know whether hundreds of companies have funded at Series A or not. And now, we can actually look and say, how good are the partners at actually forecasting this thing? Right? Are they random? Are they better than random? And we actually know that and we can feed that back to them so that they can understand their own accuracy around these pieces of the decision because the fact is that whatever a seed investor says to you, whether that company is going to fund at Series A is part of their decision. It's included in the decision. So they're making that forecast whether they make the forecast explicitly or not. So what we're saying over at First Round is let's make it explicit because you're doing it implicitly anyway, and then we can actually start to look at your accuracy.\n\n(00:58:58):\nWe can now feed that back to you and let you know how accurate you are, which will then help you to become more accurate, right? We can also look, because we know in any given vintage what are the best companies or what are the worst companies. Remember, we're having people do these ratings on a scale of one to seven of say the quality of the market, and we can look across the partnership and say, \"Look, Lenny, when you think the market is great, how does that map onto how well the company is doing in the future? When you say the market is terrible, how well does that map onto how that company is doing, how that company ends up doing in the future?\" And I can come to you and I can say, \"Oh, Lenny, by the way, your judgments about market are amazing.\"\n\n(00:59:47):\nYou know a good market when you see one and it's really mapping on in a great way onto how that company unfolds, but you're not so great with founder, or maybe you're great across the board, or maybe you're not. So we can now start to give people, we can give the partners insight into their own decision-making, not only to allow them to improve the decision-making, but also to allow them to understand not to over index on certain things that maybe aren't as predictive as an example for them. We also can change the rubric based on the evidence now.\n\n(01:00:22):\nSo the first version of the rubric is always taking the intuitions of the partners and making those explicit, but then we can start to loop those back together and understand, well, maybe this thing that the partners thought was important actually isn't predictive across any partner. For example, we can start to develop the rubric based on the data. These were all things that weren't possible because prior to that, if I had come in and said, \"Well, let's look at decision quality\", how would I do that? I mean, I have no idea why people were... I just know whether they said yes or no. And so it's very difficult to them to start to do some really serious refining of the decisions if I don't have that information.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:08):\nI desperately want to know which partner it makes the best decisions. I know you're not going to share them.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:01:13):\nNo, I'm not going to. The partnership as a whole is excellent as we know. And this is what I will tell you is that all partners have strengths and all partners have weaknesses, and they're not perfectly overlapping, which is wonderful, right? I mean, that's one of the things. It's like what's really wonderful, and I think it shows the power of why would you have more than one person having input into a decision, is some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of market, or some people are very strong on rating a particular aspect of the founder. There's overlap and then there's things where Todd is uniquely great at something, or Josh is uniquely great at something, or Bill is uniquely great at something. So that's a wonderful thing about it is that everybody has strengths and everybody has weaknesses and they're not perfectly overlapping. So this is where you can see getting that spread of opinions and really understanding, breaking that decision down into its component parts really shows you the value of diverse opinions as input into a decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:21):\nI could talk about this thread forever. Maybe let me just ask one more question just because I'm super curious. Is there anything surprising that stands out, that came out of this analysis so far? Just like, oh wow, maybe market isn't as important as we thought or this person is amazing at-\n\nAnnie Duke (01:02:34):\nYes. So I think just generally speaking, when you're creating the initial decision rubric, there are things that people are really pounding the table about that they think is especially important in making a decision. And one of the things that we found is that sometimes their intuition was absolutely right. The thing that they were pounding the table about is incredibly predictive, not just for them but other partners. But sometimes it's not at all predictive, and these are equal table-pounding situations. So let's say you're pounding the table about something, sometimes the thing you're pounding at the table about is predictive for you and for all the other partners that it's actually quite predictive about how the company does. But sometimes when you're really pounding the table about something, it's not just that it's not predictive for the other partners, it's not predictive for you.\n\n(01:03:33):\nAnd I think that what's really important to understand about this, and this is why it's so incredibly necessary in improving decision quality to take what's implicit and make it explicit, is that our intuition is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. It's not that intuition is crap and your intuition is just completely wrong, I mean obviously, that can't be true. We would die, right? So your intuition is sometimes right, but it's also sometimes wrong. And if you don't make it explicit, then you don't get to find out when it's wrong.\n\n(01:04:07):\nYou don't get to find out when it's off base, and that's a disaster. So that's the thing that I think is really interesting is that you have equal vehement and confidence that this particular factor is really important. And sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't. And it's so surprising because we're talking about people who are true experts who are great, and I think that we all just have intuition about intuition, right? You just intuit that if they're so amazing, clearly their intuition about what's important would have to be good, but not necessarily. That's the thing, not necessarily. Yeah, I think that was probably the most exciting thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nKeeping it mysterious, but I still appreciate you sharing.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:04:59):\nWell, I have to keep it mysterious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:02):\nYes, I understand.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:05:03):\nI can't give away the trade secrets.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nI wanted to touch on a different framework that I've heard a lot of companies actually using, and something that comes up in product a lot is this idea of pre-mortems, which is essentially think ahead of time what might go wrong. Can you talk about this? Because I think that it's something that's easy to implement, really powerful, and a lot of people are actually doing this.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:05:25):\nYes, okay. So a pre-mortem is great, but only if you attach a pre-commitment with it. So I just want to be super clear about that. What you find with pre-mortems, this actually work. I actually did this work with Maurice Schweitzer and Linnea Gandhi, who are both at Penn. Then when you have people do pre-mortems, it generally doesn't actually change their plan very much or it changed their behavior. So I think that we have the feeling that if you do a pre-mortem and you think what are the ways that things might go wrong, that that's going to change your plan, but probably not unless you're specifically using it for that purpose and you say, \"Okay, we're going to do this, but let's think about how we might change our plan in light of this information.\" But I think what's actually more important than that is what a pre-mortem allows you to do is to set up kill criteria.\n\n(01:06:18):\nSo kill criteria are just a set of signals that you might see that would tell you that it's time to pivot or stop because once we actually launch something, we're very, very slow to decide to quit. I'm sure that everybody has felt that way before. Things go on way too long, even like they're over budget and you've blown the timeline. And when you finally shut it down, you realize you should have done it a lot earlier. And this is true across the board because of a variety of biases. The most well-known, and probably the biggest influence is something called sunk cost, which is that feeling, but then I'll have wasted all the time and effort that I've put into this already. So it's taking into account what you've put in in the past and deciding whether to continue on in the future. So what we want to do is actually just get better at that thing. So understanding that when you've gotten to the pre-mortem process, you probably are going to launch it, like it's probably going to be the case.\n\n(01:07:22):\nUse the pre-mortem to set up kill criteria. So I'll give you an example from a sales team that I worked with. Basically, I sent them out a prompt, all the IC is a prompt that was, imagine that you got a lead through an RFP or RFI and you worked on it for six months. And now, it's six months later and the deal is dead. Looking back, you realized they were early signals that that was going to be the case, what were they. So this is a pre-mortem. What are the things that you saw that would tell you that this was going to go south? And they came up with all sorts of ideas. Notice this doesn't mean they're not going to start off pursuing the lead, right? But they saw, they came up with all sorts of signals. So I'll just give you three of them.\n\n(01:08:12):\nThe RFP RFI was clearly written with a competitor in mind, so they felt that was a very bad signal that was probably going to go badly. Another one was the customer didn't want to demo, they only wanted to talk about price. Obviously, that's quite bad. And another one was after the first few meetings, they couldn't get a decision maker in the room, right? So it was a much longer list than this, but those are three. So for each of those, that now becomes a kill criteria if I see this thing and now you attach an action with it. So in the case of price, they actually just said, \"We should kill it.\" If they literally don't want to demo and they're only asking about price, they're just trying to beat up somebody else on price like we're a box-checking exercise. So there, they just said, \"We're going to kill it. We're not going to pursue the deal anymore.\"\n\n(01:08:59):\nSo this is great because salespeople will pursue deals forever and leadership is like, \"Well, why did you stop pursuing that deal?\" And they get in trouble for it. So this is going to help with that problem, right? In the case of the RFP RFI was written with a competitor in mind, they have an action associated with that as well, which is ask them directly if they're working with a competitor and how far down the road they are, depending on the answer you would kill or pursue. In the case of we couldn't get a decision maker in the room, offer up executive alignment at the next meeting. And if they say sure, great. And if they say no, kill.\n\n(01:09:35):\nSo that's actually what I feel is the best use of a pre-mortem is to say, I'm going to try to figure out what those signals are along the way that things are going badly. And now instead of just hoping that when I see those signals, I actually act rationally, which is a hope that it will not come true. That's why there's many people who climb Everest in the middle of a blizzard, even though they shouldn't be doing that. Use the pre-mortem to now create structure around those signals that you've spotted and commit to actions that you're going to take if you see those signals. And I think that's the best use of a pre-mortem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:15):\nThat's really helpful. And it's interesting how many of your examples come back to just of a framework that you often talk about, which is make it explicit what is implicit. There's another example that the First Round example is a great example of that where it's just, here's all our assumptions, they just make them actually explicit and just shows how much [inaudible 01:10:32].\n\nAnnie Duke (01:10:32):\nRight, then you can examine them. You can examine them, people can discuss them, you can figure out if they're wrong or right or whatever. It's like, I want to be very clear, I'm not anti your gut or your intuition. I think it's probably sometimes pretty good. I just want you to make it explicit, that's all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):\nOkay. So we didn't have time to get into quitting, which is your more recent book. Maybe we'll do a follow-up episode specifically thinking about quitting, but let me just ask-\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:03):\nIt's my fault because my answers are long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:05):\nIt's my fault.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:06):\nI apologize to everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nNo apology is necessary. We'll have plenty of time in the future, hopefully. Well, let me just ask one question. I found this one quote from you where you said you should assume that if you're thinking about quitting, it's already probably past the time that you should have quit. Do you still believe that? Is that generally a good rule of thumb? And just any takeaway, tip, lesson on quitting as our one question on quitting?\n\nAnnie Duke (01:11:29):\nSo the data is pretty strong that by the time you quit, it's probably long after the [inaudible 01:11:37]. And it's really just because, look, when we start things, we're starting things under difficult circumstances, which come from the uncertainty of the decision to start something. So when we start something, luck is going to have an influence on the outcome, which obviously, we have no control over because luck isn't in our control. And then there's also hidden information. So what happens is that after the fact, we know that we're going to learn new information and it can make it very hard to start things because we want to be more sure than we actually need to be. It's why Bezos has the 70% role to try to roll people back and be willing to accept that uncertainty in the starting decision. Now the good news is that when you learn that new stuff and the new stuff that you learn is, \"Ooh, if I had known this, I wouldn't have started it\", you have the option to quit generally.\n\n(01:12:28):\nSo that's the good news. The bad news is that the same difficulties that apply to the decision to start apply to the decision to stop. In other words, we're making that decision under uncertainty as well. So we're not going to know for sure whether it would've turned out well or poorly unless we continue to do the thing that we already started. And we don't like to walk away from things unless we know for sure. So as Richard Thaler put it, most people won't quit until it actually isn't a decision. In other words, the whole thing is blown up, the startup has no money, or you're up on Everest and the blizzard is literally upon you and you're stuck in it. Or I think as he said, until you've fallen in the crevasse already, then you'll make the decision to quit because then you know how it was really bad. So people generally, for example, don't quit their jobs until they feel they have no other choice or relationships or projects or products that they're developing, it all applies because we want to know for sure.\n\n(01:13:35):\nAnd then on top of that is the fact that there is this issue of sunk cost, which is when we walk away, we feel like we'll have wasted everything that we've already put into what we're doing. But of course, waste is a prospective problem, not a retrospective one, even if we treat it like a retrospective one because it's the prospective one. Well, if you wouldn't start this today, then that means that everything that you're putting into this going forward is the actual waste, right? But we do that all the time. We go forward with things that we ought not to be going forward with because we're trying to protect the resources that we've already sunk into it in the past. Then there's other issues that have to do with, for example, endowment, the ownership over the things that we've built. This is particularly bad in product because we're building things.\n\n(01:14:18):\nAnd once we build things, we own them. And once we own them, we don't want to give them up and we actually value them more highly than identical things that we don't own. And then there's issues of internal and external validity, which is really just a fancy way to say your identity. How do other people view you? How do you view yourself? Do you feel like you failed? And what that means is that by the time, there's so many biases against stopping that by the time you're actually even thinking about quitting, it's probably already past the time that you ought to have quit. But we'll still continue on until we know for sure we didn't have any choice because here's the thing. When you walk away from something and someone's like, \"Hey, why'd you stop that?\" And you're like, \"Oh, I had no choice\" and you tell them everything that went wrong and, nobody's going to question you.\n\n(01:15:04):\nThey're going to be like, \"Oh, well, it sounds like you put in your best effort.\" But if you walk away early, people are like, \"What?\" So just quickly, I'll tell you I think just one of the best stories of this that I've got in my pocket here. Let me pull it out before the end. So Stewart Butterfield creating a product called Glitch, and Glitch is a massive multiplayer online world-building cooperative game. Releases it, this is in the aughts, and it's like a huge hit with the critics. It's Monty Python meets Dr. Seuss, it's an incredible whatever. They're getting tons and tons of great word of mouth and PR not doing any paid marketing. They have incredible investors in Andreessen Horowitz and Accel, they have $6 million in the bank and they 5,000 have diehard users, meaning users who use the game who play over 20 hours a week.\n\n(01:16:04):\nThe issue is that customer acquisition was a beast that for every one person who was playing over 20 hours a week, there were between 95 and 99 people who came for five minutes and left. So obviously, this is a customer acquisition problem, which everybody knows. So they make an agreement in 2012 that they're going to do paid marketing, which they do for six weeks. And during that six weeks, their acquisition of new users, it's growing like six to 7% week over week, which is amazing. And at the end of that six weeks, this is November of 2012, at the end of that six weeks, that Monday morning, Stewart Butterfield writes a note to his investors and co-founders and says, \"I woke up this morning with the dead certainty that Glitch was over.\"\n\n(01:16:58):\nNow notice nobody would do this in this case, right? But this is what happened is that the issue is that you really have to see is this worthwhile or not? Would I start this today? That's a forecast of the future, right? And what he did was some back-of-the-envelope math, and he said, \"Look, if we continue to acquire customers at the weight that we've been acquiring them at the cost that we've been acquiring them, it's going to be 31 weeks until we break even.\" But that's an absurd assumption because customer acquisition costs, it's going to go up. Cap has to rise because we're going to saturate the core gaming market, so it's got to rise. So what he realized at that point was that this was not a venture scale business, and he was in this for a venture scale business. So even though nobody else saw that he was supposed to shut it down, he saw he was supposed to shut it down.\n\n(01:17:45):\nAnd not only that, he saw that he was supposed to shut it down for his employees who were working for equity, and he had now realized that the equity wasn't worth their time and that it wasn't fair to them to keep going with it. So he shuts it down. Obviously, that feels... Who does that? Right? And he will actually tell you that he knows he should have shut it down before the marketing push, but he needed the marketing push to prove it to himself that he was seeing the future clearly. Now, the code to this story just quickly is two days later, he's like, \"Well, I'm a startup guy. I want to start something\", and he's got this internal communication tool that his team is using in order to develop this product that everybody loves. And he says, \"Actually, they really like that. Maybe that should be the next product.\"\n\n(01:18:29):\nSo he goes and talks to the investors, they roll their money over into that. And that thing, which had no name at the time, now gets a name which is searchable log of all company knowledge, which is Slack. And so I think this is the important thing to realize is that we get so focused on, \"But what about everything that I've put into it?\" When what we forget is that when you're doing something, there's not just the cost of doing something that's not worthwhile that's direct, but there's also the cost of not being able to devote your attention to other opportunities that might be available to you. And as smart as Stewart Butterfield is, he couldn't see Slack until he quit Glitch. And that is a true cost that he would've born of continuing with Glitch. If he had continued with Glitch, Slack would not be something that we're all using today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:21):\nThat is an incredibly beautiful way to end our conversation. I feel like I have at least a billion more questions to ask you and on the other hand, I feel like we've also helped a lot of people make much better decisions through this chat so I'm really thankful that you made time for this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn about the stuff you're up to in case they want to work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnnie Duke (01:19:43):\nYou can find me at annieduke.com if you're interested in working with me. I have a Substack, Thinking in Bets. Please go check that out. I teach a class on maven.com twice a year on effective decision-making. So if you're interested in that, you can go to Maven and check it out. My next cohort at the moment is in September, although I might do one in May. I'm not sure. But in terms of people can help me, I co-founded an organization called The Alliance for Decision Education. We're trying to bring the kinds of knowledge that we have about improving human decision-making in adults to K through 12 education to make the world a better place. So I would love it if people could go look at that. If you're interested in it, get the word out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nAmazing. So we'll link to all those things in the show notes. Annie, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAnnie Duke (01:20:32):\nThank you. Thank you so much, this was so fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:35):\nSame. Bye, everyone.

  "title": "Behind the scenes of Calendly’s rapid growth | Annie Pearl (CPO)",
  "transcript": "# Behind the scenes of Calendly’s rapid growth | Annie Pearl (CPO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:00:00):\nStrategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like what's your winning aspiration? But maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?\n\nLenny (00:00:27):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Annie Pearl. Annie is currently chief product officer at Calendly. Before that, she was chief product officer at Glassdoor. And before, that she was director of product management at Fox. She's also a member of Skip, a community for chief product officers, and she's on the board of two different companies. \n\n(00:00:54):\nIn our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including how Calendly builds product, how Calendly has grown, including the wild story of how they got their first 1,000 users, and also how they built a sales team on top of what historically has been a very product-led growth company. Annie also shares a ton of great advice on how to get into product management. I learned a ton from Annie and I know you'll too. Annie also shares a few killer tips for using Calendly, which I loved. And so, with all that, I bring you Annie Pearl through a short word from our wonderful sponsors. \n\n(00:01:25):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request. Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on. \n\n(00:01:56):\nFor example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, drive ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's readymade templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny. \n\n(00:02:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the dock that brings it all together and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Koda.\n\n(00:03:10):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Koda. Koda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Koda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of the special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at koda.io/lenny and get $1,000 start credit on your first statement. That's C-O-D-A.io/lenny, the signup and get a startup credit of $1,000, koda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:03:50):\nAnnie, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:03:53):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Super excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:55):\nI've been a big fan of yours from afar. We've crossed paths a little bit on Reforge, on Twitter, probably been at events that maybe we didn't know each other at yet. So, I'm really excited to finally be chatting, real life, in real time, at least.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:04:09):\nMe as well.\n\nLenny (00:04:09):\nI've got a Calendly question to kick things off. It feels like with Calendly one of the most awkward elements of it is I have to put the burden on someone else to book at Calendly. So, I'm sending a link and I haven't figured out a good way to send it to someone without it coming across like a power move. So, my question to you is how do I send a Calendly to someone without it feeling bad?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:04:31):\nAll right, well I love this question to kick us off. We actually have a whole blog post about this if you're curious to learn more.\n\nLenny (00:04:31):\nOh, okay.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:04:37):\nBut I think that at a high level, I think I recommend first really just kind of opening the door for the person you're trying to schedule time with to share their availability first. So instead of just sending the link, I usually start the email with something like looking forward to connecting, feel free to share, sometimes you're available or if easier, you can choose to find time on my calendar using the Calendly link here. So, opening the door to let them choose before you offer up your Calendly link, I think is a little bit of a subtle way to let them take the lead if they want. \n\n(00:05:08):\nAnd the second piece I would recommend too is once you opened that door, you can further reduce the effort on the recipient by adding times you're available directly in the email. So, when you go to share a Calendly link, there's an option to add times to email and you can then just paste those directly into the email you're creating, so that reduces yet another sort of point of friction to ask the user to click the link and get taken to Calendly. So, opening the door and then adding times to email are two things that I do to really make sure that it's not awkward and it doesn't put the burden on the other person.\n\nLenny (00:05:39):\nThat is awesome advice. That first one is what I ended up doing actually. That's really interesting where you don't send the link immediately. You first just ask, \"Hey, send me your Calendly.\" And actually, I always say, \"Send me your Calendly.\" I assume that's what they're using. That's kind of funny.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:05:53):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:05:53):\nI don't even know what else is out there.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:05:54):\nThat's good. That's what we like to hear.\n\nLenny (00:05:56):\nYeah, absolutely. It's like its own word now. Okay, that was awesome. So, there's this already actionable advice for anyone listening. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:06:03):\nSweet. \n\nLenny (00:06:04):\nTransitioning a little bit to product, the main focus of chat, you transitioned into product from being a lawyer. You told me at one point that a lot of people ask you for advice about how to transition into product from other functions, especially non-technical functions as someone without a technical background. So, what advice do you give people when they ask you how to transition into a product role?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:06:25):\nI got what I'll call lucky, which is I kind of stumbled into product management after law school, joined the founding team of a startup and ended up doing product management there. But when I think about folks who are looking to get in their product management, I think there's really two paths. I think one is more formal in nature. There are associate product manager programs out there and many scaled companies, Google, Meta. All have APM programs that you can formally apply to. And actually, when we were at Box, much earlier stage company than either of those companies I just mentioned, we actually created an APM program to help grow our bench of more junior PM. So, I think you can actually find APM programs even at smaller, earlier stage companies than even kind of big tech. So that's one, it's just formal APM programs.\n\n(00:07:07):\nI think another \"more formal\" way to get into PM is really by just directly applying to a junior PM role where there's no expectation of any sort of experience. I've usually seen this work best when you're already working somewhere in some product adjacency. Maybe you're in customer support, implementation, or maybe you're a sales engineer. But you can look at the internal job board and find junior PM roles that are posted and that's one way to make the move. So that's kind of on the formal side like APM programs and just applying via internal job boards.\n\n(00:07:38):\nI think on the informal side, really two suggestions here. The first one is to seek out opportunities to shadow or partner closely with a product manager and maybe even offer to take on some work. So, some of the best PMs that I've brought over to product from other functions, they really start by expressing interest in product and then start partnering closely with the product manager and maybe even doing a little bit of product work before they make that transition.\n\n(00:08:02):\nAnd one tactical suggestion is there's oftentimes companies will have subject matter expert programs where they want to pair someone from a go-to-market function with a certain product squad or a certain product area. And so that's becoming a SME. It allows you to really get more involved and embedded into the product team. So, that's one suggestion. And then maybe last one is just the path I did, which is joining an early stage startup. There's really usually an expectation that everyone's going to get their hands dirty doing a lot of different things. And so, I think that's one way where you might have an opportunity to try product management if you end up joining an early stage company.\n\nLenny (00:08:38):\nSo, maybe it was four, maybe it was more paths that you described. Join APM program. What was the second one again?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:08:45):\nInternal job board apply, when you're in the company.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nAs just like a junior PM. Two is, find someone that mentors you and helps you start doing the role. And is that internal? Is that the internal transfer app?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:08:58):\nYeah, exactly. \n\nLenny (00:08:58):\nCool. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:08:59):\nAnd then, another flavor of that is sometimes companies will have these SME programs.\n\nLenny (00:09:03):\nWhat is a SME program?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:09:05):\nSubject matter expert. So, you'll say, \"Hey, I want to make sure we have subject matter expert in our CS team on this area of the product.\" And they'll partner really closely with the product manager and designer within that area.\n\nLenny (00:09:16):\nGot it. And then the fourth bucket is, join a startup, start doing PM work and then you end up being a PM. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:09:21):\nYou got it. \n\nLenny (00:09:21):\nWhich of those four do you find most common? And would you push people in one direction or another?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:09:26):\nYeah, I've brought a lot of folks over internally for the path of someone's really interested in product, they express they're interested, they want to help, they want to learn, they're eager, they're curious. And so, they make that really well known and they're even willing to do some work on the side to help out and really show and demonstrate the skills before they have the job. So, I've seen that one to actually probably bring the most folks over in my role in terms of being on the product leadership side.\n\nLenny (00:09:53):\nOn the APM program route, are there any APM programs you recommend? Because I'm sure people hear this and they're like, \"Yeah, but I don't know where to apply. I don't know which ones are good.\" I don't know if you have a list, but just what comes to mind as APM programs to go pursue? \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:10:05):\nThe folks who started it all was Google, with the Google APM program. And Meta obviously has a pretty strong robust APM program. But as I mentioned around Box, I think those are obviously very, very competitive and most people want to get into them. It may be better to try and find a company like Box or a company that's a bit earlier stage, not as scaled to think about looking at those APM programs. And I'm sure if you want to, go to glassdoor.com where I used to work at Glassdoor, so had to throw that in there. You could search for associate product manager and I think you'll find a whole host of open roles that you might be able to apply to. \n\nLenny (00:10:39):\nThat is a cool tip. I haven't heard of that. Go to Glassdoor and search for APM. So, you search for companies that have an APM title.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:10:45):\nYes. You could just use associate product manager and you'll see all the open jobs out there and then go apply to them.\n\nLenny (00:10:50):\nThat's cool. Okay, good tip. What I find, and you mentioned this the best, if you have the option is internal transfer. If you're just like another function, you find someone that can help you move into the role.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:11:01):\nYou have the relationships, you can show your work really well. The other thing I would say is when I think about folks who have successfully transferred over, I think they tend to have a couple of characteristics. They're usually very curious, they tend to be really passionate about the product and solving customer problems. And sometimes, they've even tinkered with a side project as a way to hone their PM skills. So, I think as you're thinking about making that transition, those types of characteristics really showing eagerness and interest in the product itself and solving customer problems are also great ways to get noticed and increase your chances.\n\nLenny (00:11:36):\nWhy do you think it is that not more companies have an APM program? It feels like such a win for so many people. Why is it just so rare? \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:11:42):\nYeah, I think when we built this at Box, so drawing on that experience, it was a lot of work. If you're going to do it, you want to do it really well and you want to create an environment where you can help the associate product managers be successful, the goal is to ultimately graduate everyone from the APM program into being a product manager. And so, I think it takes a lot of intentionality and for us, it took a lot of work. We had to make sure we had clarity around the interview process. We had to make sure we had clarity around expectations in the role. We wanted to have a training element. \n\n(00:12:16):\nWe wanted to make sure that, again, we're setting people up for success. So, I think companies have to be at a stage of scale where they can really invest and they have the excess capacity to build the program in a way. I think that's going to help make sure everyone who comes through it has a chance at really learning, growing and ultimately being successful.\n\nLenny (00:12:33):\nThat's the same thing we found at Airbnb. There's a PM that was so excited to make the APM program and it just never really happens. It just takes so much work. And to your point, you have to set up for success. You want to make sure there's clear paths and you upgrade to a regular PM and have the interview.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:12:49):\nAnd are we doing, is this really an APM program for internal folks? Is this external? Are we going to be really trying to promote this? So, I think there's a lot of ancillary activities around the actual program itself that have to be taken into consideration to make sure that it is actually very successful.\n\nLenny (00:13:06):\nYeah. Maybe a last point we should probably imagine you agree with is generally just hard to get into product management. That's like the default. There's just not that many roles at companies versus say, engineers or some other functions. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:13:17):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nSo, I think that's just like there are not that many roles. It's a difficult role to break into, but these are the ways you can do it if you actually want to. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:13:17):\nThat's right. Yep.\n\nLenny (00:13:27):\nOkay. So, I want to transition a little bit to talking about Calendly. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:13:29):\nSure. \n\nLenny (00:13:29):\nThere are two areas I want to go. One is just how do you build product at Calendly? What have you learned about product development and team building? And then two, talk about how Calendly grows and what you've learned about growing a product like Calendly. It's such an interesting product, especially from a growth perspective. So, to start on just how product is built at Calendly, just a little context. How many product managers are there and how many PMs are there? How many people total, roughly? Yeah, just to give us a little bit of [inaudible 00:13:57].\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:13:56):\nLet's see, when I joined about two years ago, I think the company was about 150 people and I think we're about 600 now. And then the product team, there were about 15 product managers and designers when I joined again about two years ago, and I think we're around 60 this year.\n\nLenny (00:14:08):\nWow. So, 60 product managers.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:14:14):\nProduct managers, designers, and a research team. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:16):\nGot it. What about just PMs?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:14:20):\nPMs probably, my guess is 20. \n\nLenny (00:14:23):\nCool.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:14:24):\nTwenty-ish. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:25):\nCool. And then, can you talk about how the product team is structured roughly? If you think about a tree, [inaudible 00:14:30] tree.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:14:30):\nYeah. So, as I mentioned, we've got product managers, we have designers, we have a research team, and then product operations. And then, on my product leadership team, we have head of design, head of research, head of product operations. And then, within the product management team, I have leaders across core, across enterprise and platform.\n\nLenny (00:14:50):\nGot it. So, you manage the design team and engineering team, you said?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:14:54):\nNot engineering. Design, product and research. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:56):\nGot it. Something that I find is one of the big differences between product orgs is design reporting up to a product leader versus not. What's the rationale there? And then has Calendly tried a different approach?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:15:08):\nYeah. So, when I was at Glassdoor in the CPO role, I had the opportunity to lead design for the first time. So, coming into Calendly, I had led both product and design as well as research. And so, I think it made sense given I'd already done it once to keep that structure coming into Calendly. I think at the end of the day, the real benefit of the structure is really to say at the end, we want to be thinking about everything we're doing through the lens of the end-to-end user experience. And so, if we have product managers who are really prioritizing the problems we're going to go after, and we've got designers who are really trying to think about how do we bring solutions to life to solve those problems, having both of those functions roll into one person just really allows us to think more holistically around the end-to-end user experience.\n\n(00:15:53):\nSo, certainly, it can work where you have product and design reporting into different leaders that ultimately report into the CEO, but when you get to this level of scale from just a pure people management, but also just the scale of the business, you know often see this consolidation where product and design start to roll into one leader. And at least in my experience, I think it can help ensure that all the different pieces of work are integrated well together and ultimately deliver a better experience for customers.\n\nLenny (00:16:23):\nSo, it sounds like before you joined it wasn't like that. And if that's true, was there something that improved with that shift?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:16:29):\nSo, the structure was there that way. At that time, we didn't have a head of design, so we had a lot of really great individual contributors and who had been, many of whom had been with the company for quite some time and really contributed to the great user experience that existed in the product. But we didn't have a design leader. So, one of the first leadership hires I made was to bring in a head of design to really build out that function. And then, that head of design is a peer partnering with the different heads of products across the product management organization as well.\n\nLenny (00:16:59):\nWhat about in terms of the structure, whatever you can share one level below, how do you structure teams? Is it around outcomes? Is it around features of the product? Is it around type of persona? How do you think about that? \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:17:13):\nYeah, yeah. So, we have a core team who's really responsible for the core end to-end user experience. In many ways, they're both doing feature development and then they're also doing growth work. So, they're thinking about how do we build new features and functionalities to help our core personas, which is typically folks who are in sales, recruiting and customer success. So, anyone in an externally facing role, we're really trying to help them do their jobs better. So, the core team's thinking about features and functionalities to really help our core end user persona. And then growth work to think about the PLG funnel, everything from acquisition, activation, conversion, and retention. So, that's one group. \n\n(00:17:49):\nAnd then, second group is our \"enterprise group.\" And they're really thinking about two different personas. One is the IT admin, the person who needs to make sure that Calendly is secure and that they have all the reporting mechanisms to be able to manage their account and all the tools to manage users and groups at scale. And the second piece of that is also departmental leaders. So as Calendly selling into or being used by a sales organization, the head of sales is not the IT admin, but they are a Teams admin who needs to manage their organization within Calendly. So, the enterprise group really thinks both about the admin, but also sort of the departments and how do we better serve departments. \n\n(00:18:31):\nAnd then lastly, we have a platform team who's really thinking about how do we embed Calendly into the business processes of the organizations that we support and that we provide our product into. And so, that's everything from partnerships and integrations to our APIs.\n\nLenny (00:18:46):\nInteresting. So, it's like problem focused/persona focused. Who are you trying to sell it to?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:18:54):\nThat's right, that's right. Yeah, trying to sell it to, and then the persona of who's going to be using the functionality. And then, really having those teams hone and own those personas as they're developing functionality within the product.\n\nLenny (00:19:07):\nWhat's your take on OKRs? Do you all use OKRs in some form?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:19:11):\nYes, we do. We use OKRs both at the company level. So, we have three main OKRs that we're focused on for this year, for example, across the whole company. And then we have department level OKRs, many of which are in support of the company level OKRs, but then there's some additional things that we'll be doing at the department level, for example, that aren't going to show up at the company level. So yeah, we use them both at the company as well as on the product side.\n\nLenny (00:19:34):\nIs there anything you've learned about making OKRs work? People love them. People hate them. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:19:39):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:19:39):\nIs there something you do to make OKRs work? Something you've changed, something you've learned over time in how to work with OKRs?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:19:44):\nYeah. When I first joined, I'd say we didn't have this muscle well built out. We didn't really have a clear product strategy at the time or clear OKRs guiding the work. And so, there was a lot of great work happening, but it really was unclear how it all fit together or how we were going to measure success in that work. So that was a first phase. I think the second phase for us was we developed a product strategy. We then had product team OKRs that corresponded to that product strategy, but they were really contained to the product team and each department across the organization had their own kind of siloed OKRs. \n\n(00:20:20):\nAnd then, phase three, where really, I'd say we headed into this year, we have a really clear set, as I mentioned, of company OKRs and then in these really tightly integrated plans across the company around how we're going to support the key results and ultimately deliver on the objectives. And this has been a really incredible transformation of dependency mapping, being able to make sure that we're pulling all the levers across the organization to drive our most important objective.\n\n(00:20:47):\nSo, I think it's just the kind of maturing of the business from almost no OKRs to product team OKRs to now company OKRs in a really tight planning process to make sure there's a lot of integration across the company to support what we need to do as a business.\n\nLenny (00:21:01):\nSo, what I'm hearing is one of the biggest changes in learnings was to connect OKRs across from the top to the bottom, right?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:21:08):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:21:09):\nIs there anything else that has made a big impact on your ability to build and ship and execute as a company in terms of changes you've made in terms of how the company and how the teams build?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:21:20):\nI think one of the biggest changes that we've made, when I first joined, again, we had a product that served a lot of horizontal users. We help solo users who are freelancers, consultants. We help sales teams, we help recruiting teams, we help customer success, we help folks in education. So, we had a very broad user base. And what that means is that product managers in particular are I think had a really hard time prioritizing. At any point in time, it was really difficult to say, should I do work on feature A or for feature B without that clarity? And so, I think one of the most impactful things we did pretty early on in my tenure here was to hone in on our overall product strategy, but a poor piece of that being what's the actual market we're going after? What are the segments of that market? Who are the personas within the segments of that market?\n\n(00:22:09):\nAnd so, we've made a pretty clear distinction now that while a lot of the feature work that we'll do to support our target personas of sales teams, customer success teams and recruiting teams will impact folks who are not in those personas. Those are the core ICPs that we're going after. And so, historically, that would've been always a sort of trade off decision and a question. And now I think we have a lot of rigor around who our target market and then persona we're going after. And so, teams can use that to prioritize and also just deliver better value for those users.\n\nLenny (00:22:45):\nSo, it sounds like the biggest unlock and one of the biggest unlocks for making the team more efficient, move faster, make decisions quicker, is narrowing in on exactly who you're going to be selling to.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:22:55):\nI think it's one of the harder things for companies to do. So, it sounds relatively easy, and I think most companies believe that they have clarity around this. But then when you go down into the weeds of asking someone who's product manager or a designer, I don't know that it's always as clear because there's always a bit of a hesitation to say no, right? And the idea of saying no is scary. When in reality, the ability to say no is going to allow you to make sure you're building something that's going to be amazing for the people that matter most and not something that's going to be average or okay for a lot of different people.\n\nLenny (00:23:28):\nWas there anything that was really hard about actually executing that, convincing people we're going to narrow and not worry about these people and any lessons from going through that process? Because I imagine a lot of founders listening are like, \"Oh, that sounds we should be doing this, but oh man, we're leaving all this money on the table, people are going to be pissed.\"\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:23:45):\nYeah, I think it's a pretty big cultural shift. So, some of this intersects with the shift from product led growth to adding in a sales motion. So, when I joined Calendly, all of our ARR came from our PLG channel. We didn't have a sales team, we just hired a CRO who was going to build out a sales team. And so, in that world, the way you think about product, the way you think about processes, even the people you have on the team are tailored to that business model. And then, as we sort of moved up market and have now explicitly started to go after teams of users and departments of users and organizations of larger scale, everything about people, process, and product all changes. \n\n(00:24:29):\nI think I touched on culture because I think that's pervasive across the entire organization. The way that things get done has to be highly integrated versus can be a bit more siloed when you're just sort of the self-service PLG business that in many ways runs itself through the product being well optimized. So, there's a lot of process change that needs to happen, the type of people that you need to bring into the organization, that changes as you layer in the new selling motion. And then the product itself of course has to change. \n\n(00:24:56):\nSo, I guess let's just say the example of PLG and SLG or the direct selling motion is tied in to your question around what are the things that need to change in order to get clear on your target user? And I think it's highly cultural in nature across people, across process, and then obviously across the actual product itself.\n\nLenny (00:25:15):\nI have a whole bunch of questions about how Calendly grows and maybe we just get into some of the stuff because I imagine a lot of people are interested. First, let me ask this. I imagine Calendly mostly grows through, I sign up for Calendly, they send it to everyone when I book a meeting and they're like, \"Oh, what is this?\" And they're like, \"Oh, cool, I'm going to use this.\" And then they start using, it spreads, and then sales eventually finds people at a company that are using it a lot and tries to get the whole company in it. Is that roughly right?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:25:39):\nYeah. Seventy percent of our signups come through that viral loop that you referred to. And then, of those signups, then they're usually solo users and then they start to invite team members in and then the team starts using Calendly and then usually the head of that team either inbounds to us or we have some sort of PQL data to know we should go after that team lead to try and have a conversation around expanding Calendly across their entire organization.\n\nLenny (00:26:05):\nAnd PQL, product qualified lead, right?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:26:08):\nYou got it. Yep.\n\nLenny (00:26:08):\nWow, what a loop. What a magical way to grow that everybody wishes they could have.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:26:14):\nIt's pretty incredible, I will say.\n\nLenny (00:26:16):\nOh man. Okay, so going back to the question. When did Calendly hire their first salesperson, like any learnings about just how to start down that road once you start a product?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:26:25):\nYeah. As I mentioned, when I joined two years ago, we just hired our first CRO and the PLG business really represented 99% of our ARR. And then, over the last two years, we've scaled the sales team in our SLG motion. Our sales led growth motion now represents about 20% of our ARR and it's actually the fastest growing segment of the business. I think there's probably two things I would touch on in terms of early sales hires. I think the first is, when you're making that transition from PLG to adding in the sales led motion, because you're starting from PLG, it's tends to be much more inbound in nature. You've got these sales reps who are working leads who have usually proactively reached out interested or as we mentioned PQLs. They have data to tell them that this is someone who has usage within their team, and therefore, we should reach out. \n\n(00:27:17):\nAnd so, that's a very different profile of a sales team member than you might need after you need to pursue more of a heavy outbound motion, more of a hunter profile than a grower profile. So, I think that's the first piece is just make sure you think about the motion when you're moving towards a sales led model. In those early days, it's more inbound in nature, and so the type of sales reps you might need are not necessarily going to be outbound, heavy kind of hunting sales reps.\n\nLenny (00:27:46):\nJust one quick question on that actually, because that's really interesting. I don't know how involved you are in hiring these folks, but is it like, look at their background and they've worked at a company like that? Or is it personality type? Is there anything to look for specifically there?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:27:58):\nYeah, I think it is mostly background and the type of selling that they've done previously more so than personality type. But I think the second piece, that's important too, and I'll answer your question on that one too, which is the target buyer. So, when you transition from PLG to sales led or adding this direct sales motion, the buyer is usually just the department head. It's the head of sales, it's the head of rev ops, it's the head of recruiting and it's not a senior person in IT or the CIO. And so, selling into this audience is different than selling into IT.\n\n(00:28:32):\nAnd so, I think you have to be sure again that you have the right fit of sales folks with the target buyer in those early days. And so, to your question around what's that mean? You wouldn't necessarily want to bring on a bunch of sales folks who are at Oracle who are heavy in selling into CIOs in the early days because that's just not who you're the buyer's going to be. I mean, think we will graduate there eventually, but it's probably going to start from team lead to someone in IT to eventually a CIO led purchase, but that's certainly several years away. And so, making sure that the profile, the folks you're bringing on early match that target buyer in addition to match the motion around how you're going to be acquiring customers.\n\nLenny (00:29:15):\nAnd to see that, is it similar? You look at the companies they worked at, it's like PLG-ish companies.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:29:20):\nDefinitely. Yeah, exactly. Yep. Yep. \n\nLenny (00:29:23):\nOkay. So, along the same lines, as a product leader working with a strong and large sales team, anything you've learned about just how to build that relationship and build a product org that works really closely and well with a sales org?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:29:37):\nThe first piece that really starts with is customer empathy. And at the end of the day, seeing the sales team and the go-to-market team as this really great asset that can help you as a product manager get closer to the customer. So, I've certainly seen organizations or been in organizations where the product team doesn't necessarily want to be bothered by sales, but I sort of flip that on the head and say sales and sort of the go-to-market teams in general could be your biggest asset to helping you get your job done well.\n\n(00:30:07):\nWhen I was at Box, I was a product manager on the enterprise team and I spent a ton of time in the field and I don't know how I would possibly know how to have what to have built or how to build it to solve the needs of our customers if I didn't have that close relationship with the sales team and be able to lean on them because they're talking to, 10X of them were customers that I was able to ever talk to within any given week, really lean on them to be the voice of the customer to help me make the best product decisions that I could.\n\nLenny (00:30:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. \n\n(00:31:00):\nAlso, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC two, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time. Lenny's podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

There are salespeople coming at you, there's issues you're probably having, there are some founders wanting to ask you for few stuffs, just like a classic product management question. But I'm curious if you found any frameworks or approaches for just deciding what to actually build of all the things you're hearing.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:32:09):\nThe core challenge of being a product manager, right?\n\nLenny (00:32:12):\nJust to add that I feel like the core job of PM is just tell people what's next, what's the next thing.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:32:16):\nThat's right, and hopefully, you have a good reasoning as to why that thing, next is going to have the biggest impact, which is really where I start. I think it really starts with a clear product strategy that will dictate a few things. And I like this framework that's taken from a book called Playing to Win and it talks about how strategy is really just an integrated set of choices that outline how you're going to win in whatever marketplace you choose. And so, a good product strategy is going to answer questions like, what's your sort of winning aspiration, but maybe more importantly, where are you going to play? What are the markets you're going to go after? What are the segments of those markets? What are the personas in the segments of those markets? And then, how are you going to win with a target audience?\n\n(00:32:59):\nAnd so, what I think this framework does kind of dovetails back to what I was saying before around prioritization is it forces you to create clarity around where you're going to play and where you're not going to play. And so, this really helps the product team hone in on delivering value for a very clear set of people versus trying to build something for everyone. And so, once you've established what that strategy is or what the playing field you're going to go after, then I think you can divide up your product work and service of that strategy. \n\n(00:33:28):\nSo, I'll give you an example. At Calendly, we have the sort of vision, our winning aspiration to become the best place to schedule, prepare for and follow up on your external meetings. And then, we've articulated three horizons around how we're going to get there. Now, the year one that I was here, the percentage of resources we spent on that first horizon and the second horizon was about a 70/30 split and we put 0% of our resources on horizon three. That was too far out in the future and we didn't want to make any investments there quite yet, but we knew where we were going.\n\n(00:34:00):\nIn year two, it shifted. We went to a 50/50 split between horizon one and horizon two, but still, no explicit investments in Horizon three. And then, as we're entering to year three now, we've significantly scaled back the investment in horizon one, that's about 30% and then we've got 60% in horizon two and call it 10 in horizon three. So, I think just to close on the question of prioritization, I think it starts with a really clear product strategy which defines where you're going to play and how you're going to win. And then, the work and the percentage of allocation just should feed right into that product strategy and how you're doing against where you need to be in order to achieve ultimately your winning aspiration.\n\nLenny (00:34:38):\nI don't know how much you could share here, but is there a feature that is people keep asking for it and it hasn't been built because of the strategy, the long-term vision, something that's like, \"Nope, it doesn't fit. We're not going to do this.\"\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:34:50):\nYeah, I think the best example I can give is there's lots of small businesses and solopreneurs who would love us to have a Venmo integration. We have a PayPal integration. But our target market that we're really trying to go after as our primary persona are as I've mentioned, these sort of core ICPs within organizations. So, sales teams, recruiting teams, customer success teams. And so, it doesn't make sense within those personas to pursue something like a Venmo integration. Now, there's a lot of things we'll build for those personas that are going to help the small business, the solopreneur, the freelancer, but that specific feature is something that would be clearly deprioritized given the current strategy.\n\nLenny (00:35:29):\nThat's an awesome example. I want to get back to the growth stuff, but before I do that, we're kind of on this topic of planning and a cares and prioritization. I'd love to know just how you do planning at Calendly? How far out do you plan in detail? How far do you have roadmaps? How often do you plan? Anything you can share there?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:35:45):\nThis starts again, I sound like a broken record, but with this really clear strategy around where we're going over the next couple of years and then we take that and we break that down into what are the most important things we need to do as a company this year in order to be able to make the right progress against that strategy. So, we have the company level OKRs and I mentioned that we have about three of those this year. And then, those KRs within the company, OKRs are measured annually, but we have milestones across a quarterly basis so we can measure progress more frequently than obviously on the annual or semi-annual basis.\n\n(00:36:19):\nSo, I think that's kind of at the high level. And then, obviously our product roadmaps are going to be in support of those key results that we needed to deliver to the business over the course of the year, but then broken down on a quarterly basis.\n\n(00:36:30):\nI think one thing I'll just touch on real fast on is estimations and dates. Something we've done over the last year is really kind of moved to a model of talking about dates and promising and committing to dates that are within our control. And so, if you think about the product development life cycle, we can commit to a discovery effort of doing research around a certain problem space and we can have a general sense of when we know that effort's going to conclude. We don't know if we're going to actually end up going, and based on the results whether we're going to actually move forward with investing in that area, but that's a body of work we can commit to. \n\n(00:37:05):\nFrom there, we then move into, \"Okay, if this is something a problem space we want to go after, we're going to go work on a couple different solutions and we're going to go do some user testing and we're going to land on a solution,\" and that's another sort of phase we can commit to. Then, once we actually have that completed and we actually know not just the problem but the solution, we can do estimation planning and actually have a date for delivery from an engineering perspective. And so, we've gotten a lot better at making the commitments around the work that's right in front of us versus making a commitment around a project six months out when we haven't even done enough discovery, enough design and ideation to have a real clear understanding of estimation.\n\nLenny (00:37:43):\nThat is really cool. Do you have terms for these phases, like these phases you have to get through these kinds of gates? Yeah, how do you describe that?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:37:50):\nYeah, so the first phase we just call generally discovery. The second phase, we call solutioning. The third phase, build. And then, the fourth phase is launch, measure and iterate. \n\nLenny (00:37:50):\nCool. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:38:01):\nAnd then, we've designed the product development lifecycle around that framework.\n\nLenny (00:38:04):\nSo, discovery for example, is that a roadmap item for a quarter and that's like what you've committed to? And if that goes well, the next quarter has the next step.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:38:12):\nYeah, exactly. You got it.\n\nLenny (00:38:14):\nSweet. Okay. In terms of the strategy artifacts, how does that look or do you have a Google Doc with a template that you all use? What does that look like? What's interesting about people not working at a company or working at just one company is they only have, strategy documents are really hard to see and see examples of. So, I'm always curious what these looks like. So, whatever you can share about what they look like and where you put them and how long and that kind of thing.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:38:40):\nWe have a couple of different layers of this. I think the first is this high-level three-year strategy and this is actually called at the company level. So, if the doc, it also has slides that have been presented many times to the company when we're in the process of making sure that, that is part of new hire orientation so that everyone should understand where are we going over the next three years and then therefore how does this year's objectives fit into that. So, I think that's at that level. \n\n(00:39:07):\nAnd then, from there, we've got our product team OKRs. These generally start by docs and we write them in docs. So, they usually get translated into slides at some point for presentation purposes to the company and those are stored centrally in a location and then you get down to the feature level or the project level. And we have different kind of templates for the teams to use based on the type of work that they're going to be doing. And we're a pretty heavy Confluence culture, so we tend to use Confluence as one of the tools for housing and storing information around the work that's being done.\n\nLenny (00:39:39):\nCool. So, maybe on that topic, what else is in the stack of Calendly product team tools?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:39:44):\nWe talked about roadmap planning, some combination of starts with docs, there's mural boards involved. Usually, it ends in slides. Then actually roadmap tracking, we use Aha and we use Airtable collaboration/communication. We use Slack, we use Loom, bug management, we use Jira. I'm trying to think of, is there any other?\n\nLenny (00:39:44):\nConfluence, you mentioned.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:40:05):\nConfluence. Yep. Confluence is what we use quite a bit. Pando, we use quite a bit of Pando to help educate users within the product when we're launching new features. Yeah, I think that's the main stack.\n\nLenny (00:40:16):\nAnd docs is Google Docs and slides is Google Slides.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:40:19):\nYou got it. Yep. \n\nLenny (00:40:20):\nSweet. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:40:21):\nThat's right. \n\nLenny (00:40:21):\nOkay. I'm going to bounce around and go back to growth questions and then I have a couple more product team questions. How did Calendly get their first thousand users? \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:40:30):\nA great question and I had to fact check it with my CEO earlier this morning, but there's actually a few really interesting things about this story and a few things that Tope did in the early days to get 2,000 users. So, for those who aren't familiar Tope, our CEO and founder started his career in sales and he spent lots of years in sales. And so, he was very used to the challenges of trying to organize external meetings with prospective customers. So, he knew the problem space really, really well. And he had evaluated all the scheduling solutions that were on the market and came to conclusion that there really weren't any great products out there and especially there weren't any great products for the recipient of the actual booking service. And so, I think he saw this as an opportunity for disruption. So, he raided his 401k, he took out all his savings. He didn't make raise any money. \n\nLenny (00:41:23):\nThat's a lot of penalties, taking out money at that point. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:41:23):\nSort of. That's a very good point. I've never asked him about that. And he hired an outside development firm actually in out of the Ukraine to build the first version of Calendly. So, that's the background on Calendly. Why it's important is that the first 10 users were actually customer success agents at a company in the education space that contracted with the same firm that Tope was using to build Calendly. So, he really found his first set of users through the firm that he was using to build the product. \n\n(00:41:51):\nAnd then, those CSMs or customer success managers were actually using Calendly to schedule calls with parents in K through 12 education. And so, then those parents started using Calendly for their own parent-teacher conference scheduling. And then from there, the school started using it and then all the parents within the school started using it for lots of other use cases and it grew organically from there. So that was one piece.\n\n(00:42:17):\nI think the other piece that's really important is that he started off by just having a free tier. The entire product was free. Some of this came from honestly not being able to actually build the billing infrastructure that would be required to actually charge. So, it came a little bit out of necessity, but it was also free. So not only was it a better product than the alternatives out there, but it was also free. So, the combination of the viral loop and coming in through getting those first 10 users as part of the firm he was using and then the free aspect or I think what led to the first 2,000, and then 10,000, and millions of users from there.\n\nLenny (00:42:52):\nThat is crazy. I have never heard a story like that where the team that is building your product ends up being the source of initial growth.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:42:58):\nI know, pretty crazy.\n\nLenny (00:43:00):\nOh my God. So many nice things happening in this history of Calendly.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:03):\nI know.\n\nLenny (00:43:03):\nAnd wow, in Ukraine. So, I'm actually from Ukraine.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:08):\nOh nice. That's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:43:08):\nThat's pretty cool.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:09):\nYeah, they're great. [inaudible 00:43:11].\n\nLenny (00:43:11):\nYeah, and it's also interesting that it's rare that you hear a successful business starts with contractor engineers. I think OICs are like, \"Do not do that.\" So that's a cool counter example of it can actually work out, especially if they're your first users and spread it to others. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:27):\nAnd we still work with them. They're fantastic and they have incredible engineers, so they're still part of our culture, which is great.\n\nLenny (00:43:32):\nSo, Calendly got big in Ukraine, it sounds like initially.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:35):\nThere you go. There you go.\n\nLenny (00:43:37):\nWhat's something that would surprise people in terms of how Calendly grows today or grew through its history?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:43:43):\nMost people probably think about Calendly as the scheduling link and really for individual users to reduce the back and forth of email and scheduling. So, they think of that one-on-one use case and I think people would be surprised to learn that our team's business, so multiple users in an organization who want to collaboratively schedule together is growing much faster than our solo user business. And that's really where the future of where we think growth will come from is supporting these teams of users who are in externally facing roles and selling into departments and supporting multi-departmental deployments of Calendly across an entire organization. \n\n(00:44:17):\nSo, I think it's still really well known as this solo user tool to eliminate the back and forth of email, but the growth of what we're seeing and where we think it's going to go is actually more teams of users and departments of users and then multiple departments in an organization.\n\nLenny (00:44:32):\nIt's interesting when you hear the story of Calendly that just has so many good things happening, basically for free, it's just grows so well. I think people don't realize you eventually will, that'll slow down, it'll taper off eventually. You'll need to drive growth very actively in these new ways that you're describing. And I think people don't often realize that they just wanted to find something that was viral and then things are going to go great, but it tapers off.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:44:54):\nYeah. I mean, there's only so many people who, solo users who are going to pull out a credit card. And I think once you also get to hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue scale, just the law of large numbers, it means that growth will slow. And so, you have to figure out where's that next growth curve going to come from. I think the beauty of Calendly is that while we certainly have built features and functionality to support teams and departments, we got pulled there. It wasn't one of those things where we sort of said, \"We need to find our next growth lever. Let's go build X.\" Our customers really pulled us there by the way that they were using the product. \n\n(00:45:30):\nAnd so again, a very fortunate position to be in, but when you can see in the data and see how customers are using it, that they want to be working on scheduling with their teams, that was our early sign, that's where the business was going to go in the future.\n\nLenny (00:45:46):\nI don't think I mentioned this, I'm paying user of Calendly. It's what I use for booking these podcast episodes.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:45:50):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (00:45:50):\nYou got me. I think I started when it was totally free and I was like, \"How will they ever make money?\" This is too much power. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:45:56):\nAnd then, now, you learned that it was free almost by accident.\n\nLenny (00:46:02):\nYep. I was like, \"Yeah, please take my money. This makes my life easier.\" What are some fun or unique traditions and cultural kind of components of the Calendly product team?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:46:12):\nA couple of fun ones I thought we could talk about. One, we have a meeting called OPA, which stands for opportunity/problem, assessment. And so, what this is, it's a meeting where basically PMs, I don't even go to it's a meeting for PMs to really debate and discuss with each other and spar around either areas and problems that they want to go investigate or after they've gotten data back or research back from evaluating an opportunity, deciding whether we actually want to move forward and go try to develop a solution. So, it's really in the product development lifecycle of letting product managers really get into a room with each other on a frequent basis and just think through things, debate, discuss. And I know that they all get a lot of value out of that.\n\nLenny (00:46:59):\nIt reminds me of something just like a bad version of that. I had a friend who was a PM at Zynga and he said there's a meeting where PMs present their plans to all the other PM. It was like you're in a shark tank where everyone's coming to destroy you. They just point out all the problems. That's all it ever is in this.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:47:15):\nI would say on this one, it's the opposite where I feel like everyone really needs the meeting. They're like, \"Ugh, I really need to take this to OPA because I need to, I'm working through these problems and I really want to bounce it off of other people.\" So, I could imagine a world where it would be that. Actually, part of the reason I don't go to the meeting is that I really want everyone to be able to be open and transparent and provide feedback and not feel like there's any judgment from me or any needing to act a certain way because I'm in the room. So, that's sort of why I intentionally don't go. \n\n(00:47:44):\nAnother fun one we do is something we call competitive work gaming. So, on some sort of time interval, sometimes it's been quarterly, we'll have assigned people into groups for the quarter to own a competitor. And their job is to essentially spend a lot of time immersing themselves into the product of the competitor, really trying to think through the lens of, do a SWAT analysis, really try to think through the lens of where's this competitor going and how Calendly only think about that and as it relates to our strategy. \n\n(00:48:12):\nAnd so, we spent a quarter doing that and then we have the competitive war gaming day where every team comes and presents and there's prizes and it's a lot of fun, but it's a really great way to stay on top of what's happening across the market without requiring every product manager designer to be deep in the weeds, there are a lot of different competitors. We can bring all of that knowledge together through what we call competitive work gaming. \n\nLenny (00:48:34):\nThat is cool. It's really impressive how you do these exercises and they seem really positive and friendly and constructive. It sounds like there is a pretty unique culture at Calendly. I'm curious if there's anything else that's core to the values or the way that you think about the principles of building product at Calendly.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:48:51):\nWhat I touched on earlier is really core to how we build product, which is honing in on this target user and honing in on our target market. I do think it's quite rare. I think in most organizations that I've seen, I think there's a desire to do that. But I think, again, when it push comes to shove, it's really hard for executives to make decisions that say no to things. One of Calendly's actually core principles is focus wisely. It's pretty deeply embedded into our culture. And so, I think one of the reasons that I've been successful in being able to create the clarity around who the target personas are is because I think it's embedded into the culture of Calendly to focus wisely. \n\n(00:49:29):\nSo, I don't know that it'll work in every organization. I think many organizations really struggle to say no, and they're always adding more onto the plate versus taking off. But I do think from an ethos perspective, there is something around focusing and the ability to focus to therefore deliver the highest quality of product that you can to your target customers. That is unique and I think it starts with some of the broader cultural paradigms that exist at the company and then we've now embedded that into the way we think about how we build product.\n\nLenny (00:49:59):\nIs there anything else you do to instill that? It sounds like it's a core value. Do you put posters around the office? So how else do you keep people focused? \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:50:06):\nWe're a fully remote company. So, now you've got my brain going on. Are there some sort of virtual sticky notes that you could get people to put onto their laptops to remind them?\n\nLenny (00:50:15):\nBackgrounds to show us [inaudible 00:50:16]. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:50:15):\nYeah, exactly. Yeah, it's embedded into a lot of the documentation. So, it's embedded into the templates that I talked about in terms of, everything from sort of the way we structure that OPA, document that folks are going to be working on and debating too when they go to create the actual sort of PRD. When teams come in to present as part of our product reviews, we have a template that keeps reinforcing who's the target customer, who's the target user within that customer base, what are their needs and then how are we going to solve their needs better than any alternative that there is on the market. So, I think there's lots of different reinforcing mechanisms to that focus.\n\nLenny (00:50:57):\nI feel like sometimes things like that come from a big problem the company had and then you index weigh the other side, focus, here's the four people we all build for. It becomes instilled in the culture.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:51:08):\nAnd I think you're right. I mean, because Calendly started as such a horizontal product, which was amazing because that's how it grew so virally and so it had the entry, the wedge into scheduling and how our first horizon and becoming the best horizontal scheduling automation platform was because we had that horizontal focus. And so, it was a blessing. But as we think about transitioning to horizon two, which is really about deepening our support for these teams and departmental users as well as verticals, that's I think the inflection point where we said, in order to shift us from horizon one to horizon two, we need to be making some real trade off decisions and we need to create this focus so that we can actually allow teams to go do that. \n\n(00:51:52):\nSo, I think it's a really good point. We sort of had to create clarity around focus because we were trying to make a shift from broad horizontal platform serving lots of users to a deeper investment into specific users and specific teams of users within departments.\n\nLenny (00:52:07):\nBefore Calendly, you were at Box. Before that, you were at Glassdoor. I'm going to ask two different questions. You could pick which direction you want to go. What would you say are the biggest differences culturally between these three? If you had to bucket, here's how I'd describe Glassdoor, Box, Calendly. Or what did you take from those two places that you bring with you to Calendly and future opportunities?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:52:27):\nI love this question. So, they're all different, which is why I just feel so fortunate to have had experiences that were all quite different. So, starting with Box, maybe I'll take your second question. Box, when I joined, we were in the process of moving up market and trying to capture as much enterprise market share as possible, and I was on the enterprise product management team. So, I spent a lot of time, as I mentioned earlier, talking to customers. And in my first year in particular trying to ramp on the business. And I'd say my biggest learning during that time was around how to ask the right questions to really understand the why behind what a customer was asking for and then figuring out how to build a solution to their problem that would also meet the needs of a broader swath of customers.\n\n(00:53:07):\nIt became very clear early to me if I would just go build what customer A wanted and what customer B wanted and the customer C wanted, not only would that be wasted effort to do it three times, but more importantly, what they wanted me to go build was going to have a negative impact on the end user experience. And preserving that end user experience was so critical. So, learning how to ask the right questions to understand the actual problem and then build the solution that's going to be most scalable to that problem set across lots of customers was probably my biggest learning from Box.\n\n(00:53:37):\nMoving to Glassdoor, totally different business model. Glassdoor is actually really more of a consumer business and 60 million unique users go to Glassdoor every month and it's a marketplace between job seekers and employers and it's highly, highly dependent on the consumer engagement, growing traffic, getting that traffic to come and engage and apply to jobs. And so, during my time as CPO there, I was responsible now for both sides of that marketplace, the consumer business and the B2B. And so, I learned all about how do you build PR consumer products, how do you think about optimization of a funnel? How do you think about building up a growth team and growth as a discipline? How do you use data and AB testing to make decisions? \n\n(00:54:17):\nSo, I think that kind of consumer mentality and how you approach product, I then have brought with me to Calendly, which is really a blend of both, right? Calendly is first, as we've talked about a PLG business and it looks a lot more like a consumer business like Glassdoor. And then, it's got this direct selling business that looks a lot more like Box's enterprise business. So, I think I've been able to take kind of lessons learned from both Box and Glassdoor and apply them together to Calendly.\n\nLenny (00:54:43):\nWhat a cool set of experiences. I'm trying to imagine you using all three in the same day. Sending a Calendly, storing your files in a Box and looking at reviews...\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:54:53):\nAnd recruiting.\n\nLenny (00:54:54):\nAnd recruiting. Yeah, yeah. Not looking for anything new. Okay. Final question. You are part of something called the Skip community, which I believe Nikhyl and a few people run. And so, I'd love to just hear a little bit about that and maybe how folks can join if they might be a fit.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:55:08):\nYeah, as you mentioned about two years ago, Nikhyl, who was the former CPO of Credit Karma and is now a VP of product at Meta, got a small group of CPOs together who were all going through similar phases of companies' growth, late stage growth companies, and we all were facing the same challenges in our roles. And he formalized this community as a way to help us gather advice from one another, talk through how to manage challenges we're facing and just make us more successful in the roles. And we always joke, we're like the support group. \n\n(00:55:37):\nWe meet on Sundays and it has been incredibly valuable as I've sort of gone through the last couple of years in my role at Calendly. Since then, we've grown the group to about 23 heads of products and CPOs and expanded the charter a bit, which I think is interesting to help product leaders not just be successful in their current role, but also how to think about setting them up for success in the role after this.\n\n(00:55:59):\nAnd so, we're experimenting with a couple of different interesting ways to help product leaders grow. One of them is we're actually partnering with some companies right now to experiment with how can we help them as they're looking to make their first head of product hire or their first C O hire really hone in on what they're looking for and partnering with the talent partners we know to really help try to increase the success that they find the right candidates. That's something interesting we're doing. \n\n(00:56:23):\nWe also recently launched a podcast covering some topics like, how do you manage the next job search, how do you avoid burnout, breaking down things like equity, and other kind of timely topics. And then also, we just have an active Discord server where we've got all sorts of channels from topics, how to manage the CEO/CPO partnership, compensation, even sharing planning, even sharing some advising opportunities or other CPO roles that kind of come across our radar. \n\n(00:56:53):\nSo, it's been a really, really cool kind of experiment to see how the power of the community. And I know Lenny, you do a ton of stuff around community, how that has helped all of us. I think it's just more effective in our roles and feel like we have a group of people who are behind us supporting us during what is a very hard role.\n\nLenny (00:57:11):\nI love this. I imagine when people look at a CPO, they imagine they just know everything already. They have a bunch of friends in the same role, but I think in reality, it's a lonely role a lot of times. And so, I could see the power of something like this just to help people understand who'd be a good fit for this, how do they go find it and yeah, it's like the [inaudible 00:57:33].\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:57:33):\nThe best thing to do is just follow the Skip community on LinkedIn. And then, we're targeting head of products, call it series B, C and beyond, up to late stage growth companies and up to CPOs. So, I'd say start by following the Skip community and if you see folks in there who are in the group, reach out to them to get a sense of what it's like and what it would be like to join.\n\nLenny (00:57:57):\nAnd then, it sounds like if you're a company hiring a CPO, maybe reach out too.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:00):\nYeah, that'd be great. That'd be great. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nOkay. And they do that by going to LinkedIn also and looking for the Skip community?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:06):\nYeah, that'd be great.\n\nLenny (00:58:07):\nOkay, cool. We'll put all the links in the show notes as well. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:15):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny (00:58:17):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:20):\nPlaying to Win, so, I reference that one earlier, Good to Great, and Hooked.\n\nLenny (00:58:25):\nAwesome. What's a favorite other podcast that you enjoy other than maybe this podcast?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:30):\nI think I got introduced to you by Harry from the 20VC, I think. But if not, either way, I'll cross promote his podcast, which is a great one.\n\nLenny (00:58:39):\nYeah, Harry's responsible for this podcast. I was on his podcast and he's like, \"Lenny, you should be [inaudible 00:58:43]\".\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:43):\nYou got to do it.\n\nLenny (00:58:46):\nHe's the godfather of this podcast. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:48):\nHe is. That's great. \n\nLenny (00:58:49):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show? And you cannot say White Lotus.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:58:53):\nI have two young kids. So, whether I like it or not, Sing 2. It's a great movie, especially if you have young children.\n\nLenny (00:59:00):\nSing 2. So, it's like the second of Sing?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:03):\nIt is. It is. Distinct from Sing 1. Sing 2 is better.\n\nLenny (00:59:07):\nIt's better. Okay, cool. I haven't seen it.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:10):\nI would hope you haven't.\n\nLenny (00:59:11):\nOkay, cool. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people you interview.\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:15):\nTalk me through your biggest product flop. What happened and what did you do about it?\n\nLenny (00:59:21):\nWhat do you look for in an answer? What's a sign of something good in their answer?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:24):\nPeople being brutally honest around how bad it was and why it failed. The rest of the interview, they're trying to tell you all the wonderful things they did and all the accomplishments they had. And so, I think the rawer the answer in terms of how bad it was and why, the better.\n\nLenny (00:59:38):\nAwesome. Next question. I think, you might have answered, what are top five SaaS products you use day-to-day, either at work or home, whatever?\n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:46):\nSlack, Miro, Loom, Pendo, and Confluence.\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nAwesome. And these are actually, unlike other people's answers, so that's really interesting. Kind of a unique stack you got there. \n\nAnnie Pearl (00:59:57):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:59:58):\nFinal question. What's your best Calendly Pro tip?\n\nAnnie Pearl (01:00:01):\nYeah, so we just launched a new feature that I'm loving personally called Customized Once and Share. So, this really allows you to make changes on the fly to an event type and tweak things like title or duration or override a date based on the person you're actually sending it to without having to go create a brand new event type just to make one small change based on the recipient. So, it's that one-off use case where you need to make a little bit of a change on the fly depending on who you're sending it to, but you don't want to go through the effort of creating a brand-new event type. So, I'm loving it and you should check it out. \n\nLenny (01:00:34):\nThat is awesome. I need that. I find that I need to block dates out and change times and I just like go do that on my calendar, in my Calendly.\n\nAnnie Pearl (01:00:42):\nThere you go there. \n\nLenny (01:00:43):\nAll right. Annie, this was amazing. We learned a ton about Calendly growth product building. Two final questions. Where can people find you online if they want to learn more and reach out, maybe ask some questions. And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnnie Pearl (01:00:56):\nFinding me, best place online is LinkedIn. And then, in terms of being helpful to me, one we're hiring at Calendly. So, explore open roles on the product team at Calendly if you're interested. Share any feedback for me on this episode@a.pearl@calendly.com. And then, as we talked about, would love to have you follow the Skip community on LinkedIn as well.\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nAwesome. We'll have all those links in the show notes. Annie, thank you again for being here.\n\nAnnie Pearl (01:01:20):\nThank you so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:01:22):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Building Lovable: $10M ARR in 60 days with 15 people | Anton Osika (CEO and co-founder)\n\n## Transcript\n\nAnton Osika (00:00:00):\n... Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product. The reason is to enable those who have had such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their dreams into reality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:19):\nYou guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe. How did you decide on Lovable is the name. It's so sweet.\n\nAnton Osika (00:00:31):\nThe best word for a great product is that it's lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum lovable product and then building a lovable product and then building an absolutely lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):\nPeople would wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important?\n\nAnton Osika (00:00:51):\nDoing a bit of everything. Being a generalist, I think much more important than it used to be. If I'm putting together a product team today, I would really obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nWhat have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?\n\nAnton Osika (00:01:07):\nPeople love the product. That's the driver of the growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nToday, my guest is Anton O-C-K. Anton is co-founder and CEO of Lovable, which is essentially an AI engineer that takes an English prompt and codes a product for you in minutes. You can then talk to it, iterate on the product, and then launch it to the world. It's one of the fastest growing products in history. The fastest growing startup in Europe ever, and as Anton describes, their goal for Lovable is for it to be the last piece of software that anybody has to write because it'll be able to create all future products for us. They launched just a few months ago in the first four weeks, hit 4 million ARR in the first two months across 10 million ARR, all with just 15 people. Absurd. In our conversation, we covered a lot of ground, including a live demo of Lovable, how their team operates, how they hire, what has most enabled their team to scale this quickly with so few people, pro tips for using Lovable, how it all started, how he recommends you build product teams going forward with tools like this existing, what skills will matter more and less going forward?\n\n(00:02:17):\nPlus how to think about Lovable versus competitors and so much more. If you're trying to wrap your head around how product building will change with the rise of AI tools, this episode is a must watch.

Whether you're sending marketing campaigns, verification codes or account alerts, you need them to reach users reliably. That's where Cinch comes in. Over 150,000 businesses, including eight of the top 10 largest tech companies globally use Cinch's API to build messaging, email and calling into their products. And there's something big happening in messaging that product teams need to know about. Rich Communication Services or RCS, think of RCS as SMS 2.0. Instead of getting texts from a random number, your users will see your verified company name and logo without needing to download anything new. It's a more secure and branded experience, plus you get features like interactive carousels and suggested replies, and here's why this matters. US carriers are starting to adopt RCS. Cinch is already helping Nature Brands send RCS messages around the world and they're helping Lenny's podcast listeners get registered first before the rush hits the US market.

Anton, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAnton Osika (00:05:19):\nIt's a pleasure to talk to you, Lenny, great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:22):\nI don't know how you have time to do this podcast. Your life must be insane these days with the pace at which you guys are scaling, just how much is changing in AI every day. So I just extra appreciate you making time for this. I think you said it's 10:30, your time, is when we're doing this.\n\nAnton Osika (00:05:39):\nI'm a bit tired, yes. Mostly from the crazy pace of everything, but yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:45):\nThis is going to be an invigorating conversation and you're not going to be able to sleep.\n\nAnton Osika (00:05:50):\nYes. I'm sure. I'm sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):\nOkay, so for folks that are maybe a little bit familiar with Lovable or not at all familiar, what is Lovable? What's the simplest way to understand it?\n\nAnton Osika (00:06:00):\nI'd say Lovable is your personal AI software engineer. You describe an idea and then you get a fully working product from the AI. And what this means is that entrepreneurs actually today, they turn their ideas into real businesses. We have a lot of designers and product managers that create the first version of their product ideas to show to the teams, and some of them become founders because of the empowerment from this, but also developers themselves, they actually writing code or creating products much faster. The reason, it's pretty obvious for me, but I'll spell it out, the reason why we're doing Lovable is that I don't know about your mom, but my mom doesn't write code and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:52):\nSame.\n\nAnton Osika (00:06:55):\n... almost all my friends throughout my life reached out for help. Like, \"Anton, I need to build something. How do I find a great software engineer?\" And we are building for this 99% of the population who don't write code. Currently, if you're technically inclined, you get much further, but over time, naturally the way to build software is by just talking to an AI. And that's how we see it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:21):\nI love the way that you guys describe it and you didn't mention it, but I think it's building the last piece of software ever. How do you phrase that?\n\nAnton Osika (00:07:28):\nYeah, we say we're building the last piece of software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:31):\nThe last piece of software. Okay, we're going to do a live demo, but first of all, can you just share some stats on the scale of this business at this point because it's quite absurd.\n\nAnton Osika (00:07:42):\nYeah. So we launched Lovable less than three months ago, and now we have 300,000 monthly active users and 30,000 of those are actually paying and it is growing at the same rates, just almost only through organic word of mouth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:02):\nOkay. And I'll share a couple stats in terms of revenue, just so folks know this, and we'll have this in the intro too. I think you guys hit 4 million ARR in the first four weeks. You hit 10 million ARR in the first two months with just 15 people. You're the fastest growing startup in all of Europe, and you guys had to rewrite your entire code base recently and you couldn't ship any new features for a while. Is that right?\n\nAnton Osika (00:08:26):\nThat's right, yeah. People were saying like, \"Oh, you're shipping so fast.\" And we were all quite frustrated because we wrote our service in this kind of scripting language and then as we started scaling, we were just, no, we have to throw everything away and rewrite it in a more performant way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:43):\nOkay, before we get to the demo, last question, you shared there's some companies that have started based on Lovable. I didn't even know that. So what are some examples of companies slash businesses that have launched off of Lovable and now are actually companies?\n\nAnton Osika (00:08:56):\nI mentioned designers using Lovable and one of our early users, Harry, he started shipping real web apps to his clients instead of just shipping designs. And then he went on to say, okay, wait, I'm going to start an AI startup. And his company, he launched on Product Hunt and everything and making money is just like, let's anyone upload their photo library and then the AI parses and categorizes it. And if you go to launched.lovable.app, this is an app built with Lovable is again a product Hunt version where you can see a lot of businesses or small SaaS featured there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):\nOkay, cool. So we're going to come back to some of this stuff, but let's get into demo. I rarely do demos on this podcast, but I'm finding that I think it's really important for people to see these products in action because in a large part, this is the future of product building and a lot of people hear about, \"Oh yeah, AI's coming,\" and I don't think a lot of people actually see what the latest tools are capable of. And so I love showing these sorts of things on this podcast.\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:05):\nSo Lenny, I was thinking, did you ever consider making a copy and build your own Airbnb?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:14):\nI haven't, but go on.\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:17):\nHow about you do that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:18):\nLet's do it. Let's do it. Okay, so we're going to make our own Airbnb.\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:18):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:21):\nOkay, cool.\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:22):\nSo I just put in the first prompt for an Airbnb clone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:27):\nOkay. And what is the prompt, just for folks that aren't watching?\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:31):\nTwo words, Airbnb clones. That's the prompt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:33):\nOkay.\n\nAnton Osika (00:10:34):\nJust start simple and then what you get is that the AI says, okay, I can go through what does a beautiful Airbnb clone look like and it goes through a bit of design decisions and then I'll zoom out to see more of it. We have this just UI that is... I mean it has all the nice things you would expect from Airbnb clone where you see different categories and you can see two listings from Airbnb with login buttons and everything. So far it doesn't have the functionality of Airbnb, it just has the UI. I would now ask for an improvement on some of the functionality. Like if I'm switching category, I want to see different listings, let's say. But if you have any thoughts on what we should build next, let me know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:25):\nOkay, and so you had this preloaded, so you didn't see how long it would take, but how long would this normally take for it to just write all this code and have it for you?\n\nAnton Osika (00:11:32):\nThe first prompt takes 30 seconds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):\n30 seconds? Okay. And it's like a very good copy of Airbnb. I love that you didn't have to show it a design, you just tell it Airbnb and it knows. Okay, so your question is would I want to add to my own version of Airbnb? I've always wanted to explore buying the place that I look at just like, Is this for sale? So what if we see what that would feel like if you're just a way to buy a listing.\n\nAnton Osika (00:11:59):\nOkay. Okay. So how about we add, I mean prompting is important here, so let's be specific, but we would ask, add a button on the listing which has purchased this Airbnb home. Is that it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):\nPerfect.\n\nAnton Osika (00:12:19):\nOkay, so, add, and [inaudible 00:12:19]. I'll be even more specific. It will pop up a model to purchase the listing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:32):\nPerfect. And I love... So I think something as you're typing, I'm just going to share thoughts as you're doing this. So the site that you asked this AI engineer to build, it's actually a functioning website that you can browse around. It's not just a design, obviously there's no actual listings here, there's no actual houses here. Say you were trying to actually build Airbnb and you wanted to start adding actual homes that plug into this, how does that sort of step work?\n\nAnton Osika (00:13:02):\nSo as you say, this is just kind of the mockup UI, but it's also interactive. If I want to add login and add listing management, then we will connect something called the backend. So where data is stored, where user's log information is stored, and I can show you how to do that. First let's just try out where we got with this short prompt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):\nLet's do it.\n\nAnton Osika (00:13:31):\nAdding the purchase listing and it didn't do exactly what I wanted. I said, add a button... Or I didn't say what a button should say, but it says book now, and if I click book now I get a booking confirmation. So the AI was like, okay, it didn't... It was probably surprised by you wanting to buy the listing since it's Airbnb. So it still says book the listing, but it shows a pretty model where I can click confirm and pay. And then it's says booking confirmed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:05):\nI'll just say real quick, I love that this is actually a really good example of why being a good product manager is important. A lot of wasted time happens when you're not clear about the problem you're trying to solve and why you're trying to solve it and all that kind of stuff. So it's really cool that this is a use case where you have to be really good at explaining what it is you want. And it's interesting, you don't have to tell this AI-why. Humans want to understand, \"Why is this important.\" Mostly you need to be very clear about what it is you're doing and I love that's a really strong PM skill. Your PM's really good at that. So we have to...\n\nAnton Osika (00:14:39):\nHey. Explaining exactly what you expect and what you're not getting is even more important with AI than with the humans. So I'm going into hooking up more of the actual functionality, but first I'll actually show you something. What's the fastest way to change what went wrong, it's created buttons that say book now and I want them to say, \"Buy now.\" And what I could do is select this item and say change it to buy now. But what we just realized is that you can actually edit this, this is a fully functioning product, but you can edit it visually like you do in Squarespace and Wix and so on. So I'll just change the text to buy now and then it instantly changes. It actually changes deep down in the code base, but it's very fast to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:35):\nSo I think people listening to this and seeing this, if you're not aware this is the cutting edge of tools like this, no other tool out there lets you generate code from an AI engineer and then actually just change a small element of it of every other tool that I'm aware of. You have to ask the agent, do this for me, and then you hope that it does the right thing. So this is a huge deal which you just showed. Right?\n\nAnton Osika (00:16:00):\nYeah. Now it says buy now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:01):\nOkay. Like that's amazing. Okay, and that's something you just launched?\n\nAnton Osika (00:16:04):\nYeah. Great. We just launched this a few days ago, but I won't go into for building the full functionality, but what it looks like is that you connect an open source backend as a service and that's called SuperBase. And I have this instance to connect to that's completely empty, just like one click to set that up and now it's connected to the backend. It's just automatically generating some code and explaining what I can do next. And what I would do now is, say, let's add login, let's say let's add login.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):\nAnd where is it actually hosted on the backend and everything in general?\n\nAnton Osika (00:16:45):\nSo everything can be one click deployed and then it's running. It's hosted by a cloud vendor, which is hosting, I think a huge chunk of the internet, it's called Cloudflare, and the backend is hosted by also good cloud writer, which is called SuperBase.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:07):\nAmazing. Okay, let's wrap up the demo, that was... Unless there's anything else, was there anything else really important that you wanted to show?\n\nAnton Osika (00:17:14):\nNo I'll just explain what I would do next. I would say, okay, let's add login. Let's make the listings editable by the users so users can upload listings and then this is going to take a bit more time, but with patience and good prompting skills, you're going to get to a full working Airbnb.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:33):\nThat was a really good piece to add. So basically this is getting to a place where it actually is not so different from actual Airbnb. People can log in, they can add their home, you can add internal tools to add listings for your, say, sales team, ops team. Basically it just will allow you to build a marketplace that looks a lot like Airbnb. Amazing. Okay, thank you for the demo. I think for a lot of people they're like, \"Yeah, yeah, I've seen this kind of stuff,\" for most people, like, \"Holy shit.\" It's unreal what... It's almost like we're taking for granted now. You can ask an app to build you a whole website and that costs probably like a few pennies. It took like five minutes versus it would've been tens of thousands and weeks and weeks and months to even build just a prototype.\n\nAnton Osika (00:18:23):\nI mean, these tools as we see here, they're already very good, it looks really good as well, but mainly I would say they're getting better very, very fast. And I'd say one of the bigger bottlenecks is now they're not integrated into the current way that you have your existing products and so on. But since they're getting better so fast, I think the best thing for people who are interested in this or interested in just being a part of the future economies, get your hands very dirty with these tools because being in the top 10% in using them is going to absolutely set you apart in the coming months and years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:05):\nSo let me follow that thread. So say you are magically able to sit next to everybody that is using Lovable for the first time and you could just whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with Lovable, what would that tip be?\n\nAnton Osika (00:19:20):\nIt takes a lot to master using tools like Lovable and being very curious and patient and we have something called chat mode where you can just ask to understand like, \"How does this work? I'm not getting what I want here, am I missing something? What should I do?\" Is the best way to be productive is also one of the best ways to just learn about how software engineering works, which is you don't have to write the code anymore, but it is useful to understand how software engin- or how building products works. So I think that's the patience and curiosity is super useful. The second part that we spoke about is that being, if I would sit next to you, I would probably say like, \"Hey, you are not being super clear here.\" For example, don't say it doesn't work. Just explain exactly what you're expecting and which parts are working and which parts are not working. And that's something that a lot of people don't do naturally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):\nI love that when you have an engineer you're working with that does a very expensive mistake to miscommunicate something, to just forget about a feature, to forget a better requirement, and here it's... You do that and then 30 seconds later you're like, \"Oh okay, sorry, that was wrong.\" And then you could just try again.\n\nAnton Osika (00:20:41):\nThat's true. It might be more costly with humans.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:45):\nOkay, and so the first step is chat mode. So your advice is chat with the... What do you call it? Do you call it an agent? What's the term for the thing that you were talking with?\n\nAnton Osika (00:20:57):\nYeah, Lovable is an agent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:59):\nJust Lovable?\n\nAnton Osika (00:20:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:00):\nOkay. So you're talking about Lovable by the way. How decide on Lovable as the name? It's so sweet.\n\nAnton Osika (00:21:06):\nI think it's all about building a great product. That's what I want more people to be able to do and the best word for a great product is that it's Lovable. A lot of jargon that I like to use to emphasize what we should be striving for is building a minimum Lovable product and then building a Lovable product and then building an absolutely Lovable product. So I took that jargon with me in the company name.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:36):\nThat is great. Absolute Lovable product. ALP is the new MVP. Okay, so we talked about this, the scale you guys have hit at this point, I imagine it's far beyond 10 million ARR. Do you share that at this point or are you keeping that private?\n\nAnton Osika (00:21:51):\nWe don't anchor on the numbers, but I could probably do a two X tweet about this quite soon. Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:57):\nOkay, so it's far beyond 10 million ARR at this point. It's one of the fastest growing startups in history, the fastest growing startup in Europe. I want to zoom us back to the beginning. What is the origin story of Lovable? How did it all begin? What was the journey to today?\n\nAnton Osika (00:22:14):\nI think I was not impressed by what people were doing with the large language models [inaudible 00:22:21], especially after I was using them way back. But when ChatGPT came out, they were starting to get really good at taking a human instruction and spitting out code and then people in my team, I was the CTO at a YC startup, they felt like, \"Oh, Anton, you're exaggerating. This is not going to change anything in the coming years.\" So I wanted to prove a point and I created an open source tool called GPT Engineer where you write something like create a snake game and then it spits out a lot of code, a little of different files and then opens the snake game. And then I tweeted a video about that and GPT Engineer is to date the most popular open source tool to showcase the ability for large language models to create applications and it's at like 50 something thousand GitHub stars and dozens of academic references.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:21):\nAnd I know that I'll just add that it GitHub shut you down because they thought it was some kind of attack, like how many stars you're getting, how many people were using it,\n\nAnton Osika (00:23:29):\nRight. Yeah. So that came later. That's with Lovable. So this is Lovable. Lovable, earlier was always creating new projects on GitHub when someone used Lovable and we asked them, \"Is it fine? How was the limits here?\" They said, \"Oh, there are no limits.\" But once we started creating 15,000 projects per day, so there were a lot of usage. Then some engineer when was on call, maybe they woke up in the night and they saw their servers were taking too much load because of us. So then they shut off down completely and we got this email that said, \"Oh, you broke some kind of rules and we didn't know what was going on.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:13):\nThat's similar to a story I heard when ChatGPT was originally being trained, Microsoft servers blocked it because they thought it was some crawler and it was just actually the very first version ChatGPT being trained on data. Anyway, keep going.\n\nAnton Osika (00:24:29):\nSo I built this tool called GPT Engineer and I was thinking about we're seeing the biggest change humanity will ever see, I think, where before you had the manual labor being taken over by machines, but now it's actually cognitive labor being done better than humans by machines and what's the best way to have some kind of positive impact here? It's not to make engineers more productive, which there's a lot of companies using AI to make engineers more productive, Microsoft did with co-pilot and so on. But it is to enable those who have such a hard time finding people who are good at creating software that's been their absolute bottleneck and let them take their ideas and their beliefs into reality. So enabling more entrepreneurship and innovation by building the AI software engineer for anyone. And then I grabbed a previous colleague of mine who has also been a founder, Fabian, and I said we should build something like GPT Engineer but it has to be for the people who don't write code and that's the story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:43):\nOkay. And then that became lovable? There's the shift from open source into a product that anyone can use but also pay for. Makes sense. Okay, so from that point I saw a stat that you started making a million dollars in ARR per week and once you launched lovable, is that true?\n\nAnton Osika (00:26:00):\nYeah, so launched, we actually called the first version of the product like GPT Engineer app and it was very different in some ways and we launched that under a waitlist and said like, Oh yeah, we have this waitlist and we got a lot of feedback and iterated. Finally, when we thought the product was really good we said okay, now we have a Lovable product. And it was mainly on the AI that we did a lot of improvements, once we launched that, that was 21st of November, so that's almost three months ago. We just hit 1 million ARR in a week and then it kept growing at that pace. It still growing at even faster than that pace.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):\nFaster than 1 million ARR per week. Holy shit.\n\nAnton Osika (00:26:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:48):\nOkay, that sounds like product market fit to me. You said that you did a lot of work on the backend. I saw you tweet about this that you guys figured out some kind of unlock on scalability, like a new scaling law that allowed you to build something like this. What can you talk about there that on the technical element allowed you to build something new and the successful?\n\nAnton Osika (00:27:08):\nThere are many scaling laws I would say when you build AI systems and this one in particular is about when you put in more work, the product reliably gets better and better. And what you've seen generally when you have AI building something is that it can get stuck in some place. It is super good in the beginning and then it gets stuck. What we did was to painstakingly identify places where it got stuck and there is different approaches but address different ways how we do it but address the places where it gets stuck, tune the entire system quantitatively and having a very fast feedback loop to improve it in the areas where it got stuck. The most important areas, it still does get stuck sometimes, but that's the scaling law and we're still early in that scaling law, I would say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:04):\nAnd so when you talk about things getting stuck, it's like the AI agent just saying, I don't know what to do from this point or they introduce some kind of bug. Is that an example of getting stuck?\n\nAnton Osika (00:28:13):\nYeah. It introduces some kind of bug and then it's not smart enough to figure out how to get out of that bug.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:20):\nI see. And this is a common problem people have with tools like this is they get to a certain point and then it's like, \"Well I don't know what to do. I'm not an engineer, here's a bug it's running into or the infrastructure's built the wrong way.\" And so it sounds like one of the paths to solving that is what you're describing is you make the AI smarter to avoid more and more of these places they get stuck. Another is people just learning how to get AI unstuck. This is something when we had Amjad on the podcast from Replit, he said that this is the main skill that he thinks people need to learn is how to unstuck AI when it runs into a problem. Just thoughts there, I don't know anything along those lines come up as I say that.\n\nAnton Osika (00:29:04):\nThis is something that is a problem today and the frontier of where this is a problem is very rapidly receding back. So what we did was we identified the most important areas, so specifically adding login, creating data persistence, adding payment with Stripe. Those are the things that we made sure it doesn't get stuck on, for example. And the places where it gets stuck today is currently something that you can use being very good at understanding and getting unstuck, but in the future it won't be so important. This experience just going to not get stuck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:48):\nAnd I know you're not talking super in-depth about this because this is one of your unfair advantages, this kind of stuff you figured out. So I'm not going to push too far. I know you want not everyone's into exactly the same stuff. So I want to zoom back to the pace of growth that you guys have seen. One of the big stories, everyone's always looking at you guys of like 15 people, 10 million ARR in two months. That's absurd. I don't know if it's ever been done in history. If so, it's maybe a couple other AI startups recently. How have you been able to do this? What have you done that has allowed you to grow this fast with so few people?\n\nAnton Osika (00:30:24):\nI'd like to take credit of having done everything end to end in the product, but we are building on top of taking the oil here, which we have discovered oil, which is are the foundation models and then what we've done is that we're obsessed about what's the right way to present this to a user. What's the interface for the human to get as much out of this as possible? Packaging together, I showed you in the demo how you can add authentication and making this work seamlessly together as a whole. That's what we've done. And then people love the product. That's the driver of the growth. For getting awareness, we've mainly been posting what we've shipped on social media, that's how people know about us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:17):\nSo building in public is how people usually describe that. So I think it's like you guys have the advantage of the demos are just like, \"Holy shit, you can do that.\" And then you guys share the numbers that you guys are growing at. So it's innately interesting and shareable, but I imagine most people have something interesting to share. I guess is there anything that you think you did that other companies maybe haven't done that make the product so lovable?\n\nAnton Osika (00:31:43):\nI mean the team is everything in building a great product, so I just give a big shout-out to the team that has written the code. I haven't written much of the code recently, I would say. You want people who can ship really fast and have good taste for what this simple, what's the right abstractions and I think that's what we've done differently and have this obsession for us making it better and better and better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by the Fundrise Flagship Fund. Full disclosure, real estate investing is boring. Prediction markets are exciting. Meme coins are a thrill ride. Even the stock market can swing wildly on a headline. Hello Deepseek.

I know you have a lot of thoughts there in terms of writing code, how much do you guys actually use AI to write the code that is building Lovable? How does that work on your team?\n\nAnton Osika (00:33:32):\nWe have set up lovable so that we can change lovable with itself. We have done that. There is a lot of hyper-specific things in terms of running a separate... We spin up a dedicated computer for each user. It doesn't do everything. Lovable doesn't do everything. So we use the tools that are for developers, not for the 99%, most of the time. And everyone uses AI all the time in writing code. It's also in great course for experimentations.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):\nAnd are there tools like Cursor and stuff like that? Like any tools you can share right now?\n\nAnton Osika (00:34:14):\nYeah. I think Cursor is the one that almost everyone uses in the team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:19):\nYeah. Okay, cool. I did a survey recently on tools that my listeners and readers use in cursor. 17% of all people that read my newsletter use Cursor already, which is absurd and you guys are in there, too. Okay, so kind of along these lines, there's obviously other competitors and companies in this space, so everyone's always wondering, you, Bolt, Replit, Cursor is a different kind of thing. What's the simplest way to understand maybe how Lovable might be different from say Bolt and Replit, which I think are probably the closest.\n\nAnton Osika (00:34:49):\nThe packaging for non-technical people is what we aim for and I showed you in the demo that you can edit the text, you can change the colors and so on instantly without having to go into the code editor and without having to wait about 30 seconds for the AI do the full change. So that's the big way that we think about packaging it. And then for making sure that this can be used as productively as possible in a larger team. Something that's different from I think all the other tools is that it is synchronized with GitHub and that means that you can use Cursor, or the people in your team that want to be more low-level, they can use Cursor and while the people who don't want to mess and set up their local file system and commit to GitHub and so on, they can use Lovable's.\n\n(00:35:48):\nNot getting stuck is I think the most important thing for people. And that's why we entered this space late, we haven't done the same type of marketing as many others and we still, from the people that I talked to, ranked as the one that works most reliably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:06):\nI love it. Okay. So this point about how you can just use Lovable to build a lot of it for you and then get into Cursor to edit and tweak is a really big point. And you're saying other companies aren't as good at that. I don't know if any other does that.\n\nAnton Osika (00:36:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:23):\nI don't think they let you do that. Amazing. Okay. And then what's the vision for Lovable? What's the end state of this? Is this everybody can build anything they want sort of thing? What's the simplest way to understand where you're going in the next, I don't know, five, 10 years.\n\nAnton Osika (00:36:37):\nI have to say. So we're building the last piece of software and it is inherently very hard to predict how the world looks like in five years. These days it's very hard. But the last piece of software, how I see that is that it's almost instant to go from what you want to change in the product or what product you want to build to having it fully working end-to-end, integrated with any of your existing systems or integrated with the very powerful third-party providers. Already today you can just ask, add and chat with OpenAI and then you get the chat with OpenAI in your product. But that's just working perfectly is something that's coming in the coming two years, I would say. And then after that there is a lot of things in building a product that is not just the engineering side, right? And I think an AI can be very useful in aggregating and understanding your users.\n\n(00:37:42):\nSo, if you use the analytics tools, you know that there is something quite common which is to see how users have interacted with the product. AIs can do that on an absolutely massive scale and propose changes to a human to say, \"Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good change to make it a bit more intuitive.\" And it can also automatically run A-B tests so that you can see the data, all these improvements to the product. I think that's on the horizon as well, quite.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:15):\nWhat's interesting about this in one way is people wonder just what jobs will be more important, what skills will be less important? Let me share a thought I have and then I want to get your take and see where you go with this. It feels like what is getting more valuable is being good at figuring out what to build and then knowing if the thing you had built is correct and good and ready. So it's like discovery, ideation, idea, part of the step of launching a product and then it's like taste and craft. Just like is this the thing? Is this going to solve people's problems because the building now is being done more and more and it's interesting, it used to be the reverse engineering was the hardest, most valuable skill and now it's figuring out what to build.\n\n(00:38:59):\nYou could sit there and you could just tell it what to build and a lot of people get to your screen I'm sure and they're like, \"I don't know what to build, I don't know what people want.\" And it's like that's the thing now. So just reactions to that and thoughts on what's skills will matter more and less.\n\nAnton Osika (00:39:13):\nI mean if you're a founder or you want to build something. Yeah, I totally agree that figuring out what are pain points and seeing there are often currently solutions, some kind of solution to everything. How can you make this 10X better somehow figuring that out is super important when you have an existing product. Then I think taste and tasting what is good is even more of the important part. The engineer skill set is still going to be important because that helps you understand what are the constraints, so what you can build and I just think a lot of software engineers are probably a bit scared now like, \"Okay, am I out of a job? What's going to happen?\" But they should see themselves as the people who translate the problems that are stated a human, probably, to technical solutions, but they do have to abstract themselves up a few steps, not just looking at in their tech stack like oh I can just do the front end changes. Engineers or technical people are very good at understanding what are the constraints technically and they should see themselves as that translators.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:30):\nIs it almost like you want to learn the eng manager skill of overseeing engineers versus the actual engineering skill or you think it's still going to be really important to learn how to code and be really good at that?\n\nAnton Osika (00:40:44):\nI mean doing a bit of everything. Being a generalist is I think much more important than it used to be. And if I'm putting together a product team today, I would re-obsess about getting as many skill sets as possible for each person I hire. They should know how architecting a system works, preferably they should know the sign, they should have product taste, they should know how to talk to users. I think everyone should know a bit of all of that, preferably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):\nEasier said than done. It's hard to find people that know all these things. So let's segue to hiring and how you hire. How many people do you have at this point? Is that something you share?\n\nAnton Osika (00:41:27):\nYeah, now we're at 18.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:29):\n18. Okay. Wow. I love that you... It sounded like you're about to say, \"Oh, we have a hundred people now.\" No, 18. Okay, so you went from 15 to 18. Okay, great. So what do you look for when you're hiring people? The way I saw you describe it on Twitter is you look for cracked engineers, the best crack team in Europe, things like that. I guess just specifically what are you looking for when you're hiring?\n\nAnton Osika (00:41:52):\nI think the most important thing is that people care a lot and they're not just like, \"Oh, I'm here for a job. I'm here for being just a passenger on this journey,\" but everyone should really care about the product, the users and care a ton about the team, how the team works together and that you're always contributing to making the team work more productively together and that care or preferably obsession gets you a very long way and then you do often want to have absolute superpower in some dimension to be able to understand and do as many possible things as possible, have this generalist brain that quickly learns any skill but be super, super good in one dimension. And for us that's mostly cramming as much out of AI, out of the large language models and understanding the entire parameter space of what you can change to make our product perform better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:58):\nSo, how do you actually test for these things? Some of these things describe, I think everyone's looking for, they care about the user, they want to collaborate well. Because you have 18 people building in a company that's growing more than a million ARR every week. That's an absurd scale and the people you have found are clearly world-class and I think a lot of people are going to want to hire the type of people you're hiring. So when you're actually interviewing, how do you suss out some of these things like their AI cramming skills, their team building collaboration, what do you actually do?\n\nAnton Osika (00:43:32):\nI ask people what they've done before and these people that I'm describing, they have often done something where they care a lot about what they've done before and dig into details about the technical things that they did. And then we do the normal thing of showing a very hard problem that is a bit unorthodox that someone hasn't seen before preferably and see how they think through thinking research through that. Then something that I think is more uncommon is that we do, I pretty much always have people join the work simulation for at least a day, often a full week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):\nAwesome. Okay, so work trial. That's awesome. So basically they work with the team for at least a day. You said sometimes a week, and I love this point you made about they care deeply about something they previously worked on and you look for just obsession with the thing that they built last or something they worked on. What percentage are engineers of these 18?\n\nAnton Osika (00:44:39):\nSo 12 at least write code at least part-time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:44):\n12 out of 18. Okay, cool. When we were setting up, you're like, \"Oh, our engineer's creating content now.\" I think that's a cool example of how people do a lot of different things. Also. Okay, so I have your job posting that you shared once of the actual job description. I'm going to read a few lines from it. It's very inspired by Shackleton, right?\n\nAnton Osika (00:45:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:07):\nWould you agree? Cool. I love it. By the way, did you write this or did you have AI write this job description where you create an engineering job description? In fact, let me read it to you. I don't even know, you may not know what M you're referring to. I'll read a few lines here. \"Long hours, high pace, candidates must thrive under a high urgency under AGI timelines approaching, difficult mission ahead, honor and recognition in case of success, those seeking comfortable work need not apply.\" And then there's a few other things, \"Collaboration with other exceptional minds, purpose larger than any normal engineering role, generous share in the venture success.\" Amazing.\n\nAnton Osika (00:45:44):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:44):\nThoughts?\n\nAnton Osika (00:45:45):\nYeah, so I did get some help with the formatting of this, but then it was mostly me doing the exact phrasing of the different sentences.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:56):\nSo good. And I love that to some people it's going to be like, \"Holy shit, I'm not signing up for this.\" But to a lot of people, the people you want is like, \"Yes, this is exactly what I want to be doing.\"\n\nAnton Osika (00:46:07):\nGreat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:07):\nAmazing.\n\nAnton Osika (00:46:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:08):\nOkay, cool. So it feels like one of the elements of hiring here is, create a really good filter to be clear about just how intense this is so that the people that want that are the ones drawn to you. Okay. And then you're also, you're in Sweden, fastest growing startup in Europe ever thoughts on building in Europe slash Sweden versus the US slash San Francisco?\n\nAnton Osika (00:46:34):\nYeah, so this ambition level that you're talking about in the job ad is more uncommon in Sweden and I think that is the biggest unlock that someone like me, sees that this is the time in human history when you have the most impact for a worked hour and that's why we have to be super ambitious, just up the ambition level and then we can maybe retire and have AI take care of most things in society and inspiring people to be this ambitious in a place where the average ambition is lower but the talent, the raw talent is much more available, is a great recipe. I think that's a great recipe. And that's, I think it's some kind of advantage there. It is a bit of a double-edged sword but it's some kind of advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:34):\nSo what I'm hearing is there's incredible people in Europe, they're just not, they're harder to find and what I'm hearing is the key is how do you suss them out and get them to want to talk to you?\n\nAnton Osika (00:47:49):\nMost people in Europe, they haven't thought that, \"Oh, going on an extremely ambitious mission is what I want to do.\" So that's figuring out who those are is a big part of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):\nAwesome. Okay. I want to talk about prioritization. I imagine all these things that I just shared about just how ambitious this mission is, how much you're doing the last piece of software, you must have a bazillion things that people ask you to build that you want to build. What's your approach to deciding what to prioritize and actually build?\n\nAnton Osika (00:48:21):\nJust top line? I think identifying what is the biggest bottleneck, what's the biggest problem and iterating fast on saying, \"Okay, this is the biggest problem, let's really, really solve that problem.\" And then picking in the next one and not overthinking, not dreaming out the long roadmap, that's my [inaudible 00:48:41]. There's a very, very simple algorithm. Understanding what is the, mostly the biggest problem is not always a simple problem I think. Yeah, so we spend time as one should on talking to users, reading up on what people are writing. We have the feature board for where people do a lot of requests, as you say. And then when we pick one of the problems, we are quite engineering-led. For a product like ours, it's hard to be have product managers that are not engineers say, oh, this is what we should do now because the right solution to the problem might be entangled in things that are technical details.\n\n(00:49:32):\nThey might be entangled in technical details of like, \"Okay, yes, this is the biggest problem, but we should have this larger technical initiative that's going to solve all of these problems.\" So it's quite engineering-led compared to many other product companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:48):\nAs it should. I'd be worried if you guys had a product manager at this point, that wouldn't make no sense right now. I imagine the answer is it's chaos and there's no actual defined process, but just what does it look like generally? What's kind of the cadence you guys operate on? How do you take an idea to build it, spec it, launch it? Just what does that look like if you have something?\n\nAnton Osika (00:50:10):\nIf you look back three months, we mainly said, \"Okay, let's do this weekly planning.\" We do have a big jam board where we have all the main problems and then we have kind of ranked them which else do we focus or when we focus on next or this week? And then we have a demo where we say, \"Okay, these are things we ship this week.\" So to get everyone on the same page, we do have a bit more of a roadmap now, where we say we are going to make so sure you can support custom domains. Next, they're going to add collaboration after that. And the biggest problem now or the biggest initiative now that solves the biggest problem is making the system more agentic and that has a bit of a longer roadmap, but we still do the cadence of weekly planning. These are the things we're focusing on. This week, it's mostly... There's a good word for this that I would want your help with, but polish, we were fixing the bugs and polish this week and that was the planning on Monday.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:21):\nThat was actually this week was polish, polish week. I love that. How far is this roadmap that you are now having?\n\nAnton Osika (00:51:28):\nI mean it's clear over the coming month, but it stretches out three months, but in one month it's probably going to look a bit different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:39):\nOkay. And then what are the tools you use just for folks that want to understand the latest tools? So you said FigJam, what else is in that stack of tools?\n\nAnton Osika (00:51:46):\nI mean we do so many things in our company in Linear because it's just amazing product. So we do talent application tracking in Linear and after going through and this thing, lot of the other custom-made tools for that Linear and then FigJam.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:06):\nSo simple. How soon until one of your engineers is an agent engineer, an AI Engineer, do you have a sense?\n\nAnton Osika (00:52:15):\nI love to dig into what does that question actually mean? I think we've been talking about, Oh, AI that would require something playing chess, that's AI. If a computer can play chess, that's AI and now that's like, Oh no, that's a chess program and which always shifting this forward and forward. I think anything that a human doesn't do is just a smart computer system, right? When is an software engineer and agent, I think it's always going to be just we're building in... Lovable is just an interface that humans interact with to create the software that they want and then how we solve that, we said going to be an agent under some definition. Yeah, sure. I think so, but that's less important to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):\nOkay, I like that. Let me ask this, you guys are moving super fast, scaling like crazy. You described a little bit about your process, weekly planning, FigJam board of ideas and now there's a roadmap that you're kind of thinking out in the future. Is there anything else that you found helps you move this fast that gives you a lot of leverage over the small team you have to ship quickly and move fast that you haven't already mentioned?\n\nAnton Osika (00:53:40):\nWe work from the office most of the time. I think it's pretty nice. Then you can say like, \"Hey, I think we're thinking wrong about this thing,\" or, \"Shouldn't we actually do this other thing?\" And especially I think lunch, eating lunch together is a pretty productive hour where you're cross pollinating. I mean people are constantly thinking subconsciously as well about how to solve these different problems and which the most important ones are. And then being in office has this focus or most of the time usually focus, but you also have this high bandwidth where everyone has to be down structured communication.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:18):\nI love that. The answer to the CEO of a company that's one of the most advanced AI tools in the world is one of your answers to how to move fast is lunch together. I love that. That's so human and so it makes all the sense in the world, but I love that that's still a part of this.\n\nAnton Osika (00:54:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):\nOkay. You talked about this kind of on the same thread you talked about if you were to start a team, like a new product team today, say you were head of product somewhere or head of RPM, VP of product somewhere building a new product team, scaling a product team, what would you do going forward that's different from what people have done in the past in terms of who you're hiring, how you're structuring them, that kind of thing? Just what do you think people should be thinking as they build product teams going forward? Knowing tools like Lovable exist and all the other stuff that's going on.\n\nAnton Osika (00:55:13):\nI mean everyone should be excited about using AI. I think that's a pretty big ones. And then the team working really well together is, like the lunch, you have to sit down and solve problems together. The bottleneck for most products these days is not going to be as much on engineering, but having good taste, good intuition about your users. And that, engineers and everyone preferably in the team should have that willingness at least to want to go through that motion and listen to the users and truly understand what they care about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:59):\nWell it's kind of like the background of most of the engineers and people you've hired. Is there anything in common? Are they just super impressive humans generally, like champions of programming contests, stuff like that? I don't know. What are some attributes of the folks you've hired so far?\n\nAnton Osika (00:56:19):\nI think raw cognitive capability is the strongest, the strongest correlate of being at Lovable. But there is this startup mindset that I think is also very strong. Being much more interested in moving very fast and iterating fast, then having a lot of structure, a lot of process and thinking about the business as a whole. More than thinking about my specific profession, my specific craft that I'm seeing myself wanting to dig into on me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:58):\nAmazing. Okay. So smart, very smart entrepreneurial, acts like an owner, isn't just like, this isn't just a job. But they feel like they actually have agency. Okay, this is great. There's something you said kind of along these lines that I think is important that one of the things that gets you excited about what you're building is giving people super powers and especially people that don't add a code, basically 99% of people. Is there anything along those lines that you think is important to share?\n\nAnton Osika (00:57:27):\nIt's very clear to most people who have been engineers or been founders, that there's so many that have failed in their endeavors because they didn't have someone that know how to solve the technical parts. And now that we're close to having people know that this exists and they solve everything, it's going to be an Cambrian explosion of entrepreneurship and better software product. We're not going to settle for all the annoying bad technology that we use today. And everyone who has an idea is going to say, \"Okay, I'm going to build this thing and show you that this is the best version of the product or what our company should be doing,\" instead of having long meetings or writing up documents. So it's going to be empowering across a lot of different professions and places in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):\nWhat's next for Lovable? What's the next few things they might launch as this episode comes out?\n\nAnton Osika (00:58:38):\nAs I mentioned this agentic behavior, and when I say agentic, what it means is that you give more freedom to the system to decide what happens next. It might want to write a test, run those tests and say like, \"Oh, the test failed, let's fix those.\" So that's one of the big unlocks for getting further faster. And then there's some more obvious things that you want to do to go all the way to easily go all the way to making money with Lovable. And that's like how do you set up so that it's hosted on your specific domain? How do you collaborate there seamlessly with your team and making that is here so that those are just obvious things and something we're thinking about is to help founders succeed after they built their first version. And how do they get more users? How do they get feedback? How do they get the word out if they build something useful?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:42):\nI was just going to say that and that's exactly where my mind went is everyone's going to be building all these things. No one's ever going to get any traction with these tools. No one knows how to find users, get anyone to basically go to market. And growth is a whole different skill. So that is so cool that you're thinking about that. How do we run some paid ads for you? How do we think about SEO? How do we think about word of mouth, reality referrals? That is very cool. Okay.\n\nAnton Osika (01:00:06):\nYeah, we already have playbooks that we help the people building with how do you do those things that you can find up on our blog?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:15):\nInterestingly, this makes me want to buy some meta stock because all these apps that everyone's building, they're going to be running paid ads on Facebook and Google. Oh my god, what a good business those other guys get. I want to come back to, you said that you can work on your existing code base. This is actually a big question for a lot of people. They see all these tools, they're all amazing for prototypes and concepting. You talked about how you can actually do this within your existing code base, use Lovable.\n\nAnton Osika (01:00:41):\nLet me correct you there. You cannot use it on any existing code base.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:46):\nGot it.\n\nAnton Osika (01:00:47):\nWe kind of have a research preview of importing your code base, but what you can do is if you start in Lovable, then you can have engineers editing it in whatever tool they want to use for editing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:59):\nOkay, cool. That's great clarification. So I guess just for people, because most listeners here are not building something brand new, they're working within an existing product. So you're saying that that is coming, you can use Lovable in the future in some form with your existing app and product?\n\nAnton Osika (01:01:15):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:16):\nWow, that's huge. Okay. Because basically most people, so that's going to be a big deal. Okay. Final question. We have the segment on this podcast called Failure Corner, where most people come to this podcast, they show all these stories of success and everything's going great, and here's all the things always winning. You guys, this is a good example, just up into the right, the fastest growing product ever. What's an example when something totally failed in the course of your career and what did you learn from that?\n\nAnton Osika (01:01:49):\nI am a bit hard-pressed to find something that totally failed, but I think there's a bit of a product lesson where I was the first employee at an AI startup here in Stockholm called Summer Labs, and the premise was just, okay, so humans learn in different ways. If you personalize, then you get two standard deviations more effective learning. So there are a lot of products like education software that helps you learn that is not personalized. And we were building an API to personalize learning and the AI and so on, it was pretty good.\n\n(01:02:34):\nBut the thing that we were doing in the end was to say like, Okay, here's this product. Someone has to build a product or some way to learn or be it like English thing Duolingo, and then the people that have that product have to use this advanced AI API to start making it personalized. And it is very hard retrofitting like, oh, you have to switch out the engine and put in this AI. And the big learning here is that it didn't work very well for the company. I mean, the company wasn't super successful in this. The big learning is that you have to start with how is this product working end-to-end and then add AI or think where should we add AI? So that was a big learning for me that you really want to see what does the big picture of the user, what's the big picture of how do you think the user experience should be? And then add something with AI to solve specific problems. And now Summer Labs is doing great, but it's not on top of that product specifically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):\nI think it's a lot of people hear this and they're like, of course, but I think it's so hard to actually remember this point when you have some cool tech and you're like, \"Holy shit, everyone needs to try this. They're going to love it.\" And then you don't realize no one actually cares if it's not solving a problem for them. There's a lot of novelty products that everyone want to use for a little bit and then forget instant, I don't actually need this often. And so what this makes me think about is, there's all these product lessons for what is likely to help your product be successful. And an app like a tool like Lovable can help you do this because if someone is building something, you can guide them, Okay, what's the problem you're solving for somebody? How many people have this problem? How much does this matter to them?\n\nAnton Osika (01:04:38):\nMaybe we should add the Lenny mode. It activates in Lovable, it activates this product coach. That would be infinite questions, like, \"No, no, wait, hold on, why are you doing this?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):\nAbsolutely. Let's take a step back. Everyone's going to be like, \"[inaudible 01:04:55], get out of my way.\"\n\nAnton Osika (01:04:57):\n[inaudible 01:04:57].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nYeah, exactly. What's your experiment plan? I think there's actually a big opportunity there to save people. There's a play around with this thing and then there's like, okay, but really is this anything people actually want?\n\nAnton Osika (01:05:09):\nI love it. Can we call it Lenny mode? Is that fine with you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\n100%.\n\nAnton Osika (01:05:13):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:14):\nLet's do it. I'll license you no cost.\n\nAnton Osika (01:05:16):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nOkay. Okay. We made a deal here. Let's do it. Okay, Anton, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything you want to leave listeners with before I let you go and go to sleep?\n\nAnton Osika (01:05:28):\nI think, again, the world is changing quickly and it's very fun. You should see that's like have fun in all of this change, and the best thing you can do for your current profession or if you want to have a new job is to be in the top 1% in knowing how to use AI tools. So go out there, use Loveable, use other AI tools, and become... Make sure to understand or try to understand as much as possible in how to use them productively. That's something I tell all my friends generally, and I love the audience to know as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:06):\nOkay. Well, I got to try to make this even more specific for people. How do you know if you're in the top 1%? What's a heuristic almost slash how do you get there? Is it just use it a hundred times a day? What else? What can you recommend?\n\nAnton Osika (01:06:19):\nYeah. I think if you spend a full week on trying to reach an outcome, the best way to learn is I want to do this thing and then I want to use AI to do that thing. And you've spent a full week, you are in the top 1% in the global population. And if you surround yourself with friends who have this obsession or they also care a lot about this, then you'd be quickly in the top 0.1%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:47):\nSo what I'm hearing is find a problem that can be solved, find a problem, a pain point for yourself or someone, and then end-to-end fully solve that problem. Spend a week getting from idea to a thing that somebody's actually using and you're in the top 1%.\n\nAnton Osika (01:07:03):\nYeah. I think... At the top, yeah, the top 1% by just spending a full week and asking AI if you don't understand. So making sure that you understand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):\nYeah, that's the thing people forget. You just ask. Would you ask the chat feature of Lovable in this case or would you go to Cloud or ChatGPT to ask for advice?\n\nAnton Osika (01:07:24):\nI mean, my recommendation here, if you're in product is to use Lovable to build software and learn that AI tool and then you should use ChatMode and ChatMode, I have to add, is something you activate in your user profile. It's not launched in the main product, so it's in labs, but if you add that flag, then you can use ChatMode. If you want to learn some other AI tool, then you should ask that tool or ask Cloud, ChatGPT about how that topic, that domain works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:02):\nOkay, amazing. Where can people find you? Where can they find Lovable and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnton Osika (01:08:09):\nLovable posts updates, and memes on Lovable underscore dev on Twitter, we post things on LinkedIn as well, and there are a lot of things coming out and changing in how we build software, so you can follow Lovable underscore dev and you can follow me at AntonOsika at Twitter. I'd love more feedback on where people see this is a huge change for them. There are a lot of people posting about that on Twitter, but we have a Discord where you can share like, \"Oh, this is how I use Lovable. It was super useful to me.\" And feedback.lovable.dev can ask for new features. There's a lot of people asking and uploading what features you want next. And that's super useful. That's the most important thing for us. We just want to solve people's problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:04):\nAmazing. Anton, you're doing incredible work. What a journey. I'm excited to have you back someday when we see more chapters of this journey.\n\nAnton Osika (01:09:12):\nI have a lot more to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:13):\nAs do we all. That's why people listen to this podcast. Anton, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAnton Osika (01:09:18):\nThank you so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:19):\nBye everyone.

  "transcript": "# The full-stack PM | Anuj Rathi (Swiggy, Jupiter Money, Flipkart)\n\n## Transcript\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:00:00):\nThere are only three reasons why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem that you didn't set up the ways of working now design properly. So, as a leader, do you have the right people in terms of capability? If not, is the right answer for us to coach them or to really put them... or mentor them and so on, or move them to some other place because maybe their capability is suited elsewhere? If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you? Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not just have enough time? So on and so forth. So you need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?\n\nLenny (00:00:50):\nToday, my guest is Anuj Rathi. I've been looking to get more India-based product leaders on the podcast because this podcast has a large audience in India. When I put out a call on Twitter and LinkedIn asking people who I should have on, Anuj was the single most requested person. Anuj is Chief Product and Marketing Officer at Jupiter Money. Previously, he was Senior Vice President of Revenue and Growth at Swiggy where he spent seven years. He was also VP of Product at Snapdeal, a Senior PM at Walmart Labs, and the very first Product Manager at Flipkart where he led the buyer experience team.\n\n(00:01:24):\nIn our conversation, we dig into how product management is different in India, Anuj's lessons about building product experiences for new users, how he operationalized the working backwards process at the companies he's worked at, why he pushes his teams to explore three divergent directions before settling on a plan, why he thinks product managers and companies should be much more full stack than they are. Also, a bunch of frameworks and contrarian takes about building product and your career in product. A big thank you to Sayan Maiti and Nikhil Kulkarni for helping me navigate the product scene in India. Look for more amazing India-based product leaders to come. With that, I bring you Anuj Rathi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:08):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate, but most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages and recreating content for other channels and applications, and their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.\n\n(00:02:39):\nForward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Riot Games, Linear, and more use Sanity to build content growth engines that scale, drive innovation, and accelerate customer acquisition.

Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:37):\nIt's my pleasure. I haven't told you this, but when I put a call out on Twitter and LinkedIn for people's favorite India-based product leaders, you are the single most recommended person, and so I just wanted to start with how does it feel to be the most loved India-based product leader at least according to my Twitter followers and LinkedIn followers?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:04:58):\nWell, it feels really good, and I really feel it's come together because I've been doing product management for the longest time. In 2010, when I started the product management journey with Flipkart. I think that that was a time when there were not a lot of products being built for India. So I think one part is just the tenure, and B, I think it's just a lot of people have known the work.\n\nLenny (00:05:20):\nAwesome. You're very modest. I wanted to start with a question about product in India, and I'm just curious just how is product management and product building in general just most different in India?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:05:33):\nYeah. I think that's a very interesting question, and I think about this all the time. When I look at product management in India, and I do have a lot of friends comparing product management versus in US or even in Europe versus even in China, Southeast Asia, et cetera. I think India has had a very interesting journey of products in general and hence, product management also. I think till about 2010-ish, there were not really many products built for the Indian consumers in the first place. There were a lot of products being built, a lot of technology being built, but largely, because it was a back office, so you had a lot of great engineers working in companies which would build products for the American customer or even for the European customer and so on. So once these startups started coming in, which were thinking about building for the Indian consumers, I think we did not really have that talent which we could directly tap into. We're trained into product building. Forget product management as a field in the first place. There were no colleges which were teaching anything about this. There was no playbooks, and so on, and so forth. We would go to the internet, and look at YouTube, and look at SVPG and all of that, but what we would understand would not... you could not put directly to the Indian startups.\n\n(00:06:48):\nThe way that they shaped up I think also shaped up the way product management field would evolve in India. So it's taken a bunch of iterations, and I think there are two or three different waves that have come in, and we are way closer to how good product management should be done in India. We still have a little bit way to go compared to, say, US. I also think of it along... For example, in US, the product building culture probably started in 1970s, the modern software product building culture, and you didn't only have product manager, but the entire ecosystem... If you think about a company, who is the VP of business, and who is the VP of supply, and sales, and ops, and technology, and all of that? That group knew how to work with each other to build software products. They understood how that would be built and what to expect.\n\n(00:07:37):\nI think in India, when we were in 2010, et cetera, even those different people who needed to come together to build, say, e-commerce, they would come from, say, FMCG, or they would come from manufacturing and so on. What they would have seen in their journeys in terms of what we expect is a very request response kind of understanding which is, \"Here's machinery. If I give this X resources, I expect, with a little bit of variability, why predictable output will come,\" and that mentality also moved on to what I expect from product managers or product building journeys and so on. So I think over a period of time, a lot of those cycles have happened, and a lot more other leaders in companies have now seen those cycles and understood, \"All right. Now, I understand software is not machinery. Consumers are not predictable as much as we thought.\" That has led to, now, finally, I think, product management coming of age.\n\nLenny (00:08:34):\nYou said that, I guess, in the Bay Area, things started 1970s, something like that. When would you say things started to really ramp up in modern product thinking in India?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:08:43):\nI think 2010 was when it started because... Look, there were a few products that were built before that also, and I think somebody said this clearly that usually, when modern consumer internet starts coming in countries, it usually starts with travel, so you do have... Basically, any country, we would start with, usually, the first travel company. So I think India started with some companies like MakeMyTrip and so on way earlier. There were a few very interesting products being built in India which were solving uniquely for the Indian consumers that were in the matrimony side which is Shaadi.com, and Bharmatrimony.com, and so on. We're like, \"What do you think about Tinder?\" India is famous for arranged marriages, so a product that would really understand that, \"Hey, if you're a parent, if you want to get your kid up for matrimony, how would you solve for them?\" and that marketplace of matchmaking, et cetera started.\n\n(00:09:34):\nSo a few blips here and there which was following uniquely for India. I think 2010 was a decade or time when I can very clearly imagine that's where a lot of people started building for India. So I think, again, Flipkart started that kind of journey, but in a couple of years, then they were like, say, Ola which was, in a way, similar to Uber, what they were doing elsewhere, and then a whole bunch of other startups that started coming in. So, for example, in food delivery, when I was working at Swiggy, that came in like, say, 2015, 2014, in that timeframe. Now, you see a whole bunch of startups which are trying to do not only things which are... what could an Uber for India look like or what could a DoorDash for India look like. Very different and also, very innovative. So I think now is the time when you see a lot more product building around that area.\n\nLenny (00:10:24):\nWhere are some numbers of just like companies in India, people in India's money spent in India? I don't know. Things that would be like, \"Wow, that is a much bigger opportunity than I thought.\"\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:10:33):\nOkay. This is a very wide question, so I'll tell you. Before the opportunity in India, I think I'll talk about the complexity in India which I think a lot of people don't understand. India has what? 1.4 billion people. So there were three waves, really, that happened in India, but also, in the globe. I think first wave was from desktop to mobile, and then even from mobile to smartphones. From smartphones, there was what we call the Jio revolution. There's an Indian company called Reliance Jio that basically got internet at the cheapest prices for smartphones. So because of this, a whole population came onto the internet which was hungry for newer products, newer content, completely different ways of interacting with each other, and using internet for all sorts of different things. That was one of the waves.\n\n(00:11:24):\nThe other part is really what the Indian government really enabled which is... especially in digitization of a bunch of absolute core fundamental citizen-related machinery which is either through digital payments, which is a whole bunch of Indians now started having a bank account by default, and something called UPI. So even if you do not have a bank account or that bank account is linked to your mobile phone number, but now everybody would pay through that, and that brought in a very different kind of revolution. So even if 5 rupees, that is basically 10 cents or less than that, that would be paid through UPI, and people started moving away from cash and so on. There's something called the India Stack that is all of these things coming together, which is social security, identity, payments, and so on, that a whole bunch of other apps can now use to build their own layers on top of that. So many interesting cases started coming about. So that's one which is just a number and the infrastructure.\n\n(00:12:25):\nNow, the other thing to look at is India is very diverse, so the number of languages spoken here, even the official languages is so high, and they say... There's an elders' quote in India like, \"Every 15 miles, the language will change, and the people and the culture will change, and it's a huge country of so many people.\" So your traditional ways of thinking about products also, the \"Who I'm building for?\" is very different. \"Are you building for this person or that?\" Et cetera. So a bunch of frameworks break down because it's not even that the same language will apply. While English is a language that is used by the people at least who have the money and who have the dollar to even give to you, but you have to think way more widely.\n\n(00:13:06):\nThe other thing about India that is interesting is the price that people are willing to pay. Generally, it does look at the per capita money that people have. It is very low. It's in the two, two and a half thousand dollar range compared to US which is maybe 30 times more and so on. So while there's a lot of people who are going to give you traffic, and engagement, and so on, but the craft of actually choosing the right kind of paying customer who will actually come, and engage, and give you money is at a premium. So a lot harder work needs to be done. If you're running e-commerce, who are the people who will pay me delivery fee? Who are the people who will actually buy this expensive stuff? So a whole bunch of different ways of thinking has evolved in this country, and that's why it's so vibrant and so different than any other global products.\n\nLenny (00:14:01):\nWow. Fascinating. I could keep going, but I want to talk product. I've collected a bunch of questions from people that know you or people that have worked with you about a bunch of different stuff, so I'm just going to go a little bit all over the place. The first area I wanted to talk about is the user experience. Apparently, you have a interesting insight and a different approach of thinking about new users and new user experiences.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:14:24):\nOne of the things that I realized once we started working with the products is that product managers and generally, companies are too engrossed in thinking about... because they are very close to the product. It's close to their heart, and they're looking at it all the time. They're looking at a lot of minor nuances in terms of how this works and feels, and almost inherent into this is the bias that everybody is thinking about this product all day, all the time, and so on, and so forth. Whereas the reality is most consumers in the country or in your target market, they don't care, and they may have sometime heard about your product. The word of mouth is not ever so strong, even if you're the strongest brand, and so on, and so forth, but that is the customer that you've got to bring in, and then serve.\n\n(00:15:07):\nSo there's very interesting insight that I heard from Scott Belsky from Adobe, and then now, he's doing very interesting stuff, and that stayed with me which was you have to think about users on modern internet consumers having three attributes. So they are lazy, they are vain, and they're selfish. So lazy meaning, \"I don't have time for this, so blow my mind away. Otherwise, I'm not going to pay attention.\" Vain which means, \"I have a habit. I'm solving this problem in a particular way, and here, you come with your two-pack product and ask me to change my habit. Do you really expect me to do that?\" That's second. That's their inherent attribute. The third one is that they're selfish like, \"Show me what's in it for me.\"\n\n(00:15:52):\nOnce you start thinking about users in that vein, and if these users are not even using your product, suddenly, you realize, \"Oh my god, it's quite difficult even... How do I attract this kind of customer, and if my marketing team has done a good job at bringing this user to my product, how do I actually now empathize with this lazy, selfish, and vain customer, and build my product in a way so that I can make this appear on your site like this is the thing that you have to use, the way you write your copy, the way you build your onboarding, the way you do your first warm welcome?\" It's going to make the biggest amount of change in terms of a product success, then your core product features that you're going to build for your loyal consumers.\n\n(00:16:37):\nSo that one insight, and I've seen and applied that multiple times not only the companies that I worked with, the companies I've consulted and spoken with. Most neglect it. Well, they get user onboarding is important, but just how important is that is one, and B, the craft of thinking like a user who's lazy, vain, and selfish, and basically, rejecting all your products, but this does not work for this kind of customer. It's extremely hard. It's very hard, but it's totally worth it if you put that lens on.\n\nLenny (00:17:06):\nIs there an example of you using this framework on a product you worked on where you're just like, \"Here's a thing we really did...\" I don't know, had a big impact or really surprised everyone?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:17:16):\nSo we used it in two different areas. So one is, of course, products I worked on. So I worked in Swiggy for the last seven years, and really, when we started working towards this user, instead of thinking about everybody as, \"This is what our onboarding experience looks like, and this is what our product is.\" So, essentially, we used, basically, say, a key that it's... \"We are a food delivery app. We are a grocery delivery app, and we have these bunch of things.\" Instead of that, we just started reframing it from the point of view of, \"What would you want, and how could you use us? What is it in it for you?\" and we started connecting all our marketing messages along with the onboarding. So even going out market and thinking, \"Where do you actually find us? How did you know about us? It's a reasonably large brand. Why have you not already downloaded us and used us? Have you used us and rejected us in the past?\" So building that entire mental model and looking at a user from the point of view of, \"Let's assume that you have heard about us 20 times. What was that exact situation that brought you to download this app?\"\n\n(00:18:20):\nSo right from the entire journey of you hearing us, what was the trigger, and what was the marketing message, and what was the promotion that we were running? How do we continue that journey on your onboarding from your splash, that 200 rupees of... X rupees if you buy from us, continuing that entire journey in the language that they understand and with the user experience that is continuation from the marketing to product, other thing that we started focusing on a lot more, and it instantly started showing us results. But while I'm talking about just a very simple example and everybody should be doing it, that is true even when you have a particular app which has multiple products and many product lines. It's the same principle that applies there, and that's where I think the largest amount of delta that happens that people don't know really why are we not able to cross-pollinate or cross-sell, and so on, and so forth.\n\n(00:19:14):\nRight now, I'm working with a company called Jupiter which is a financial services app, and it's a neobank. So we care for personal finance, and it has a bunch of offerings. There's a personal account or savings account. There's a credit card. There's mutual funds. There is investments in, say, gold, and FD, and so on, and so forth. It's a bunch of things. But when people think about why using us only for one service and just go away, actually, the key is to recognize that this user has found value in... They are not interested in all the other things that you talked about, so be able to empathize with that user, and now thinking about the behavioral science aspects in terms of, \"How do I convert this user from one to the other?\" That I think is extremely important.\n\nLenny (00:20:00):\nSo a couple things I'm hearing here. One is the importance of focusing on not people currently using your product, but this idea of maybe the marginal user or the adjacent user, the next state of users is who you should be thinking about when you're trying to optimize onboarding the user experience, and then two is... Something that sounds like you've had a lot of success with is picking one value prop, maybe one positioning statement, and then following that through their entire journey versus like, \"Here's all the things we do.\" Is that right?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:20:31):\nThat's absolutely right. Let me give an example of this one. One of the reasons why I really feel product managers must, if not better, but equally understand, category consumers which are not in market or which are not really buying your products just yet. As good as the marketer or the brand expert in your team does... because they really are tasked with, \"What is that one message that I can say that will make the user take attention or get to like, 'Oh, this is interesting,' and direct attention towards your product?\" If the product managers are able to do that, then they will choose that positioning and essentially, understand, \"What is my hope product, and what is the hope that...\" At least get them to try my app or any of those things, right? So if they understand it as well as the marketer, and then understand, \"Over a period of time, what is the right time when I introduce them to this other one rather than being very greedy about letting the new user try everything?\" So that's one.\n\n(00:21:37):\nThe other thing that I feel a lot of product managers don't do right is... \"Forget about everything. Here's my app. Go figure,\" is how most of the products are designed unfortunately. Automatically, these things will happen without any intervention. I have created something which is so beautiful, and once you tap that icon, everyone can say, \"That is my product that is so working perfectly,\" but they don't really think about, \"At what moment do I actually get this user here, and will they use it?\" Well, this user is lazy, vain, and selfish.\n\nLenny (00:22:09):\nThat phrase reminds me of something I always think about. Marc Andreessen had this great quote that your user's time is already allocated. They're not looking for more apps to download. They already have a plan for the day. Basically, they have things to do. They're not like, \"Hmm, what's another iPhone app I'm going to check out right now?\" So somehow you have to convince them, \"This is worth your time,\" and I like this framework. Is there an example of a phrase you found really effective either at Swiggy, or Jupiter, or Flipkart, or anything just like, \"Here's a really quick example of something that had a big impact on either simplifying the value prop,\" or if you don't have an example top of mind, what was the impact you saw from implementing some of these ideas?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:22:48):\nI'll talk about a phrase that I now use with product managers a lot to simplify how they should be thinking. I think one thing is... and that's not only for the consumers, but even how we operate. We are product managers, and we are in the business of influence. Users are doing something, and now we want them to do something else. Our engineers are doing something, and now we want to influence them into building something fast. Really, leadership has some plans. We'll influence them to, essentially, look at a plan, and basically, sign off, and do something else. We are in the business of influence, and you are doing this all the time internally. Otherwise, you're not successful even in shipping. Now, we have to extend this to our users and really think about it from that point of view. So you are a full-stack influencer and not only an external influencer. So we've got to think more like sales, more like marketing, more like influencers.\n\nLenny (00:23:42):\nOne of the most important skills for a product manager is influencing people on team, and I like the point that you're also trying to influence your user. That's interesting. Just more reason to get really good at influence, so. I actually have a newsletter about how to get better influence based on Frodo Baggins and Lord of the Rings. We'll link to that in the show notes. Okay. Let's shift to a different topic. You have a really concrete way of actually implementing the working backwards process. We had one of the authors of the book Working Backwards on recently, and I'm excited to just hear what you've learned about how to actually put this into practice. It's easy to hear about, \"Let's work backwards,\" but doing it is a different beast, and so I'd love to hear what you've learned there.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:24:20):\nSo I think the people who invented working backwards is clearly Amazon. I think they started this entire process which are like, \"Hey, why don't you write a press release, and with that press release, we'll work backwards from that one?\" I thought that was a very cool idea, and I was trying to dig down into like, \"Hey, why does it work?\" My insight or at least the way that I thought about this one is it's not working backwards only from a customer value proposition. \"Will our customers love it, and will they pay for it? Is it noteworthy, and is it something that we should even be working?\" While that is one of the most important things that the Working Backwards framework teaches us, but essentially, what you're working backwards from is an entire machinery at a particular day that is working for... For the date of GTM, what do we need to do from here till that particular day so that the GTM is successful, but also, what will be the machinery we would have created so that this product is successful?\n\n(00:25:20):\nNow, because you're already talking about GTM, you're already thinking about, \"How will users love it? What is the money that we'll spend? What are the alternatives that we will... routes that we have explored that finally we have zeroed in on and all of those?\" So they are all going to be a part of a PR review. If I take a slightly open stance on this one, what is a press release? A press release is you have a one-pager which talks about what are we building, what is a particular date, what is the exact value proposition, what will consumers say, what will the business manager say, how will they respond, how will they use it. But the one thing that comes out from this framework is that you can use it for a whole bunch of other things. You can use it for negotiation, for example, because you start with a date, and then you say, \"This is the one-pager that I need to ship, and I want the consumers to see that.\" You can use it to now go to our VP Engineering and say, \"By this date, can we build all of this?\" Now, they do not have all the PRDs and everything, but they can give you a sense that this is too aggressive or this is not and so on.\n\n(00:26:18):\nWe can also use the quotes here to actually find alliances or find people who are going to actually derail this. So you actually use the customer quote to basically say, \"I want my customers to say this. From marketing and from my pricing team, can we actually ship this so that consumers will say that?\" Then, from the business owner's quote, you actually say, \"This is what we are shipping, but what are your goals? Can you say that within three months, we would have achieved this much?\" So using that to build one entire picture is one way that I found it really powerful because if you find disagreements here, then say, \"I can't ship it,\" then you change the date, and then you change the goals because all of these things are changing together. So instead of one, you find the other set of all the things that need to come together for that press release to go live is the real value.\n\n(00:27:07):\nThe other part that I found interesting here is that I really truly believe in the power of three. So I actually ask my teams to write three press releases, alternative and divergent like, \"What if we...\" Suppose you're launching a membership program. So, instead of two tiers, let's do three tiers, or for example, let's take another one which is instead of building a membership, let's build up tiering pricing program with membership points. Instead of this segment, let's use another segment. Let's say within these three, and they all need to be fully thought-through, and that helps the leadership choose.\n\n(00:27:44):\nSo the two things that work here. When you are in the product discovery phase, you would have heard from a lot of folks. Finally, if you show them just one roadmap, it feels like, \"Hey, this person didn't...\" They listened to my interesting point which was valuable, but didn't include it. But when you're doing this three PR FAQs, I considered this, and this added up to a story that eventually is valuable, this alternative route. I considered your point of view, and I created a story, but unfortunately, it is not adding up so we rejected it. So, now, people can compare and contrast, and that's a very powerful leadership tool. That, actually, is a very powerful tool even for CXOs. When they say, \"Let's build this,\" you'll say, \"Here are three ways we can build this, and here's the reason why I'm not building what you said because you would like these two more.\"\n\nLenny (00:28:36):\nThat's a really cool idea of just using the PR FAQ and working backwards process to think very differently partly to make sure you've explored all the options, partly to just think through things that are in the back of people's minds and see if there's something there before committing to the one direction.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:28:51):\nSo the FAQs also are very important to set processes in the system. For example, now, at Jupiter, we have a financial services app. So every FAQ will mandatorily have, \"How are you going to make sure that it is fully compliant? Have you gotten sign-off from A, B, C people? Have you actually thought about legal aspects, and so on, and so forth?\" So, for example, you can use the FAQs very effectively here. Whereas, for example, when it was Swiggy, and it's a three-way marketplace, you have consumers, delivery executives, and restaurant partners. Now, any small change that you do on, say, delivery partners, for example, if you're working on optimizing their earnings per hour which will lead to some changes in cost per delivery, but that may have a completely different impact on delivery fee.\n\n(00:29:31):\nI'm just making this up, but now, because of so many moving parts in your FAQs, you're explicitly asking, \"Have you thought about what are the implications on restaurant partners? Have you thought about what are implications on delivery partners?\" We, in fact, also have that PR FAQ in terms of we write down the different segments of delivery partners, and sometimes it will have extremely weird correlations because those product managers on one side of the equation have started thinking or at least consulting the other part of the marketplace, \"What could this mean for you?\" It gets everybody together to create very crisp products that work for all sides of the marketplace.\n\nLenny (00:30:10):\nOne thread I'm pulling out of a few of your stories so far is you often come back to this full-stack approach to many models. So you talked about how PM is like an influencer, but also, they're influencing users. That's a cool way of thinking about it. With this working backwards process, you can use it to think about the full stack of launch, not just what features you're going to build. I know you also have some strong opinions about product managers, and they should be much more full-stack than most PMs. Does that ring a bell, and if so, can you talk about that?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:30:39):\nYes. No, I think it is the same thread that is connecting the first and the second. I think product managers have to own outcomes and not only features and parts of the problem. Well, they will own some parts of the problem fully, but if they need to work with everybody to make sure that eventual product that they launch is successful and not only successful from the point of view of, \"Hey, we launched something that works for users,\" et cetera, that's not the definition of success. Did it work in the way that it really changed the behavior of the kind of user that we wanted to achieve a business outcome that will build a capability that is important for us? All of those things combined will not happen if the product manager is only thinking about their part. So they have to think about external users, they have to think about competition, they have to think about other product managers and product leaders about engineering, about marketing, and so on because it's such a diverse field.\n\n(00:31:36):\nUnless you really... and I'm not saying you need to be an authority of that. Either you are very, very good at that, or you have built partnerships, and have run your ideas or product through those people and gotten weighted from them, and finally made a decision around that part, I don't think you'll be very successful. So, in my opinion, the full-stack product managers are the ones who are going to be more successful rather than product managers who are doing very good at one particular area only. So there's one book which is Range, right? I'm sure you may have heard about it, right? Even the first chapter, what they talk about is... They take two examples. One is the example of Federer, Roger Federer. So, with Roger Federer, for example, I think I'll just continue that, that till 18, he played a bunch of racket sports, and this wasn't even tennis. But then, you bring in ideas from one racket sport to the other, and second to the third, and so on, and so forth, and now you have such a range of ideas that you can connect a lot more dots and actually ship it. I think that's a better playbook for being more successful in product.\n\nLenny (00:32:41):\nI was just watching a documentary on... I think it was called Greatness and had Wayne Gretzky. He had exactly the same experience actually. When he was young, he played hockey just during the winter times, and during summer, he played other sports. Hockey was just like one sport he played, and then eventually started to focus on it, and they talked about how people that played different sports in their childhood actually ended up being much better at that one sport that they chose. So a lot of parallels. I know you also have a lot of interesting ways of thinking about coming up with a roadmap ideas, and ideating and building a roadmap backlog. So you already talked about this idea of going in very divergent directions and seeing if that leads anywhere. There's a couple more someone shared. One is you have this idea of show don't tell. What is that?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:33:27):\nActually, show don't tell is an idea which is an extension of what we are talking about from what backwards. When we're talking about working backwards, one is a PR FAQ which is a written documentation of what we are trying to achieve. Show don't tell is essentially a way in where the product manager starts ideating with the entire experience, and they actually create all the collaterals together of a user they need to begin with if you're working on a single-play product which is a single-user product. Then, you actually start bringing together your marketers and others in terms of, \"What is literally the first screen, and how is my user getting here?\" It's not as simple as he imagines somebody who will be doing this and reaching here. We try to recreate an exact situation.\n\n(00:34:16):\nThere's a concept of person, not personas. So we'll talk about personas, but we try to go to, \"All right. No. Don't think about agentic user. Let's say Lenny, 30 years old, doing A, B, C things, earning this much, et cetera, et cetera. His relationship with this category of food delivery is X. These are the things that he has done in the last month. In the last three days, there were the needs, desires, aspirations, fears, frustrations, et cetera, et cetera.\" We say, \"Okay. It's 11:00. What's happened? Why is this user open, or what triggered this particular app, and then what happened?\" So you literally start from there, and I think 50% of my product reviews are on that part, and then when we say, \"All right. Then, this app got open. Do we have the right kind of way forward for Lenny to actually achieve what he came here for?\" Literally, each pixel, and each copy, and each word is going to be in service of that part.\n\n(00:35:08):\nSo that's showing the entire journey rather than just staying and assuming. So that is something that I've found really powerful with respect to even designing products or even thinking about why are we building something. What it also helps is when we are building complex products, especially in marketplaces because once you are building this for the user, simultaneously, something is happening on the other part if it is simultaneous, if it's a real-time marketplace, or something like that. So you're building something for the user and saying, \"All right. If this guy ordered, now there's a 30 minutes time when our delivery executors will come to the user with food. What is happening? What's the emotional state of the user, and let's plot out the 30 minutes time, and let's create various scenarios. Is it like, 'Hey, maybe he went to the restaurant, and the food is delayed,' or the dude on a bike, his bike got punctured, et cetera. Now, what is the consumer thinking at this time?\" So you show all of those things in real time, and that cuts out a whole bunch of random ways in which the product could have looked like if you're creating even a chatbot. So just having that showcase of all journeys coming together helps a lot in building your products in the right way.\n\nLenny (00:36:19):\nSo, essentially, just getting very detailed and very concrete with the product experience that you're building thinking about the user experience. Sounds like a lot of work. I can't imagine you do this often. Is the advice here to do this once a year or once and just keep it updated? It sounds like you did this at Swiggy, and that was a really impactful way of building the product.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:36:41):\nYeah. I think there's not only one way actually. I think I recommend this every product manager to do a show don't tell version of their current version. At the same time, there's a new version all the time. So they can compare and contrast, and very easily explain to everyone why they're doing something. In fact, that wall... So it's called a wall. It also becomes one common place where you can get all the stakeholders in because it becomes... Instead of just doing the elevator pitch, you can actually do detailed discussions on why I'm choosing this versus something else, and so on, and so forth. That's a product manager's version of doing this.\n\n(00:37:10):\nThere's also a product leader's version of doing this thing which is recycle strategy on a page, and a lot of people call it like growth loops. Right? Don't show our user's journey. Now, let's see the entire strategy of the company together on one page. \"All right. This is what the market looks like, and why will we get what kind of users? What is our activation budgets, and how many of them are we going to get to this next stage and get them to use it? How will we get them to cross-pollinate into different sections? Do we need a membership program? Are there any different levers which will press more or less and so on?\" So that also is a show don't tell, and not only one, but usually, I like to create three of them as well like, \"Why did we choose a strategy versus the other?\" That, for example, is a very good way for our product leaders to get to one strategy that their CXOs align with and something that they can essentially tell the entire product and other teams, \"This is what we're going to follow.\"\n\nLenny (00:38:09):\nThis episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client, and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life? Let me tell you about Wix Studio, the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency. How? First, let's talk about advanced design capabilities. With Wix Studio, you can build unique layouts with a revolutionary grid experience and watch as elements scale proportionally by default.

There's the built-in AI tools, the on-Canvas collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover, and that's not all. Find out more at wix.com/studio.\n\n(00:39:14):\nWhat kind of impact have you seen from implementing something like this, or is there an example of something that came out of this that was a big unlock? Again, it's probably a lot of work for someone to put together a whole board, keep it updated, screenshots, marketing, funnels of where people are coming from. What sort of impact do you see from doing this either on growth or people, what people think?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:39:34):\nI think the largest impact that happens here is on alignment, so how CXOs are thinking if that is not very clear, and that can be a document, and so on, and so forth. But for a lot of people, it's not very clear on... I can see one part of the funnel. I can understand... The marketing team can understand the best why we are acquiring those users, but they don't fully see the picture of, \"If I attract this kind of users, why will these users become loyal, and what does that entire thing look like or, say, some other team which is building a part of the product? Where do I come in and so on?\" So I think the largest impact that the show don't tell has is on, basically, getting the entire company together on the same page and them being able to understand why I'm doing, and which part of the entire picture I am working on, and why others are working on so that I can actually work with them to solve that part. That's one.\n\n(00:40:30):\nThe other thing that it helps, Lenny, is it also helps in choosing directions, like I said, because we are not doing one, but three of them. I'm choosing one alternative versus the other, and sometimes these strategic discussions, they can get going all sorts of different ways, and maybe you will talk about one particular unique point and go deeper rather than look at the entire picture together and say, \"This is good because of all of these five points that we presented in page one versus the other one.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:01):\nI think the other benefit, just one of the benefits of working backwards in Amazon's whole written-down memo approach is it forces you to crystallize ideas and not stay superficial because there's so many good ideas in theory. But then, when you have to get really concrete, that's actually a terrible idea. Basically, it's the same benefit in a lot of ways of get very concrete. What are you actually going to do? That will help you identify, \"Okay. This isn't going to work. What are we even thinking?\" So I like that. Awesome. Okay. Another framework that you have is something that you call the four BB framework for product strategy. Can you talk about what that's all about?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:41:36):\nWe essentially saw that if a startup actually usually wants to do a bunch of things across the border, there's always like, \"Hey, I should be investing in tech debt or building core platforms. That would really help my product in the long term. That's super important,\" and that's my engineering managers and largely, people asking for that bandwidth. Then, there is the product manager themselves who's basically saying, \"I want to do feature enhancement, bug fixes, my version twos, a few areas, experiments, and so on, and so forth.\" That's a regular product backlog that would work on screen by screen, and there's this leadership which will say, \"You know what? Now, we have a suite of products. Now, I want to take a large delta bit that may work. It may not work, but we need to make sure that it works, but I need work across teams, and it's not only one person that needs to do it. I need contribution from four or five of you that come together and deliver that,\" or there are places where a company is just reimagining their identity, or they're pivoting which is like, \"All right. We were doing X. Now, we are doing X plus Y. That's how we want to be known,\" or, \"We were doing X. Now, we want to do very little of X because current consumers, okay, we will take care of them, but now we want to pivot into Y.\"\n\n(00:42:55):\nSo it usually is in four of these buckets, and what really happens is it gets down to product managers eventually prioritizing between these four. So I don't think it's a tactical prioritization product manager call. It really is a product strategy call, and the conversation that needs to happen is between, say, the head of product and the CEO or even the leadership. If I gave you a hundred focus points, how much will you put in each of these buckets, and what are those four buckets? Those are the four BB buckets, so what are the ones? We call them... First BB is Brilliant Basics. The reason why we call it BB, Brilliant Basic, you need to brand... You cannot brand it as tech debt, so it feels like very off because these are brilliant, these are important. That's what the company's built on, and the company needs to invest in that. So that's one.\n\n(00:43:46):\nThe second one is Bread and Butter. So that's your backlogs. If the product managers had no big ideas, and they just were left on their own, what would they come up with in terms of just improving that line of business that they're given? Then, there are Big Bets. Now, that's where your larger ideas that have come together, but how many big bets should we take, or is this big bet even a big one? That's where you're working backwards or PR FAQs start becoming even more important because those are the kind of bets that cannot be taken without everybody basically signing up, working backwards, and saying, \"We will all make this successful.\"\n\n(00:44:26):\nBreaking Bad essentially is a different world altogether. That's where you want to redefine your company. For example, in Swiggy, if we were doing food delivery, now we want to do grocery delivery as well. It's like these are two companies working together, or from a food delivery company, we wanted to become a convenience company. So that's almost breaking bad. Again, like I said, we got cheesy, but the good thing that happens is now what you can do is, along with your leadership, take stock, and the head of product essentially can say, \"You know what? In the next year, I can invest a lot less on my brilliant basics, and we should as a company focus a lot on this breaking back because that is existential.\" But then, we should not look back and say, \"Why were tech systems a little bit broken this time? We had a little bit more down times.\"\n\n(00:45:17):\nYou can basically blow it out and almost showcase what to expect. For example, if we are just working on a whole bunch of bread and butters, so you'll start seeing a lot fewer bugs, customers will be a little happier. You worked a lot more... drill in basics. Tech systems are nice, but you didn't create any differentiators. Well, none of your bets went out, and your competitors are catching up. So does that sound like a better future? These are hard questions, and these privatization questions... I don't think of product management questions so much as product strategy questions, but in a lot of cases, executors don't know what they're trading off against.\n\n(00:45:53):\nSo if you are able to create the conversation around which buckets do we want to put in and create three alternatives... I have tried to do that a bunch of times. Let's look at strategy A, and we see how to be divergent. Suppose we were putting a lot fewer focus points in brilliant basics and a lot more on, for example, big bets, then there will be a risk that they will be like, \"We won't have any experiments or very less experiments. Bugs will stay bugs, but we will get a shot at changing the game.\" Is that a future that sounds better or something else which is like because you're pained also by a lot of bugs and constant down times, which is more secure, but we won't build something amazing, so which sounds better? Because you are able to drive that, now the clarity to the product managers is way clearer in terms of what will they do. Also, they would know that if they have been signed up for a big bet, then they will need to contribute to the PR FAQ. They will need to contribute to the actual working on that irrespective of what their product was, but now they're part of something bigger.\n\nLenny (00:47:03):\nAwesome. I love it. Okay. So just to summarize so people can have just a very short definition of this framework. Brilliant Basics is essentially tech debt and things that you just have to do like hygiene almost. Bread and Butter is essentially optimizing the product, existing product. Big Bets are big bets, and Breaking Bad are just future big rocket like moon shots just transform the way the business works?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:47:29):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:47:30):\nI love it. It's also interesting. Another thread that comes up again and again in your advice is exploring all the options before committing to one like you always... I think it sounds like you always try to recommend three. I guess let me say what I always find is important there is I think it's important for the product manager to recommend one along with that. It's not just like, \"Here's three. You tell me which one you do.\" It's like, \"Here's three. Here's my recommendation why.\" Is that your advice too, or do you see something-\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:47:53):\n100%, 100%. So when you have explored the three, you essentially have done the work one like, \"I have covered all bases and also crystallized them into a concrete option. Now, I'm choosing one on the company's behalf on the basis of whatever I know about the market, about the company, about our strategy, and about how we will make it successful.\" Now, if I miss something, it's also a time where you can actually work with leadership and other product managers to essentially get that knowledge complete, or if you're 80% right, you can actually use elements of strategy two and strategy three to bring into one. So that's always the way that your thing that... one very concrete option, but because you have these other tools so that you're not missing and bringing it together. But ultimately, you're the one who is going to champion this, and that's where the other leadership element of Amazon comes in which is disagree and commit. But once we have aligned on this one, we'll all commit to launching this, and then the leadership should not go back and forth on that part.\n\nLenny (00:48:59):\nAwesome. I want to go in a completely different direction. It feels like you have a lot of contrarian opinions about how to build product, and how to build teams, and build companies, and things like that, so I just want to start broad. What are some things you have contrarian opinions about, things you believe that a lot of other people maybe don't believe or seek differently?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:49:19):\nSo one, for example, excellence and speed. There's always a question around that. \"Hey, would you rather ship faster, or would you rather ship better?\" In my opinion, when you have to make a choice, think more and ship better. Most experiments should be thought experiments. They should not even be tried out because they're obviously going to fail which is contrary to, \"Let's try it out, and then let's see.\" I think that wastes a lot of company time. If you had smart people who could do metathinking, a lot of experiments would just not even be like... It's not a rule, but it's a preference. I think speed and excellence are two different axes. Ideally, you should be better at both, but if you had to choose one, choose excellence.\n\n(00:50:04):\nThere's another contrarian opinion which is... I think most product managers, and again, I'm probably talking a little bit of the kind of people that I work with and have interacted with in product. Most product managers should not even be product managers. They should think a little bit more around whether this is actually the right field for them because I think a lot of people from other areas have entered the field without fully realizing what it takes. So there is definitely a way in which you can coach yourself, and then work your way upwards of that one, but it can make you quite miserable if it's not right for you.\n\nLenny (00:50:49):\nIs there something folks should look for there that will tell them you probably shouldn't be a product manager? Either motivation, or skill set, or background, or anything?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:50:55):\nNo. I don't think about particular domains that you come from. I have, again, a simple framework of three. I think the first thing is essentially raw sharps, and that can manifest itself into problem identification and problem solving. That's one, and also, higher-order thinking and all of that. I think that is super important. The second one is what I call drive or grit. I think with that comes a whole bunch of qualities around curiosity, learnability, never giving up, consumer-backward thinking, \"I really want to solve this,\" and all of that that comes with that. Third, which is a little difference, we talked about that, is influence. You're in the business of influence, and if you can see yourself that, \"I'm built this way,\" or, \"I want to really get better at these,\" that's when I think this field is going to serve you well.\n\nLenny (00:51:45):\nI love that everything is three. How handy.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:51:48):\nOnly the BBs are four. I wish I could compress them three.\n\nLenny (00:51:51):\nYeah. There's too many things to do there. Essentially, these are maybe your perspective on the most important PM skills. A good way to think about it. Influence, grit, and just being smart.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:52:02):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:52:03):\nI think what you said here is not like you have to be amazing at these to get into product and do well. It's you need to be excited about getting better at these skills.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:52:10):\nYes. That's right.\n\nLenny (00:52:12):\nAwesome.\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:52:12):\nWell, I think it's not as if that everybody is born with a lot of influence. Of course, you can get better at it, but it's a prospect of that, \"Hey, I will need to be influential to succeed at this job.\" That should excite you and not scare you away. You should not think like, \"Hey, you know what? I can get away from this and still be very successful product manager,\" because most likely, you will not.\n\nLenny (00:52:34):\nMaybe spending a little more time here. So, smart, you're probably not going to be able to do a lot about. In terms of grit or influence, is there anything you can share about what you've seen most helps people develop at these skills other than just doing the job for a while, and then starting to get better at this?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:52:49):\nYeah. I think even smartness, I think 80% of that smartness, I think, is something that's very achievable. You don't need to be outstanding on that. Domain knowledge, for example, is something just like... An average smart person with no domain knowledge versus you armed with a lot of knowledge around domain and so on can already take you there, but you can take better decisions. I think first one is more about decision-making, problem identification, problem solving, and all of that. So I think that really can be developed at least to a level where you are very effective. Drive, I think, is probably the hardest to coach, probably the hardest. I've not seen people with less drive actually eventually turning out with a lot of drive, et cetera, but they can be inspired. I think you need to be a person who can think about it that way, but the third one, influences, I think, there's no negotiation there. You need to really think that, \"I have to be good at this one.\"\n\n(00:53:46):\nThere's another framework that, Lenny, I wanted to talk about. When I look at product leadership in general and how do you think about different people and so on. When is it a product manager problem, or your problem, or a company problem? There are only three reasons, again, why things do not happen the way you want them to happen as a leader. You can look at a person, and you would say either that person can't do, which is a capability issue, or they won't do, which is a motivation or an alignment issue, or they were not set up to do, which is really your problem, that you didn't set up the ways of working now design properly, or we are okay as such and such, and so on, and so forth.\n\n(00:54:26):\nSo, as a leader, it's almost the opposite of what we talked about, great influence and raw sharps. Do you have the right people in terms of capability? If not, is the right answer for us to coach them or to really put them... or mentor them and so on, or move them to some other place because maybe their capability is suited elsewhere? If they won't do, why won't they? Are they not aligned to you? Do they not agree with your vision? Do they not just have enough time? So on and so forth. So you need to really go deeper there. Why won't they do?\n\n(00:55:05):\nThere are different answers for that, but if it's a setup issue, and at least I've realized that apart from what product managers can do, almost 70%, 80% of problems why things don't happen are a setup issue. Product leaders or other leaders have not thought through what OKRs are doing to my company, not really fully thought through around org design. If you've read the book called TEEN Topologies, that's one interesting book which starts with Conway's law and essentially saying, \"Show me an engineering architecture, and I will actually tell you what the org design of this company is,\" but that also manifests itself in products that you can basically look at a product. In most cases, you will be able to say what was org design that led to this kind of product.\n\nLenny (00:55:51):\nI have heard that book mentioned a couple of times recently. I got to check it out just to the three you just shared, which is another three. I love it. Can do, won't do. What was the third one again, didn't do?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:56:01):\nNot set up to do.\n\nLenny (00:56:03):\nNot set up to do. That one is long. That's a long one. I think what's cool about these are they're essentially ways to measure performance. Maybe if you're a product manager, like performance reviews, it's like, \"Did you have the skills to do this? Did you have the motivation to do this, or is it something not set up for you?\" You weren't set up for success, basically?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:56:20):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:56:21):\nOkay. Let's go to AI corner, something I'm trying to do with every guest. Is there anything you've learned about working with AI that you think might be helpful to listeners?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:56:31):\nYeah. I think a couple of things. I think working with AI, many, many teams and companies get too excited about AI, and the possibilities, and so on, and it's almost like a solution ready to find a problem within their companies, which also is fine because now you're thinking about possibilities on what this particular technology can do for my company. So it's a good way to start, but many people don't actually use it in the best way possible and force fit it. Instead of that, you can think about, \"How do I get AI to work with HI?\" Again, it's connecting back with... and this is something that Swiggy CEO, Sriharsha, invented this term called HI just to make sure that everybody understands.\n\n(00:57:13):\nArtificial intelligence is important as much as human intelligence. If you're not humanly intelligent, you're not going to be artificially intelligent or AI really help your company a lot. So, literally, any product that you're building, even when it is technologically quite interesting, and exciting, and so on, it needs to be balanced out and work together along with a great UX, along with behavioral science. The combination of those two will actually make sure that you're getting the best outcome of that, unless you are building something which is completely backed and with no human interventions. We're talking about consumer products largely.\n\nLenny (00:57:51):\nYou've helped build some of the most successful marketplaces in India and in the world. I'm curious just what may be a lesson or two about building a successful marketplace?\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:58:02):\nOne thing that I would definitely want to talk about is when you're thinking marketplaces, it's not as a one plus one equals two, it multiplies. We're thinking about three-way marketplaces. You almost not need to think like it's a two-dimensional plane going into three-dimension. It becomes that amount of complexity, and your regular product management and leadership principles start failing. So a bunch of usual suspects will not work. Let me give an example. OKRs will not work. Why not? So, fundamentally, OKRs are a way to think about objectives and key results, but the fundamental assumption here is that it is solving for a kind of user, and that kind of user, you can divide and conquer. Of course, there will be a little bit of tussle between different teams, but you can get them to work with each other. But if it is working for three different kinds of users, then all the goals will all the time be in conflict with each other.\n\nLenny (00:59:00):\nWhat are examples of the three users? There's like the delivery person, the restaurant-\n\nAnuj Rathi (00:59:04):\nThe end user. So if you have... I'll give you an example of. On the consumer side, we need to collect more delivery fee. What does that really mean for those other two? On the restaurant side, hey, we need to get more commissions because profitability is a goal. On the delivery partner side, it means pay them less or optimize a little bit more. But once you start moving one lever, those two are already stretched towards the other directions. They're not independent levers in the first place, and the way to even model them out... How will it work? What if we choose X versus what... Ys will change. Y on Z. Z will change. It's almost impossible to do that.\n\n(00:59:43):\nSo I've seen OKRs fail multiple times when you're running this kind of a marketplace. Big bets work much better. That's when you say, \"Hey, we want to take this bit,\" but it's all going to be... It's all going to come together as... If we pull this lever, then something else will change. So here's the entire story of, \"Let's go make this profitable by making delivery fee higher, but maybe not touching earnings per hour, or maybe not touching restaurant commissions.\" Things like that. So I've at least found that's a better way to choose strategically which direction we have to go.\n\n(01:00:18):\nThe other thing is managing multiple empathies together that's not straightforward. So, again, Swiggy being a real-time, hyper-local marketplace, and we discussed about that, right? As soon as the order comes, what happens between when user does this and when delivery executor is doing something else, and what are absolute different kind of scenarios that are going to be faced by the delivery executor? At the same time, how will I really work with the user to manage their emotions? So you need to manage a whole bunch of these things together, and product management here, you cannot have... The delivery executive product manager only care about that side. They also need to be a champion on the consumer side and vice versa.\n\nLenny (01:01:03):\nYeah. I find with marketplaces... Uber went through this, Lyft went through this where the supply often just gets squeezed because they need to deliver for the customer. So drivers end up getting housed. Airbnb hosts get pushed to do things they may not want to do. Imagine delivery people, same thing.\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:01:18):\nNow that you mentioned Uber, for example, one of the things that companies which were running taxi businesses. If you have just one limited pool of money, for example, and you want to get the marketplace humming with respect to number of orders per day, how do you decide, \"Should I incentivize my users, for example, for the first ride, first 10 rides, and so on, or put zero money in there, but incentivize my drivers?\" You need to come here, so you have to think about liquidity also in very different ways, and sometimes you need to pull the lever completely towards the other side. So the experiments also. A/B experiments also don't work, and that's a very unique thing about marketplaces. I mean, not work the way that you would expect them to work because there are network effects all over. So if you have to run A/B experiments on your drivers side, if you put half drivers on A versus half on B, but there is a network effect between the both of them.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nWhen you're trying to decide which side of the marketplace to focus on and prioritize, do you have any lessons or rules of thumb of just focus on the customer and index towards their happiness versus the supply versus, say, the delivery person?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:02:32):\nThere's one thing that I think marketplaces need to realize is that, A, you need to be operating in a stable marketplace. So all sides need to be stable enough so that they're not going to go away. So I think that's a starting point, and that's an important point because once we have established that, then after a stable marketplace, then we say, \"Which are the kind of customer that we are in the service for? Which are the customer that we will really focus on?\" For example, Amazon is very, very clearly a customer-centric company. If they have to make a choice, they won't because they need to have a stable marketplace. So sellers also are very... as important, but slightly more important than the customer.\n\n(01:03:10):\nFor example, if you looked at, say, Taobao or in Alibaba, their way of thinking is their aim in life is to create life-changing experience for 10 million Chinese sellers, and they will create a marketplace from the point of view of sellers which can actually sell. Again, they will have the same consumer app, and a seller work, and so on. They are in the service of sellers, so you really need to derive from the company's vision. I think the way we had thought about it at Swiggy that we had to clarify in our values that the first value is... Initially, it used to be customer comes first, but that was very confusing because everybody is a customer. Even a restaurant is a selling customer and so on. We had to clarify that consumer comes first, the end consumer which is actually eating food because we are a convenience company that delivers to the end consumer, and when you're thinking about restaurants or delivery partners, we work with them because we both are... When you're talking with the delivery partner, Swiggy and the delivery partner, we both are in the service of the customer. So you'll build that app also from that perspective and even the restaurant side also from that perspective that we both are together in the service of the end customer.\n\nLenny (01:04:25):\nI feel like you have probably a hundred more frameworks, and processes, and acronyms we can talk about, but I know you got to go. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on, or is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:04:38):\nJust last few words that I want to revise. Work backwards from an amazing future. So first thing is creatively imagine a future, and then work backwards from that, and essentially, think what will make that successful, and be paranoid about... that everything is going to go wrong. Hence, I need to just make sure that it all comes together.\n\nLenny (01:04:59):\nOnly the paranoids survive. Great advice to leave people with. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:05:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:07):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:05:12):\nOne book is Working Backwards. We covered that. The other one that has shaped my beliefs a lot is called How Brands Grow by a professor called Byron Sharp. There are two paths to it, How Brands Grow 1 and 2, that's both very good. The other book which I really love is... and recently, Kunal Shah, who's the founder of Cred, an Indian startup, suggested is The Luxury Strategy. The reason why I love that book is because it gets into the depth of the human psychology behind hierarchies, and how lords, and kings, and those kind of social hierarchies have shaped how people think about aspirational products and so on. So highly recommend it.\n\nLenny (01:05:52):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:05:57):\nI really like to do reruns of The Office. I was trying to think about this as, \"What is a recent movie that I watched?\" I'm like, \"No.\" I keep on going back to The Office and some other episode. Like today, I have a lot of stories from Michael Scott.\n\nLenny (01:06:13):\nOkay. The US one, not the British one, or do you watch both?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:06:16):\nNo. I watch both, but the US one has a lot more seasons.\n\nLenny (01:06:21):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing product-manager-specific?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:06:27):\n\"Which are the products where you decide speed is more important versus which are the products where you have to say excellence is what's important?\" I think that gives me a good understanding of their frameworks and why they're just saying what, and then we go back into concrete examples where they chose one versus the other, and then take it from there.\n\nLenny (01:06:46):\nThen, what do you look for In a good answer to that question?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:06:49):\nI look for, essentially, their assessment of risk, their assessment of how important or how well have they assessed the market and the competition or the competitive products in that market. If their answer is, \"Let's ship something, and we'll find out, and so on,\" that also gives me, basically, a point of view that they really don't understand that this product, what they're talking about with the shipping speed, is not really... The V part of the MVP is not viable or is not... I don't know. How do you call the MLP or whatever? But it's not differentiated enough that it can be marketed. It is not worth enough where we can take it to user. It's not going to work for a lazy win and selfish user, and maybe that's not the answer towards speed versus excellence versus, for example, there's some products which are... There's a very clear competitive differentiation that we can find. There was a clear market gap. I want to launch something even if it is half-baked. No problem. I want to go, take it out, get user feedback, I trade, and so on. So understanding of the market, A, but B, also understanding of the core orientation.\n\nLenny (01:08:00):\nIt comes back to your ongoing advice of being full-stack in a lot of ways, and in this case, being a full-stack PM thinking about marketing, launch, and adoption, all those things. Next question, what is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:08:15):\nThe very recent product that I like is called RISE. It's a sleep track app because I am half insomniac, and for the longest time, I was thinking about, \"How can I track this? What am I doing, and how can I actually get better at this?\" So I really like the way that they actually help the end user. It's just been a week since I've started using it, but recommend it.\n\nLenny (01:08:42):\nHas that helped your sleep yet or too soon to say?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:08:45):\nIt's helped me track my sleep, so it's... Now, it's getting into the zone where it is actionable, but I like it.\n\nLenny (01:08:51):\nOkay, okay. We'll see.\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:08:52):\nWe'll see.\n\nLenny (01:08:53):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with people, think about in either work or life?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:09:01):\nI would call it a life motto as much, but one of the things that I keep telling my people who work with me, alongside me, and so on is, \"Stop externalizing.\" That's one, which also means the more artistic way to say that is you are the reason for your own misery. So that's something that I keep using a lot more in a fun way. But if things go wrong, if that leadership meeting didn't happen in that way, if my product bombed, and so on, go back and let's ask ourselves what could we have done better, what I could have done better, and so on. Of course, because I'm also a poker player, so in a way, I understand there is half luck involved and half skill. But over a long period of time, if it's only luck and you're failing, and failing, and failing, you have to go and look back at your skill. So, yeah. You are the reason for your own misery.\n\nLenny (01:09:50):\nI love that advice. Be very empowering, and be responsible. Final question. I was stalking your LinkedIn. You host an event called The Secret Soiree, which is not that secret because you post about it, but I'm curious, just what is that all about, and what got you to do these sorts of events?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:10:07):\nSo we just started, me and an ex-colleague of mine, Shivangi. So we essentially wanted to meet cool people around. So that's how it started. Interesting people without agenda who can come together and discuss interesting stuff about entrepreneurship, about startups, about products, about connections, and so on, and so forth. So it just started like that, and now we are onto many, many more interesting things that we are bringing in terms of cohorts which will be team-based. So it could be around product management, around marketing, around growth, and so on. We are strictly keeping it not-for-profit for at least the next year, but long way to go.\n\nLenny (01:10:51):\nAmazing, and so for listeners, is this something they could join? Who should look into this? Who is this for?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:10:57):\nAbsolutely. At that time, probably, we'll not call it The Secret Soiree once we have probably expanded.\n\nLenny (01:11:02):\nNo longer secret. Okay. Cool, and then I guess they just follow you on LinkedIn, right? That's how they can keep up to date with these sorts of events. Okay. Cool.\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:11:11):\nYes, on LinkedIn as well as on Twitter.\n\nLenny (01:11:12):\nAwesome. Anuj, we've gone through so many topics. We've talked about breaking bad and full-stack product management, full-stack thinking, working backwards, bread and butter, rule of threes. I don't know. So many things. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything we've talked about, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAnuj Rathi (01:11:33):\nYes. So I'm on Twitter, so on twitter.com/anujrathi, and LinkedIn, you can just search my name. I'm pretty active on both of them. I do a bunch of... not podcasts all the time like you host, Lenny, but a bunch of other events as well as talks, so. I keep on posting on Twitter. They can find me there.\n\nLenny (01:11:55):\nAmazing.

If you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, \"Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better.\" That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, \"You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it.\" Because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.\n\nLenny (00:00:39):\nToday. My guest is April Dunford. April is the world's foremost authority on product positioning. She's the author of the bestselling book, Obviously Awesome, which is my favorite book on positioning. And this is her second time on the podcast because she just published a new book called Sales Pitch, which builds on her 25-year career as VP of marketing and advisor to companies like Google and Epic Games and many others. The book guides you through a better way to pitch and sell your product. And in our conversation, April shares the framework that she has seen work most often in getting potential customers to get excited about your product and to decide to buy your product.\n\n(00:01:16):\nLike I say, at the top of this episode, you'll become better at pitching and selling your product by the end of this episode. And if that's useful to you, which it should be, this episode is for you. With that, I bring you April Dunford after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:01:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Composer, the AI powered trading platform now with retirement accounts.

Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, click up, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\n(00:03:04):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.\n\nLenny (00:03:47):\nApril, thank you so much for being here. Welcome back to the podcast.\n\nApril Dunford (00:03:52):\nSo great to be back. We were talking about this earlier, but it feels like it was so long ago when I did the last one. I was one of the first guests and I feel like, man, you've been running this thing forever. And that was like a year ago.\n\nLenny (00:04:05):\nIt feels like a lifetime, but it was about a year ago.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:08):\nBut what you've done with it is amazing, right? The growth in it, everything else, it's super inspirational.\n\nLenny (00:04:13):\nThanks April. I appreciate that.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:15):\nYou're welcome. It's true though. I think everybody looks at your stuff and goes, \"What the heck? How does he do it?\"\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nThe secret is a lot of work.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:04:24):\nThat's the get rich quick scheme there.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:28):\nNobody wants to hear that.\n\nLenny (00:04:30):\nYeah. But it's work that's extremely fulfilling and we get to chat again and you are a very rare return guest, which makes me very happy. And the reason you're back is you've written an incredible new book, which I have right here if you're on YouTube called Sales Pitch.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:44):\nThat's so cool.\n\nLenny (00:04:45):\nThere it is. And it's in your background, too. It's like a inception. The book is called Sales Pitch, How to Craft a Story to Stand Out and Win. And we're going to be spending our time today digging into all of the lessons and frameworks in the book as much as we can in the hour that we have. And my goal for this conversation is for listeners to leave this podcast with better skills at pitching and selling their product. Which I think every product leader and founder will want to do and get better at. How does that sound?\n\nApril Dunford (00:05:13):\nThat sounds great.\n\nLenny (00:05:14):\nOkay, sweet. I was thinking as a way to get into the conversation, we start with maybe a story or an example of a company that you worked with where you applied the frameworks and lessons they teach in the book. And then use that as kind of a jumping off point for digging in further.\n\nApril Dunford (00:05:30):\nYeah, sure. So my background is, I do positioning work. And so in the work that I do with clients, generally what we're working on is a shift in the positioning, which is a little bit of a shift in our thinking around, how do we win in the market? So in order to test that positioning, what we want to do is take the positioning and translate it into a sales pitch and then test it live with prospects.\n\n(00:05:53):\nAnd one of the things I noticed right at the beginning of doing this work is that everybody's sales pitch kind of looked the same and they weren't all that great. And for the most part what was happening in the sales pitch is there was no positioning going on in the sales pitch at all. The sales pitch was essentially a product exposition, so essentially a glorified product box room. If there was five dropdown menus, we're going to click on all five dropdown menus and show everybody everything just feature, feature, feature, feature, feature.\n\n(00:06:24):\nAnd so, most of the teams weren't used to doing any kind of pitching in the pitch really. It was just the facts Jack, were just going to show you that. Some would do this really lightweight thing. Here's the problem, we're the solution. Now let me walk you through all the dropdown menus, but it is basically the same thing like that.\n\n(00:06:43):\nAnd so what I wanted to do was build a pitch structure that would reflect the positioning. And so in order to do that, we have to get a little bit into storytelling mode. Not a lot, but at least a little. And when we're talking about features, we shouldn't be talking about features. We should be talking about the value that the features deliver.\n\n(00:07:01):\nSo let me give you an example and I'll do before and after what this would look like. So I work with these folks, Help Scout, and so they're in the customer service space, so think Zendesk or whatever. They're in that space. And what's interesting about them is they were built from the ground up to serve digital businesses. So businesses that don't have a physical store, they don't have sales reps. And so their approach to customer service was different from the outset. Help Scout said, \"Well, you know what? Customer service for that kind of business is really important. It's the only time you ever get to interact with actual customers.\" And so the data shows that if you give them a really great interaction in service, it improves loyalty, it improves repeat purchases, and it's actually a growth driver. Now, most folks in other industries see customer service as a cost center.\n\n(00:07:49):\nSo your telephone company for example, wants to get you off the phone as fast as possible. And they want to push you to the self-serve FAQ channels, and they don't care about giving you a good service at all. They don't care about any of that. And so they're all about driving the cost down. So if we look at Help Scout in their positioning, the alternatives to Help Scout are a handful of things. Most folks start using a shared inbox and it's really easy to use and the reps love it. It's easy to use. The problem is, is you start growing and then you want customer service features. You want to be able to do assignments and prioritization and things like that. So then these customers end up upgrading to help desk software and now they're in this whole different world.\n\n(00:08:31):\nSo the first thing is really hard to use. So we're not in shared inbox territory anymore. And the second thing is that there's this attitude of we're trying to push folks to low cost channels. We don't really care about them. We're going to assign you a ticket number. You're not a person anymore. All this stuff. So that's the situation. So Help Scout, if they did a typical pitch the way I see most SaaS companies pitch, they would just expose the features. Right? So the pitch would look like this. Digital business comes in and they say, \"Hi, Help Scout, let me show you how to log in, let me show you all the features. Look, there's a shared inbox thing there that's really great. Oh, look, we can do assignments and prioritization and we can do this other thing and we can do this other thing and la, la la.\" And I keep going until the time runs out and I don't have any more features to talk about.\n\n(00:09:20):\nThe problem with that pitch is the customer's sitting there going, \"I don't know, man, that sounds a little bit like my shared inbox, but it also sounds like help desk software. Is it different than help desk software? I'm not so sure. And there's overlap in the features there.\" And so it doesn't really answer the question, why pick us over the other guys?\n\n(00:09:42):\nAnd so a different style of pitch would be one, we would do a little bit of setup to give everybody an idea about how we fit amongst all the other solutions and what our point of view is in the market. And then when we get to exploring the features, we would do that within the context of the differentiated value. So here's how that pitch would look like. Customer comes in and Help Scout says, \"Hey, digital business, we work with a lot of companies like you, and I'm going to show you the product. But before we get there, one of the things we think is interesting is that digital businesses look at customer service differently. They look at it as a growth driver rather than a cost center. And so most of the folks we work with see delivering a really amazing experience as a key part of customer service. Would you agree with that?\"\n\n(00:10:26):\nYeah, we would. They have a little conversation and then they say, \"Great. We you have choices here. So most of the folks we work with start with a shared inbox, and that's great because it's really easy, really easy to use all that stuff. The problem is if you're growing and you probably are, then you're going to outgrow that because you're going to need prioritizations assignments, help desk stuff.\n\n(00:10:45):\nAnd so then your option is to go to help desk software. And so help desk software is great, does all the things. The problem is that it was not designed for businesses like you. It was designed for businesses that want to take the cost out of customer service. So it's going to do some things that are weird. It's going assign your customers a ticket number and it's going to try to drive them to low cost channels. So can we agree that in a perfect world for digital business like yours, we'd want something as easy to use as a help desk, but had all the bells and whistles so we wouldn't have to migrate to something else. And on top of that was built from the ground up to deliver amazing customer service. Do we agree we want that?\"\n\n(00:11:26):\nNow, at that point, the customer is either with you or you're not. But if they are, then we switch to the actual demo part. If we do a demo and then we say, \"Great, we've got those three things. Let me show you how that works. So one as easy to use an inbox. Look, here's the inbox. It's easy to use. Looks just like an inbox. It's amazing. Two, features, so you never have to outgrow it. Look, here's how we do prioritizations assignments, whatever. We can do all the stuff you need as you grow, and you're never going to have to switch platforms. And then last one, deliver an amazing experience. Look, the customer gets to choose which channel that they interact with you with. And look, they get to stay Dave and not ticket number 1479.\"\n\n(00:12:02):\nThat sort of thing. So that's how the pitch looks in the after. But that's a really different pitch. That pitch is designed to answer the question, \"Why pick us over the other folks?\" And so as you might imagine, it is a lot more effective at actually getting clients to get their head around, what is this thing? Why is it different? Why should I pick you? And it just works way better in a sales situation.\n\nLenny (00:12:22):\nAwesome. So just to maybe summarize the framework 'cause you went through each of these pieces, and I think it might be helpful to give people the kind of steps. And I have them here, but maybe it might be better for you to kind work through.\n\nApril Dunford (00:12:33):\nSo you can think of it is... So first of all, the pitch structure has two big pieces. So the first is the setup. The setup piece is not about us, it's about the market, our point of view on the market. The second bit is all about our differentiated value. So why pick us over the other guys? So those pieces aren't equal. In a normal sales pitch situation, we don't want to spend all day in the setup part. We want to get to the meat, which is our differentiated value, but we can't skip that bit. So if I've got a half hour call or a 45-minute call, maybe I spend a few minutes on this upfront, this upfront stuff is really important though.\n\n(00:13:12):\nAnd we could break the upfront into three pieces. So it starts with our insight into the market. So you can think of this as our point of view on the market or kind of like the problem inside the problem, in some ways. So in Help Scout's case, the insight is, \" Hey, customer service is just different for digital businesses, and this is really a growth driver, not a cost center. So we need to think about customer service in a different way.\" That's their insight. So we start with that.\n\n(00:13:41):\nThe second piece is pluses and minuses of alternative solutions. What we want to do is paint a picture of the entire market and talk about what's good and bad of the other ways of approaching the job. And then out of that conversation, we have a conclusion, which is what I call perfect world. But just kind of like can we agree that if we really wanted to solve this problem and knowing what works and doesn't work in the alternate solutions, can we agree really good solutions should tick these boxes? This is getting the customer aligned with your worldview.\n\n(00:14:14):\nIf they're aligned, then we switch to the follow through. The follow through has a handful of steps, but the main step is this differentiated value step. So usually what we'd start with is an introduction. \"Hey, we're Help Scout. We do customer service stuff specifically for digital businesses.\" And then we would move on to, \"Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it. Here's the value we deliver. Here's how we do it.\"\n\n(00:14:37):\nWe generally end the sales pitch with a couple of little steps. So one is after we talk about the value, generally there's a step for proof, which is how can we prove that we do what we say we could do. Which is often a customer case study or it might be independent third party verification on stuff. But usually there's a proof step. There's an optional step after that, which is handling objections that haven't come up during the call. So sometimes we'll have a silent objection, \"Yeah, that sounds really good, but it sounds really hard to adopt.\" Or, \"Yeah, that sounds really good, but it's probably pretty expensive.\" Or, \"Yeah, that's okay, but it probably doesn't meet our needs for security or whatever.\"\n\n(00:15:15):\nAnd so we handle that at the end in this special objection step. And then we end the pitch with what I call the ask, which is whatever we want the customer to do next. So it could be just asking for the sale or it could be, \"Hey, we want to do a proof of concept. Who do we need to talk to about that?\" Or, \"Hey, we're going to do a project. Who needs to be involved in defining the project?\" Whatever the next step is in your sales process. That's how we end is with dask.\n\nLenny (00:15:44):\nCool. I wanted to actually talk about objections. 'Cause I imagine going through this, companies often don't agree with what you're saying, and I wonder how you handle that. So you're going in this, do you agree? And yeah, the silent objection is really interesting. I don't even think about that, where they're just like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, we agree.\" But they don't really agree. How would you suggest people handle them being like, \"No, I don't actually see the world that way.\" Or the silent objection, which I guess is something you save for the end.\n\nApril Dunford (00:16:09):\nTypically when we're starting with insight, our insight into the market, if we're doing this well, the insight is generally not all that controversial. So you could think of it this way. So it's kind of the reason you built what you built. So most founders, when you talk to them, they didn't just come up with the idea out of nowhere. They woke up in the morning and said, \"You know what sucks about email, this thing sucks about email. And so I'm going to build this different kind of email that solves that problem.\" Or in the case of Help Scout, it's like, do you know what sucks about customer service? It just wasn't built for these kinds of businesses.\n\n(00:16:44):\nAnd so if you've got a point of view on the world and you're talking to a customer that just fundamentally doesn't agree with that... In the case of a Help Scout, they come in and they say, \"No, actually it's a cost center for us. We're just trying to get the cost down.\" They should disqualify that deal because they can't serve that customer better than Zendesk does. Zendesk is going to win that deal. But if you've done this properly, your insight should resonate for the target account that you're trying to go after. Now, that doesn't mean there aren't going to be other objections, and usually there's all kinds of other objections. But the objections are more on a level of, if I can get you hooked at the beginning in this setup, then we go to the value, which is just proving I can do what we already agreed we wanted to get done. Then the objections tend to be more like operational stuff. \"Yeah, this sounds good, but I don't know if we can forward it.\" Or \"This sounds good, but boy, we're going to have to migrate off the old thing or whatever.\"\n\n(00:17:40):\nSo mentally they're kind of sold already, but they're worried about, \"Well, what's IT going to say? And can I actually get budget about this?\" And in B2B, we've got this network of people that we've got to go get agreement from to move forward on this thing. And so often there's objections around that. The beginning of the sales pitch thing... One more thing on that is that part of what we're doing in that setup is what salespeople would call discovery. And so that setup part should not be me talking at you. It should be a conversation between me and the client saying, \"Do you agree with this? Is this what you're seeing? Did you start with a shared inbox? What are you doing right now? Did you ever consider using help desk software? Why yes, why no? Do you have any constraints on what you're looking at? What have you tried before? What are you looking at trying right now?\"\n\n(00:18:31):\nThis is part of the discovery that we do in a first substantive sales call that your sales reps would know how to do this. Typically, one of the things we don't have in the pitch decks that I see in SaaS companies is there's no good place to do this discovery. So it kind of happens outside of the structure of the pitch. In this pitch structure, there's a definite spot for discovery. So by the time we get to the end of the setup, we should either be aligned like, \"Yep, this looks like a good prospect for us. Yep, we can do something. Yep, they got a problem we can solve. This all looks good.\" Or we kind of jointly come to the conclusion, \"Hey, this just... Our stuff just ain't for you, man.\" And that's it.\n\nLenny (00:19:13):\nI mentioned a lot of this comes from doing this enough times. You get to understand where people generally agree, this is a problem. We all know this is our problem. And it's unlikely that you're going to have to throw everything out because someone just decides, \"No, this isn't for us.\"\n\n(00:19:29):\nI think one of the biggest shift maybe from this framework is that you go into a teaching mindset. It's not just like, \"Here's our product, it's going to solve your problem.\" It's more, \"Here's what's happening broadly. Maybe you don't have the time to do the research we've done. Here's what we found.\" And then that builds trust, I think in you as a company and as a leader, a salesperson. And then they're like, \"Okay, see, they see the world the way we do.\" Or, \"I've just realized something new. I never thought of it that way.\" And then, \"Okay, cool. How do they think about the solution to this?\"\n\nApril Dunford (00:19:57):\nRight. One of the key things to think about in all of this stuff that I think we don't think about enough as software vendors is that customers will come to us and they've done their homework. They've Googled around and they've looked at stuff, but that doesn't mean they have perfect understanding of the market. In fact, it's usually far from it. If we think about it, most of the folks in B2B software, most of the time, your buyer has never purchased software like yours before. This is the first time they've done it. And their bosses come to them and said, \"Hey, figure this out. Go find us a CRM and look at all the CRMs and figure it out.\"\n\n(00:20:33):\nAnd the buyers looking at it going, \"Geez, I don't know, man. There's a lot of CRMs out there, and I'm looking at all the things. I'm on G2 Crowd and there's 24 CRMs in the top right corner. And I'm looking at Gardner Group and I'm looking at this thing and I'm actually doing my research, but I'm overwhelmed. What I don't have is a clear picture of the market. What are the different approaches to this problem? Forget about products. What are the approaches to the problem? Where do the products fit in those approaches? What's a good solution for me look like? What should be my purchase criteria?\" That's really hard for buyers to figure out.\n\n(00:21:10):\nAnd in general, in a sales process, we're not doing anything to help the buyer figure that out, even though we know it. We eat, sleep and breathe this market. We spend all day looking at competitors and thinking about this stuff and whatever. But we've got this idea, \"Well, we shouldn't do this because first of all, we can't talk about the other guys that we'd be seen as bashing our competition, and that's bad.\" The other thing is, even if we did give our opinion, nobody would trust us because we're biased. But if you look at the research on this stuff, the research doesn't support that. The research actually says what B2B software buyers want in a sales interaction is perspectives on the market and help weighing their options. And we don't do that. We're just like, \"Here's our stuff. You figure it out, it's up to you. You figure it out.\"\n\n(00:22:03):\nAnd so as a result, what we get are these buyers come in, they're overwhelmed with all this information. They come in and they sit in our sales process, and we overwhelm them even more with more features and more information. And what they're really worried about is, \"What if I make a bad choice here? I've never done this before and I'm going to have to recommend to my boss. And if I make the wrong suggestion to my boss, maybe my boss thinks I'm stupid. Or maybe I buy something and the whole department hates me because awful to use. Or maybe I pick something and it's just bad software and then bad things happen for the business, maybe I get fired.\"\n\n(00:22:40):\nAnd so the data on this shows that for B2B, 40 to 60% of B2B purchase processes end in no decision. And then when you look at, if you scratch on that data, the majority of those aren't saying, \"Well, I'm not making a decision to buy something new because the old thing we were doing is better.\" That's not true at all. In fact, the majority of the...\n\nApril Dunford (00:23:00):\nThe old thing we were doing is better, that's not true at all. In fact, the majority of those is they couldn't figure out how to make a choice confidently. So what they did was they just went to their boss and said, \"You know what? Now's not a good time. Let's not do it now. Let's do it next year. Let's just delay it,\" because that is the safe risk-free thing for that person who's on the hook to make the decision to do.\n\nLenny (00:23:23):\nI think this is one of the most interesting insights that you share in your book and you also share this in the newsletter post about how buying software you could argue is harder than selling it because people will have learned there's skills and training for selling, but buying is, as you described, extremely stressful. Basically your job's on the line if you make a mistake. Is there anything more you can share along those lines just to help reinforce that buying software is extremely hard and stressful and people don't understand that?\n\nApril Dunford (00:23:50):\nOnce you get into that mindset, I think then you look at the situation a lot different. I think we've seen the statistics on this that says the buyer is 80% of the way through their buying journey by the time they talk to your sales rep. Yeah, maybe, but they might be 80% of the way to saying, \"Nope, I'm not buying nothing.\" And in fact that's true 60% of the time. And so how do we combat that? The way we combat that is not just talking about ourselves, it's actually about trying to be helpful to that person in this very stressful situation that is trying to figure out how do I make a really good decision.\n\n(00:24:27):\nSo what we should be doing is giving them a way to think about the whole market and say, in the case of Help Scout, \"Look, there's shared inbox and then there's help desk software and then there's us. And I don't care who the vendor is, I'm going to put them in one of those buckets.\" And so you can just think of it that way. So you don't need to know every single feature, every single thing. I'm giving you a bigger picture of the whole market and helping you feel good. Well, if you choose this or you choose that, now you know why.\n\nLenny (00:24:57):\nI think what's interesting about this is a lot of startups fail because they can't convince anyone to switch from the status quo. And I think people always think of that as the current product is good enough and that's why they're losing, but I think this adds an additional wrinkle of it's also the person buying it is just like, \"I don't want to add the stress to even decide and make the choice and put my butt on the line to switch.\" And I never thought of it that way.\n\nApril Dunford (00:25:22):\nI think that hurdle is a lot more than you think. So we obviously have to compete with status quo, we can't ignore status quo, because sometimes status quo just is good enough and so we can't ignore that. We still lose deals to status quo, but we lose an awful lot of deals to just plain customer indecision, customers being more afraid of screwing up than missing out.\n\nLenny (00:25:46):\nSo to try to overcome that, to drill into the things you find most powerful, one is help the customer understand the bigger picture and why essentially they're falling behind, why maybe competition is going to have an advantage because they're thinking in a different way.\n\nApril Dunford (00:26:04):\nWell, I'll throw something out about that.\n\nLenny (00:26:06):\nPlease.\n\nApril Dunford (00:26:10):\nAnd I've heard people talk about this a lot that one of the things we could do in this situation when a customer is feeling this indecision is to lean into this FOMO and say, \"Look, you're missing out. The competitors are all doing it and you're not doing it.\" And so this is an interesting question. And so I was super excited, Matt Dixon wrote this book called The JOLT Effect, and in that they studied two and a half million sales calls, they recorded on Gong and they studied it with AI, and then they looked at what happened after the sales call, so were these successful or not successful, did a deal happen or whatever. It's pretty rare that we get a chance to dig into some data like this.\n\n(00:26:49):\nAnd so what his data showed is if a customer is indecisive, throwing FOMO into the mix makes it worse. So they're less likely to close the deal if you throw that in. And the idea is that they're already stressed out and you're just putting more stress on them by pressuring them, by saying, \"Oh, this is happening, bad things are going to...\" You're like, \"Bad things will happen if I do something, bad things happen if I don't do something, what do I do?\"\n\nLenny (00:27:22):\nThey just put their head in the sand, right? They're just like, \"Ah, forget it.\"?\n\nApril Dunford (00:27:24):\nSo they're just like, \"Forget it, I'm doing nothing. Now I'm totally paralyzed.\" And so there's an assumption that companies are very motivated by this FOMO thing, but I think that that is not always true, and if the customer is actually indecisive, throwing in this FOMO thing isn't going to do it. So what does work in that situation is, one, giving them the tools to make the decision. So that includes paint the picture of the market, teaching them how to buy essentially. So teaching them, look, for customers like you, you just have to worry about these three, four things, and all this other stuff, it doesn't apply to you. That applies to bigger companies, that applies to whatever, so this idea of teaching a customer how to buy is one way to take that stress down.\n\n(00:28:08):\nAnd then there's a whole bunch of other techniques you can use. So one is if it's a really big deal, we can split it into smaller pieces, we can do things like offer you a money back guarantee, we can do things like sometimes we have services and support that are going to help you if things go bad and this is how we're going to make sure. So this idea of being able to take risk off the table is a really serious one if we've got a customer that is actually paralyzed because of this indecision thing.\n\nLenny (00:28:36):\nThat makes a lot of sense, basically it's like how do we help the buyer cover their ass if they made a mistake, because what you're saying is that's the main reason they're not buying your product.\n\nApril Dunford (00:28:43):\nAnd this FOMO thing is just not going to do it.\n\nLenny (00:28:43):\nThat's so interesting. So I really like this framework. I wrote this down, teaching them how to buy, that is a really simple way of just thinking about this whole process.\n\nApril Dunford (00:28:53):\nWell, it's funny, I was having this conversation with Bob Moesta, he did Jobs To Be Done.\n\nLenny (00:28:58):\nYeah, I watched that episode.\n\nApril Dunford (00:29:00):\nSo he's just the best. And so one of the things I think of is normally when we come at this we're like, \"Well, how can we convince the customer that we do the job that they need to have done?\" And obviously we need to do that, but there is this secondary job that the champion of the deal is, and that's how do I make a decision without getting fired? And so we got to help them accomplish that job, otherwise we don't get what we want, which is the money.\n\nLenny (00:29:28):\nIt's so interesting. And it's not even necessarily get fired, it's even the performance sufferers or they don't get the promotion, it's did they do a good job. This makes me think of a process at Airbnb we went through to buy community forum software and I just remember these massive teams of salespeople come to the office and pitching everyone on the software and they just keep pushing you to make what's the next step here, who do we need to roll in, who needs to buy into it? And it's just like, \"Oh my God, it's so stressful. I have to keep this thing moving.\" And then there's IT coming in like, \"Oh, we got to make sure it integrates with Salesforce.\" And you start with I just wanted the best community forum software because we were trying to build something really different and unique and you end up with like, \"Okay, it's fine, just go with the thing that works with Salesforce. It's all good. I'm just going to move on to another process.\"\n\nApril Dunford (00:30:15):\nWell, this is the thing, it's so easy to default to the market leader in that situation. The market leader has this big advantage that you can say, \"You know what? Who's going to get me in trouble for picking Salesforce? Nobody.\" It's so easy to just flip back on that. And so if you're the challenger in this situation, the brand that's number two or number three, you've got to get over all of this inertia and tilting towards the status quo, because it's just so easy, it's the lowest risk decision, besides do nothing is to just pick the leader in the market and we'll just run with that.\n\nLenny (00:30:49):\nI think the classic phrase was no one gets fired for buying Microsoft. I wonder is it Salesforce now that's the default version of that now?\n\nApril Dunford (00:30:55):\nYeah, the original one was IBM. [inaudible 00:30:57]\n\nLenny (00:30:56):\nI think you're right. Oh, man.\n\nApril Dunford (00:30:59):\nNow you totally get fired for buying IBM. I don't know what happens. The other thing you bring up is I think an interesting thing to think about too that really messes people up in these situations is that in B2B, typical purchase process, we have five to seven people involved in making the deal happen and so there's this complexity we don't have a consumer, but a lot of people I think overcomplicate that. In a typical B2B purchase process, we've got someone in that buying team is what we would call the champion. So that person is the person who's been tasked with, hey, pick us the accounting software or pick us the CRM, you figure it out. And so that person is the person that does the initial research, makes the short list, probably sits on the first calls, and then there's all these other people.\n\n(00:31:49):\nNow, the other people can't make a deal happen, but they can kill it a thousand ways. So the way this works is your positioning and your pitch needs to really work for the champion, because if it doesn't, you don't even get to talk to anybody else, you don't even get to go near anybody else if you don't make it out of the shortlist and you don't get the deal cooking. But once the deal is cooking it is on you to arm that champion to handle all the objections potentially of all the other groups. So if you're the line of business buyer, let's say you're in the sales department and you're buying a CRM, IT is going to have to get involved at some point, and IT doesn't really care about the value of your CRM, but they do care does it meet the security requirements and does it integrate with the stuff we already have and how much of a pain is this thing going to be to manage, and so we're not actually pitching value to those people, we're just handling objections.\n\n(00:32:46):\nAnd so once we realize that, then we can get really tight on our positioning in our sales pitch. What we're really trying to do is just cook the champion, get the champion, and then once the deal's going we got to arm the champion for how to handle all these objections of all these other groups so that you can get a consensus to get a deal moving forward.\n\nLenny (00:33:05):\nHow do you actually do that? Is it ask them what are all the concerns you're hearing? Is it ask the individual stakeholders what your biggest concern is?\n\nApril Dunford (00:33:11):\nWell, if we're really smart, we already know because we've done lots of deals. So if we're being a good partner in this, sometimes even in the very first meeting in that spot where we're talking about objectives, we're going to say, \"Hey, look, IT is going to come in and they're going to be worried about this, this, and this, and don't worry, we got you.\"\n\n(00:33:32):\nSo we're SOC 2 compliant, we do this, we do that, we know because we've done 15 deals and we know what these deals are like and we know what the stuff is going to be. You might have the champion come in and say, \"Well, I don't know, end users might not like it.\" And it's like, \"Okay, well, here's how we're going to get your end users on board, this is the training we have, this is the stuff we're going to do.\" The neat thing, if you have a product like [inaudible 00:33:54] on the front end of that, it takes that objection off the table. And you might have other things like you're going to take this to your boss and they're going to want to know ROI numbers, blah, blah, blah, and we've already done that, look, here's our calculator, if you give us this information, we can put this in, here's how you sell your boss.\n\n(00:34:12):\nSo that's what we're doing. We're trying to arm them because we've done a million deals, they've never bought software like this before. So half the time you'll be doing deals and they don't even know what the purchase process is. And so if we're being good partners, we're like, \"Okay, does this need to go to purchasing?\" And they'll say, \"Yeah, it probably does.\" Oh, well, here's what typically happens at purchasing. They're going to do this, this, this, and we're going to give you this stuff and that's going to help you get it through purchasing.\n\nLenny (00:34:40):\nThe way you're describing it now makes it feel like you need to be a big company for this to be useful because smaller companies don't have all these reps and they may not have the resources to do all these things you're describing. Who is this framework useful for? Can you use this approach if you're just, say, an early stage B2B?\n\nApril Dunford (00:34:53):\nWell, so it's B2B products. If you don't have a sales team, I still think you can use this structure to build a story that marketing can use and you can use in different ways, and we can talk about that. But in the companies that I work with, they're B2B, they've got a sales team, and so the immediate thing we're doing is we're making a shift in positioning, we're building a sales pitch that reflects that positioning, we can immediately implement that in sales even though it's going to take a while for us to forklift the messaging and do other stuff and change our campaigns and everything else to match this new positioning, but we can tighten up the sales pitch and have an immediate impact over in sales on that. Second thing is that I've worked with tons of companies where the founder is the only sales rep and this works pretty good for that.\n\n(00:35:39):\nI don't think we need a ton of resources to do it, but I do think we need to have enough traction in the market that we understand how a deal typically goes. So if we haven't sold anything yet then we don't know yet, it's hard for us to help you buy something if we don't even know how to sell it. But if I've done 10 deals, I know what happens, I got a pretty good guess of what IT is going to say when you try to implement this stuff, I have a good guess of what's going to happen when we go to roll it out, I have a pretty good guess of what your boss might object to or might get excited by. And so I don't necessarily need a research team to go figure this out. This is just me trying to be helpful and help the champion do their job of getting this deal to the finish line.\n\nLenny (00:36:23):\nSo maybe the MVP of this approach is a deck that you continue iterating and adjust and restructure, and also bullet points of things you want to bring up like, \"Okay, cool, IT is going to ask for these things,\" a few bullet points that you keep track of.\n\nApril Dunford (00:36:38):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:36:39):\nI'm also thinking from the perspective of a product team building a product, they don't really sell it themselves. They work with sales, they work with marketing. Is there anything that you would recommend or that you think product teams could learn from this approach of selling that would help them build products in a different way or work with sales in a different way?\n\nApril Dunford (00:36:59):\nYeah. So here's what I think, the core of a good sales pitch is really deeply understanding your differentiated value, which is what is the value I can deliver that no other solution can. Often what I see at companies is you got a smart product team and they know a lot about the stuff they're building and why it's important and what the value is to the customer, and they did all this work on that when they were building it, but that information never made the jump to sales, because sales isn't even trying to pitch value. They're just pitching features like here's the dropdown menus, here's what they do. And so the first step in fixing this I think is to have a cross-functional team work on positioning.\n\n(00:37:43):\nSo if I've got product, marketing, and sales together in the room working on defining what our differentiated value is, then I'm going to get all the good juice out of the product team that deeply understands the product, deeply understand what's differentiated about it, deeply understands value, and then I'm also going to have all the juice from the sales team that understands what the common objections are, what the champion really wants to get done and doesn't want to get done, what the situation is in a typical account, and then all of this cool information sharing happens, which actually you end up with way better definition of your differentiated value in the first place.\n\n(00:38:22):\nAnd so once we've done that work, it is very natural then for us to work together on the sales pitch that reflects that. What typically happens is not that at all. What typically happens is product's working on some stuff, sales is working on some stuff, marketing's working on some stuff. Marketing in their own little bubble comes up with positioning, they might build some stuff for the sales team, heave it over to the sales team. Sales team looks at it and says, \"I don't get what any of this stuff is. I disagree with this. This doesn't match what I see,\" and they just throw it out and they go back to doing the same pitch they've been doing since the year of the flood.\n\nLenny (00:38:57):\nThat's a long time. So first podcast episode was all around positioning, and so folks want to get deep into that, they should listen to that, so we're not going to spend tons of time there, but differentiated value is a big part of this process also so I think it's worth spending a bit of time here. Could you maybe share a couple examples of what this is to give people a sense of what does it mean to share differentiated value?\n\nApril Dunford (00:39:20):\nYeah. So differentiated value is the answer to the question why pick us over the other alternatives? And so the way we get at that in positioning is we start with putting a stake in the ground of who do we actually compete with? And so if we didn't exist in the market, what would a customer do? And so typically there's some status quo thing, it might not even look like you, it might just be a spreadsheet, or do it with the intern or manual labor, and then there's whatever else ends up on a short list against us. And it's basically the definition of I got to beat all this plus indecision in order to win a deal, so I can stick my stake in the ground. Sales knows the answer to this question. If you have a sales team, they know the answer to this question, what would a customer do if we didn't exist, they know.\n\n(00:40:06):\nAnd then we get to the next step is, well, so what do we have that's different? And that's capability wise, feature function of the product or capability of the company, so it could be features, it could be your pricing model, it could be we have support in a way that the other folks don't. So there's all kinds of things it could be. It could be be the breadth of the portfolio that you have beyond that one product, we can fill whiteboards with this stuff. And then what we do is we go down that list of features and we say, \"So what? You got advanced AI, whatever the heck the thing is, so what? Why does anybody care?\" And the answer to that so what is your value. And because it came from this differentiated feature, it's generally value that the other guys can't deliver because they don't have the capabilities that underpin it.\n\n(00:40:53):\nSo if I give you an example, a company I worked with a few years back, they've recently been acquired by Salesforce called LevelJump, and so they're in the sales enablement space, which is terrible. There's a million companies in the sales enablement space and they all look the same. And so LevelJump, so if you look at, well, what's the competitive alternatives, if I look at all the companies in the sales enablement space, you can put them into two buckets in terms of approaches, they're either a CMS like a jazzy content repository where you could make sure that people are using the right content and whatever, or they're an LMS, a learning management system, which I can build the course and certify you on the course, and that's how we're going to train the sales reps.\n\n(00:41:39):\nIf you look at LevelJump, they're differentiated capability is they're the only one that's built on top of Salesforce. That's the feature, we're built on Salesforce, the other folks aren't. And then who cares? So what? And so when we first had a conversation about it, there was five or six different answers to that so what question, but the big answer was, well, because we're built on top of Salesforce, my sales enablement data is integrated with my sales data. And then you say, \"Well, so what about that?\" Well, because then that means I can actually tell did the sales enablement improve time to first deal or improve time to make quota? Well, so what about that? Well, if I improve that ramp time, then we get way more revenue faster. So that's the differentiated value.\n\n(00:42:29):\nWhen I go to do that in a sales pitch, I can translate that into my insight. My insight is every day your rep's not making [inaudible 00:42:36] it costs you money. So if we really want to solve sales enablement, don't we really want to have something where we can measure whether or not the sales enablement is working with sales metrics? Yeah, we do.\n\nLenny (00:42:47):\nInteresting. So the differentiated value often informs the insight that you start with?\n\nApril Dunford (00:42:52):\nIt does. It absolutely is. The insight is basically the context that makes your differentiated value important, what is the thing you need to know to understand the importance of my differentiated value? In the case of Help Scout, the insight is, look, digital businesses like customer service is a growth driver, where does that come from? If you look at their differentiated value, it's there. And so we can just reverse it, flip it around. Even if the product wasn't necessarily constructed with that insight, maybe we got there sideways or the roundabout way or whatever, we iterated our way into that. We can look at the differentiated value and then basically reverse it out to the insight.\n\nLenny (00:43:33):\nWhat's a sign that the differentiated value or insight that you've come up with just isn't clicking?\n\nApril Dunford (00:43:37):\nIf the differentiated value doesn't work in a sales pitch, what you'll get is the company going, \"Why would I pay for that? This is not value for me, buddy.\" The companies I work with, the way I look at it is if you're in market and you're selling and you have happy, engaged customers, there's differentiated value there. That's why they picked you. That's why they love you. That's why they don't turn out on you. It's there. You might not know what it is, we might have to do a little process to get at it, but it's there and it exists.\n\nLenny (00:44:16):\nAwesome. Another question that's been in the back of my mind since we started talking about differentiated values is just how honest should you be about the competition? Obviously there's a spectrum of extremely honest to super biased, what's your guidance on just how honest to be there?\n\nApril Dunford (00:44:34):\nThe posture I think you should assume in a sales situation, I had an old boss used to talk about this, is the posture we should have is calm confidence. So where that calm confidence comes from is we really understand why people should pick us. So this is differentiated value, we really understand it and we really understand who that's a really good fit for, and we don't even bother trying to chase anybody else.\n\n(00:45:03):\nSo we should be able to come in and say, \"Look, we're sales enablement that delivers results. If you don't care about those results, you shouldn't pick us. You should pick someone else.\" And so generally what we're trying to be is extremely honest. We're trying to come in and actually give credit where credit is due with the other approaches, because typically the other approaches work just fine for other kinds of companies. If you're really small and you're not growing e-commerce business, use a shared inbox. It's free, it's easy to use, there's no problems there, just use it. If you're really worried about bringing the cost down in a customer service center, maybe you should use Zendesk. And so I think the more we can act as a guide in this situation and come in and say, \"Look, these guys are good for this, these folks are good for this, and we're good for this. And you might not care about that, and if you don't care about that, we're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us.\" But I think that...\n\nApril Dunford (00:46:00):\nWe're not the one for you. You shouldn't pick us. But I think that this calm confidence idea is that where we know the client should pick us, we should be unafraid to fight for that business. But we should totally walk away from business where we're not the best fit. We shouldn't be chasing that business at all.\n\nLenny (00:46:20):\nAnd this comes back to teaching them how to buy again and again. For these cases where you're like, \"This is not a fit.\" Ideally you know that before you fly to their office and pitch them.\n\nApril Dunford (00:46:29):\nYeah, generally you've had some kind of qualification happen upstream, and so that qualification could be done in lots of different ways. If you've got some kind of product like growth motion in the beginning, you're looking for signals in that. And if the signals aren't there, then you're not talking to them. And so if you've designed your signals right, then you already know there's intent there. You already know you're a fit. You already know stuff. The way a lot of companies do this is they'll have inside sales do a qualification call before they set up a first call with a sales rep. In that qualification call, you're trying to make sure is this the right person? Do they have a need that we can actually meet? Is this actually a good fit for what we do? And if they're not, they don't even make it to the call.\n\nLenny (00:47:10):\nMm-hmm. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost efficient way. If you're a B1B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q3, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms.\n\n(00:48:09):\nAudiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podlenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podlenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\n(00:48:32):\nAnother question around this idea of differentiated value and just alternative approaches is there's a certain previous guest who was very big on creating a category being extremely important, and that potentially being the only way to build a legendary business. I know you have a different perspective on that because in theory if you go that direction, there's no alternative. It's like \"We're the one.\" What's your take on that?\n\nApril Dunford (00:48:55):\nWell, so here's a few things. So one, obviously creating a category is not the only way to create a legendary business because the vast majority of legendary businesses did not create the categories that they're in. So Google did not create search, Facebook did not create social network. There's so many of them. It's actually more of an exception to the rule that the company is creating a category than the other way around. So I think it's a bit disingenuous to say the only way. It is a way to build a big business, no question about that. But it's absolutely not the only way. In fact, it is not the most common way, but it is a way and it does work. So that's one thing. The second thing is that category creation is interesting. Like most companies, if you look at their arc, even the category creators that are successful, they did not start out as category creators.\n\n(00:49:53):\nSo they started out as a niche play in an existing category, and that's because that's generally the easiest way to get traction for a company early because what is the job of the market category? The job of a market category is to help answer the question, what is this thing all about? If I'm positioning an existing category, I can say, \"Well, I'm CRM for very small businesses.\" That was Salesforce's initial positioning. I didn't have to explain to you what a CRM was, that already existed. There was already billion dollar company in that space. We know what a CRM is, and I could say \"We're CRM for very small businesses. The reason you can use in this very small businesses is we don't have any software. So you don't have to have an IT department to babysit it. It's fantastic.\"\n\n(00:50:34):\nSo most companies start there. Now what happens is that if you become the dominant player in that space, which again, category creation folks talk about this like no category creator has ever lost the market. In fact, most category creators wins their market. Like what happened to MySpace? What happened to Ask Jeeves? It didn't work out so good for them. Most category creators actually get overtaken by fast followers. So if we look at the CRM market, Siebel was the big dominant player there and now they're not. So now we've got Salesforce. Once you're the dominant player in that market, a cool move to do is to actually extend the boundaries of the category so that you can continue to grow. And most of the category creation examples we see are companies that when they were 200, 300, 400 million revenue dominating their space, then decided to move the goalposts and say, \"Well actually now we're expanding into all these other areas and we're going to call this category something. And that's what it is.\"\n\n(00:51:38):\nAnd there's loads of examples of that. Like Qualtrics for example, is a company that a lot of people talk about very successful category creation. Well, they were survey software up until there were 300 million revenue just like everybody else in an existing category. So that got them there and that worked just fine. Oh, well, once we're dominating it, now we can say it's whatever, it is, customer experience software, whatever it is. Snowflake. Another good example like data warehousing in the cloud, they were that data warehousing, an existing market, were data warehousing for the cloud. That is not category creation. And that took them all the way up to the point where they were about to go public and now they're cloud data, which is their attempt to expand and say, \"Well, it's not just data warehousing, it's actually data lakes and all other data stuff.\"\n\n(00:52:22):\nAnd so that's a smart move for them because they're now very well known in that space. I'm not saying category creation is a bad thing. There are examples of company that came right out of the gate and successfully created a category and then survived to own the category longer term. But a more common thing that happens is that the company does the hard work of creating the category and in exactly the moment where the category starts to take hold, fast follower can come in with fresh funding and a lot of it and learn from all your mistakes and come in and knock you off the peak right when you think you've made it.\n\n(00:53:01):\nSo I think category creation is, again, it's good, it works, but I think we have to be very careful when we're thinking about doing that at an early stage business or a business that isn't already dominating the category that they're in. It's much more common to see companies come in, shave off a piece of the market, dominate that, and then successfully branch out. It's what Jeffrey Moore called bowling pin strategy. Almost all successful companies follow bowling pin strategy.\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\nWait, what is that? Let's touch on that real quick.\n\nApril Dunford (00:53:31):\nOh yeah, you remember that thing. It's funny how many times I've talked about bowling pin strategy in the last two months. So this comes from a bunch of work that was done around the way innovation gets adopted, blah, blah. So there's a bunch of research done on this stuff, and I'm going to misquote it because Jeffrey Moore stuff, I've been reading it for decades. But bowling pin strategy goes like this. The easiest way to take over a great big market is to define a segment of the market that is underserved by the market leader.\n\n(00:53:59):\nAnd so if you think about a bunch of bowling pins, we're going to circle around the lead pin, which is this little piece of the market that's easy for us to go get, and the market leader probably doesn't care about it. And so we knock over that pin and knocking over that pin enables us to get to the three pins right beside it. And so now I'm established here as a beachhead and I can go get the next three pins, I'm going to knock those over, and eventually I get big enough to challenge the market leader and then I overtake them.\n\n(00:54:28):\nSo the example for my early career was I worked at this company, we thought we were enterprise software. We narrowed it down to CRM for investment banks, and so we literally drew bowling pins for our investors and said, \"Lead pin is CRM for investment banks. Once we knock that over, then we're going to go to retail banking, then we're going to be CRM for banking. And then once we knock that over, we're going to go to insurance, then we're going to be CRM for financial services. Once we knock that over, then we're going to be a great big company and we're going to challenge Siebel to be CRM for enterprise software.\" Instead we got acquired by Siebel for like $1 billion, but whatever. So most companies, if you look at the history of them, they actually start that way. And so yeah, if we just fast forwarded to when they were 300 million, we can say \"Category creation's the only thing to do,\" but it's like, well, what happened before then? That was something different.\n\nLenny (00:55:21):\nAwesome. Let's come back to your framework. I'm looking at the list of bullet points. So we've covered a lot of this already actually. So there's the insight where you helped them understand what's happening in the world and what's changing and why this is important. Then you talk about what the alternative approaches might be, pros and cons. Then there's this third step, which we haven't talked about yet, which is sharing the perfect world characteristics of a perfect solution. Can you talk a bit about that and why that's important?\n\nApril Dunford (00:55:47):\nSo this is the conclusion of the setup phase. So if I'm Help Scout for example, the conclusion is we say, \"Look, you really want customer success software that's as easy to use as an inbox. You're never going to outgrow it, but it was built from the ground up to be deliver an amazing service.\" And so it's this part of the pitch where we actually get agreement with the customer that we are aligned in terms of our point of view on the universe. So it's where I say, \"Okay, we've had our little discussion about the pros and cons of the other alternatives,\" and we say, \"So look, so are you with me, man? Can we all agree that a really good solution for you would have A, B and C?\" And the customer is either like, \"Yeah, right,\" or they're not. And so if they're right with you on this definition of the perfect world, then I've got you. I've already won the deal and I haven't even talked about us yet because the way I've set it up, I'm the only one that can deliver that.\n\n(00:56:49):\nSo if you say, \"Right,\" all I got to do is prove that I can do that and get you over the hurdle that it's possible for you to adopt it.\n\nLenny (00:56:59):\nSounds too easy.\n\nApril Dunford (00:57:01):\nYeah, I mean...\n\nLenny (00:57:02):\nIt's like you lure them in.\n\nApril Dunford (00:57:04):\nIf all of this was easy, Lenny we would be on a beach drinking out of a coconut.\n\nLenny (00:57:09):\nOh man, let's make it happen. Okay, so that's the setup. What do you call the second part again?\n\nApril Dunford (00:57:14):\nIt's the follow through-\n\nLenny (00:57:14):\nThe follow through.\n\nApril Dunford (00:57:15):\n... which is really focused on differentiated value. So in the second part, the first step is usually we introduce our stuff, which is where the market category is important. So we come in and we say, \"Okay, can we agree that a really good solution should tick these boxes? Yes. Okay, good. Now let's talk about us. Okay, so we believe that. That's why we build what we build.\"\n\n(00:57:36):\nSo here I am, I'm Help Scout, we're customer service software for digital businesses or whatever our market category is. So we introduce it just to get people straight in their mind about what it is, and then we move to here's the value, here's how we do it. If we think about a typical sales call, like let's say a sales call is half an hour, 45 minutes, I would expect to spend more than half of the time in the sales call in this differentiated value phase. So if we're doing a demo, that's the demo, and we're saying, \"Okay, step one, let me show you how we do this. So easy to use as an inbox. Here's the features. Never have to outgrow it, here's the features. Delivers amazing customer experience, here's the features.\" And so that's where we're getting to the meat of what you thought you were getting when you clicked on the button that said, \"Give me a demo.\"\n\n(00:58:25):\nSo that's what we're doing there. And then we end with these three little pieces. One is generally I got to show you some proof that I can do what I say I can do. So if I'm claiming this thing delivers an amazing customer experience, how do I prove that? Well, I can prove it by other customers saying it was amazing. That's one way to prove it. If I had some independent third party data that proved whatever I was claiming, I could show that there too. But a lot of times what we're doing is we're like, \"Let me show you how this worked in a company that used our stuff. So this is what the before looked like. They did this thing, here's the after.\" And so customer case study is usually good way to do that, but there's usually a step called proof, which is, I showed you the value, now here's the proof that I can actually deliver on that value and it's not just me blowing smoke.\n\n(00:59:16):\nAnd then the step after that then is this optional objection step where they say, \"Oh yeah, sounds good, but IT is never going to go for it,\" or \"Sounds good, but maybe it's going to be too expensive,\" or something. And so you're going to handle that objection as best as you can. And then you finish with the ask, which is whatever the next step in your sales process is. So it's, \"Hey, so what we have to do to get a deal cooking here, do we have to get IT involved? Does IT need to see it? Would you like us to come in and present with you with IT or do you want me to just help you work on some stuff for IT?\" It's whatever your next step in the sales process is.\n\nLenny (00:59:56):\nAwesome. So let me read through this just to have it also succinctly here in case people are taking notes or trying to remember the stuff. So there's the setup, there's the follow through. Within the setup, you have the insight, the alternative approaches, pros and cons, in the perfect world. And then you introduce your product, talk about the differentiated value, share the proof of why it works, potentially handle objections, silent objections, and then the ask of what comes next.\n\nApril Dunford (01:00:21):\nThat's right. That's it.\n\nLenny (01:00:22):\nIn terms of knowing if this is working and if your differentiated value works or if your insight works, do you have kind of a heuristic of a success rate that feels right? How often should this work for you to feel like \"I think we have it?\"\n\nApril Dunford (01:00:34):\nWell, so generally if the sales pitch isn't working, it's because the positioning was weak.\n\n(01:00:41):\nAnd so companies that jumped straight to building the new sales pitch without going back and really making sure that they really nailed the differentiated value, who knows? Maybe it works, maybe it doesn't. And a lot of times it doesn't, I think. And so in the work I do with my clients, we go all the way back to the beginning. So we go right back to let's work on the positioning first. Now, if I've got the smartest people from the company in the room and we've done enough deals that we are pretty knowledgeable about how customers buy and what they like and what they don't know. If I've got the senior executive team in the room and they've got a reasonable amount of customer experience, we can pretty much feel good that the positioning we come up with if we're following a process will be good.\n\n(01:01:25):\nThen it's just a matter of taking that positioning, mapping it to the sales pitch and then going to test it. So I think there's a bunch of things in testing that are really important. So one is we absolutely need sales involved in building the pitch. If we don't have sales involved in building the pitch, the pitch is never going to stick. The rule with sales reps is even if they don't like their current pitch, they're comfortable with the current pitch and they know it and they've memorized it and they have a little joke they tell on slide three. So they're not going to give up the current pitch without a fight. So you got to get sales management involved in building a new pitch, and then I would never just build the new pitch and then heave it over the wall and say, \"Good luck, Chuck.\" Because what'll happen is they'll come up with all kinds of excuses why they can't use this pitch.\n\n(01:02:07):\nInstead, what you do is you take your best sales rep, your best one, and you bring your best sales rep over and you train them on the new pitch. They got to learn it, they got to pitch it to you, pitch it to the head of sales. We do a bunch of repetition on that, and then we have that rep test the pitch with qualified prospects. So we don't go to existing customers. They've already been polluted with the old positioning and the old pitch, and this needs to work with a qualified prospect, so let's do it in the way it was intended. We're going to take qualified prospects and work that new pitch with them. Usually what we'll do is a test period where after every pitch we'll huddle and say, \"What worked? What didn't work? Maybe that word is tripping people up. Maybe we need to move this slide from here to here,\" and so we'll tune it.\n\n(01:02:53):\nAnd then after we've done a bunch of pitches, one of two things happens. And so in this test structure, I am very much relying on the expertise of my best rep to know what's good. So after the best rep is comfortable with the pitch, done a bunch of pitches, re-twizzled it, at some point the rep will say, \"Okay, I think we're done optimizing this pitch, and I'm not going back to the old pitch. I'm sticking with this pitch because I think this one works better.\" An experienced sales rep will know that, whether the pitch is better than the old pitch, if you give them the opportunity to feel comfortable with it, work with it a bit and pitch a bunch of new prospects with it.\n\n(01:03:38):\nSo if your best sales rep says, \"Oh, this is way better than the old pitch. I can just feel it from the way people react to it and the number of times we've been able to convert people over into actual opportunities from a first call.\" Then what you do is at that point I call that pass. So then we take that rep, we can film them doing the pitch for training, and then we can take that rep, go back to the rest of the sales team and have that rep sell everybody else on it. So that rep goes back and says, \"Listen up people, you're stupid if you're using that old pitch, which sucks. This new pitch is way better. Trust me, I'm the best rep on this whole team. By the way here's the list of deals I have cooking in the pipeline that I got using this deck. You should go do it and I'm going to teach you how to do it.\"\n\n(01:04:24):\nNow I got sales, teaching sales, teach and sales instead of marketing, sort of throwing something over the wall and crossing their fingers and saying, \"Hey, I hope this works.\" What we should see is an immediate uplift in what happens after first call. So most of the time what that is we get a higher percentage of deals converting into opportunities after that first substantive calls. Sometimes depending on the quality of the pipeline we had coming in, we're actually disqualifying more. But sometimes that's a good thing.\n\n(01:04:54):\nBut what we should see is an immediate uptick. It's stuff coming into the pipeline. It's a neat trick to pull, especially right now when everybody's budgets are really tight and you're just trying to squeeze more juice out of the lemon. It's a really easy way to get some more juice out of the pipeline. Just go in, tighten up your positioning, tighten up that sales pitch. And we can have instant impact with that because we can roll that out in a couple of weeks and start getting better deals flowing through the pipeline because these customers are understanding your value better, understanding why to pick you better. It's just easy, low hanging fruit to do when the economy's bad.\n\nLenny (01:05:32):\nTo give people a sense of maybe how easy that might be, how long would you suggest people spend on maybe tweaking their positioning and then also on this pilot, how much total time could it take to potentially significantly increase sales?\n\nApril Dunford (01:05:45):\nSo in the customers that I work with, when we do the positioning stuff, the positioning stuff takes a week. We're beginning and we're done in a week. We're all about speed on this thing. We're trying to get the thing happening fast. So we're in and out on the positioning in a week. It might take you, it depends on the company, the bigger the company, the slower this is, but some big companies are actually quite fast, and if you're motivated, it shouldn't take long for us to take that pitch and make it real.\n\n(01:06:11):\nThen we got to find a rep, train the rep, and then how long it takes us to test it really depends on how much deal flow you've got. So if you're working on monster deals and you don't actually get that many qualified prospects to pitch, that might take a few weeks. But if you've got a lot of prospects coming through the door, and you can get through this fairly quickly. So I've had companies do it start to finish. We got new pitch out the door and people using it in two weeks. That's about as fast as you can get it done. Most folks, I would say take about a month.\n\nLenny (01:06:39):\nCool. That is a very short-\n\nApril Dunford (01:06:40):\nSometimes you're like IBM and who knows when you get to it, right? But most folks could get through it if everybody's motivated, we can get it out and have it running a month.\n\nLenny (01:06:50):\nYou mentioned marketing and earlier you said that marketing is involved in this process in some way. What's your advice to just how to involve marketing, where they fit in?\n\nApril Dunford (01:06:58):\nYeah, so usually marketing is going to end up being the stewards of the positioning once the positioning is done. So they're going to end up being positioning police after this because a lot of the positioning stuff is going to take the form of marketing things. So they're invested in this. So when I was the VP marketing, I was the person that would instigate the positioning thing, let's get everybody together and work on the positioning. And then I would usually be the person that is driving, getting the sales pitch figured out, but it's me and sales and product working together. And then once the sales pitch is done, depending on the size of the organization and whether or not you have sales enablement or somebody inside sales that can babysit the pitch. Usually me and the head of sales would work on, \"Okay, this is the pitch and this is locked down and we're not actually going to change this pitch until something happens that requires us to change the positioning. And then that's when we'll re-look at the pitch.\"\n\n(01:07:55):\nSo we would look at recertifying the reps every quarter on the pitch and all that kind of stuff. And that would be generally, me in partnership with the head of sales. But it depends on how you do it. I don't think it really matters who owns it. If you have a good product marketing organization, good product marketing organization generally is very concerned with the positioning and the pitch, and those two things sit in their purview, but depends on how you define it. I can't wait till you get Airbnb. Tell us how this stuff works. They're different because they're a consumer, but companies are arranged in all different ways. So if you have product marketing, it looks one way. If you don't, it looks another way. Somebody's got to kind of be the owner of this thing though. And so we have to decide who that's going to be.\n\nLenny (01:08:38):\nJust a couple more questions. One is to motivate people to do this. What kind of impact have you seen at companies that invest this time and rethink the way they pitch?\n\nApril Dunford (01:08:49):\nWell, so people don't like me to talk about revenue stuff. Hugely what we've seen though is again, the immediate impact is felted sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that.\n\nApril Dunford (01:09:00):\nImpact is felt in sales, and everybody's very jazzed about that. Because sometimes what the worry is, is we've got this old positioning and they came in through the pipeline that way. So they were exposed to our marketing somewhere with this old positioning, and then we hit them with the new positioning with this sales pitch. And aren't they going to be all like, \"Oh, you moved my cheese.\" And usually it ends up not being a problem at all. So usually what we see immediately is an uptick in what's happening in sales. And so I've had a couple of companies tell me they've doubled the number of deals that they're bringing from first sales call to opportunity just by tightening up the pitch and getting that going. I think that's not unusual. I worked at a company where we did it in-house where I was the VP marketing, and we, within two quarters, had doubled the revenue just by tightening up the pitch. Just tighten it up.\n\nLenny (01:09:53):\nHoly shit. All right.\n\nApril Dunford (01:09:54):\nTighten it up.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nNo big deal.\n\nApril Dunford (01:09:54):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nOkay. So-\n\nApril Dunford (01:09:56):\nIt was a big shift in positioning, I'll tell you that. Not small. Most of the time, we're not doing that. Most of the time, it's a tightening. We're not saying, \"Oh, we used to be this and now we're this.\" Most of the time, it's a tightening, but usually the pitches are so bad. I'm telling you they're so bad that there's this low hanging fruit there that if we could improve it even a little bit, it actually has this big impact on how much stuff survives down the pipe.\n\nLenny (01:10:25):\nAnd again, if folks want to go deep into the positioning step, your first book Obviously Awesome, is a great guide, and our first podcast episode goes through this. Plus you have a guest post in my newsletter where you give them a quick start guide. So there's so many tools to help you through this process.\n\nApril Dunford (01:10:38):\nSo many tools.\n\nLenny (01:10:39):\nThe other thought I've had in the back of my mind as we've been chatting is a previous guest, Andy Raskin, has a different framework, feels similar, but I know they're different. His framework starts with a shift that's happened in the world, and then here's who's going to win in the shift, here's who's going to lose. And then he goes into why this product is the best. What's your perspective on that approach versus this approach and the big differences?\n\nApril Dunford (01:11:01):\nSo the thing with that framework is I do think it works in certain conditions, but again, I think the conditions might be kind of edgy. So there's a couple of things that I think are lacking in that structure for a sales pitch. So the first one is there's actually no concept of differentiated value in that pitch, which for me is a giant miss. So in that pitch, it assumes that new is inherently valuable and old is inherently bad, and sometimes that's true. So sometimes there's just you versus the status quo and the status quo is some terrible old thing, some legacy thing or it's manual processes or something, and you're the only thing out there, then you can get away with that. But most of the time, we don't have that. Most of the time, there's multiple new ways of doing something and you just can't say, \"Well, I'm the only new and the rest of you are old and bad.\"\n\n(01:11:55):\nSo usually I've got to thread the needle. And so that's the first thing. The second thing is that for most companies, if we really understood customer and decision, old is good, it's safe, it's not risky. And does anybody ever say, \"No, I'm not going to buy Salesforce. That's the old stuff,\"? I just don't think that happens. So in a lot of cases, I don't think you can rely, it's lazy to say, \"Buy this because it's new and new is better.\" Most of the time, the customers are going to want to know, well, what's better about it? Tell me what the value is that I can't get anywhere else. And you're going to have to get more specific than just saying, \"Trust me, it's new and new is good.\" So that's the first thing. The second thing is this idea of starting with a trend. On the surface it looks kind of good, but the problem is often the trend is not unique to you. So everybody else sees the trend too. And so you are starting in a way that any of your competitors could start the same way.\n\n(01:12:59):\nI did this for years where I was taught to do problem solution. We would define the problem like a trend. We'd say, \"Well, the change in the world.\" I was selling databases and I'd say, \"Change in the world, data is exponentially growing.\" It's like, no shit. We all know that. All of my competitors could say that, and all of my competitors deal with the trend in the same way. So unless you have a particularly unique take on the trend, well, then it's not the trend at all really, is it? It's your insight into the trend. So I don't think trend is that great because it's not always unique to you. And ideally what we want is something that we can say that none of our competitors can. And typically a trend is something outside of our control. It's out in the world and everybody else can see it too.\n\n(01:13:47):\nSo I don't think it's great. I think that structure looks a lot like the structure we use in a VC pitch or an investor pitch because we're talking about much longer timelines and we can say, \"Look, the world is really changing and 10 years from now there's going to be chaos and destruction and the only one standing is us and therefore there is no competition.\" And because the timeframes are longer and we're talking about disruption of an entire market, which is pretty theoretical, we can get away with a lot of that stuff in investor pitch. In fact, we want to go there in investor pitch. Sales pitch is all about right now. Sales pitch is like, okay, I'm going to exchange my money for right now. You can't get too far into the future. Otherwise, all I'm doing is giving everybody a reason to delay, which they're likely to do anyway because they're indecisive about what they should do.\n\nLenny (01:14:39):\nI feel like I need a debate version of this podcast where people come on and-\n\nApril Dunford (01:14:43):\nI know, but here's the thing that I think people should think about when they're looking at all this stuff because it's terribly confusing if you're trying to figure this out. The one thing I really dislike about the category creation folks is they say that's the only way that you can be successful. And in general, that's just not true about anything. There's lots of ways to do everything. And so I think people should mess around with stuff. And for any of these frameworks, I think they should look at it and see if it works for them and their situation. And maybe it does, maybe it doesn't.\n\n(01:15:16):\nAnd I think they should steal things from wherever they can steal it and figure out what works in their own situation. My stuff, I like to think is a starting point, folks should use it as a starting point, but people shouldn't be slaves to it. There are lots of things that work at a market, and I think the only thing that we know for certain is that we can't say, \"Well, this is the rule and it always works like this.\" If it was that easy, again, this wouldn't be so hard. We wouldn't have podcasts and newsletters and all kinds of things trying to figure this stuff out.\n\nLenny (01:15:49):\nExtremely true. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nApril Dunford (01:15:54):\nOh yeah. Lightning round. Oh gosh. It gives me stress. Okay.\n\nLenny (01:15:58):\nOkay, question number one. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nApril Dunford (01:16:04):\nWell, that's an easy question. So right now I'm really into Matt Dixon's work right now, which we've mentioned him a couple of times on the podcast, but Matt Dixon's new book called The JOLT Effect is really great just because there's all this data and the things that he discovered with that data, a lot of it go against what we would consider accepted sales wisdom. And so I think that book is full of juicy nuggets and everybody should look at it. His previous book, The Challenger Sale, and there was a companion book to that called The Challenger Customer. Those were also excellent and based on a deep set of research. And those books are older now, but what we see in The JOLT Effect is all the stuff holds true. All the stuff from The Challenger Sale has not changed in 10 years. So I think those books together are really cool.\n\n(01:16:54):\nThe other one that I always recommend is the original book on positioning, which is the book by Ries and Trout Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. I have my copy of it, is dogeared. I probably read that book 100 times and I still see stuff in that book that I didn't see before. So I think if you really want to go deep on this positioning stuff, my book is the how to book. Their book is what is it in the first place book. And I think everybody that's interested in positioning should go read that.\n\nLenny (01:17:19):\nAmazing. By the way, I have your first book somewhere behind me there. I don't know where it is, but it's there.\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:23):\nI got mine right here so I can do this gag. There it is.\n\nLenny (01:17:23):\nNailed it.\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:27):\nThere's the new one, there's the old one.\n\nLenny (01:17:27):\nThe YouTube audience can see that trick that you've learned. Second question, what is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:36):\nOh man, I'm going to get in trouble for this. So you know Bong Joon-ho is the guy that did the movie Parasite?\n\nLenny (01:17:47):\nYeah.\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:47):\nSo [inaudible 01:17:48] before Parasite, there was this book called, this movie called Snow Piercer. It's really old. I think it came out in-\n\nLenny (01:17:54):\nI've seen that. Is that with the train?\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:54):\n2013. Have you seen it?\n\nLenny (01:17:54):\nYeah.\n\nApril Dunford (01:17:57):\nSo I love this movie so much. So recently I went on a train trip with my dad and before I went to the train trip, we got talking about trains. And then we all had to go watch Snow Piercer again. Like me and my daughter watching Snow Piercer. We're really into this movie. And it's funny, when it came out, I was working at a startup and the CEO came and said, \"Seen any good movies lately?\" And I was like, \"Oh man, you got to see this movie Snow Piercer.\" And he went on a first date with a woman and he came back the next day and he was so mad. He was not just kind of mad. He was really mad at me. He was like, \"That was the worst movie I've ever seen.\" I was like, \"Dude, you should have told me you were going on a date. I didn't know.\"\n\nLenny (01:18:40):\nYeah, that is my experience with that movie. I did not enjoy it, but I think you have to go into it [inaudible 01:18:46]\n\nApril Dunford (01:18:46):\nIt's polarizing. You either think it's amazing or you're like, that was terrible. What did I just watch?\n\nLenny (01:18:52):\nThis explains your taste in movies. We learned a lot about you, April. That movie is something else.\n\nApril Dunford (01:19:00):\nDid you see Parasite? That was amazing.\n\nLenny (01:19:02):\nThat was amazing. Very different. Not what I imagined. I didn't realize it was the same person.\n\nApril Dunford (01:19:06):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:08):\nAll right. Okay, cool. That's two movies for people to watch. I'm curious how people think of Snow Piercer.\n\nApril Dunford (01:19:13):\nBe warned don't go on a date with this.\n\nLenny (01:19:16):\nOh man, I still think about that movie sometimes. Next question, what is a favorite interview question you like to ask people that you're interviewing? Usually this is for when you're hiring, so whatever this comes up for you.\n\nApril Dunford (01:19:28):\nSo back when I was running teams internally back in my VP marketing days, I felt like a lot of marketing folks came with a certain amount of bad habits, particularly startup marketing folks. It's a bit of the wild west in marketing. And so sometimes they'd come in and you get into somebody new and they'd be really smart, but they learned something at the previous company that you're like, please never do that here. It's not going to work here. And so I developed a thing where I was just looking for attitude. Were you enthusiastic? Are you super into what we're doing here? And I can teach you pretty much anything. The only thing I can't teach you is persuasive writing. And I think that's a learnable skill. I think people can learn how to do persuasive writing.\n\n(01:20:12):\nI just don't have time to teach it to you myself. And so I used to give people a writing test, so I'd say, \"Look, think of something you bought recently and write me two paragraphs and just sell me on it.\" And I used to love that test because people could either do it or they can't. And there's just so much stuff we end up doing in product marketing and marketing that involves a little bit of writing that it's kind of a foundational skill. And if you don't have that, that was the one thing I couldn't teach you.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nWow, that is fascinating. I've never heard of that as an interview question. And I love it. I feel like product managers-\n\nApril Dunford (01:20:47):\nI stole it from a company that made me do it before I got hired, and I was like, this is a really smart thing. I'm [inaudible 01:20:53] stealing it. My thing was I got anxiety and I couldn't decide what product to write about, and I had literally just bought a new pair of running shoes. So I wrote two paragraphs about my new Brooks distance running shoes. But it was good. I got the job.\n\nLenny (01:21:09):\nIt is an excellent segue to our next question, which is, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nApril Dunford (01:21:15):\nRight now I'm kind of into, I don't even know how to describe this category of things, but things that are kind of low tech but are awesome. And so one of the category of things that I really love right now is I'm really into fountain pens. I don't know if you've ever written with a fountain pen. [inaudible 01:21:35]\n\nLenny (01:21:35):\nI haven't, but I know what they are.\n\nApril Dunford (01:21:36):\nAnd so there's this company, Lamy, they're based in Germany, and they make the world's greatest fountain pens. They're beautiful, they're amazing. Some of them are really expensive. If you want to spend a lot of money on a pen, you can. But they have this one called the AL-Star, which is not an expensive pen. It's 20, $30. It may be expensive for a pen, but it's not so much money that you wouldn't feel bad if you lost it. So Lamy AL-Star. That's my great product lately. I don't have one right here. I should, it'd be a great prop to pick it up, but I actually don't have my bag here and it's in my bag. But Lamy AL-Star. You Google it. These are beautiful pens. And then if you haven't written with a fountain pen, it takes a minute to get used to it, but then it's like, gosh, it just feels great. You'll never write with a ballpoint pen again.\n\nLenny (01:22:22):\nI was going to ask, is it the feel of the writing that you really enjoy about it?\n\nApril Dunford (01:22:25):\nFeel. Totally different. Yeah. Amazing.\n\nLenny (01:22:29):\nI use Muji pens. I don't know if you know these pens.\n\nApril Dunford (01:22:31):\nOh yeah, these are actually really good. They're like roller ball pens, roller ball pen, very good, but not as good as the fountain pen.\n\nLenny (01:22:31):\nIt's no fountain pen.\n\nApril Dunford (01:22:38):\nThe Muji pen is pretty good.\n\nLenny (01:22:39):\nThen do you have to dip it in ink and stuff? How does that work?\n\nApril Dunford (01:22:41):\nNo. You actually, they either come with a little cartridge that you stick in or if you feel bad about the environment, you don't want to be throwing out cartridges all the time, there's a refillable cartridge, so you basically just stick another thing and it sucks it up and yeah, you don't dip it in ink. That would be crazy. I can't take that on the airplane, man.\n\nLenny (01:22:58):\nConfiscate your ink. All right, questions get a little more challenging potentially or really easy. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, you like to share with people, that you find useful to come back to?\n\nApril Dunford (01:23:11):\nMy thing lately is, and maybe this is just an old person thing, but my thing lately is nothing's a big deal. Nothing's a big deal, nothing's a big deal. And so you'll have stuff that you think is a really big deal, positive or negative, and you'll be like, wow, if this thing happened, it'd be so great, and then it happens and you're like, yeah, it's pretty great, but things are good otherwise, or it'll be the opposite. Like, oh, if this thing happened, it'd be so bad. Then it happens and you're like, that wasn't that bad. And so I don't know if this is good or bad, but lately I'm in this zone of I'm in this kind of chill zone where I'm like, nothing's a big deal, man. Everything's cool.\n\nLenny (01:23:56):\nThat super resonates. And as much as you say that to yourself, it's still hard to convince yourself of that sometimes. But that is a really good motto. I'm going to steal that myself. I kind of say that to myself often in different way.\n\nApril Dunford (01:24:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:24:10):\nWhat is the most valuable lesson your mom or your dad taught you?\n\nApril Dunford (01:24:15):\nYeah, it is funny because it's a little bit related to that. So my dad ran a business, so I grew up in a really small town and my dad and it's cottage country in Canada. And so my dad ran the local toys for tourists, like boats and motorcycles and ATVs and that sort of thing. And he ran that business for years and years and he sold it a few years back when he retired. But it's a neat thing to grow up in entrepreneurial family because you kind of see this highs and lows. The business is really good. Then the business was really bad and then we were all broke and then the business was good and we were not broke. So there was this thing, and my dad used to always kind of have this attitude of you just got to grind it out.\n\n(01:25:01):\nYou're just going to grind it out. There's going to be good stuff, there's going to be bad stuff, but the key is to just keep going, just keep going. And so he ran that business for whatever, 30, 40 years. I don't know. His motto is the home of fun since '71. So he started it in '71. I think he sold it three, four years ago. So a long time.\n\nLenny (01:25:21):\nWow.\n\nApril Dunford (01:25:22):\nIt all worked out good in the end. And so I don't know, I think there's something cool about growing up in a family where you can see the highs and lows and then again be like everything's we're just grinding it out over here. Nothing's a big deal.\n\nLenny (01:25:34):\nIt's clear where all that comes from now.\n\nApril Dunford (01:25:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:25:37):\nFinal question. You do a lot of traveling, you do a lot of speaking, you go to a bunch of cities. I'm curious just what is your favorite either city that you go to that maybe people may not know about or venue that you speak at?\n\nApril Dunford (01:25:49):\nIt's such a cliche, but I love Paris. I just love it. But for me, Paris is like a particular vibe. So when I was in university, I did an exchange when I was in engineering and I did third year engineering at a school just outside of Paris. And so I spent the whole year there, learned a bit of French. My French was pretty good at the end. My French is really bad now. So I kind of get Paris. I like Paris. And so when I go to Paris, I just have the best time. I have my set of restaurants I want to go to. I have my handful of places I want to go shopping. I put my butt down in a cafe, look at the beautiful people, drink my nice coffee. I just really dig the whole vibe of Paris and people are starting to know that now. So French companies will call me and they'll say, \"Do we get a Paris discount? We hear you like coming here.\" And I go, \"Okay.\"\n\nLenny (01:26:50):\nNow this is going to [inaudible 01:26:51]\n\nApril Dunford (01:26:51):\nThere's a great product management conference there called La Product Conference run by these folks at Tega, shout out to Tega. So I've been there a number of times for their conferences and they do an amazing job and the venue is really great. It changes around. But last year, the last time I went there, which was two years ago, it was at an old theater in [inaudible 01:27:13]. Absolutely beautiful. And that was a pretty great venue in a great city with a great conference. So yeah, shout out to French people.\n\nLenny (01:27:22):\nOh man. That sounds dreamy. Paris. I see how that could be a favorite. April, I think we accomplished everything we were hoping to accomplish. I think everyone that has listened to this podcast is going to be better at pitching and selling. It feels like even if they take one element of this framework, say starting with an insight or focusing on different value will make them better. And so I'm proud of us. Thank you so much for doing this. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nApril Dunford (01:27:50):\nSo where can people find me? I'm aprildunford.com. The only social media I'm doing these days is LinkedIn. I'm a bit social media-ed out. I'm experimenting a little on threads and Instagram, but LinkedIn is a good place to find me if you just want low lift way to follow my stuff. But I'm doing all the things now, Lenny, I got a podcast, it's called Positioning with April Dunford. I got a newsletter that's also called Positioning. You can find that if you go to, it's on Substacks, you can find it there, otherwise aprildunford.com/books and you can sign up there. But those are the big things. And then there's the books, obviously, if you want to learn more about this stuff. Everything I know is in the book. There isn't stuff that I know that isn't in the book to be honest.\n\nLenny (01:28:34):\nAmazing. And then how can listeners be useful to you? Just check out those things.\n\nApril Dunford (01:28:37):\nI guess so. You know what? I'm in this phase. I think, again, I think it's an old age thing. I am in this kind of philosophical phase where I'm not going to be doing this forever. And what I'm trying to do right now is get everything that's useful out of my head and out in the world before I'm done. And so right now I'm very focused on delivering useful things for other people. I didn't think I needed to write a book about sales pitches, but then I got the idea in my head, everybody's sales pitch is so bad and there isn't a book on how to build a sales pitch. And I'm not saying mine's the world's greatest thing, but it's better than nothing. So this is what I'm trying to do right now. I'm trying to be useful to other people because pretty soon I'm not going to be doing anything, I think is the idea.\n\nLenny (01:29:29):\nArnold Schwarzenegger's new book is called Be Useful. And I feel like that's the perfect description of how to be successful and especially in the work that we do, just helping people. But I keep coming back to that. It's just be useful.\n\nApril Dunford (01:29:41):\nI think this is a really important thing. When I wrote the first book, people started writing back to me and saying, \"Oh, your book was so great.\" And my reflex action was to say, \"Oh, I'm glad you enjoyed it.\" But then I stumped myself and I was like, you know what? I don't actually care if you enjoyed it. This isn't entertainment. I'm actually trying to create something that's useful. So what I really want is for people to read this stuff and come back and say, \"That was useful. We were struggling with this thing, and that unlocked something for me and that was useful.\" And that's what I'm trying to do right now.\n\nLenny (01:30:11):\nApril, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing.\n\nApril Dunford (01:30:14):\nThanks so much. It's always good to be here.\n\nLenny (01:30:17):\nAlways good to have you here. And we might do a V3 when you do a third book if you ever-\n\nApril Dunford (01:30:21):\nNo, not happening.\n\nLenny (01:30:25):\nOkay. All right. Well, bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
