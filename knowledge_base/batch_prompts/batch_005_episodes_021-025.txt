And then the team starts to optimize for that conversion rate as their north star. But in practice, it's actually almost always easier to just make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate. Instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people, I just want more people to get activated.\n\n(00:00:32):\nAnd then once you start thinking that way, you realize actually the best way to get more people to get to a step is just get more people in the door in the first place. That will always hurt your conversion rate, but it may actually give you more people on the outside.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nToday my guest is Archie Abrams. Archie is VP of product and head of growth at Shopify, where he leads an org of over 600 people across product, design, engineering, data ops, and growth marketing. Shopify is both an incredibly unique and also an incredibly successful business, and they do things very differently. And as a result, there's a lot that we can learn from how they approach building product and driving growth.\n\n(00:01:12):\nSome examples include their priorities in product roadmap are driven by a 100-year vision that comes from Tobi, the CEO. And the core product teams don't have metrics or KPIs. They're essentially banned. And instead, decisions are made based on taste, and intuition, and building towards this long-term vision. Also, the growth team optimizes for churn, which is unlike any other company I've ever come across. And once you hear why, this will make a lot of sense.\n\n(00:01:38):\nAlso, they keep long-term holdouts for every experiment they run, and they automatically look at the impact these experiments have had on the business a year later, two years later, and three years later, and then revisit these decisions down the road.\n\n(00:01:52):\nAnd in our conversation, we dig into all of this plus how Shopify organizes their growth team, how they run experiments, how the growth team collaborates with the product team, how they measure impact. Plus, Archie shares a bunch of very specific and interesting examples of changes that have driven growth for the business and so much more. This is such a fascinating conversation, and I know this will give you a lot to think about in terms of how you run and organize your own product and growth teams.

Okay, so what I want to do with our time together is to basically do kind of a living archeology of how Shopify grows and what you specifically have learned about growing a company like Shopify into this just juggernaut of a business that it's turned into. To give people a little bit of a sense of just how large Shopify has gotten, so maybe surprising them about the scale of this company at this point. Could you share some stats about the scale of the business at this point?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:03:09):\nYeah, absolutely. So overall, we're about 10% of e-commerce in the United States. So basically if you're not buying an Amazon or Walmart, you're probably buying on a Shopify-powered store. And behind the scenes globally, we did about 235 billion in GMV in 2023, which is roughly the size of the economy of Finland. So we've got a big economy and big impact happening from Shopify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:37):\nWow. I think interestingly with Shopify, it's kind of this behind the scenes tool, and so I imagine many people have no idea they're using Shopify a lot of time when they're buying stuff online, and I think some of these numbers kind of creep up on people with just how large a company like Shopify has gotten.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:03:53):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting.

One of the most interesting things I've heard is that how you think about churn and retention. To most companies, the most important thing is to increase retention, reduce churn. My sense or my understanding is you guys are kind of the opposite. You one, don't think tons about churn, you almost optimize for churn. Talk about that. How does that work?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:06:48):\nThe way we think about churn is really going back to Shopify as a kind of our mission and what we want to do, which is to increase the amount of entrepreneurship on the internet. And so as a business, we want to make it as easy as possible to get started with your online store, with your business.\n\n(00:07:06):\nBut most businesses do ultimately fail. And so the way we look at it is can we lower the barriers to getting started and get as many people in the door trying their hand at entrepreneurship? If we do that, again, many of those businesses, many of those folks will maybe on their first attempt not be as successful, but we're going to have a set of merchants who go on to become extremely big businesses, the Allbirds of the world, FIGS, etc.\n\n(00:07:36):\nAnd the way the Shopify business model works is we do charge a subscription, but most of our revenue comes from payments, which is tied to directly to a merchant's success. So in a given cohort of merchants, a lot of people will start. Some of those people on their first attempt that's entrepreneurship might not succeed, but the folks who do go on to be successful will make that entire cohort of merchants who started something that makes Shopify as a business extremely successful. And that's why we lower the barriers to get started and help folks grow, and those winners make the whole thing work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:12):\nI love that. So what I'm hearing is it's not that you don't want people to stick around, it's not that you don't want people to succeed. It's that you're not optimizing every new shop for sticking around long-term. It's basically make it as easy as possible for people to try it. And all you need is a few big wins for it to all work out.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:08:33):\nCorrect. And that's really a different insight than most SaaS companies that they get a customer, they really never want that person to leave. And we want to lower that barriers to get started and be successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:44):\nOne of the main reasons companies focus so much on churn and retention is because it costs them a lot of money to drive new customers and users. I imagine there's almost an implied it's really cheap for you all to find new customers because of maybe the brand and word of mouth. Is that true?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:08:59):\nI think that definitely has some dynamics. I think the bigger factor is the monetization model. For most SaaS companies, they're making from a subscription, right? 29 bucks a month is the only way that they're going to really monetize. Whereas our business works, you have folks who are paying a subscription. But as folks get bigger, because we're monetizing on that GMV that that merchant is producing or the revenue the merchant is producing in the form of payments and other services, it allows us to grow with the merchant in those really successful merchants, make the whole system work well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:34):\nGot it. So basically, your net dollar retention or network revenue retention is just absurd for the winners and it makes up for all the losers slash not losers, people that have tried to build an online-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:09:44):\nYes, tried and haven't been very successful. When you can think of the other parallel is in angel investing, right? Most of angel investments are not going to work out, but the couple that do make that entire investment portfolio successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:00):\nWith retention not being the primary goal and the metric you guys focus on optimizing, how do you know if you're doing well? Is it some number of these winners have to come out every quarter, every year? How do you think about progress and achieving, and success basically for growth?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:10:18):\nThis way is thinking about a cohort of users we acquire in a given time period, say a quarter. And then over the next year, two years, three years, four years, five years, how much GMV have those merchants produced in total? Not about per merchant basis, but in total, did that cohort generate GMV? And if they generate GMV, that will translate into revenue and gross profit and all of those things that we can then use to reinvest in growing the business. So it's really looking at the total value, but on that GMV basis. And GMV is a power law based metric. And so it's really that power law that drives the success of each cohort.\n\n(00:10:56):\nAgain, going back to investing, same thing there. Each vintage from a fund, how much did that return as a fund? And it's really driven by the few really successful outliers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):\nSo this begs the question, that sounds like a very long feedback loop. And I don't know what I do with that information if five years from now, \"Oh okay, that was a really good idea we did five years ago.\"\n\nArchie Abrams (00:11:18):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):\nComment on that. It touches on something you said about how metrics aren't actually a driver of how you all think at Shopify, so take that wherever you want to go.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:11:26):\nYeah. So it's interesting. I think with Shopify, we very purposely set up different parts of the org to think on very different time horizons and with very different ways of thinking about how to build product and the like. Very different than a lot of companies that typically, have maybe one kind of unified, there's one north star that the entire company is rallying around. \n\n(00:11:49):\nAnd so there's three major product groups at Shopify. There's core product which is basically building the 100 year, the right things for commerce 100 years from now. There's merchant services which is building things like payments, shipping, the tools that entrepreneurs need to be successful with a more shorter or medium term horizon. And then growth is really thinking about that end-to-end customer journey. How can we bring folks on and make sure they're successful?\n\n(00:12:19):\nAnd then from a metrics standpoint, we do have obviously some leading indicators in growth that we're looking at on a given experiment or what have you. But the key in what we try to instrument in our experimentation is the ability to really look at longterm effects of experiments.\n\n(00:12:37):\nSo we constantly will relook at an experiment a year later, see that the way the GMV curve for the distribution was different than we might've originally thought. And that'll actually change what we do from that previous experiment. And so there's a lot of longterm monitoring of experiments over these very long time horizons to both inform what those input metrics are and more importantly hold ourselves accountable to, did we actually move what we cared about, which is that longterm GMV, in the right way?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:12):\nWow. Okay. I want to spend more time here. So the way you're describing it is the way the business operates is you think, what is our 100-year plan? How do we think, where does this need to be in 100 years? And with that, it allows you to run these long holdout experiments to see, is something we're doing impacting the business broadly? And because you think so longterm, you can take a year, or two, or three to see if there's an impact and then make adjustments versus I'm having to drive a certain metric every quarter, every year.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:13:47):\nCorrect. And I mean on growth, we're definitely in the... We want to drive metrics on a short-term basis and we can do that obviously, but we have the luxury, and the way Tobi thinks about the world and the way we operate, to really think about these longterm effects and make sure that we're holding ourselves accountable with these longterm holdouts, and then constantly refining the input metrics that we're using and getting a lot smarter about that. But because we take that long horizon, it allows us to be better in the short term and just get a lot smarter.\n\n(00:14:17):\nAnd a lot of counterintuitive things. And I would encourage everyone, if you can, look at some of the experiments that you thought were your biggest winners. Look at the downstream metrics for a year, two years on that experiment. And I'll bet you'd be surprised how many times the metric is different than what you thought it would be after a year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:36):\nBecause where people just make a call at a certain point in time, here's the list in it, here's the list experience. I love this, because very few people have experiences running a longterm experiment, and so this is a really interesting insight that you're sharing that, I guess how often do you find this to be true in your long-term holdouts, where things end up being very different downstream?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:14:59):\nI think there's probably two things that have been very common. And I would say in quite a few cases, you get a lift on a metric up front, a more short-term metric. Number of people who become a paying shopper, number of people who make their first sale in Shopify. And then you look a year later, and there's actually no incremental lift on GMV from that cohort.\n\n(00:15:21):\nAnd so I think it actually trains, a lot of us in growth are looking at these short-term metrics. A lot of the time it's actually more pull-forward effect, than you fully realize or an incremental user that's just really not worth that much. So that's one.\n\n(00:15:35):\nAnd then two, so this effect size goes away. There are cases where the experiment has flipped the other way. And then there are cases, and these are the most interesting ones, where you realize that you uncovered a pocket of merchants that are actually extremely valuable entrepreneurs who go on to be successful, that you missed in your normal short-term measurement techniques. And so all across the board we see that. But actually the most common is it actually isn't a long-term lift from a lot of things that you might think of the short-term are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:16):\nIs there an example in that second bucket of what you mean when you say there's a pocket of valuable merchants?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:16:22):\nYeah, I think a lot of this has to do with, we call it monetary friction. So one of the hardest things to do with a business is when you're getting started, is you might not have any revenue coming in, and you are kind of bootstrapping, which in Shopify's case might be 39 bucks a month. But still, it's a real expense. \n\n(00:16:43):\nAnd so typically when you can lower the barriers to monetary friction in some form, that could be all sorts of monetary friction early. The common belief is that we'll usually get lower quality folks coming in the door, because usually discounts are associated with lower quality. \n\n(00:17:03):\nIf you think about in a business case, if I give you a little monetary boost and reduce that monetary friction, I can actually causally change your ability to become successful, because I've given you a little bit more time to try that idea a little bit longer. I've given you that opportunity to move your business over to Shopify. And so often in those types of experiments you see that you've basically unlocked a class of people who might've given up without reducing that monetary friction\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:35):\nInteresting. And giving them time to actually make it work.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:17:39):\nTo make it work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):\nOkay. So just roughly, do you have a sense of how often you find no effect after a year that you saw early impact? Just to ballpark that.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:17:50):\nYeah, it's in the 30 to 40% range.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:51):\nOkay. I think you're tearing the heart out of so many growth people right now, and nobody wants to hear this that works on growth where you're saying potentially a third of the experiments they're running today that are showing lift probably don't have that same... Don't have any impact down the road.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:18:09):\nYes. Unfortunately, I think that's brutal. Probably more common than we like to believe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:15):\nYes, and nobody wants to hear this, except people that you should want to hear this because if you want to build a business that grows and need to grow, it's better to know to learn that now. \n\nArchie Abrams (00:18:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:29):\nOkay. So for people that can't run whole long hold that experiments, I guess is there anything that you find is a good early indicator that might be the case? Most people don't have time to sit around and wait a year or two or three. They're not thinking 100 years.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:18:43):\nI mean I think end of the day that is going to be the most effective and you actually learn the most. I think it is, though even in shorter term horizons, really being as specific as you can be about what are the early signs of success in your product, and making sure you instrument those. And then making sure, particularly up funnel experiments, you are actually looking at the further downstream metrics to make sure you have some understanding of what's moving down. \n\n(00:19:17):\nSo as deep as you can go in the funnel for as long as you can wait. Do that. And if you can't, you know what I would say? Still you should just bet on, if something is showing lift up funnel, still ship it and it's probably not going to hurt you, but don't overestimate the amount of impact that this is having.\n\n(00:19:34):\nSo it's funny, two things here is, my recommendation to folks is don't think, \"Oh my goodness, I have to wait all this time.\" Because if you didn't move the short-term impact, you're not going to have the long-term lift. So still ship if it's short-term lift. Just be reasonable that if you can measure it longer term, you'll get better about identifying what things are that are really impactful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:57):\nGot it. And so it may be positive initially, but often neutral. Rarely is it neutral initially and then positive down the road?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:09):\nThere are some cases of that, but it's rarely... I've seen neutral be positive, but I haven't seen negative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:15):\nGot it. Okay-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:16):\nThat resulted positive. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:17):\nGot it. Okay. So that's reassuring. You're not harming the business, but you're probably getting a lot more credit than you deserve as a growth team shipping things that are-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:27):\nLikely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:28):\nLikely, right?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:29):\nLikely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:29):\nAnd there's also just trade-offs to moving on and on balance, you're probably doing good things if you continue to ship things that are showing positive. Right?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:39):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):\nOkay. This is awesome. For people that want to run long-term holdout experiments, I imagine you've built your own experimentation system internally? Yeah, we have.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:50):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:51):\nAnd is it basically you hold out 10%, say it was some percentage of users from seeing the new change? Is that how you approach it or is there a different way of approach?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:20:59):\nTwo things. We have two layers of holdouts. So one is more the holdouts of every change in a quarter, holdout 5% across the board. Second is for changes that only affect new merchants, what we'll do is we'll take that group of folks, let's call it 50/50 split, and then run that for a few weeks. And then what we're doing, we look at the long-term effects is actually ship the winner to 100%, but we're looking at the cohort of folks who was assigned to the experiment. We're going back and looking at those people who were assigned a year later.\n\n(00:21:36):\nSo it allows us to still ship, get stuff out, but we've kind of held the experiment in a way that allows us to see those long-term effects just for the cohort that was exposed. That only works if you're doing it on new users. For existing, it's a little more complicated. That's okay. And then in our experimentation tools, all experimenters are paying that three months, six months, nine months, 12 months with here are the updated results. So you can't really get hide from, what did this really result in over a longer term horizon?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:10):\nSo your tool is email everyone that's involved with the experiment of here's what this cohort is doing now.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:22:16):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:16):\nI love that. Okay, that's awesome. It's interesting that you use kind of these cohort curves for GMV, and is that the core metric you look at to see?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:22:25):\nThere's a few GMV, obviously gross profit. But GMV is kind of like a key determinant of long-term success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):\nSo it's interesting. Most people use cohort retention curves. You're using cohort because you don't look at retention. You're looking at for GMV over time. So that's really interesting. \n\nArchie Abrams (00:22:45):\nGMV over time, which correlates better. And there's a retention in profit. And then really the absolute number of merchants who are on the platform and then reaching certain GMV.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:56):\nOkay, I'm going to not keep falling this path. We can go on and on. While we're in the topic of experiments and what you've done, I'm curious if there's any examples of big wins that your team has shipped that might inspire people as they're thinking about launching experiments. I know there's probably some trade secret stuff you don't want competitors to know, and I know this is particular to Shopify and a platform in eCommerce. But I guess is there anything that would be worth sharing of like, \"Here's a huge win that maybe we didn't expect.\"\n\nArchie Abrams (00:23:25):\nGoing back, there's always a lot of value in thinking through monetary friction as I mentioned. That's always going to be something to export. Trial dynamics, different types of incentives, all of those things are very impactful.\n\n(00:23:39):\nI would say on things that are maybe more practical and for everyone, there's an enormous amount, and we do see these with long-term effects. But just the nuts and bolts of sign up, collecting the right information. And you usually want to collect more information than most people think you do in your sign up flow. If you can then leverage that to personalize the guidance. And this is for SaaS product, the guidance that someone can get when they onboard into Shopify. \n\n(00:24:09):\nSo whether you're coming on, Shopify is a very diverse product, in-person selling, online selling different channels. There's the nuts and bolts of get more information from folks, build trust in there, give them right amount of guidance when they come on in a personalized way.\n\n(00:24:25):\nAnd that may sound like, okay, that's kind of obvious. But the amount of impact by just nailing those flows has never ceased to amaze me and setting up that person for long-term success. So monetary friction. Then just really good onboarding, personalization, a well of opportunities there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:49):\nI love that onboarding comes up every time I ask anyone where they've seen ongoing success and opportunities, particularly in actually surprisingly driving retention. It's interesting that that's not what you look at, but it turns out that's one of the biggest levers for increasing retention. Interesting that even for a company that doesn't look at retention, that's a big opportunity.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:25:07):\nYes. Yeah, it's really because it's setting people up, for Shopify's case, I think the big thing about all of our metrics is... What we get very nervous about is the easiest way to increase retention is always to constrict the funnel stage one above the retention metric you're trying to optimize for. \n\n(00:25:27):\nThe simplest way to increase my signup to activated thing is just make it harder to sign up. Nuts and bolts, that will always happen is when you have teams on that local conversion rates, you get all these weird team incentives, because they're optimizing to basically implicitly make it harder to do the step before them.\n\n(00:25:49):\nAnd because we focus on that long-term GMV, number of merchants who are successful, orienting every team to think about the total number of people, not the rate, but the total number of people who got to the end of their part of the journey is a very powerful way to incentivize people to do the right thing in terms of getting people set up versus do the, \"I'm going to constrict the funnel step right before me to make my local conversion rate look better,\" which is the bane of my existence but something I see a lot of teams, implicitly or explicitly do when they get too focused on rates as a way to think about the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:32):\nIncentives. What a power.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:26:34):\nIncentives, what a power, what a lever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):\nI definitely want to chat a little bit more about metrics. I know you have a really interesting take that's kind of built on what you're just talking about. But first of all, you mentioned this term monetary friction as one of the levers that you've seen success with. Can you just describe what that actually means?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:26:48):\nTotally. So things like trial, trial dynamics, trial length, trial amount. It means incentives. So what is in your product? What do people value and need in order to be successful? So in Shopify's case, that might be app score credits or things like that, but those are the two forms of monetary friction we talk about and then of course actual price point. But that's what the larger bucket of monetary friction is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:16):\nSo let's follow this thread of metrics. You're big on absolute numbers and you've been talking about this already, versus percentages and ratios. Talk about that and how you encourage your teams to think about metrics.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:27:29):\nYeah, I think one of the things that I think happens particularly in large, in Shopify's growth order, it's about 600 folks. When you have teams naturally break up the world into different funnel stages or different points in the journey, it gets very seductive to look at my part of the funnel, and what's my conversion rate through that part of the funnel? And then the team starts to optimize for that conversion rate as their north star over a longer time period. I'm going to try to move my conversion rate from 10 to 12% or what have you.\n\n(00:28:04):\nBut in practice, I talked about it's actually almost always easier to just make it harder to do the thing right before your step in the funnel to increase your conversion rate. If I make it harder to sign up, it's going to be very easy to increase sign up to activated rate, because I just have fewer people and the people who made it through our higher intent.\n\n(00:28:23):\nAnd so I see teams get really stuck when they are trying to optimize conversion rate, but they just make it harder to do the previous thing. Versus everyone is thinking about absolute number of people who made it through their \"stage\" of the funnel. So instead of I'm trying to convert a bunch of people, a conversion rate, I just want more people to get activated.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd then once you start thinking that way, you realize actually the best way to get more people to get to a step sometimes, and often they just get more people in the door in the first place. So make it easier to sign up or reduce friction. It's the opposite. \n\n(00:29:05):\nBecause that will always hurt your conversion rate, but it may actually give you more people on the outside. And a lot of teams get very nervous, their retention rate went down, their LTV went down. Oh my goodness, is this this going to affect our ability to pay? No, your CAC also went down by probably more. And so now you have the ability to likely spend more and you have more people through the door, getting to each point in the activation or the immersion journeys.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:33):\nWhat I'm hearing is essentially teams are gold not on increase, lift this conversion step by some percentage. It's drive some absolute number of new merchants, potentially.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:29:45):\nMerchants, yeah. Exactly. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:47):\nThis is a good segue to I want to hear how you structure your growth team at Shopify. Essentially, what's the raw structure, what are the different teams, and what do they focus on? And then what are the functions within each teams?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:29:59):\nWe have two big groups within growth. So one is what we call growth R&D. So this might be what you traditionally consider product design engineering, data, your traditional product teams. Then we have growth marketing, which in Shopify's case is paid acquisition, media buying, affiliate marketing, email, content, and SEO. So that's growth R&D, growth marketing.\n\n(00:30:23):\nWithin growth R&D, three pillars. One is what we call growth products. And so this is basically everything from landing pages, sign up, onboarding, monetization. So trial, incentives, the like, all the way through to what we call our home feed, our engagement to basically get more merchants. Again, not necessarily to retain, but to keep giving entrepreneurship a try to become bigger and bigger businesses. So that's growth product, the full life cycle there. \n\n(00:30:56):\nSecond is what we call our enable pillar, and this pillar is building tools for both growth and the rest of Shopify. So things like experimentation platform, our communication platform, our business intelligence tooling that powers a lot of what we're doing, our more tech work to support our growth marketing team. \n\n(00:31:14):\nAnd then our third bucket, which is maybe a little different from most growth teams is actually our customer support, groups within growth. We want to think about customer support as part of this merchant journey of coming on, giving entrepreneurship a try, all the way through to here's the support I need as I'm becoming a multi-billion dollar business on Shopify. So those are the three big growth product buckets. And then within growth marketing, it's a more traditional channel setup. Paid, all the different channels online, offline, SEO, email, and affiliates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:49):\nSuper cool. Okay. So within growth RD, I just took notes. I'm going to summarize what you just shared, which is awesome. So there's three big buckets. One is growth product, which essentially is onboarding. It feels like it's like the top of funnel, get people in. Well okay, so growth marketing feels like that's super top of funnel bring-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:32:07):\nThat's super top funnel. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:08):\nYeah. Okay, got it. So growth marketing, drive people to Shopify.com. Then within RD team, growth product takes that user and tries to get them to activate it. Enable helps... It feels like that's like internal tooling and ways to make the teams internally more efficient.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:32:27):\nCorrect. Both growth and outside growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:29):\nAwesome. Okay. And then the customer support team, that's really interesting. So there's a customer support product team that helps new merchants be successful. And does that include actual customer support agents? Is that within that team?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:32:46):\nThat's not. We build a tooling to make those support advisors superheroes. And then on the help center, all of our AI stuff to make a great customer experience for people who are just engaging in a self-serve. So it's the tooling and the experience for merchants.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):\nOkay. So with these teams, is there anything you can share about just how you think about metrics/goals for these different buckets? We don't need to get too deeply, but does everyone basically have an absolute new merchants goal or is it a little different?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:33:18):\nSo yeah. So at the highest level we think about that total cohort value. We bring in a set of merchants in a given year. How much GMV, how much that set of merchants worth over the next three, four years to Shopify? And that's the most important thing that we want to focus on. And then that of course, from an efficiency standpoint, that of course meeting our payback guardrails and all of that. So that's the macro growth perspective. Cohort value over cost and payback. So that's the macro point of view.\n\n(00:33:52):\nAnd then within growth marketing, each channel operates with certain guardrails around their LTV CACs. Same thing for content and SEO. That operates with kind of a guardrail model for each piece of content. How much is that going to come back and down the line?\n\n(00:34:09):\nFor growth products, it's also a combination of total GP incremental cohort value that's produced from those teams. So everything is basically going to be measured on from an experiment, ideally measured over a very long time period. What was the incremental cohort value lift that this generated? And that's how we think about and measure the impact of each of those sub teams along the way.\n\n(00:34:40):\nEach of those have a civic part of the funnel they play with. But because they're measured on absolutes and they really think about that absolute value, we don't get caught into, did your conversion rate over the course of this year go up or down? It's kind of irrelevant. What was the sum of the impact over a long period on that total cohort value that we're trying to produce from before merchants?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:01):\nAnd the way you come up with this goal I imagine is you have a forecast of where things would go organically, and then here's the lift we want to see from the work this team does this quarter, this year.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:35:12):\nCorrect. And then we're going to measure against for each experiment, did it actually get to where we expect that lift to be?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):\nAnd those experiments again, are those all long-term holdout experiments where you look wait a year or some-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:35:29):\nWe call. We call the experiment after three weeks, but in all cases, the group is held, we watch them. And that's where that ping comes back, every experiment is watched. And that ping comes back three, six months, 12 months to re-look at was this actually successful?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:42):\nOkay, cool.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:35:44):\nSo that creates the loop of shipping value quickly, but making sure we're holding ourselves accountable to did this actually produce results over a long period, or did it actually just have this neutral effect? It's like, oh, then we can learn from that and get better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the AI-first customer insights hub for all teams. Dovetail has always been the go-to tool for teams who want to find insights in customer calls, user interviews, or documents. Now they've stepped it up with the release of Dovetail 3.0.

Just go to dovetail.com/Lenny. \n\n(00:37:10):\nSo maybe just to dig into this again, because it's so interesting. Basically, product team ships stuff, they run an experiment, they see impact. Say it's 5% lift on something. Huzzah, you did it. Great work, performance review. Your exceeds, you're doing great. This team's killing it. And then a year later you realize, \"Oh, that didn't last.\" How often do you find a team that is shipping wins looks back and ends up seeing, \"That wasn't actually as successful as it.\" I know you said maybe it's a third of the time.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:37:38):\n30. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):\nYeah. Okay, so it's still roughly, yeah.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:37:42):\nAnd it's great learning and that's why we take it. It's like, wow, okay, now we really uncovered something and it's such a successful discovery. Wow, okay, we thought this thing. But now we learned it actually wasn't as true as we thought. Cool. What can we take from that and be smarter next time so we don't just double down on the wrong things?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:02):\nThat's so interesting. And again, and you mentioned most of the reason this is the case when something doesn't show lift down the road is it's pulling forward success that would've been seen later on its own if you had not even shipped this thing?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:38:14):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):\nAwesome. Is there an example by any chance that comes to mind of something like that that's just like, \"Wow, that was a big win. And then oh I see we just pulled forward some revenue from the future.\"\n\nArchie Abrams (00:38:25):\nSo I think one good example is something around payment failure notifications. So one of the things that a lot of teams have or see is we call Dunning effects where somebody might have a payment not go through, a credit card that doesn't go through. So we did a bunch of experimentation around, hey, how can we alert people that their credit card is failed, their payment attempt failed?\n\n(00:38:47):\nAnd that's a typical growth win, usually produces a lot of short-term impact. And that's what we saw here. We were doing much better alerting, reminding people, sending them a million emails about it. Cool, we got some pretty major lift.\n\n(00:38:59):\nYou look back six, 12 months. There was really no long-term lift. And why is that? Because there's really a little bit of a selection bias there that people who were letting that payment fail probably weren't actually that dedicated to this entrepreneurship craft. They may have updated their credit card, but they still really weren't in it.\n\n(00:39:22):\nAnd so that was a good example of in a bunch of this stuff around payments, even \"preventing\" churn where you look, it's six, 12, 18 months. On a GMV metric, not a lot of lift over that long-term horizon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):\nI love this example. I could see so many people having run experiments like this and like, \"Oh, we found such a huge win. This team's killing it. What a great idea. Of course this makes sense,\" and then turns out it's nothing long term.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:39:54):\nWhich is great. We were going to spend a lot of time, okay, what else can we do here? It's like, no actually bigger fish to fry in a lot of other areas. So it helps the team just feel really good that their work is really the things that were good.\n\n(00:40:13):\nAnother one that went the other way, which was really interesting was in our online store, and this might be if you use Shopify, we have sections and blocks that come pre-configured. And so we tested, okay, if we give you a pre-configured block of you should have an image up top, then a text banner, and then a collage with your products. That should help folks understand what to do when they're building the online store. It actually had no lift in people converting to a paying merchant. \n\n(00:40:48):\nHowever, when we looked longer term on that six months later, it had a pretty massive impact on the number of people who were selling and producing GMV. And why is that? Because it didn't likely really influence anyone to buy Shopify or pay for Shopify. But the people who used it created better stores that were higher converting, and so they got early sales. They actually converted one of their visitors and they got momentum, and they stuck with entrepreneurship a little bit longer. And we saw that in that opposite way.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAnd so this is an example where that neutral, and so we tend to ship neutral. It's like it could be positive and so let's let it go if we have good intuition about it and it'll turn. So we've seen a bunch of these things go in very different directions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:36):\nThis is so fascinating. I didn't realize that you ship neutral experiments. That's an interesting insight. So it's like if you feel good about it and it's neutral, you ship it?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:41:45):\nIn our culture of the kind of aim heavy, if the intuition is right that this probably is helping merchants, why do we start with that the original control is better if it's neutral? Let's start with, what would we have shipped if we were a blank slate? And if it's neutral, actually neither is better, so let's just pick the one we feel better about and ship that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:03):\nMakes so much sense. Oh man. Okay, so let's talk about this a little bit more. So this aim heavy concept, this idea of thinking 100 years out, can you just share more about that insight and that philosophy? I know it sounds like it comes from Tobi of how he likes to think about the business.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:42:18):\nTotally. It is all Tobi of really making sure Shopify is so oriented around, we are here to build 100 year company. And so the decisions we're going to make are really oriented towards the long-term success of merchants, of Shopify. Embedded in all of our principles are make the best product in the world, make money to do more of one. Never reverse principles two and three. In every kind of executive meeting, every town hall, that slide comes up. It's like you've been at Shopify, you've probably seen that slide 10,000 times. But it's an important reminder job is to build the best product for merchants over the long period of time. And then all of the metrics and the make money part of it, secondary to that. So what we care about is that long term piece. It ties a little bit to that original conversation about entrepreneurs and being the core of why we just want more people to start businesses and go.\n\n(00:43:15):\nIt's very seductive I think in most companies, including in Shopify because we can support large enterprise businesses today, right? Big brands who want to get off an outdated solution and come over to Shopify. It's very easy to just say, \"Oh, that's very concrete.\" There's an existing business, we want to have them come join Shopify. \n\n(00:43:40):\nAnd in the short term it feels really good. It brings a lot of revenue right away. But if you're thinking about the long-term 100 years from now, guess what? All of the big brands of today be out of business. And many of them will be out of business in 30, 40, 50 years. The real success of Shopify is getting every business to start with us and go, but making that type of an investment and being so focused on that entrepreneur segment and making it easier is how we build a very, very long-term oriented company. So just even how we do capital investment, how we do product decision-making comes back to, hey, we can't chase the short-term. Even more concrete things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:24):\nIs there an example that comes to mind where you did that where something short-term looked like, \"We should definitely do this,\" but we're thinking thinking 100 years out so we're going to approach it this way?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:44:35):\nIt's kind of very much just imbued in the culture. Almost everything kind of feels that way. And I'll give, practically speaking, every six weeks all the R&D group leads we get together and we sit with Tobi and each other and review every single project across the company. Every six weeks, every single R&D pull up the dashboard, and look at it.\n\n(00:44:56):\nAnd in that conversation, so much of the conversation is about both the technical how. How are we building this in a way that allows for Shopify to have optionality in the technical decisions that we are making? And I think for Tobi, one of the things I've learned and so is that how, the technical architecture determines strategy in a technology company even more than the what and who we're building for. If you build the right technical how and set yourself up to have a platform that can be adaptable, flexible, that is incredibly valuable over the long term. It means we will sometimes take longer to ship a feature. It means we'll not chase certain deals or what have you, but we're going to kind of make that investment. And it comes through in all of our reviews and just how we got to do our work together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:53):\nWow, that is really unique. I've not heard of that where how... Usually it's the opposite. Let's not worry about how we're going to build this thing. It's why are we building this thing and then when are we building it? And not just the architecture is the most important thing.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:46:09):\nYeah, I mean in the last one, it was great. We had a 30-minute discussion about how to build CSV importers for people coming over from different platforms, and it was all about are we using open source library, doing it internally, are we doing it in the core code base? Are we building a separate first party app to do it? It was incredible detail. \n\n(00:46:29):\nThis is what's amazing about Tobi. The technical detail of how we're going to do this was incredibly important to get right, to kind of set up this type of infrastructure. And most companies it'd be okay what, you're going to make it easier for people to migrate their data over. Cool. Team, go figure out how. And if team does figure out the how do we work on it with Tobi and the details, because the how is so important to how we build for the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:54):\nThat's fascinating. And usually it's how do we do this as quick as possible, because CVS importing is not our core differentiator. It'll just build something good enough, we'll ship it, we'll move on.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:47:02):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:02):\nTotally the opposite. That is fascinating. What's also really interesting about this is I think about Brian Chesky at Airbnb where I worked for a while and his... So one, he also had this idea of the 100-year vision and thinking for the future way out in 100 years. But interestingly, since he's a designer, he had a very different focus. So Tobi, he was an engineer. He still codes from what I can see on Twitter, he still-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:47:24):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:26):\nSo I could see why his brain goes there and why he's really strong in the how. Brian on the other hand is very focused on the experience and making sure the design is amazing, and the app is exactly what he wants it to feel like. It is very experience oriented. So it's interesting that these founders lean into the thing that they're strong at, and understand deeply, and that ideally connects with the way this business specifically wins and grows. And it makes sense a platform, I could see why engineering would be so essential to get right. Travel, hospitality, consumer app. I could see why design is so important. \n\nArchie Abrams (00:48:03):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):\nFascinating. One more tidbit that I've heard about how you all think about this is metrics. And you mentioned before we started recording that a lot of the company doesn't actually have metrics that drive what they build, especially within the core business, which I think surprised a lot of people. Most people are like, \"Every team needs a metric and a KPI, and this is how we measure progress and this is how we know if they're doing well.\" Talk about just how that works, how most of the companies doesn't have a metric.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:48:31):\nYeah. It's funny, we ran against KPIs are basically banned as OKRs or banned and all that. And so certainly, in growth you have metrics, but they take a different form. And then in core, it truly is, do we have conviction that this is the right technical foundation to build the future of commerce? And that is built through certainly looking at data. So it's not that teams are not looking at data and using it as a piece of their puzzle, but it's not the overriding. And when we go to ship a feature in core, it's not like a team is held accountable for this metric over this six months. It's much more, did we ship the right thing? And we're going to kind of get at that through a variety of lenses. Could be some of that could be data, qualitative, just our own product sense of what's good or not.\n\n(00:49:24):\nAnd so I think the upside of that is I think we tend to ship things in core and that are incredibly forward-facing and we take more risk. I think to acknowledge some of the downside of it though is sometimes conversations get extremely subjective about what is the right thing to do. And so that requires the right way of having good discussions, openness from all leaders and from teams to debate those things. But it does result in some squishiness, which again has its pros and cons, but taste is what drives a lot of what we're shipping in core.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):\nYeah, I'm glad you touched on that. I was going to say, okay, everyone would love this idea of just build things that we think are awesome. It's going to be great. But then you build a whole org with teams and people building stuff. How does one know if they're building things that are good and helping versus not?\n\n(00:50:21):\nAnd you're pointing out there are pros and cons to that. The pros is we're not optimizing for some short-term wins and driving some poor metric. The con is you might ship stuff that... There's a lot of subjectivity, and people may not agree, and it's a lot of squishy stuff.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:50:39):\nYeah, totally. Glen, who's heads of core product, I mean one of the things that's so impressive about Glen and that core team is they go incredibly deep into every single release that is shipped. And so you do have a central eye on the quality and how it all fits together.\n\n(00:51:00):\nAnd so that I think helps make sure there's a consistent kind of bar for taste. A bunch of folks Tobi obviously that can enforce that. So it's subjective, but it's objective in the sense that it's kind of a small number of people who really hold what that bar is and needs to be. I think if it's just subjective, let's just ship what we want without a couple people really holding that quality and that taste bar, that's where things go really sideways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:31):\nAwesome. That's exactly what I was going to ask is, who's the ultimate decider of taste and what is good? And so it sounds like basically Tobi above, and then he's kind of deputized Glen and relies on him to make a lot of these final calls. And then I imagine Glen has some folks that he kind of deputizes to make smaller decisions along the way. Or not, or he's very involved in everything.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:51:55):\nAnd I think this is the fun thing about Shopify. Literally we have our own internal project management system that's been kind of crafted just for Shopify and every shift-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):\nWhat is that called by the way? It's got a cool name, right? \n\nArchie Abrams (00:52:06):\nGSD. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:07):\nGSD, yeah. [inaudible 00:52:10].\n\nArchie Abrams (00:52:10):\nYeah, get it done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:11):\nThat's what I remember.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:52:12):\nSo get shit done. And every project, so you got a core project, you have emergency service, you got growth project. And the expectation is that the group leads. Every single project that goes out has a few minute video with Figmas and everything, and everything that shipped. Needs to be okay-toed, so approved by the group lead. There's nothing that can ship without that okay-to approval. And that okay-to approval has to be Glen, Carl, myself with different groups. And so that is how everything is reviewed. Now of course there's great amazing teams that do amazing work, but it is that that's how the system works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:50):\nAnd okay-to specifically means someone above reviews it or all this whole team, everyone looks at it?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:52:56):\nNo. So Glen reviews the core stuff. Carl reviews the MS. Okay-to. It's interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:05):\nIt's basically Glen is founder mode and not as a founder where he's involved in all the details, has final say. So this is a really cool example of founder mode, but not as a founder.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:53:15):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):\nIn the way you guys operate. And I imagine sometimes Tobi disagrees with Glen and then they talk about it and things get ironed out.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:53:22):\nTotally. And that's why we come together every six weeks, everyone in person to review every project so we can hash out those disagreements. Go through all the core projects, all the merge service projects, all the growth projects. And it's a great forum to say, \"Hey, here's where we disagree,\" really on the how and the tactics of what's happening. And we can flag those things, have good debates about whether there might be misalignment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):\nAmazing. What a unique way of working. I'm so fascinated by all this. So what I'm hearing essentially within Core, Glen and his team come up with, \"Here's what we're going to build the next quarter.\" You guys have twice a year releases, is that right? Or is it every season?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:53:58):\nYeah, so big additions. Twice a year. Obviously continually shipping, but we package them twice a year in a big bang.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:05):\nBig launch. Yep, I've seen those. Okay. So he's like, \"Here's what we're going to do in the next release. We're just going to build this because we think this is right. And we're not driving a specific goal. We're building for 100 years in the future. Let's just build it.\" And basically you build it. He's like, \"This is great, not great, iterate until it's this good,\" and then ship. And great. Okay, this is great. Okay, so then there's that team, and then there's your team, which is drive some freaking numbers, drive growth, hit these goals. How do you collaborate across these two teams? Do you have a model for how you work together? Because these feel like very different ways of working?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:54:41):\nYeah, honestly, it's been one of the things I'm very proud of. We built a really great partnership for the last three and a half years, because it's intentionally meant to be almost at odds, and that's part of the structure of how we want to work.\n\n(00:54:56):\nBut it comes from, I think, a place of respect on both sides. And I'd say for anyone, it's okay, here's what growth is going to do. We're going to do it in a way that is high quality, that is shipping really good stuff for merchants. We're probably going to approach it in a faster way. We might disagree on things, but we're going to have reasonable paths to handle that conflict.\n\n(00:55:17):\nAnd so while there's no magic bullet, it wasn't like these are the surfaces that growth can touch, these are not. It was like you can go anywhere in the product, but let's go figure out how to work together to figure out that quality bar to understand when you're going to be different on it, on the quality bar to get something out to learn, and just building trust along the way that we're actually going to ship high quality things and we ship it to 100% and move. And so a lot of great work on the team to make those relationships really strong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:47):\nGot it. So basically, you guys are like, \"Moving this button over here is going to drive so much growth,\" and then Glen's like, \"No, this is not acceptable. We don't want a button here. This looks terrible. Everyone's going to hate it.\" So that's the healthy tension. I'm describing a combative-\n\nArchie Abrams (00:56:01):\n[inaudible 00:56:01] totally. And it's like, okay, so how are we going to work to figure this out? It might be, \"Hey, we're going to move the button. Hey let's run the test,\" but see the short-term lift. You know we're going to monitor it long term. You know when we ship it, it's going to be high quality, high quality polish. And you trust us to make those trade-offs.\n\n(00:56:19):\nI wish I had a better answer of it's very human. It's very that trust that's that's very important in any of these. I think growth with other teams is like, there's no replacement for just the human trust and then following through on commitments of no, we are actually going to make this thing really good. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:38):\nIs there an example of that, that comes to mind where you had something that was you thought was going to drive meaningful growth? You showed it to Glenn, he is like, \"No, don't know about this.\" And then either you iterated or you just forget it, this isn't right for the platform even though it's going to drive some meaningful growth?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:56:54):\nThe place that we often come back to is, and this is with I think Tobi is great, Tobi and Glen, is on wizards. So wizards-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):\nOnboarding carousels.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:57:08):\nOnboarding carousels. Some way that basically has folks get set up by not using the actual product. And so we've always kind of danced around and we have very specific no wizard principle, but I think that sometimes the tension is wizards can serve a purpose in certain circumstances, but we've avoided doing that. But we've always worked to try to make the principles of what a wizard does really well, which is it simplifies the product into something that allows people to have a lower bar, to try to work with core to bring that into the actual experience itself.\n\n(00:57:52):\nSo the example of that experiment I mentioned to you of giving pre-filled sections in the online store editor, you could have solved that in a wizardy way of, \"Enter a few things, and we're going to generate these sections for you.\" Instead, we actually took those pre-generated things based on what we know about you and put it into the actual project experience itself.\n\n(00:58:15):\nSo it tried to get at some of the principles of what a wizard can do well without avoiding the wizard principle, without creating actual wizard. So that's been some of the, how do we work together to get the intent of what the growth ideas but in a way that's consistent with the way we want to build in core?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):\nGot it. And I get why that you think about this a lot because you talked about one of the biggest levers is onboarding and helping more people get activated, and so I could see why you spent a lot of time thinking about how do we help more people succeed there.\n\nArchie Abrams (00:58:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:48):\nI want to ask your insight on this idea that people might be listening to this and feeling like, \"Oh, we need to build a team that just builds great product and is not constrained by metrics and driving growth.\" Short-term thinking, long-term thinking, 100 years. This is inspiring I think to a lot of companies because the sounds great.\n\n(00:59:08):\nWhat do you think it takes to make something like that work? Because in a bad case, this team just sits around and builds whatever they want, and the rest of the company's like, \"God damn, this sucks. I have to show success in metrics and moving a metric in this team, over there just build beautiful things.\" Is it like you need a founder like Tobi, that prioritizes this and values it and has a very good taste and intuition? What do you think are important elements of something like that, of this approach working at a company based on what you've seen?\n\nArchie Abrams (00:59:37):\nYeah, I think it needs to have a very opinionated founder set of people who are driving what good looks like. And I think Shopify a few years ago and before maybe sometimes drifted into the mode of, \"We are just going to build stuff and each kind of team is just going to build stuff not really accountable for it,\" and that is a very, very bad state to end up. So I think you either have to use, my sense is metrics as accountability, which is the most common kind of way to drive accountability and focus. Or extremely strong founder or set of folks who have extremely strong opinions on what good is and what taste is. If you have one of those two, you can make it work, but the worst case is let's just go build a bunch of cool stuff in kind of a haphazard way. That I don't think would work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:30):\nYeah, this is great. So either you need metrics to tell you you're doing the right thing or really correct and good taste in your founder.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:00:42):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:42):\nCool. I think that's a really good way of... And I imagine every founder is going to think, \"Oh, that's me. I have this, I can do this.\" I think it's rare in real life. It's rare that you're like a Tobi, or Brian Chesky, or Elon.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:00:43):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:57):\nYeah. It's hard to internalize that, but I think that's the reality. So most people will be more successful building things that are driving metrics they can track in an experiment. \n\nArchie Abrams (01:01:07):\nYes. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:08):\nAwesome. This is very fascinating. I'm so happy we're spending so much time on this. Okay, there's a few other random things I'm going to touch on. One is sales. So historically, Shopify has been very product-like growth, very organic. Go check it out, sign up, shop a store, start a store, grow. And you guys have layered on sales. In a sales motion that's an increasing part of your business. What have you learned about your team, the growth team working with sales and making that a successful relationship?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:01:36):\nYeah, no, it has been great over the last couple of years as built out, the sales order has added a whole new kind of motion to Shopify. As Shopify's product got better, it can serve the biggest companies in the world. It's like the natural evolution. Well what are you going to do that for people to grow up on Shopify and to be the biggest companies, but we're also going to take folks another platform, bring them over.\n\n(01:01:57):\nFor growth in sales, I think the biggest learning from the the R&D side at least has been the scale is very different with sales, and so it's really hard to use as much quantitative data to make growth, to make some of those decisions. \n\n(01:02:18):\nAnd so a lot of it has been building much more qualitative insights working with merchant success, sales about the challenges they're facing and onboarding a large customer. So how do we build import tools that work for them? How do we make sure they have the right guidance in the product for a very different set of use cases? So a lot of it has just been very much empathy building with sales about what that merchant journey looks like, and quite frankly challenging ourselves to think differently. It's been one thing.\n\n(01:02:49):\nAnd then second, we kind of built two very distinct funnels for a little bit. There's a sales funnel. You come in, you contact us, that's it. There's no mention of self-service, there's no this. There's just drive MQLs, boom. Then there's the self-service thing. There's no mention of sales anywhere. \n\n(01:03:05):\nSo one of the last thing the year, last year we've been really doing is how do we create these hyper journeys where there is... We shouldn't force the merchant to choose, do you want to talk to sales? You want to do self-service? Should give them the options, whatever path that they want to go on.\n\n(01:03:19):\nAnd so a lot of that has been building into the self-service journey over to sales and then from sales into self-service. That's broken a lot of metrics in the business. That's broken a lot of ways people have thought about their jobs, and so there's been a lot of cultural resetting and just getting smarter from a metric standpoint about, how do we measure this thing of hybrid journey? They came in via self-service, they went over to sales. How do we value each of those components in the process? And transparently, that's something we're still getting better at, but it's really important to get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:55):\nIs there an example of something that broke that would be illustrative of what you're describing?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:04:01):\nYeah. So I think that breaks is drive someone from an ad over to self-service. We typically look at only the self-service LTV of that person. But what happens if they come in, they sign up via self-service and then they go talk to sales? They get changed to a sales driven merchant, which means that that value of that merchant, which is usually actually quite large, does not get associated back to that ad campaign. Oh, guess what that means? That means you would probably reduce investment on that ad campaign because you weren't valuing that. Our system had two different models for calculating LTV. Sales driven one, and a self-service one. Uh oh, we're going to make suboptimal investment decisions now by kind of moving things around even though it's the right thing to do.\n\n(01:04:55):\nSo a lot of it's in rebuilding all instrumentation, how we do LTV modeling, how we do attribution, how we do incrementality testing across each of those different types of outcomes, because it was not an intuitive thing for us originally because we had built all of these systems with a much more siloed view.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:16):\nYeah, basically attribution gets a lot more complicated. Are you going in a multi-touch attribution direction or is there something even more clever?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:05:26):\nMy rant is I am... Multi-touch attribution as its place. I think ideally what we want to get through is what we really care about is incrementality. So incrementality is kind of the gold standards, for people who are less like attribution measure is, how do you assign value to a given touch point, right? Click, a view, etc. But it doesn't tell you causally what drove something. That's where incrementality tells you. Incrementality test is basically don't show ads on meta for certain number of people. Show it to the other set, see what the lift is and the outcome.\n\n(01:06:04):\nA lot of what we're doing is trying to get a lot, is continuing to get even more sophisticated in incrementality measurement for not just self-serve outcomes, but for self-service outcomes that then drive to sales for sales specific outcomes. And as soon as we have that kind of incrementality at the channel level, we can get a lot more sophisticated in terms of our bidding, budgeting, and all of that. But that's really the key thing we want to get to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:35):\nThere's certain topics that alone can be their own podcast conversation to just dive deep into this stuff. But I'm going to stop myself and I'll go further down that track. Let me touch on a couple more things before I let you go.\n\n(01:06:46):\nOne is marketing. So we talked about sales, marketing. You guys don't have a CMO, there's no Shopify CMO. Instead you embed marketing leads within the org. For folks that are trying to grapple with that, should we hire CMO? Should we do something else? What have you learned about maybe the benefits and also maybe some downsides of approaching it the way you guys have approached it?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:07:07):\nThe benefit is, so there's growth marketing who sits in growth, there's revenue marketing who sits over closer to sales. There's a brand team under Harley who does amazing work. Our president. There's marketing embedded in core and PMM, sit with the product managers there. There's shop marketing on a consumer side. So marketing is truly everywhere in the org.\n\n(01:07:28):\nAnd I think the benefit of it is it's closest to the primary goal that those marketers are trying to do. They sit with growth so we can focus on that self-service motion. Harley is an amazing communicator, so brand sits with him so he can have a lot of influence over that. And so I think it sits with the people its most relevant outcomes are driving, which is great. It allows us move faster with less kind of coordination. \n\n(01:07:58):\nI think it only works because Tobi and Harley has such amazing intuition on what the brand is, needs to be, and all of that. Some of what the CMO does of kind of creating the cohesive story of Shopify it held in their heads and they have the pen on that. \n\n(01:08:19):\nAnd so that allows then, that piece of that CMO's job to not be as important at Shopify. But the other pieces are obviously critical, but they can be now closer to the action and where they're going to drive the most impact. The downside is things are sometimes very messy. So that's...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:40):\nIt's another example where the founder, their background and interest in skills can impact significantly the way the work is structured and who you hire and don't hire. Okay, one last question. Totally different topic, discounting. So you worked at Udemy for a long time. And from what I understand, discounting was one of the key reasons Udemy succeeded and one of the big differentiators. I'm curious what you learned about discounting, the power of discounting as a growth lever.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:09:09):\nYeah, so Udemy is a very an online marketplace for online courses. So come on course. And I think what was happening in I started, and we were there 2012-ish was people were like, \"What is this online course thing? I don't really understand what it is. I don't understand what the value is and what I'm willing to pay.\"\n\n(01:09:30):\nAnd so what discounting has a really powerful effect on is it can signal value with a high list price, but then bring something down to an affordable price. And that may seem like of course that's obvious, but in online courses what was important is the list price would be high at 100 bucks. So it's associated with a college course. But what people really value this thing as was a book.\n\n(01:09:54):\nAnd so you could signal very high, signal quality through price, which was very murky at that point in online learning. Signal value through price. Discount it to 10 bucks, or that was a typical Udemy deal. And then so 99% off, 90% off. We might see fire sales, but it changed the value in willingness to pay and then it tapped into the fact that, and still is education is very aspirational.\n\n(01:10:23):\nAnd so what a lot of people missed in education is yes, we want people to actually take the course, but that's actually in many cases not the job to be done. That there's an emotional job that's even more important, which is I'm feeling like I'm making progress in my educational journey, and just the act of purchasing a course or the act of buying a book is progress.\n\n(01:10:47):\nAnd so if you can make it very enticing, very high value thing, cheap, urgency, you can let people make that emotional journey by the act of purchasing, which then allowed us to actually have very good retention. Because you could keep coming back to that emotional job over and over again, which just counting with urgency allowed us to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:10):\nAmazing. Well with that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Archie, are you ready?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:11:15):\nI'm ready. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:17):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:11:21):\nSo one, I love to go back to marketers who wrote in the 1920s. And so one that I love is Scientific Advertising by Claude Hopkins. So it's basically one of the first direct marketers that came out and he innovated on some of the concepts of copywriting and just how you sell a product around can't make this product, can't sell the product, can you tell the product will help the customer achieve their goals? And so it's really fun. I find it really fun to go back in time, because there's a lot of really good first principles thinking that I think we've actually lost in more modern stuff where it's like personalization band, it's optimization, all this stuff. Where it's like how do you actually write and sell things really effectively? Scientific Advertising, it's a great book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:09):\nIt's just like the name alone, it sounds really cool. Especially for someone in your shoes that feels like the perfect book for your role. And I think there's so much wisdom in just the thing someone figured out many years ago about what convinces people to buy something is still true and people overcomplicate it. Just going back to the original is often really useful.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:12:28):\nTotally. And The Perfect Mile about the chase for sub four minute mile by Roger Bannister and a few other folks is just a wonderful... As a runner, it's a really fun book to read about perseverance, how these folks really, they all competed to get to that really amazing goal of under four minutes in a mile.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):\nAwesome. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:12:58):\nI went back in time and I watched for the first time actually the entire season or all the episodes of The Sopranos, which was quite fun. Highly recommend. I did that in The Wire in the last six months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:13):\nIt's a lot of watching.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:13:14):\nIt's a lot watching. Work out in the morning on my elliptical or bike, so it's a nice-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:20):\nThat's smart-\n\nArchie Abrams (01:13:21):\nWorkout show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:22):\nThat's a good motivator to just work out out something. I got to watch the next episode. The Wire, it's hour long episodes and five seasons times 20. I think it's 22 episodes per season, right? \n\nArchie Abrams (01:13:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:33):\nOh geez. It's a lot of watching and I did that once and I was like, \"I've got a lot of episodes to watch,\" but incredible. Okay. It's funny you should say The Sopranos. I feel like a number of people recently told me they're watching the full Sopranos again. It's like a trend recently for some reason.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:13:50):\nOh, interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:51):\nAnyway, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:13:54):\nSo the AI music creator. My kids and I... I'm the least musical person in the world and it's been amazing. My kids and I will create songs together about our days, about what's going on. So it's just been really fun to be able to have a musical experience for a non-musical person, and have that creative experience for them and it's been really awesome to use. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):\nSuno is Insane. I think it's Suno.ai, folks want to check it out. It's just such a fun party trick too, just to write a song on the spot about something that you're thinking about. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find helpful and worker life?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:14:31):\nYeah, I often come back to the plan is the plan until it's not. And it's basically like we have a plan. It's the plan, it's our best, let's commit to it. But acknowledge it might change and we'll deal with it then. But if the combination of we have a plan, stay focused on that, with also the acknowledgement that you need to be flexible, and try to combine those two sometimes contradictory things of focus plan with we got to be able to react in an effective way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:01):\nReminds me of strong opinions loosely held as a concept.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:15:07):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:08):\nAwesome. Okay, final question. So I asked your wife what to ask you when you came on this podcast and she suggested that I ask you about your late father who had a lot of impact on your leadership style. So here's my question, what did you learn from your dad that impacts the way you work today?\n\nArchie Abrams (01:15:26):\nYeah. My dad a lot is a father, and he was an entrepreneur in technology. And I think one of the things that I so appreciate about his leadership style was the empathy, and curiosity, and kindness that he showed in everything. And I hope in some of the stories that of him, it's like no matter who anyone was, curious, love to engage and learn from. And I hope that's something that I try to take inspiration from is just be with everyone kind and learn from everyone you're with and around. So something I think about a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):\nThat super resonates. He sounds like a wonderful human as are you. Archie, this was wonderful. We touched on so much. We covered so much. I feel like we could go on for many more hours. Maybe we'll do round two as you learn more things at your time at Shopify. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to potentially reach out or follow the stuff you're up to, and how can listeners be useful to you? \n\nArchie Abrams (01:16:30):\nSo not super on social media. But on LinkedIn, check me out, send me a message. And then yeah, if folks are hiring a bunch of folks, growth marketers, PMs, engineers, data folks, UXers, you want to work at Shopify and growth or other parts? Fully remote. So we'd love to have great people join.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:54):\nAwesome. And that last point, I think I'll just highlight one of the few remaining fully remote tech companies that is not returning to work. Returning to the office [inaudible 01:17:05] work. Definitely work.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:17:07):\nYes. Yes. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:09):\nAmazing. And sounds like basically you're hiring across all functions.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:17:12):\nAll functions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:13):\nPerfect. Archie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nArchie Abrams (01:17:17):\nThank you Lenny, it was fun. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:19):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:17:21):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The art of building legendary brands | Arielle Jackson (Google, Square, First Round Capital)\n\n## Transcript\n\nArielle Jackson (00:00:00):\nSo over time, a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means. Like Disney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean, that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.\n\nLenny (00:00:42):\nArielle Jackson spent nine years at Google, where she helped grow Gmail in its early days, taking it from just a side project to a product that is now used by hundreds of millions of people all over the world. Then she went on to Square, where she was one of the first marketers and helped launch and scale the growth of Square reader. She's also worked with over 100 early stage companies, helping them nail their brand and marketing efforts, including Patreon, Loom, Front, Eero, Maven, Sprig, just to name a few.\n\nLenny (00:01:12):\nThese days, she teaches a super popular course on startup brand strategy and she's a marketer in residence at First Round capital. In our chat, we cover primarily three things, naming strategies for your startup or your product, a framework for developing your brand, that includes your purpose, your positioning, and your personality, and also getting PR for your startup. I can't wait for you to listen to this conversation with Arielle. And so with that, I bring you Arielle Jackson.\n\nLenny (00:01:41):\nHey, Ashley, head of marketing at Flatfile, how many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (00:01:49):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (00:01:51):\nAnd how many of them screw that up? And what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (00:01:54):\nWell? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock-full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:02:13):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I'm consistently seeing that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (00:02:28):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because [inaudible 00:02:38] data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (00:02:45):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:02:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack.\n\nLenny (00:03:15):\nEmbedding banking into your product, not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain and monetize your customers. Unit is the market leader in banking as a service combining multiple bank partners with a developer friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks. Unit is trusted by leading brands, such as AngelList, [inaudible 00:03:39] Invoice2go And Roofstock.\n\nLenny (00:03:41):\nTo hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/ lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:58):\nWelcome to the podcast, Arielle.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:04:01):\nThanks so much for having me. It's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:03):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. I've read so much of your writing online. You've done a lot of writing, which I found really helpful. And so I'm really jazzed to be digging into all kinds of really good stuff. Before we get into some of the meat, just a couple questions that I had in my mind. You've worked with so many amazing companies, Google, Square, Loom, Patreon, Front. So many others. I don't want to keep going. What's been either your favorite or most unusual project that you've worked on?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:04:35):\nGosh, it's like asking me to choose my favorite son. I'm like, gosh, I can't really like pick one.\n\nLenny (00:04:40):\nThat'll be the next question.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:04:41):\nI would probably say that my favorite project, and this is because they get reminded of it on a daily basis was working at on the Square stand at Square. It was the first time I ever worked on hardware and our joint Square was 140 people. We had no marketing function. We had a couple marketing people. We had no product managers and the hardware team was running the show on launching this new product that was supposed to get us up market into brick and mortar.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:05:05):\nAnd anyway, I was running event marketing at the time and giving away a bunch of those readers that you stick into a phone for free and having a lot of small merchants use. I volunteered to run the launch of this product as a product marketer for the first time. And it was just so fun, doing everything from positioning it, figuring out how we were going to talk about this beautiful new piece of hardware that would turn your iPad into a real point of sale.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:05:31):\nWe had people fly around the country and get cool coffee shops and brick and mortar businesses seeding it so that they would all use it. We had I think 15 Metro areas covered with the coolest coffee shops and donut shops and everything at launch. And you know, there was a lot of fake it till you make it. I was negotiating a deal with Best Buy in the Apple store. Never done anything like that before.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:05:53):\nDesigning packaging was really awesome. There was just so much to it launching a physical product. And at the time it was at a pretty high price point for a company that had always had one free product and helping that company go up market. And I remember I was 30 something weeks pregnant when we launched. We got all the blue bottle stores to use it. And we had this launch event where Jack, our head of hardware, Jesse unveiled this product at the blue bottle in Mint Plaza. And I was super pregnant and super proud. And I still get kind of excited every time I pay on one of those, which is all the time.\n\nLenny (00:06:30):\nSuper pregnant and super proud. I love it. And that product that was the POS stand, the iPad thing that you kind of swivel and sign.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:06:39):\nYeah. And there's been new versions of it since, there's a contactless version of it, and there's one with an integrated screen that I think is Android based, which you don't have to have an iPad, but that product's still around. I still pay on that original Square stand all the time. I drink a lot of coffee. Those independent coffee shops around LA. So they're all still using it.\n\nLenny (00:07:01):\nWe're going to talk about positioning a bunch, but while we're on the topic, what was the positioning of that product while we're talking about it?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:07:07):\nYeah, so at the time Square was mostly used by farmer's market vendors and event vendors. I made jewelry in a past life and that's how I got to Square was being one of those vendors. And the positioning was really that it was for brick and mortar businesses, particularly quick serve coffee, donuts, sandwich shops that kind of quick serve brick and mortars. And it was up against your ugly old point of sale. Your cash register effectively. That was our foil. And the benefit was turn your iPad into a point of sale. And the differentiator was about one unified experience that you can do everything you can on your cash register and more, and you'd be proud to have it out on your counter.\n\nLenny (00:08:01):\nSo you said that you were creating jewelry and that's how you got into Square to work on this product. I need to hear more about that.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:08:08):\nYeah, sure. So I was working at Google before Square and I'd always had this hobby of making jewelry and I used to sell my jewelry in a few different like boutiques around San Francisco and LA. It was a very small side hustle, but it was my creative outlet. And I sold at craft fairs around Hanukah/Christmas time. So I used to sell and just take cash. And then I got a Square reader and I sold at a craft fair that year. And it was awesome. That Square reader, it helped people buy more, it helped me sort of look cool. It was just really great to accept credit cards. I'd never done it before.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:08:49):\nI used to take PayPal invoices and be on my computer and send someone an invoice and they'd get it. It was painful. All the reasons that people use Square, I experienced it. And two people I knew from Google, Megan Quinn and Kyle Dink had gone to Square from Google. And so after I had that experience, I think I sent them both an email just being like, this thing's fucking awesome. I make jewelry. It was great. I sold I think it was 50% more than I did last year because I accepted credit cards and I can't remember which of them wrote back first, but they were like, come interview. And so that was basically how I ended up at Square.\n\nLenny (00:09:27):\nWow. I bet that helped you a lot through the interview, actual have personal experience.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:09:32):\nHaving been a merchant, I think it helped me understand the small merchant that initially we were marketing to.\n\nLenny (00:09:38):\nAnd so today you are marketing expert in residence at [inaudible 00:09:45] capital. I was going to ask what does that mean and what is it that you do day to day these days?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:09:51):\nSure. So after I left Square, I went to a tiny startup that was seven people. They were funded by First Round and I helped them with everything that a tiny startup that's trying to grow needs.\n\nLenny (00:10:06):\nWhat startup was that?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:10:06):\nIt was called Cover. They were acquired by Twitter. It was an Android app that could get you the right apps at the right time based on where you were by changing the lock screen on your phone. And so that company and that experience of working at this tiny startup that was seven people, I really liked it. And then they got acquired by Twitter, but I had just left Square. So I decided not to join Twitter with the rest of the team. And instead I just decided I was going to help a bunch of other small startups. And I emailed a few friends from past lives who had small startups, which was like, Hey, I'm not going to Twitter with the rest of the team. You do need marketing help. And every single person wrote back and said, yes. And that's basically how I started consulting.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:10:49):\nI guess it was about eight or nine years ago. At the same time, First Round had reached out and said, hey, who did you use for marketing comps for cover? And I got connected with Brett from First Round and he's like, would you help our companies? And we did a three month project for one day a week, nine years ago. And I'm still there. I work halftime at First Round. So I do everything I do for other companies, but for First Round companies on First Rounds time.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:11:17):\nSo the way it works is if you're funded by First Round and as part of your onboarding, we offer a lot of value add services and I'm one of them. And those services can be everything from, we have someone who's really good at compensation and HR stuff and we have someone who will help you with pricing and I'll help you with marketing. And what that means when you're a seed stage startup is everything from naming to positioning, to developing a brand identity, a website and your initial launch, and eventually hiring a marketer. So that's sort of the bread and butter. That's what I like working on anyway. So it's a good fit because we invest in a lot of seed stage companies at First Round, I get to help almost all of them.\n\nLenny (00:11:58):\nThat's an excellent segue to what I wanted to get to next. What I want to do in our chat is cover three broad topics. Things that I know are very near and dear to your heart, naming for products and startups, your brand development framework and how to hire marketers. Does that sound good?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:12:15):\nAwesome. That's what I like to talk about. So yeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:12:19):\nLet's do it. Surprise, surprise. Okay. So with naming, I've actually heard from a few founders that you were really helpful to them in naming their startups. Folks that have maybe been on this podcast that will go unnamed. So for founders trying to come up with a name for their company or their product, two questions. What makes a good name for a product or a startup, and then just how do you come up with a great name?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:12:44):\nI love naming. I think I've named just over 30 companies at this point. And actually when I mention how I got into consulting when I emailed some friends and asked them if they needed marketing help, I think I'm allowed to talk about this one. So one of those companies was some friends from Google, Adrian and Carl. They had left Google, gone to Facebook and then started a company it's now called Seesaw. It's an ed tech company. That was the first company I named post Google Square, all of that.\n\nLenny (00:13:09):\nIt's an awesome name.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:13:10):\nIt is an awesome name and I'll use it as an example. So seesaw is a ed tech company. They had a really bad name before that and we did this whole naming process and ended with that name and why I think that's a good name is when I say Seesaw, you don't really know what it is, but when I tell you, oh, it's this ed tech company and it's an iPad app and it helps the work that elementary school students do go between the teacher, the parents and the student. And you're like, oh, well, Seesaw makes sense for elementary school, it's something that goes back and forth. It has that sort of nostalgic feel. And it makes sense that it's an ed tech company.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:13:48):\nAnd I personally tend to like those kinds of names that are suggestive or evocative, where when I tell you what the company does, you're like, oh, that makes sense. But it's not that what the name is tells you exactly what the company does. So that's an example, I think of a good name. I don't know, during COVID and when my older son's school was closed and they all used Seesaw and I got to tell my son, oh, that's my friend's company and we named it back in the day. And he was like, oh, that's cool. That name makes sense.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:14:21):\nThat's the reaction you want. It also has a little bit of emotion to it. It has some nostalgia. It's fun to say it's short, it's memorable. I think all of those things make a good name. Another company that has a good name that you and I have both worked with is Maven. So they're a First Round company. Gogan has talked about this publicly. We named that company together. Maven is a Yiddish word that means one who understands and it means specifically one who understands because they've done something, they've acquired the skills or knowledge over time.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:14:58):\nAnd I just think that's such a cool name for a platform that allows X operators or current operators to teach their skills to other people through cohort based classes. You want to be a Maven, instructors are Maven's, it's short, it's easy to say, when I tell you what that company does, that name makes perfect sense. So I tend to like those [inaudible 00:15:17] of names myself, but I also, I don't know, I like other kinds of names for other kinds of products too. I think it really comes down to what is your product? What is your company? What is the name trying to achieve and really getting clearer with those criteria. So we can talk about the criteria that always apply, the criteria you might add and a process to get there.\n\nLenny (00:15:38):\nThat sounds great. Yeah. I'm really curious about a process. If one exists, that'd be really cool. So another question in my mind is just some names are just nonsense words like Yahoo and I don't know Google, I guess. What's your take on that as a name, that approach?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:15:51):\nYeah. So words like that are empty vessels, they really don't mean anything. If you think about the name Yahoo, it's actually like really silly. It's like Yahoo. I always hear it like that. Google has a meaning for people in the know with the one followed by as many zeros. It's like a big number and it's a misspelling of that. So that one's a little less silly to me than Yahoo. My take on empty vessel names is they can be really memorable and they can be evocative of the emotion, but you have to do a lot more marketing work over time to make it mean something.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:16:25):\nSo if I say Yahoo today, we know it's that search engine we use before we all switch to Google and we have the purple color in our head, and we think about what it meant at the time that we might have used it, but it took a lot of marketing dollars and a lot of time for that word to be in that. So they're doable. I worked on a company Eero. That has kind of what is almost an empty vessel name. Eero is for Eero Saarinen who was a designer. He did like these really beautiful buildings, architectural buildings. And then also some tables. You can get a Saarinen and table at Design Within Reach, but that name, nobody knows that unless you're in the design community. And so that name is effectively an empty vessel and they have to spend a lot and be consistent about making that [inaudible 00:17:16] mean a wifi system.\n\nLenny (00:17:17):\nI want to get to the process, but another question is why is it important for the name to kind of connect to the company and what they do? Is that just it feels nice to people or is there some kind of a bigger reason?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:17:30):\nYeah. So it doesn't have to, and examples like Eero and Yahoo, it doesn't. Even if you think about Apple, it doesn't. Apple has nothing to do with Apple computers. It's a word we all know. There's a lot of words where there's no meaning behind it. If there is a meaning behind your name, your name is doing a little bit more of your marketing work for you. So if your name is Internet Explorer, RIP, I know exactly what you do.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:17:56):\nIf your name is Chrome and you're a designer on the web, you kind of might be like, oh, that makes sense. That's the area around the browsing window. If your name is Firefox, I have no idea what you did. You just took two words and put them together and made something up. And now you have to spend, and you have to be consistent over time in making that word mean something for people. But all three of those browsers were successful at a time. And I don't think the name had anything to do with Internet Explorer's demise.\n\nLenny (00:18:25):\nGot it. So it's kind of ideally you can find an easy mode. If that doesn't work, then you go hard mode. You come up with your empty vessel name and then you just have to do a lot of work.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:18:33):\nThat's my personal preference.\n\nLenny (00:18:35):\nOkay, cool. That makes sense.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:18:37):\nMy personal preference is if you think about there's descriptive names, the Internet Explorer, there's suggestive names like Chrome, then there's evocative names, which I would say Seesaw and Maven fit into there where they're like in between suggestive and evocative, and then there's empty vessel names or fanciful names. There's a spectrum. And when you do your brainstorm, we can talk about this in the process, you want to think across all of them, but you might have in your naming brief, we want a suggestive name, or we want a descriptive name. You might go into it with that. And so there's times and places for all of those names across the spectrum. My personal bias is I tend to like suggestive names.\n\nLenny (00:19:16):\nMakes sense. Okay, let's get into it. What should teams do when they're trying to name something?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:19:22):\nYeah. So the first thing is to do your product positioning. I really believe that positioning dictates so much of your marketing and should always be the first thing you do. I had a student in my last class that I taught through Maven. I teach a class on brand strategy and he was I think a second or third time founder, who had never taken a class on brand strategy. He worked really hard. He was awesome. Anyway, at the end of the class and you kind of do this closing thing. And he goes, I'll never write a line of code without doing positioning first. And that was music to my ears. I think positioning comes first, but in any case, you do that first, and we'll talk about that in a little bit. And then you write a naming brief and it's really simple.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:20:07):\nWhat are you naming? Are you naming a company? Are you naming the product? Are you naming both? Usually if you're early stage company, you're naming both and they're going to have one name because you don't want people to have to remember two things. What do you want the name to communicate? So in that example of Seesaw, we wanted it to communicate young childhood. In the example of Eero, we wanted it to communicate design, being designed forward. It can be whatever you want it to communicate. What do you want to avoid? We don't want it to sound like this competitor, or we hate this word or whatever you want to avoid. What are the names of competitive and related products? And then are there other considerations? I worked with another First Round company that was operating in China.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:20:53):\nAnd one of the considerations was this has to be pronounceable for a native Chinese speaker. That's a very valid, additional consideration. And then there are seven criteria for names that always apply in my opinion. And you could add additional ones, like that Chinese speaking one would be an additional one. The seven are trademark, which is kind of obvious, can you use this? Are you violating someone else's trademark? And the second step with trademark is, do you need to proactively protect the name? Domain availability, so everyone gets hung up on getting a.com like maven.com got maven.com. It was an arduous process that Gogan wrote about on Twitter. But these days, you don't necessarily need the.com. Square operated on SquareUp for very, very long time. Lots of companies are operating on variants of a .com. So domain availability, distinctiveness. Is it memorable?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:21:51):\nIs it sound like someone else's name? That's I think one of the most important ones, just is it different and distinctive? Is it timeless? So there's a lot of naming trends. If you tell me Optimizely I could tell you what year was the company formed when it ends in LY. If you tell me a word like Flicker, I can tell you what year it was, because that was the naming trend to remove vowels. So I generally stay away from naming trends, because I want your company named not to sound dated in 10 or 20 years. The last one is it's kind of related to that. What we talked about in the brief, what do you want the name to communicate? Which is the name reflective of your key messaging or does it somehow suggest an emotion or feeling that you're trying to convey, and then sound and ease of pronunciation.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:22:44):\nIs it fun to say, is it easy to say, how is it to spell? We almost named a First Round company a while ago Lattice which is now a different company that's doing quite well, but we didn't name it that because this was a company that was B2B sales was going to be their main channel. So they're going to be people on the phone being like, hey, I'm calling from Lattice and we went through this exercise and we're like lettuce? It's not so easy to say and spell. So we actually didn't name the company that and went with something else. But there's a company now doing quite well.\n\nLenny (00:23:16):\nYou think that was the right move?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:23:18):\nI don't know. I always say a good name is only going to help you, but a bad name won't hurt a good company. So I don't really feel-\n\nLenny (00:23:25):\nInteresting. Good to know. Yeah. Keep going.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:23:27):\nAnd then the last two are appearance. So there are some names that just lend themselves really nicely to visual design and they have to do with how tall the letters are and is their symmetry and if you give this to designer, making a logo just so awesome and cool and fun and then length. So a lot of people, they want to name like Square and Stripe and these one syllable names, but a two syllable or even a three syllable name can often be more memorable.\n\nLenny (00:23:57):\nlennysnewsletter.com. Shoot.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:24:00):\nYeah. Well, so you got the Lenny part with the two syllables is generally a nice sweet spot.\n\nLenny (00:24:07):\nSweet. Have you put out a template or anything that folks can find to do this? Or should they kind of listen here and take notes?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:24:15):\nYeah, there's an article on the First Round review called Positioning Your Startup is Vital, Here's How to Nail It and all those criteria and how to do naming is actually in that article.\n\nLenny (00:24:27):\nAwesome. We'll put that in our little show notes. And then as you go through this, is this a binary thing or you kind of rate each of these categories one to five?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:24:36):\nYeah. So the way I do it is I apply the criteria after we do the brainstorm. And then we do red, yellow, green on each of those criteria just to weed out ones that are not doing well on any of those. Got it. And then you add your own criteria. So the next steps the brainstorm. I'm going to go fast through this.\n\nLenny (00:24:55):\nYeah. I was going to ask you about the brainstorm. I'm excited to hear this.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:24:57):\nYeah. So the way that I run a naming process is I like to first do positioning and then I set up an hour with the founders and me and ideally a couple other people who are interested, but disinterested. So I'll bring a writer from the First Round team or the founder has a friend who's a linguist or the founder has a friend who speaks four languages. We like those kind of people to be in it if possible. And it's generally five to seven people in a brainstorm. And the idea is we spend one hour, I set it up beforehand and we try to come up with hundreds and hundreds of bad ideas and a couple decent ones that are worth exploring more. And the brainstorm is two parts. The first part is based on words in your positioning statement.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:25:40):\nSo we take all the meaningful words out of your positioning statement is the warmup and we run synonyms, antonyms, free associations, other languages, whatever we can do off of those words. And so if your words in your positioning statement are related to what that you do, which they very well should be, that's a great way to just come up with hundreds of words really quickly. And then the second step is a thematic brainstorm. So I pick between seven and 10 themes, you can think of them like Jeopardy themes. So it's like, I don't know, okay, so there was an-\n\nLenny (00:26:11):\nSource.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:26:11):\n... AI. Yeah. It was like an AI tool for strawberry picking and the themes would be the history of strawberry farming or botany 101, things that are related. You could do like last names of famous farmers, think about how did Tesla get their name? They probably did last names of people related to electricity, and that's such a great name, so thematic brainstorm. And then that's usually a little more fruitful. And we do the same thing, free association, all that.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:26:40):\nI spend some time afterwards on Wikipedia and the internet and actually finding words words. Also love the library, check out books sometimes and just read books on the topic and just write down the interesting words that come up. And anyway, so then I give them back a short list. The short list is around 10 to 25 concepts that are ideas that are worth looking at further. And from there narrow it down based on the criteria and the red, yellow, green, we come up with three to five, don't come up with one because you might not get it for trademark, and it's really sad when you get really attached to one and then you can't use it. So yeah, three to five top contenders. And then you go through trademark process domain and kind of go from there.\n\nLenny (00:27:23):\nThat was amazing. If you're doing a startup name versus a product, is the process any different or is it basically the same?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:27:29):\nNo, same. The only difference is if you have a lot of equity in your company name... Square is a good example. Square had a lot of equity. Google is a perfect example. A lot of equity in the company name, you often don't want to name your products something really creative and different because you actually want the equity in the master brand to come through. So if you think about Square's names, they have other ones, when they diverge from the Square brand like cash or when they want something new or Google, when they came out with Android and they wanted to diverge from the master brand. But think about all the products. Square Register, Square Stand, Square App, Google Maps, they're really boring and it's because the equity is in the company name and the product name can actually be boring and descriptive.\n\nLenny (00:28:20):\nThat makes sense. I want to come back to a point you made that a great name will help a startup and a bad name is not going to hurt you or I forget the word to use. I'd love to hear that because that's that's really interesting.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:28:33):\nYeah. So if your company has a great name and the name is remarkable, people will be like, oh, that's a great name, or it just makes sense. In the case of Seesaw like, that's a good name for that company. That good name is just going to help people talk about it. It's going to spread word of mouth. People are going to like to talk about the company. If you think about there's a lot of companies with bad names that we use all the time or even quite boring names that we now love. So if you think about Disney, Walt Disney's last name, it didn't mean anything, but over time that's such a good company and it got imbued with all this meaning and now it stands for magic and stands for so much, but it was just the dude's last name. So over time a word can come to mean something that is beyond what that actual word means.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:29:21):\nDisney means magic today. Volvo means safety. Those names are not good. If I just put it in a spreadsheet or one of those lists, no one would pick it. So that's kind of what I mean that the name is just part of the overall marketing or the overall brand and a bad name with a really great company with great company strategy, great marketing is going to be great over time. And a good name is just going to help you, but I don't think a bad name is going to kill a good company.\n\nLenny (00:29:51):\nSo interesting. So basically your goal is to help find a name that will help. Worst case, you're going to be okay if your product is awesome.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:29:59):\nI think so. Yeah. I mean it also takes a little of the pressure off to be honest. Everyone wants to find that perfect name. If you actually think about it, this happens a lot. You give someone a list of 10 names or 15 names and they're just cells in the spreadsheet these days, we're doing most of this virtually. You give people a name like that and it's like, you have to imagine what it could be. You think about Apple or Disney or Nike or Volvo, Lego, any of these brands, in a cell spreadsheet in plain Arial in 10 point, they're just okay, you have to grow them over time. You just hear about I think Phil Nate with Nike, when he was given that name as an option, he was like, that's okay. Yeah. I'll sleep on it. Such a great name.\n\nLenny (00:30:50):\nThis makes me think about my startup back in the day, it was called Local Mind, and we went through an exercise similar to this. Not nearly as in depth and well run, but I remember our designer was the person that helped us nail the name. He's just like, oh, I could do so much with this name. Let's just see where this one can go. Is that something you find?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:31:10):\nYeah. There's definitely been bad names. I helped a company rebrand recently that they had a bad name. It just looked dated. It didn't fit any of those. It wasn't distinctive. It wasn't timeless. It had one of those like naming trends. Those are not good. You want to avoid those, but if you come up with something that is pretty good and you can make up something beautiful out of it and it fits your company, it does some of the marketing work for you and people like to say it and ideally it's memorable and it has some emotion to it, go, go for it.\n\nLenny (00:31:39):\nAwesome. One last question about naming. What's a common mistake that people make going through this process coming up with a name?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:31:47):\nYeah, a really funny one is if you have a code name for your product or at First Round, a lot of the companies we invest in, they raise their seed round with one name. They may or may not be attached to it, but then they work with me and I'm like, yeah, your name's not that good, and here's why, we should probably change it or they say, we can't use this name. We found out we have a trademark conflict. I really believe in using a code name that's so ridiculous that you won't ever launch a product like that if you're just trying to incorporate and go really quick.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:32:18):\nSo for example, a lot of people, they need their name for their corporation. And so they are filing all the steps to creating a business and they just like pick something, but then they end up getting attached to it and then they want to actually launch under that name. And it's like, well, that's not so great and here's why I think you should change it. If you pick something so ridiculous that you would never launch, it's actually helpful because then you can go through a process and find a name that will do more of your work for you and you won't be attached to something crappy.\n\nLenny (00:32:50):\nSuch a good point an idea. And by the way, so if you're a First Round company, you get this naming service for free and all these other things we're going to talk about just to be clear.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:32:59):\nYes, that's right.\n\nLenny (00:33:00):\nOh my God. I could do a whole episode about how much I love First Round, but I will say I'm a huge fan. I think I've participated in every program that First Round offers. The First Round review is actually one of the first pieces of writing that kind of helped spur my now career. And so I'm really-\n\nArielle Jackson (00:33:15):\nI remember that article, was awesome.\n\nLenny (00:33:17):\nYeah. And I did two more after that. So much work, but yeah, that was a big deal. So I'm really appreciative to First Round. And we could talk about First Round a bit at the end, too.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:33:26):\nSure. Yeah. Everything we're talking about that you've asked me so far, I think that you're going to ask me about positioning and [inaudible 00:33:33] your marketing person, and all of that is stuff we offer to First Round company, we offer my services as part of the investment. There are times when we might get stuck and we have to bring in an outside person to help us with something, but for the most part, it's all included and you'd pay a lot of money... The naming firm I like the best when I get stuck, it's called A Hundred Monkeys. They're awesome. A long time ago, I used to be like, oh yeah, it's about $25,000. And I recently couldn't take on an outsider First Round project and referred it to them. It's $47,000 for a name.\n\nLenny (00:34:04):\nWow.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:34:05):\nSo yeah, it's gotten expensive, but if you have the means, it's nice to get some outside help.\n\nLenny (00:34:12):\n#valueadd. Okay. I want to transition to your brand development framework, which I read a bunch about. And I know you teach a course about this, which we could also chat a bit about, but first I'm curious, just practically, why is a brand useful? Why is it even something people should spend time investing in? Why does it matter?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:34:33):\nOkay. So a lot of founders may think that when we say your brand, we mean your logo and your font and your colors, and that is a visual expression of your brand, but it's not actually your brand, your brand is who people think you are. And so why is it important for people to think what you want them to think? That really comes down to people's understanding and particularly your target audience's understanding of what your company and your product is. And I don't really think there's anything else more important than that if I was building a company.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:35:08):\nSo your brand is who people think you are and developing a brand strategy is what do you want to be? What do you want people to think you are? And what are you going to do to help shape that perception? So when I work on a company, there's a lot of steps to this, but I kind of have this nice little process that's right sized for early stage startups. And I like to start with, why do you do what you do? Just having a really clear understanding of that. That's your purpose. The second part is your product positioning. So meaning how do you want people to understand your product and what role it plays in their lives? And then the last part is your personality, which is how do you show up in the world? What do you like? If your brand was a person, would I want to hang out with them? Would someone else want to hang out with them?\n\nLenny (00:36:02):\nWe're going to get into each of these three pieces, but before we get in there, as a founder, how do you know when you're done with your brand development? I know it's a never ending ongoing process, but at the end of a process, you figure out your purpose, positioning, and personality, and then there's logo and colors, when you think about just here's the brand package, what are all the little pieces of it? And then we'll dive into these three elements.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:36:30):\nI think what you said is right. You get those three components, your purpose, your positioning, your personality, you use that as an informant to your visual design and also to your tone of voice. So the way your copy sounds, the way you show up in written copy. A lot of companies have what they call like a style guide or a brand style guide and it really only covers logo, fonts, colors, like don't put our logo and blue, don't tilt it on an angle, here's what it looks like in white, here's what it looks like in black, here's the favicon, but they don't have that for here's who we are, here's 10 lines that could be ad copy for us, here is why we do what we do.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:37:14):\nThis is the personality of our brand. Here are five attributes. We are playful, but not silly. We can talk about that a little bit more. But I think all of that belongs in the style guide, not just logo, font colors, which is really just a visual articulation that feeds into your brand. I'm a big Volvo fan. I'm on my fourth Volvo right now. So I'm super brand loyal. And I always use them as an example, because if you can picture the Volvo logo in your head right now, it kind of looks like the male symbol, it's like a circle with an arrow coming off the side.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:37:48):\nThere's nothing about that logo that means all the things I like about Volvo, all the things that the Volvo brand has come to mean to me and they're colors, they're like black and white and a little blue. There's nothing more boring than their color palette. And so it's not the logo and the font and the colors of Volvo that has made them mean... They literally own the word safety in cars right now. It's other stuff. And if you looked at their style guide actually, looked at their style guide recently and it's just like, here's our black and our white and our blue and here's our tertiary colors and here's our logo. It would not help you understand Volvo as a brand.\n\nLenny (00:38:29):\nI'm guessing some of that happened because they've evolved over the years and it's probably a very different initial brand. So it kind of tells me that it's more important to have a logo and a brand that can kind of represent many things that isn't so stuck in a certain positioning, maybe. Does that resonate at all?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:38:44):\nYeah. Their logo has to do with a very early history. I researched this because I was a nerd out on this stuff. They had some early history as a ball bearings company. And so I guess that logo had some meaning then, but it wasn't so descriptive to being a ball bearing company that they were able to keep it as they evolved into a car company.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:39:05):\nBut if you look at their early writing, it's so cool. It's so cool. Long, long time ago they would talk about cars are driven by humans. And our job as a car manufacturer is to protect the humans who drive the cars. That was fundamental formation of the company. So they really knew why they existed. And then they did stuff in I think it was the 1950s when everyone just wore lap bands in the car and they came out with the three point safety harness and instead of patenting it and licensing it, they gave that away for free for everyone because that would make all the world's cars safer and those kinds of company decisions. That's what made Volvo stand for safety. It's not the logo.\n\nLenny (00:39:48):\nVery interesting.\n\nLenny (00:39:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris, and Lex Fridman, and so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine, especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One with a small scoop that dissolves in water. You are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as a safety net for my nutrition in case I've missed something in my diet. Two, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they're on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on latest science research studies and internal testing that they do.\n\nLenny (00:40:39):\nAnd three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now, it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day. And that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. Make it easy. Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase. All you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:41:10):\nAgain, that's athletic greens.com/lenny to take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance.\n\nLenny (00:41:18):\nOne question on my mind before we get into these three elements, last question kind of setting context is if I'm a non founder or a PM, I'm just like, oh my God, a branding exercise is going to take months going to suck up all these resources. I don't know what it's going to do for us. What kind of timeframe do you recommend for early stage companies to go through kind of a branding exercise and go through something like this and maybe even later stage, what's reasonable?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:41:45):\nYeah. It depends on the stage of your company and how much you have already that you have to kind of... It's hard for people to scrap up what they already have. There's a lot of sunk cost fallacy type stuff going on. If you're starting from nothing, I think you can do this in three weeks. The naming process itself because of trademark and domains can take a little longer. When I name companies, it usually takes about a month just for naming, but the whole brand strategy process you could do, if you're a really early stage company in a matter of weeks.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:42:15):\nAnd I think whatever time it takes you actually is going to save you so much time down the road. It's going to help you save time on company decision making. It's going to help you save time, writing your website. Literally your web copy almost writes itself, if you get this all done right. So it's a small investment of time up front that actually saves you a lot of time down the road is how I would sell it to a skeptical PM.\n\nLenny (00:42:40):\nYou've sold it. That sounds very high ROI. Let's get into it.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:42:43):\nHigh ROI.\n\nLenny (00:42:43):\nSo purpose is the first piece. What is that? And then what are some examples of really good executions of purpose that you've seen?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:42:50):\nSure. So your purpose is why you do what you do. It makes people want to root for you. And it has a big role in aligning people to come want to work for you and to have employees all feel like they're part of something. I like to think of it as we exist to blank. And whatever that blank is your purpose. Do you want to hear about examples or do you want to hear about what makes a good purpose?\n\nLenny (00:43:14):\nBoth would be most excellent.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:43:16):\nSo a good purpose, it explains the change you want to see in the world irrespective of financial gain. So people often get hung up on mission and vision and values and all this stuff. And values are fine. They're internal. I'm not going to talk about those today, but I don't care about mission and vision. I just want one thing because people can only remember one thing and it's your purpose and it's why you do what you do. And when you articulate this really well, it helps you make company decisions, it exists on a 10 year frame. So everything we talk about with product positioning, it's pretty malleable. It exists on an 18 month frame if you're a early stage company, so it can evolve, whereas your purpose is pretty much going to stay the same for 10 years. It's that north star.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:44:03):\nAnd it helps align people in the company and it helps the public want you to win. I worked at Google right out of grad school and Google's purpose was to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. And I thought every company had a purpose that everyone at the company knew. I just thought that was my first real job. It turns out that's not true. And Google's actually been amazing at this. I had a person in my last cohort who had recently left Google when they were like, I don't know, 80 or a hundred thousand people. He said everyone still can say that. That's amazing. But I joined, it was like 1400 people. And by the time of your first day, you already knew that. It was part of your hiring process.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:44:51):\nIt was part of your onboarding. It was in your offer letter. It was everywhere. And I just thought that was really cool and a good purpose. One that is kind of related to financial gain, but I still think is cool is Stripe's, which is to increase the GDP of the internet. I think that's really well said and cool and just gets you thinking about the internet as a country. I don't know. If you're an internet person, it makes you want to root for them.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:45:21):\nNike's is awesome. I wrote Nike's down because I don't remember it, to bring inspiration and innovation to every athlete in the world. And if you have a body, you are an athlete. It's not just about LeBron it's about me and how was my Peloton ride this morning too? So those are some famous companies. I could tell you a little bit about some that I've worked on that I think are pretty cool that are companies you may not have heard of yet, just because sometimes we get hung up in like thinking Stripe and Nike and Google are awesome names because of all the meaning we have behind them. And I want to talk about some companies you may not have heard of because you can have a good purpose and not be Stripe and Nike and Google.\n\nLenny (00:46:07):\nYeah. That'd be awesome. And by the way, the purpose, should it be a sentence? Is that the general-\n\nArielle Jackson (00:46:08):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:46:08):\n... guideline. Great.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:46:09):\nSo you can introduce yourself at a conference. You're the keynote speaker at a conference and I want you to introduce yourself and I want you to go, hi, I'm Lenny, I'm the founder of the company X, and we exist to blah and say it and have that feel natural.\n\nLenny (00:46:21):\nAwesome.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:46:22):\nAnd it should make people want to hear what else you have to say. And the other thing it should be able to do is be the header for your about page. So meaning we exist to blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. But you would just take out the we exist and say the verb and start there. That could be the header for your about page. So one company I worked on, First Round company, they're called LogicLoop and it's an operations automation company.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:46:48):\nYou can think of it almost stuff like a no code, low code platform to automate a lot of the operations data based work that people have to do. And we did this whole brainstorm and I really liked their purpose. You can look at their about page. It will be right there it's to make operations data work harder than operations people. And if you ever have worked in operations or have friends who have, they work really, really hard and it can be kind of thankless. So it gets anyone in that field to root for you. Your data should be working harder than your operations people.\n\nLenny (00:47:21):\nDisclaimer, I'm an investor in LogicLoop, and I love that you worked with them.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:47:24):\nCool. Awesome. And then another one that I worked on of another First Round company, they're called Woolf. They're informed by the UC model where there's a bunch of individual schools that all exist by themselves, but they get something from being part of a larger organization. And what they do is they provide accreditation through being part of the larger Woolf University, but every individual college can still operate as their own independent college.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:47:52):\nAnd so their purpose is to increase access to world class higher education and ensure that it is globally recognized and transferable. So this idea of you should be able to take a class from the best instructor online and then go travel to Australia and take a class there and then go to China and take a class there and get the best education that the world can offer.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:48:15):\nAnother one that I worked on a while ago is Alt. I think they've recently gone through a little bit of like a rebranding, but theirs was to increase the transparency and liquidity of alternative assets. And in their case, the product positioning was really about making sports cards as easy to invest in as stocks. So the idea of alternative assets in this case are not private equity and hedge funds in real estate, but alternatives to alternatives, like sports cards and Pokemon cards and art.\n\nLenny (00:48:45):\nAwesome. Those are so many awesome examples. That's going to be useful for people to wrap their head around what a purpose might be. Execution wise, do you just kind of open up a Google doc and just start writing out ideas and brainstorm a little bit and just kind of keep refining with your team?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:48:58):\nI actually stole this exercise or borrowed it from [inaudible 00:49:03] that I actually think adds some structure to that. If you do it that way and it works for you, that's awesome. But if you want to go in and go through a process to get there, what I like to do is list all of the cultural tensions that are happening in the world that are relevant to your business first. And so for Alt, that would be things like there's an increase in interest in alternatives. People who are now in their 30s are nostalgic for things that happened in the '90s There is at the time really low interest rates and people are not getting any sort of edge off of investing in the things that their parents used to invest in. So those would be examples of cultural tensions. Cultural tensions are zeitgeist, their things that your audience might be thinking of.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:49:51):\nThey're things that they may be even subconscious to them, their current events. So you make a long list of all of those. Then you make a long list of all the ways that you might describe your brand's best self. And this is related to your product positioning, but let's say you haven't done yet, so just think of it as your brand's best self. How would we want someone to describe us? When everything works perfectly, and our product really delivers, what does it deliver? And again, bullets, just ways that you would talk about that. And then you pick one from each side, that's really the best articulation of what's happening in the world, what your product delivers, and with that context, now you're primed.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:50:30):\nWith that context in mind, now you do the brainstorm of, we exist to let me finish this sentence, and even before you get there, sometimes it's helpful to do the world would be a better place if. So for my company, the world would be a better place if, and finish that sentence and then go into the we exist to.\n\nLenny (00:50:49):\nWow. I'm so happy I asked that question. By the way, is there also a place we can point people to that want to do this exercise? Is there another First Round interview post, or I know you have a course on this too.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:50:59):\nYeah. There's another First Round review article it's called Three Moves Every Startup Founder Should Make, something like that\n\nLenny (00:51:07):\nGreat. I will find it and I'll add it.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:51:09):\nYeah. Okay. Awesome.\n\nLenny (00:51:10):\nAmazing. Okay. Let's move on to the next part, which is around positioning, which is a big deal. First, just what is positioning? And then I'd love to know just what tells you may have a positioning problem, that's something you should really focus on?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:51:23):\nOkay. So positioning is the space that you occupy in your target customer's mind and everything you can do to influence how they describe your product. You have a positioning problem if I ask 10 of your customers or 10 of your employees what the company does or what the product does. And I get multiple answers. And unfortunately that's the case for most companies. It's okay if the answers are tiny slight variance on the same thing, but I have actually done this with some later stage companies [inaudible 00:52:01] my first step is often I go in and I interview 10 people, and the 10 people are everyone from execs to people who talk to customers to a few customers. And when you get 10 people saying 10 wildly different things, you have a positioning problem. Other ways you might know that if you have a positioning problem is if you can't explain what you do to me in a sentence that's, you have a positioning problem.\n\nLenny (00:52:25):\nThat's a high bar.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:52:26):\nYeah, it is. And when I first started consulting, I would spend the first meeting with a founder, just totally cold. Hey, tell me about your company. And they would take 30 minutes to tell me about their company. And at the end of 30 minutes, I would pretty much get it, but it always took the first 30 minutes. So now when I engage with a new company, I have them fill out this little worksheet beforehand. And one of the questions is what do you do? And they have to write in a box that's kind of paragraph length.\n\nLenny (00:52:55):\nClever.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:52:56):\nAnd then I go in and I ask questions about that. And ultimately we get it to sentence length.\n\nLenny (00:53:00):\nAmazing. Okay. How do you go about figuring out your positioning? Big question.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:53:05):\nYeah. So I start with your audience. Who's this for? And we really think about what's the broadest set of customers or users that you might have and narrow in from there to a target audience, which is who are you outwardly going to try to acquire for the next 18 months?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:53:25):\nYou can think of it like concentric circles. The biggest circle is your TAM. As you get smaller, there's five parts to it. So the biggest circle is circle one, circle two, circle three, circle four is your target audience. All of the circles have to be contained within the bigger circle. And then the dot in the middle is your model persona. So this is actually like a person with a name and an age and a location and a job and feelings and priorities and interests and all of that.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:53:54):\nAnd so we talk about the model user and the target audience, the target audience again is who will you outwardly try to acquire for the next 18 months? If you're an early stage company, it's very possible that you're going to acquire people outside of that circle, in the next circle or even the bigger circle, but they're not who you're actively going out to try to acquire.\n\nLenny (00:54:15):\nCan I ask you a couple questions on the person?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:54:17):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:54:18):\nI'm doing some writing and research into this stuff. How specific do you suggest people get with this person right at the middle? I love that it's an actual person, I guess not a real person, but a very descriptive [crosstalk 00:54:29]\n\nArielle Jackson (00:54:29):\nCan be a real person or an amalgamation of not real people. So with the target audience, I like to think of it as something you could name. So with Eero, it was tech savvy dads. It's a category of people. And then the model persona, or that individual user who represents a tech savvy dad for them was this guy who had teenage kids lived in suburban St. Louis, had a 2,800 Square foot house that was made of brick, worked at home on Fridays. His kids were into gaming. He was the VP of sales at a company that was tech adjacent, but not tech. He was more of like a tech enthusiast than an actual software engineer. We knew a lot about him. I could tell you a lot about him. It's kind of robust, but tech savvy dads was the way to represent him and other people like him, that would be their target audience.\n\nLenny (00:55:22):\nA lot of founders have trouble recognizing that going very focused and niche is a good idea versus man, I'm just going to have these 10 people in the world that really want what I want. What have you found to be the reason it's very powerful and important to start really focused?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:55:37):\nYeah. So when you are an early stage company, the worst thing you can do is try to be everything to everyone because you don't have enough runway. You just don't have enough of anything to do that successfully. The best thing you can do is find an audience that is big enough, that if you got your significant market share among that audience, you'd be a giant business. And tech savvy dads is a pretty big audience. Also that's just who your outbound going to try to acquire for the next 18 months. I'm a tech savvy mom. I live with a tech savvy dad. I have an Eero system. It doesn't mean everyone you'll ever acquire must be in that audience, it means that is who we're focused on acquiring.\n\nLenny (00:56:24):\nAwesome. I took us off course around the positioning process. I think we kind of went off course with concentric circles model. So I'll give it back to you to keep going.\n\nArielle Jackson (00:56:36):\nYeah. Okay. So the way that I like to run positioning exercise is to start with who is this for? And then what is the problem that they have? There's some problem usually that these people have, they may not even be aware it's a problem, or they may not be experiencing the problem as particularly troubling, but there's something going on for these people. And then how do they address that problem today? So they do something, they're buying something, they're have a workaround, they're doing something today. And that something might not be another startup or your direct competitor. It might be the old way of doing things, but they're doing something. So we go through who is it for? What's their problem? How do they address it? And then what do you make?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:57:20):\nHow does it work? And what would you want a user of your product or service to tell another? And that's kind of if you answer all of those questions, it ultimately leads into this classic four statement, which is not something I invented, it's something that's been around for 40 or 50 years. And I learned it when I was 22. And I think it's one of the most powerful tools in marketing. It can feel like mad libs if you just approach it cold. But if you've gone through that work of defining who is it and what's their problem, all it is a distillation of that. So that statement is for target audience who there's a statement of need or opportunity. And then you say our product name is a category that has a benefit, unlike the old thing they were doing, our product works this other way.\n\nLenny (00:58:10):\nAwesome. And we'll link to the post that actually has that so people don't have to write this all down. That last piece you mentioned, I hadn't heard before, the idea of what will they tell other people or how will they describe it to other people? Is that right?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:58:22):\nYeah. So I believe that great benefits if you've defined your benefit really, really well will actually be the thing that will be the H1 on your homepage and will be the thing that you want someone to tell someone else. Think about Square Stand and turn your iPad into a point of sale. Turn your iPad into a point of sale. Yeah. If I went to a small business owner and they were having drinks with a friend, who's also a small business owner, what would I want them to say about the Square Stand? Oh yeah. I just got the Square Stand. It's this really cool new register that turns my iPad into a point of sale. That's pretty much exactly what I want them to say. And so if you can write that line, that is your ideal benefit, what you want people to say, and it's something that your target audience would actually say, that's great.\n\nLenny (00:59:12):\nInteresting. I love that. That makes a lot of sense. For people trying to go through this exercise, you always have such a good answers to how actually the process of coming up with say you're positioning this case, is it again, you pull up a doc and start writing things or is there something even more structured?\n\nArielle Jackson (00:59:28):\nYeah. There's something more structured. I have kind of a worksheet that goes through all those things we just talked about. So it's like, who is it for? What are they doing today? All those questions we just talked about, it's more like a structured brainstorm. There's an exercise I really love that I've called the bar test that is helping you get everything you've written into human language because one of the really big pitfalls I see, especially for B2B companies, but really for everyone is they write in a way that people don't talk. So the document, when I get the first draft back from founders often has things like leverages and empowers and nobody talks like that. And so getting this into turns your iPad into a point of sale blankets your home in fast, reliable wifi, records your screen and cam at the same time, really basic stuff that it describes your product in a way that someone would actually say that's the type of language that I think people want to use.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:00:28):\nFirst of all, you defined your target. Now you pretend to be someone in your target, having drinks with someone else in your target at a bar and you have to be able to say, hey, I just started using product name. It's this really great category, that benefit. And the other person goes, hm, tell me more or that's cool, what do you mean? Or some other similar prompts. And then you have to say your differentiator. You actually have to say it out loud. And if you run through that test and it's actually stuff people would say out loud, then you've done a pretty good job and you can start using that copy publicly.\n\nLenny (01:01:07):\nThat is very cool. I have not heard this bar test before and I like that it might happen at an actual bar. Is that also something people can find online or is that they write it down right now?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:01:18):\nOoh, I don't know if that's online.\n\nLenny (01:01:20):\nOkay, cool. This is it. Exclusive.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:01:22):\nYeah, that's in my course, and we talk a lot about that and we go through the exercise like a real role play in the course, but yeah, take some notes.\n\nLenny (01:01:31):\nI like that a lot.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:01:33):\nThanks.\n\nLenny (01:01:33):\nYour point reminded me of an email I just pulled up that I got from ADP, your point about just you want to make sure you're branding is something that feels like something you would say to a person. So it's like ADP, which is a security service for fire, like alarms. I got this email, summer's on with fun or our free secure app and more. And then it's like make summer safer and more fun at home or away. ADP, you're not going to make it more fun. What are you talking about?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:02:01):\nSee, that's an example of trying too hard. They tried too hard to make it sound colloquial and fun. They're a security system, it should be more like secure your home while you're away. Feel safe when you're on your summer trip. Stuff like that.\n\nLenny (01:02:16):\nThey even included a gif of this TikTok'er being like ADP is my MVP.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:02:21):\nYeah. This kind of relates to brand personality where the brand personality for ADP, I don't know, it's pretty not fun. And so for them, when they put on fun hat, it seems awkward and forced.\n\nLenny (01:02:36):\nThat's exactly the feeling I got. And so, yeah, personality, that's our next topic. It's not something I you think about when you think about brand and marketing and plans and so I'm really curious to hear why I think that's important then how to figure out your own personality for your brand.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:02:51):\nSo I think personality is one of those inputs that will help define your visual design and it will definitely help define your written copy. And it really comes from this idea of brands are like people. And if you start thinking of your brand more like a person, it's quite obvious that it needs a personality, because all people have personalities. And these days, especially when brands show up in places where people show up, like TikTok and Instagram, your brand certainly needs a personality or else you end up like ADP trying to be fun for the summer, which just feels really off and weird. So personality is one of those things that it's actually the easiest part. I think it's the fastest part. It often ends up an hour and you can get it done. But I have some frameworks I like to use that really just get at are you Mountain Dew or are you Rolex or are you somewhere in between?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:03:46):\nAnd when you think about brands that have a lot of equity, they really do have a personality. I often talk about Mountain Dew marketing as that marketing that's like trying really hard to be cool and rugged and edgy and fast and kind of teen and Rolex, it's very like Gray Poupon, oh, roll down your window and do you have any Gray Poupon, it's fancy and sophisticated and a little bit aspirational and maybe even a little British. And those two things are really, really, really different. And there's a lot in the middle and not everyone's going to be a Mountain Dew or Rolex, but where are you? And so you can just write it down. I think a lot of these answers come back to like, if you are good with just opening a blank Google doc and like writing down who you are by all means, go for it.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:04:35):\nAnd if that feels daunting and hard for you, use a framework. And the framework that I like to use has two parts. The first part is based on some academic research by Jennifer Aker and it basically analyzed the top brands in the world and figured out that all brands can be segmented into five dimensions of brand personality. And that really strong brand spike in two of the five. So the five dimensions that she found were sincerity, so this is like, is it down to earth and honest, excitement, it's spirited, this is a Mountain Dew thing, competence, reliable and intelligent, sophisticated, sophistication, which is a charming and upper class and rugged outdoorsy and tough. So sincerity, excitement, competence, sophistication, and ruggedness. And going back to those two brands we just discussed Mountain Dew is rugged and exciting, Rolex is sophisticated and competent and you can do this with any brand who admire or just think about brands you like and kind of deduce them to their two of those five.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:05:39):\nSo that's the first step. Which two of those five are you going to spike in? And it turns out a lot of tech companies end up spiking in sincerity and competence just usually does happen that way. Amazon is sincere and competent. Google is sincere and competent. Apple is not, Apple has a little more of that sophistication to it. But in any case, if you just did that, we would end in a world where everyone's sincere and competent or maybe sophisticated and competent. It's like a really boring world. So the next step after you do that is to define five attributes, five brand personalities, thinking about those two dimensions. I like to think about this as a star, five point star and brands need tension to be interesting. So if you tell me we're helpful, we're nice, we're approachable, we're competent, and we're reliable.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:06:37):\nYou basically haven't told me anything because you just use three words to say one thing and two words to say another thing. Whereas if you tell me, oh, well we're really savvy, but we're also really approachable. That's kind of cool. Because people who are expert are always approachable. They have to have a little tension and then you want to write them as statements that say we are X, but not Y, where Y is taking X too far. So in the example Google is playful but not silly, so they would say we are playful, but not silly, or maybe Mountain Dew would say we are daring, but not stupid. So taking that attribute a little too far. And so yeah, then you end up with these five statements that are we are X, but not Y. And those are really useful in informing how you write and maybe even what your visual design would look like, and certainly what your illustration style photography style ad copy will be like.\n\nLenny (01:07:39):\nOnce you've gone through that exercise and in maybe the other two pieces, where do you put this? Is this just like in a doc that's like here's our brand overview, here's our personality, here's our positioning, here's our purpose. And then you refer back to that whenever you're designing and putting together strategies? Is that how it works?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:08:00):\nYeah, you could do it that way. That's definitely one way of doing it. That's a good start. I think that one other place where it shows up, like we talked about that visual style guide that everyone has, that they give to an agency or copywriter who's writing on their behalf. I think these should all be inputs into that doc that you end up sharing. I think it should go into any onboarding you do for new employees so that they understand who the company is. Any partners that you're marketing with, co-branding, all of that, it should really be think of it as your little brand Bible about who you are. And also it should be revisited when you're doing, let's say a new product or to make sure does this need to be updated or does this new product need to fit into who we are?\n\nLenny (01:08:40):\nWhat do you call this document/place?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:08:44):\nWhen I take all those three components and then add a bunch of other stuff, I call it a creative brief, which is the thing you would hand to an agency or a writer who's writing on your behalf. It would include some other things too, that we didn't talk about, like creative inspiration direction. So picking visual clips and written clips and all these things that you like and that you don't like, so you can show both positive examples and counter examples to the thing you're looking for.\n\nLenny (01:09:09):\nAwesome. Thank you for all of that. There's so much juice there. I think people are going to have to listen to this a couple times to get all the learnings. Before I let you go, there's two other areas I wanted to dive into. But I'll keep them brief because I know we're going long. One is about getting PR and just a question I wanted to ask you while I had you, founders and even bigger companies, they're always like, how do I get PR? How do I get press for my product, even though it's sometimes a waste of time. Do you have just any tactical advice for startups hoping to get some PR?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:09:43):\nYou mean initial coverage around a launch or ongoing?\n\nLenny (01:09:47):\nI'd say early on, yeah, before the launch.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:09:49):\nSure. So the first one is to get your story straight. So, so many times I have founders come to me and they're like, hey, we need help with this announcement. I'm like, cool. What's the announcement? And back to the 30 minutes until I understand what the company is, so if you can't describe it to me in a sentence, your reporter is certainly not going to understand in a sentence and they won't be able to describe it to their audience in a sentence. And so really getting your story straight, all the stuff we talked about specifically around product positioning is so key. Almost always when someone comes to me and says, I'm ready to announce, we go back to positioning first. Also make sure that your website is ready for the traffic you're going to drive to it, that you're not driving traffic to a name that you're going to later scrap.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:10:32):\nAre you really ready for this? So go back to all the other things we discussed first and then having realistic expectations about the outlets that will cover you and the time it will take to get them. So a lot of people will be like, I'm launching next week. And it's like, well, cool that you're doing that, but no reporters going to cover you next week. It just doesn't work like that anymore. Five years ago, eight years ago, founders could really dictate the date of a launch announcement, they could brief three to five outlets under embargo, which means like you all can't tell our secret news until we tell you at this time you can publish. And at that time, three of the five would all file a story and write, and it just doesn't work like that anymore. These days for early stage startups, we're almost always running the launch announcement as an exclusive, which means you give the news to a single outlet.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:11:19):\nAnd they're the only ones who get to write about it. You can obviously still do all your owned and operated stuff, your blog, your social, your investors, your friends and family, but they're the only like news outlet who gets to write about it. So having an expectation that this is probably going to be an exclusive, it's harder than ever to secure funding for a seed stage company and funding in and of itself is not that interesting anymore. There's so many bad companies getting funding. There's so many good companies getting funding too just more than ever. And the number of reporters and the number of outlets that are covering it is just less than it used to be. So really just thinking about like, well, who writes about this space? Do they write about company's at my stage?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:12:08):\nThat's another really big one is, hey, we want the New York Times. It's like, cool, no one's at the New York Times has ever covered a seed stage startup unless it's crazy for the last five years. Who do you think is going to write about you? But there are still outlets that do. The other one is don't do a straight funding announcement. A lot of founders raise money and they're like, cool, let's announce. It's like, no, we'll use that funding announcement as a news hook to tell a larger story and a larger story might be your products available. You have reference customers, you have momentum, you have some great partnership that you're announcing. There's something else going on, not just your funding and using your funding as part of that initial launch is great, but what else are you announcing?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:12:55):\nThe last thing is really about making what you do interesting and relevant so that it's not just interesting and relevant to you and the three other people who worked there at the time, but interesting to all the readers of whatever outlet you're trying to target. And so an example of that is I worked on this company, Vitable Health and the founder, Joseph, he created a product for hourly workers that their employer would buy and it costs like $50 per person per month. And what it does is it provides urgent care and primary care. So these hourly workers who make too much to qualify for Medicaid and too little to pay their health insurance premiums, and so primary and urgent care for hourly workers. And we tied it into this idea of the great resignation and small businesses not being able to hire hourly workers, which was like a big trend end of 2021, and the company operates in Philadelphia and Delaware, and we were actually able to get him the Sunday after Christmas, Philadelphia Inquirer story.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:13:57):\nBut it was all about making this daycare and this restaurant in Philadelphia into heroes because they offered this cool benefit to their hourly workers. And so the headline was perfect for them, but it wasn't like here's Vitable and here's what they announced and here's, it was like, hey, look at this cool new thing that local businesses are doing to attract hourly workers. And so think about your company in a way to make it interesting and relevant and don't sleep on local preps.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:14:23):\nIf you have a local business or a local story or local customers, this was a huge thing at Square. We turned all of our customers into heroes and went after local press. Most PR firms that service the tech community aren't experts in local press, but if you have a way to make some connections with some local press, they are the ones hungry for these stories more than the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal.\n\nLenny (01:14:50):\nWhat a good tip and most likely they're much more open to writing about you versus New York Times or Wall Street Journal. Cool. Okay. So I want to ask you one question about hiring marketing real quick and I'll keep it short just because I know we're going to run out of time. When should a startup hire a full-time marketing person in your experience?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:15:08):\nWhen you have a lot of problems that you're trying to solve that would be better solved by someone who knew what they're doing, or when you have a bunch of freelancers and agencies that are becoming too hard to manage by yourself.\n\nLenny (01:15:21):\nWhen do you find that usually ends up being... Is there kind of a heuristic-\n\nArielle Jackson (01:15:25):\nYeah. Ballpark, it kind of depends if you're a marketing driven business or a sales driven business. So if you're a sales driven business and you don't have a repeatable sales motion, it's not yet time to hire a marketer, get that repeatable sales motion, and marketing's job is to bring you more marketing qualified leads. So that's one, so that kind of depends. If you're a marketing driven business, it generally seems to me like it happens around 10 people, the founders doing most of this themselves, they're not doing the best job usually or they've hired agency here, a freelancer there to kind of cobble some stuff together. And they now realize like, okay, if I had a person who would be able to do all of this and manage these agencies and freelancers, this would be a lot better.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:16:13):\nIt also is do you have a one point in time project? Do you need to do positioning? Do you need a website? Do you need a name? Do you need to run a test of Google ads? Those things are all discreet when it becomes this is ongoing work that needs to happen over time. It's better to think about hiring a marketer and really what kind of marketer do you need? Do you need a product marketer, a performance marketer, a comms person, a creative person? Ideally everyone wants all of that. But I kind of like that idea of a T-shaped marketer who's really deep on one of those functions, but knows enough to be dangerous across all of them.\n\nLenny (01:16:48):\nI think we're going to need another episode just about that one topic. I have so many questions I want to ask, but I need to let you go. That'll be V2. Before we do that, we've gotten to the very exciting lightning round where I'm just going to ask you quick questions and you just give me a quick answer and we will knock through them all. Does that sound good?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:17:06):\nSounds great.\n\nLenny (01:17:07):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:17:09):\nIn marketing land, definitely the book called Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind. It's from 1980, it's still my favorite marketing book. Another recent marketing book is Alchemy by Rory Sutherland. It's like my favorite area of reading is behavioral science, psychology meets business. And that's in there. For fiction, I just read The Vanishing Half by Brit Bennett. It was awesome. I then read her other book called The Mothers, but I think The Vanishing Half's better.\n\nLenny (01:17:36):\nAwesome. I will check that out. What's a favorite podcast or even newsletter on marketing?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:17:41):\nI love Nick Sharma's weekly newsletter. He's a growth marketer. He started his career I think at [inaudible 01:17:48] water. So he does a lot of CPG type DTC. He has a great marketing newsletter that comes out every Sunday night. On podcasts, I love How I Built This. I know that's already really popular, but I love that one. It's not really marketing, but just general business. The First Round podcast in depth is pretty great. Lenny's podcast I've been listening to is awesome. And then my friend Jasmine from The Concept Bureau has a marketing podcast called Unseen, Unknown. And it's kind of about culture and branding and how these things and society and trends. It's not like straight marketing. It's kind of more of the culture and sociology that informs marketing.\n\nLenny (01:18:30):\nWow. That is a lot of good stuff. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've loved?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:18:35):\nThis is more embarrassing. How many movies have you seen in the last year? Just curious.\n\nLenny (01:18:41):\nMe? A lot, on streaming services. Way too many also, if that's where you're going or have you seen none?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:18:48):\nWell, I've seen maybe four and they're probably all on Disney+.\n\nLenny (01:18:53):\nYou're winning. That's excellent.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:18:56):\nI would say I really like some of those Disney Pixar movies, Luca, Encanto. Those are all really great. I mostly only watch movies with my kids, but I'm pretty excited. I had a celebrity crush on Anthony Bourdain and I'm excited to watch his new documentary if I ever get around to it. And TV shows I'm equally bad.\n\nLenny (01:19:16):\nOkay, great.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:19:16):\nAnd there's this little Netflix show called Old Enough. It's a Japanese show with subtitles about sending toddlers on errands in Japan. They like go by themselves. It's 10 minutes. They're awesome. My whole family watched them together. It's really cute.\n\nLenny (01:19:29):\nOld Enough. I'm going to check that out. Okay. Two more questions. Favorite interview question when hiring a marketing person?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:19:35):\nIt's probably tell me a project you're proud of. Tell me about a project you're proud of, is just really open-ended and get to hear a lot about a lot of things that way. And then maybe runner up is tell me about a campaign you recently come across that you were not involved with that you thought was cool.\n\nLenny (01:19:53):\nHmm. Love that. Okay. Final question. Who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:20:01):\nIn the marketing industry?\n\nLenny (01:20:02):\nIn the marketing industry? Yeah, sure.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:20:04):\nI guess old school thought leaders, David Ogilvy, Rory Sutherland, Seth Godin. New school thought leaders, we mentioned Nick Sharma. There's a woman named... I'm probably going to butcher her name, Anna Andjelic. She has a newsletter that I didn't mention before. It's called the Sociology of Business. That's really good. She's a CMO, chief brand officer type. She kind of turned around Banana Republic recently, which was cool. Emily Hayward from Red Antler. I also really like Ross. I don't know this guy, but Ross Simmons from Foundation, which is a content marketing agency. I'm not a content marketing expert, but he really is. And I think he puts out some good content.\n\nLenny (01:20:48):\nMan, these show notes are going to be a long list of great stuff. Arielle, thank you so much for being here. There's just so much jampacked knowledge. I don't know if people were prepared when they started listening to this and so congrats on making it through and I hope you're probably going to go back and listen again and again. And so again, Arielle, thank you so much for doing this. Two last questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or ask questions and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nArielle Jackson (01:21:14):\nSure I'm on Twitter and LinkedIn. Twitter, I'm hiimarielle. And if you're interested in this stuff, but feeling overwhelmed, I will plug my Maven course. I teach a course on startup brand strategy that covers everything we talked about in this hour, or this is more than an hour now and kind of with a little more hand holding and feedback. So it's a crash course on all this stuff. The four founders that takes two weeks and you go through all of this and that next cohort of that, I think we're on cohort four will be this fall. So you can apply for that course at maven.com/arielle/startupbrandstrategy.\n\nLenny (01:21:57):\nAmazing. And I guess that's how listeners can be useful to you.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:22:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:22:01):\nExcellent.\n\nArielle Jackson (01:22:01):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:22:02):\nAll right. Well great. All right, well thank you again, thank you again and [inaudible 01:22:07].\n\nArielle Jackson (01:22:07):\nThanks so much, Lenny. It was fun.\n\nLenny (01:22:09):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How 80,000 companies build with AI: Products as organisms and the death of org charts | Asha Sharma\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00):\nHe said that we're just starting to scratch the surface of what an agentic society actually looks like.\n\nAsha Sharma (00:04):\nWe're approaching this world in which the marginal cost of the good output is approaching zero. We're going to see exponential demand for productivity and outputs. The way that you scale to that is with agents. When all of that happens, the org chart starts to become the work chart. You just don't need as many layers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23):\nWe were chatting about this concept you have that we're moving from product as artifact to product as organism.\n\nAsha Sharma (00:29):\nBecause these models are so effective at this point, you want to start to tune them to certain types of outcomes. All of a sudden, these are these living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen. I think this is the new IP of every single company products that think and live and learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45):\nPlanning right now is just crazy. How does anyone plan a roadmap when there's just like, \"Okay, GPT-5 is out.\"\n\nAsha Sharma (00:50):\nWe think about it as what season are we in? Season one might've been prototyping of AI and then it was all around models and reasoning models, and now it's the advent of agents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03):\nToday, my guest is Asha Sharma. Asha is Chief Vice President of Product for Microsoft's AI platform where she oversees their AI infrastructure, foundation models and agent tool chains, while also leading applied engineering, responsible AI and growth for the core AI division. She was previously COO at Instacart and VPR product at Meta where she ran Messenger, Instagram Direct, Messenger Kids and Remote Presence. She also sits on the boards of the Home Depot and Coupang, and she's a second degree black belt in Taekwondo.\n\n(01:32):\nAsha has a really unique and rare role that allows her to see more than most anyone else in the world, where things are heading with AI and what works and doesn't work for companies that are building large-scale AI products. In our conversation, Asha shares a bunch of trends and predictions that she's seeing that I haven't heard anyone else talk about, why we're moving from a product as artifact to product as organism world, why GUIs are being replaced by code native interfaces, why post-training is the new pre-training, the coming age agentic society, what it takes to be a successful builder today and going forward, and also her single biggest leadership lesson that she learned from Satya who she works closely with.\n\n(02:09):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Asha, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nAsha Sharma (04:25):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:26):\nI want to start with something that we were chatting about before this that I've never heard about as a concept that I think is going to be really helpful for people to think about, which is this concept you have that we're moving from product as artifact to product as organism. Talk about what that means and what people need to understand here.\n\nAsha Sharma (04:45):\nIt's been a pretty interesting shift, especially over the last year or so because when I got to Microsoft, it was right after OpenAI and the large foundation models happened, and then immediately after there was this explosion of models, proprietary open frontier models that were pushing the frontier curve and so they were both more efficient and then we're starting to see domain level expertise in a bunch of them and then even more recently, models now can tool call and they can function call and they can take action, and I think that's just giving way to a new type of products that are starting to see some success.\n\n(05:26):\nAnd so all of a sudden products aren't just like these static artifacts that we start to ship that's not just like, \"Hey, come up with an idea or an insight. Go solve a problem, ship it into the world, maybe make it a little bit better and then have a dashboard.\" All of a sudden, the whole KPI is what is the metabolism of a product team to be able to ingest data and then digest the rewards model and then create some sort of outcome? Because these models are so effective at this point, you want to start tune them to certain types of outcomes, whether it's price or performance or quality. And so it's pretty exciting because all of a sudden these are these living organisms that just get better with the more interactions that happen and in many ways I think this is the new IP of every single company and it's a completely different way to build product and to even think about products that think and live and learn, which is kind of exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (06:21):\nSo when I hear this, what I'm thinking about is when I had Michael Truell in the podcast, the Cursor CEO, he talked a lot about how their big moat is the data that they capture from people using Cursor, accepting certain suggestions, not accepting other suggestions. Is that what you're talking about here? Just the proprietary data that companies gather from people using their product or is there something beyond that even?\n\nAsha Sharma (06:40):\nI think why we're seeing the rise of post-training happen is just that the models themselves are so powerful. As of this year, Nathan Lambert did this study that I thought was pretty interesting of all the top leader boards and it showed that once a model hits 30 billion parameters, the CapEx to actually train a model and put billions of tokens into a pre-run doesn't economically make sense and you can start to optimize on the loop. And so yeah, in many ways, I think using your own data is the best way to do that, but you can synthetically generate data.\n\n(07:16):\nYou have to come up with the rewards design, you have to actually roll it out, you have to A/B test it rigorously. You have to find the job to be done or the use case that it makes the most sense for. And then yes, that generates data that you can learn from. I haven't ever seen it be one loop for any product. I think it's multiple tracks running in parallel that are like assembly lines, if you will, and producing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (07:43):\nAnd so is this thesis that we're moving towards product as organism, is this basically for model companies or is this also true for, I don't know, SaaS businesses and tools and user tools?\n\nAsha Sharma (07:54):\nLook, I think that software as a primitive is changing and the artifact inside of it is a model alongside the software components itself. And so in many ways I think that software products will all be model forward products, if you will.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (08:12):\nThis reminds me what I just had Nick Turley on the podcast who we were talking about before we started recording head of ChatGPT and I was asking just like how much does ChatGPT change with GPT-5 coming out, and he's just like, \"It's the same thing, they're the same product. It's just the model tells us what to do in the product of ChatGPT.\"\n\n(08:32):\nAnd it makes me think about something else of just you would think why can't just GPT-5 build its own user interface just like as you use it, it just evolve. It's sort of what it's doing with Canvas and all these things, but that's another way I think about when you talk about this idea of product as organism is the product, the UX can shift based on how you're using it and evolve automatically without having product teams have to do anything.\n\nAsha Sharma (08:53):\nI 100% believe that's where the world is going, and then my experience should look and feel different than yours. That's been I've been in personalization, but now you can do it on the fly in the future. So I think that'll be a pretty fun world. I also think it will look different for agents and it will look different for power users and new users and all of those things too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:12):\nLet me zoom out a little bit and ask you this question. You work with a bunch of companies that are building AI products on your platform, other platforms. I imagine some just do an awesome job and are killing it, some are struggling. What do you find are common patterns across the companies that do really well and have a lot of success building really successful AI products and ones that don't?\n\nAsha Sharma (09:35):\nYeah, so I think there's things that are more broadly applying to the organization themselves and then there's things that are applying to the people who are building the AI products too. So more broadly, I think there's a pattern that's starting to emerge for successful companies. One is they are embracing AI and everybody becomes AI fluent.\n\n(09:58):\nSo I think everybody is using some sort of co-pilot or sort of AI in their day-to-day workflows like job one, so everyone's not afraid of it, understands how we can raise the ceiling and lower the floor for all sorts of skills and tasks. Number two, from there, they start to say, \"Okay, how can I take a process that already exists and apply AI to making it better?\" That might be something like customer support or taking fraud down from 15 days to cure to 10 days.\n\n(10:26):\nIn going through that entire loop of mapping out the process, applying AI to it, seeing some sort of impact, and then feeling the P&L or the intrinsic benefits that looks like. The third thing then is like, \"Okay, great. Now that you've seen impact, everybody is using it, how do you actually use it to inflect growth?\" And that can be something like improving the customer experience, so your LTV or retention improves. It could be co-creating a new set of concepts or categories.\n\n(10:56):\nIt could be going from agents that are embedded to agents that are embodied and then being able to take on exponential number of tasks. I think that where companies fail is that they're doing AI for AI's sake. They have a ton of projects that they're kicking off at the same time without a blueprint to understand how it actually worked and what their Stack looks like and they aren't treating it like a real investment, and so they don't have the measurement and the observability and the evals all set up.\n\n(11:24):\nIt's going to do that end to end. I think the tricky thing is for enterprises is the technology is changing. There's something like 70,000 enterprise tools in the AI space launched last year. It's really hard to know which one you should use for what outcome. And so you really need to bet on a platform or some app server type layer that allows you to swap things in and out and not really be beholden to anything, any one technology or any one tool because the reality is the whole thing is going to change.\n\n(11:54):\nI feel like you have to actually build for the slope instead of the snapshot of where you are. So that's kind of what I see at the enterprise level. I think the builders themselves are actually changing pretty fundamentally too. Every single advent change a technology has invented a changing set of roles like mainframes to PCs like the whole garage engineers, and then when we went from server to cloud and mobile, there was like SEO specialists and CDNs and growth VMs and UXR and front end, back end, and yada yada.\n\n(12:30):\nAnd now I think we're seeing this advent of the polymath and where I think that full stack builders are kind of having their renaissance where if you take an average organization, it takes probably 10 steps to launch a product. It could be security review, it could be spec, it could be user research, and there's what? Five plus functions, maybe six or seven. I'm being generous for a normal organization, and then you have six or seven layers. So all of a sudden, you have 500 different touch points that have to happen to get a product out and when there are 500 models available a week or 500 new technologies, that is insufficient.\n\n(13:15):\nAnd so I really believe in the concept of the full stack builder. You're seeing it with a bunch of the AI native companies that are coming up. I'm even seeing it in enterprises that have been around for 50 years starting to operate in that way. And I think that gives you velocity and throughput and then gives you the whole loop to start to actually metabolize and go through that much faster.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (13:35):\nThat's definitely a recurring theme in these conversations is just the Venn diagrams of PM engineering design or starting to converge and more and more of other disciplines within your role. So PM needs to level up on design or engineering.\n\nAsha Sharma (13:50):\nYeah, I completely agree. I think it's all about the loop, not the lane here. And so I think that whatever function you are, you have to be obsessed with trying to understand the efficiency or the cost of the product, the actual rewards or system design that you're going after, the actual UI, UX, how that actually manifests for agents or people. You have to start to get really good at that really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:21):\nI like this phrase that you just use, the loop and not the lane. Can you say more about that?\n\nAsha Sharma (14:21):\nOh, it's just going back to our previous discussion on the signals loop and products evolving and becoming these living organisms and not these artifacts. And if you think about getting really good at that loop, I think that is the product, that is the IP, that is the future of every organization and I think feedback becomes continuous and observability becomes the culture, and I think that functions start to blur in future workforces.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:49):\nTo make this even more real, is there an example of a product or a company that is a really good example of doing this well, living this kind of loop life?\n\nAsha Sharma (14:57):\nI think most companies that we're seeing in the space from an AI perspective are doing this. I can tell you about a couple that we are working on. Obviously in the coding space, you mentioned Cursor. GitHub has very similar features that we're using as an ensemble of models that have been fine-tuned across 30 different countries. All of the languages to actually then go iterate in a loop for next set of suggestions or code completions and things like that.\n\n(15:25):\nWe've got in AI product called Dragon that's for physicians and we saw a massive difference from when we used synthetic fine-tuning to when we annotated 600,000 patient-physician interactions by experts and actually fed that into the model and continuously optimized it to then produce. I think we were sitting between 30 and 60 character acceptance rate depending on the run to something like 83%. And so that required a small group of individuals, not a large organization that were able to actually iterate in this loop across functions and all of those lines dissolving.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:07):\nThat's super interesting. So what I'm hearing here is if you can gather data on how things are going and then spend a lot of time creating high-quality labeling to feed back into it, to fine-tune it is basically the big advantage is how you win in a lot of this stuff. Okay. Along these lines, something else that you told me that you've been noticing that I want to hear more about is the shift from GUIs and you reference this from GUIs to code-native interfaces. Talk about what that means, what that looks like and what this means for folks building product.\n\nAsha Sharma (16:38):\nI think it goes back to what does it mean to be a product maker in the future. I think that everybody's instinct is a GUI, but if you think back in history, databases went from the desktop down into SQL, I think cloud was all about consoles and now it's about Terraform. And so I think we're literally just seeing the same pattern that's played out in history, start to play out in AI and everything else in AI, it's like Moore's law and it's getting faster. And so I think that's just accelerating and if you think about a stream of text just connects better with LLMs.\n\n(17:14):\nAnd so I think that there's a bunch of trends that are working in the favor for the future of products being about composability and not the canvas. And I think that product makers really need to rewire their mindset around this because I think we spend an inordinate amount of time thinking about the UI of something rather than how something composes, how an agent's going to be able to read something. How do you actually get infinite scale? How does that collaboration start to work? And so I think it's just a new way of thinking even though it's long been a trend that's happened in these changes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (17:49):\nSo is the prediction here that it's terminals like Claude code sort of experiences or is it that it's agents that are taking or is it both? Is that what you're just sharing?\n\nAsha Sharma (18:02):\nYeah, look, if any of us knew, that would be amazing. I just think that the reason why terminals are great and it feels really great when you code is because of the way it can interact with an LLM with the text stream. And I think that both can be true that humans will continue to commit code and will find new ways to actually do that, whether it's in the IDE, whether it's in GitHub, Copilot, whether it's in some new development environment, and I think that we'll do that with agents and agents will do that with each other and we'll continue to evolve from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (18:36):\nWe had Bret Taylor in the podcast, founder of Sierra, and he had a similar prediction that all software companies are going to become agent companies and it's essentially what you're saying here is that your software will just be this thing that's running in the background and there's much less of a GUI. Do you think it still becomes this chat interface the way we're getting used to? Is that the primary interface with agents or is anything something else happening there?\n\nAsha Sharma (18:58):\nI think the conversation is a really powerful interface. I worked on messaging. I think it's great for lots of forms of communication, but it's not the only form of communication. We use email today to collaborate with each other. We use docs. Everybody uses Word and PowerPoint. There's a billion people living in places of artifacts that I think can become really important composable pieces of the picture and I think they should be. So I'm excited about that. I think that chat will be important, but certainly not sufficient.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (19:35):\nWhat's interesting is ChatGPT, the number one fastest growing product of all time, maybe the most important consequential product of all time is chat.\n\nAsha Sharma (19:44):\nYeah, it's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (19:45):\nIt works.\n\nAsha Sharma (19:46):\nI think the question we have to ask ourselves is will it only always be chat?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (19:49):\nYeah, yeah. The way Nick described it is we're in the MS-DOS era of ChatGPT, which is interesting. It's like the reverse of what you're saying, so it's like maybe if you start as that and then you have to move to GUI and then maybe it'll go back, but he said there's going to be a Windows version where it's much easier to understand what the hell is going on.\n\nAsha Sharma (20:07):\nYeah. Look, I think that it's smart. Every company should be bringing AI to where their users are and ChatGPT has all of their users using chat and it's a phenomenal product and we've got lots of people around the world that do work in many different ways and we should be thinking about how we use AI to enable that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:28):\nSo let's talk about agents. You spent a lot of time working with agents, building agents, helping companies build agents. Yeah. There's a really great quote that I love. You said that we're just starting to scratch the surface of what an agentic society actually looks like. I just love this idea of an agentic society. What does that actually look like in the future?\n\nAsha Sharma (20:47):\nOh gosh. It's funny you were telling me about your two-year-old and I have my son Ron just turned one and I can't even imagine life at two. I'm just like that is so far away and what will have been developed. Look, I think that in the future, work will look really different. I think that we're approaching this world in which the marginal cost of a good output is approaching zero. And I think when that happens, we're going to see exponential demand for productivity and outputs.\n\n(21:20):\nAnd I think that the way that you scale to that is with agents and it's agents that are embedded and their tools and their pieces of software. And I think there's going to be a ton of those far more than the software that we use today. And then I think there could be a set of embodied agents that are developed and we start to see that now, right? You can assign a pull request to Copilot. You can create a software development rep that's agentic that can do some of the lead generation and mining for you.\n\n(21:50):\nAnd so I think that when all of that happens, the work chart starts to become the work chart. I think that tasks and throughput become more important than they have been before. I also think that you just don't need as many layers. I think the whole organizational construct might start to look different in a few years, and so I'm pretty excited about it. I think meetings will still be meetings and there'll be weird, but I think that will be a bit better and I think there'll be lots of changes.\n\n(22:24):\nI think that for the average employee, my hope and my optimistic view is that they will be able to expand their skill set because now they have their own agents stack that they can bring with them to work just like you can bring your own device and you can start to have access to a set of skills that you never had before. And so if you think about the 20 million people that maybe sit in that space across America and they get 20% more skilled, it's pretty exponential for GDP, and so it's pretty fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:59):\nThis comment you made about the work chart becomes the org chart is such a profound concept because I don't know if this is what you meant, but what I'm imagining is you build these teams and here's your mission and goal and KPIs and it's humans and like, \"Oh cool, go do this first.\" And what I'm recognizing as you're talking is like, \"Okay, but if you have agents doing that, that is their prompt, go drive conversion.\" And then you have all these agents and that's the org. This is the conversion onboarding team and that's like a bunch of agents off doing their work. Is that what you mean?\n\nAsha Sharma (23:33):\nYeah, I think today we think in terms of, \"Hey, who reports to who in the org chart and who's responsible for these areas?\" And I think at the end of the day, when you have a set of capable agents and people are capable of more things, you're not going to start to think in hierarchy and communicating up or during start to figure out outward task base type of opportunities. I think that humans will always decide in organizations how AI is used and what we want to apply it to.\n\n(23:58):\nBut yeah, it's exciting when a new issue comes up or new tasks comes up, how do you actually automatically decide where to route it? Who's working on that task? How do you actually go work on it? How do you observe if they, it's doing the right thing, how do you fine-tune it if they're not, all of those things. So I think that I'm just speculating that there's a world in which that could be pretty exciting and I think that's great because we can just accomplish more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:25):\nYou touch on this point that reviewing the work is going to be increasingly important. If you have a thousand agents off doing work, it's just like holy moly, that's a lot to look at and make sure they're doing the right thing. How do you think that evolves? Just being able to scale your ability to review the work that's being done?\n\nAsha Sharma (24:40):\nYeah, I think that the same kind of loop that we talked about becomes increasingly important, like fine-tuning and self-healing observability, really good evals, all of that. The good news is that there are systems that manage this for billions of people today that already exists, and so I think that we don't have to reinvent the wheel. There's certainly going to be a bunch of new things to learn if that world ever plays out, but I think managing devices and policies and group access, all those things are solved problems, which is good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by Fin, the number one AI agent for customer service. If your customer support tickets are piling up, then you need Fin. Fin is the highest performing AI agent on the market with a 59% average resolution rate. Fin resolves even the most complex customer queries. No other AI agent performs better. In head head bake offs with competitors, Fin wins every time.\n\n(25:39):\nYes, switching to a new tool can be scary, but Fin works on any help desk with no migration needed, which means you don't have to overhaul your current system or deal with delays in service for your customers. And Fin is trusted by over 5,000 customer service leaders and top AI companies like Anthropic and Synthesia. And because Fin is powered by the Fin AI engine, which is a continuously improving system that allows you to analyze, train, test, and deploy with ease, Fin can continuously improve your results too.\n\n(26:07):\nSo if you're ready to transform your customer service and scale your support, give Fin a try for only 99 cents per resolution. Plus, Fin comes with a 90-day money back guarantee. Find out how Fin can work for your team at fin.ai/lenny, that's fin.ai/lenny. So a lot of this, it feels like it's in the future. I know a lot of this already happening, people are using agents in all these different ways. Is there any way you and your team have found a value in working with agents of some kind other than coding I imagine is a big part of it, but just anything there that's like, \"Wow, that's a big deal.\"\n\nAsha Sharma (26:40):\nAt this point, we have AI and agents and many of our workflows, one of my favorite ones, so right now are my engineering partners out. So I jump on the live site bridges when something goes down and as something as simple as you can automatically get a summary of everything that just happened because usually, there's 15 people talking, you don't actually know where the incident started, where it's going to end and everything and then all of a sudden I have that and I can figure out and ask questions and get updates. Awesome. I think that the entire DevOps areas is changing.\n\n(27:17):\nWe use use Spark to create prototypes so everybody on the team is expected to code, but sometimes just chatting in and talking in real words actually gets you to a prototype that's more interesting and more expressive and reflective of your creativity. So we use that. I think everybody's using AI to write. Everybody is using AI to find ways to have efficiencies and coming up with documentation and things like that, and so I think it's everywhere, which is cool. I think that we're just scratching the surface though for what's possible in terms of working with agents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:58):\nThat's how I always feel when people ask me how I use AI. It's just like everywhere. It's just in every little sprinkled in everything I do now. I don't even know how to describe it.\n\nAsha Sharma (28:06):\nYeah, it's hard to remember a world where it didn't really exist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (28:09):\nYeah, there's a product manager that I collab with, Peter Yang who talks about how he just, \"I don't even know how to do a strategy doc anymore without AI. How did people do this without having someone-\"\n\nAsha Sharma (28:20):\nDo you think there will be strategy docs in the future? That's going to be interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (28:25):\nI wrote this post once of which skills of a PM job will be most replaced by AI, and strategy is the one that people are the most have the biggest debate on. You could argue, I don't know, let's get into it briefly. You would think if some AI had all of the information you had about where the market is going, your metrics, your product today, it would be so good at developing a strategy for you. Many people think that's the one thing AI will be really not good at for a long time because that's where we need all this human judgment stuff. I don't know, do you have any thoughts?\n\nAsha Sharma (28:59):\nI think that some of the most consequential products in the world required a bunch of deterministic, logical sets of inputs and sparks of creativity and imagination and judgment and vision that could not be achieved without humans. Microsoft is the vision of a software factory and creating what Microsoft did wasn't inevitable. Instacart, there was web bands and web bands didn't work, but Instacart did work because of a different way of thinking about it.\n\n(29:40):\nThat came through and iteration and a bunch of things that you couldn't have learned unless you actually went through the process, the iPod, you go forward. So I think it's there. I think docs themselves for every idea, for every need will just start to fade into applications and different artifacts in the productivity suite, which is just a different way of working.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:06):\nYeah. Your original question, which I didn't quite answer, but I think is important. You're asking do we even need strategy docs? And I guess it's just somehow everyone needs to be aligned on the strategy, maybe it's not a doc.\n\nAsha Sharma (30:17):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:17):\nYeah, it could be some other artifact.\n\nAsha Sharma (30:20):\nIf you architect an organization the right way to keep up with AI, you need a different alignment mechanisms than traditional ways of actually work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:34):\nSo let me ask you actually about that. So planning right now is just crazy. How does anyone plan a roadmap when there's just like, \"Okay, GPT-5 is out.\" Okay, great. What works for you for setting actual a roadmap and a strategy for your team? How far out do you plan? How often do you have to rethink everything?\n\nAsha Sharma (30:49):\nI'll caveat this by saying everyone's just figuring it out and it's a lot harder to figure it out when you're a larger organization than when you're much smaller and you get to run something yourself and there's pros and cons to both. So here's what we do. The company historically, at least in our product teams had semesters that they planned against.\n\n(31:10):\nSo think of that as every six months there's a strategy to look back, look forward, all of those things. I think that's very valuable. I think the idea of six months though and really understanding what's changing out in front is truly challenging to have a overbaked situation. And so we think about it as what season are we in? And so a season which is very uncomfortable can be denoted by a set of secular changes that are happening in the industry or that are happening from customers.\n\n(31:40):\nAnd so you can think about season one might've been the prototyping of AI and the early GPT work and then it was all around models and reasoning models and now it's the advent of agents and so that can last a year, that can last six months, that can last three months. But grounding everybody on the ethos of what are the secular changes? What are the customer problems we need to solve? What does winning look like?\n\n(32:06):\nSo everybody has that shared sense. What is the north star metric is something that we do. The second thing that we do is that we have kind of loose quarterly OKR. So like, \"Okay, if we believe that, what do we need to do next quarter to actually put ourselves on a path to that?\" And then from there, teams are operating in squads and they're kind of setting out four to six week goals that they're trying to go after for problem areas to go ladder up to that and especially as the platform for the company and the platform for our Azure customers with AI, I'll say we go through lots of changes to that all the time and I think we have to just have an openness that that is the business that we're in.\n\n(32:47):\nI think the other thing is just we try to leave Slack in the system, not just for the unplanned, but for the slope. I think that we have to continuously be thinking about how we're going to disrupt the platform in our thinking and what we need to be investing in to make that possible. And so we try to do a little bit of both.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:06):\nThis is awesome. So what I'm hearing here is there's this concept of seasons and everyone's aligned, \"Okay, this is time for agents, this is what's happening right now. We're going to center around our strategy around agents.\" And then there's these loose quarterly OKRs. You plan for three months roughly and then you leave some Slack in the system for things to change.\n\nAsha Sharma (33:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:24):\nIs the current season agents, how would you describe what season we're in right now?\n\nAsha Sharma (33:27):\nYeah, it's agents. The rise of agents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:31):\nThe rise of agents. It sounds like a Terminator movie. Do you have a sense of what the next season might be? Is there any like, \"Oh, this might be coming next.\"\n\nAsha Sharma (33:39):\nGosh, I don't, but I think that, look, we have more than 15,000 agents that are deployed on our service today, at least at the Azure service. There's a bunch of other platforms in the company and I would just say that I think that we should really focus on making sure that we have all of the alignment, accountability, observability, evals to making those agents great.\n\n(34:11):\nI think that Manus breakthrough in the space was that they could do these tool calling loops and have agents do longer running tasks that really no other platform was able to do. I think stuff like that is critical. Memory is critical. There's still a bunch of building blocks that I think are leaving agents incomplete in the wild that I think we have to really sweat the details on before we move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:37):\nSo it's just like agents until the end of time until super intelligence and then we're just on beaches chilling.\n\nAsha Sharma (34:44):\nYes, agents until dank memes look. Yeah, I think the cool thing is something new could come in three months. Something new could come in 13 months. I think we have this conviction on a set of building blocks that we want to provide to enable these agents to endure and have high endurance and so that's what we're focused on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:07):\nWhen you said there's 15,000 agents, what does that mean? Is that 15,000 types of agents you can use or is it like that's how many processes are?\n\nAsha Sharma (35:13):\nNo, that's customers. 15,000 I think I should re-reference the numbers. 15,000 customers who have produced agents. I think the number of agents is actually millions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:24):\n15,000 customers that are building a specific kind of agent on your platform and they're running and the number of agents is in the millions just running in the cloud.\n\nAsha Sharma (35:32):\nYes. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:33):\nOkay. It's wild. Some crazy numbers here. Okay, so let me just go in a slightly different direction. You're in the center of the storm of a lot of AI, just seeing everything else going on. Is there something you wish you'd known before stepping into this role that you're just like, \"Okay, I see. I didn't expect this.\"\n\nAsha Sharma (35:52):\nWhen I first took the role, it was described as the belly of the beast and I had spent most of my career building products at the center of machine learning and applications or businesses and I think that to my surprise, a lot of the learnings have translated in terms of what makes a great platform is what makes a great product. And the thing for me is it's often in the invisible work or not the pixels that actually drives that.\n\n(36:26):\nSo for example, one of the first companies that I worked at was a company called Porch Group. I was employee seven and we knew we wanted to help people take care of their home and I think we invented so many features like the home report or a way to manage your home or house style inspiration where you could see all of the houses and it's map every single room. And the single most important thing that we could have done and did during my time there was create a matching platform that matched the 6 million professionals with the 1,300 service types with the 37,000 zip codes and all of the homeowners in North America to actually take care of their home, and that was just the game of inches and optimizing that engine in order to create higher quality leads essentially.\n\n(37:15):\nThat's what got us to the first $500 million valuation. That's eventually what we built on to actually have other vertical services and software platforms that IP of the company. Same with messaging. The number one learning that I had was look like WhatsApp didn't win because it had stickers or stories or dark mode. In fact, I don't even think it had all of those things when it won. It won on a few premises because one was the phone book, you knew that when you use WhatsApp, you could reach every single person because you had their phone number and those are the people that you care about when you're using messaging.\n\n(37:54):\nIt was the reliability and how fast it was. I could text my grandmother in India and know that she would get my text message all the time, and then it was the privacy. When you are sending 200 messages a day to the four people you care about most, you want to make sure no one else can read the messages and so the end-to-end encryption really mattered. And so it wasn't the hundreds of features, it was all in the infrastructure and the platform.\n\n(38:21):\nSame Instacart, there are so many loved features of Instacart, but at the end of the day, it's a billion items that updates 3,000 times every single minute to get homeowners their groceries from the store that they love. And so I think I wish I had known that because I think it would've curtailed my learning curve to say that it's not all the features for the platform that matters, it's the data residency.\n\n(38:46):\nSo the hospital in Germany that's fine-tuning the model can do so in confidence and the data isn't going to leave the region, it's the availability, it's the reliability. It's making sure you have the right selection of the tools that enterprises need and the right way to retrieve the knowledge and that's the platform that we've built but just didn't fully have that picture that those learnings would translate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:07):\nMm-hmm. That's really interesting. So what I'm hearing is people undervalue who just the simple bottom of the Maslow hierarchy of things that help you win in platforms, especially in messaging platforms including so it's like reliability, privacy, I don't know, availability.\n\nAsha Sharma (39:26):\nYeah, performance, reliability, privacy, safety, all of those things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:31):\nMm-hmm. Let me ask you a totally different question. When we were going to record this previously and you're like, \"Oh, I have a big meeting with Satya I got to do instead.\" And so we moved at a different time. Very few people get to work with Satya, he's quite a successful leader. What's something you've learned from him about? I don't know, leadership or product building?\n\nAsha Sharma (39:52):\nI've learned that optimism is a renewable resource. This company for 50 years has had every reason not to succeed and it has even as it's had early success in the AI era and challenges and other successes and the space is developing so quickly, I think that his ability to generate energy and to use his optimism to renew everybody's dedication to the mission is unbelievable and I think it's such an important part of the culture. Everybody talks about the growth mindset, that's real, huge part of the culture, but I think the ability to generate energy and clarity on what we need to go do and use optimism to renew the commitment every single day for every single person in an entirely competitive talent space is pretty amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (40:54):\nIs that something you think that is just innate to him or it's something that he's worked on to just generate this optimism on behalf of everyone?\n\nAsha Sharma (40:59):\nI have no idea. We should ask him, but I'm deeply impressed by it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (41:04):\nIt's interesting that a lot of this comes down to just vibes. There's just this vibe of imagine it's not him just the words he uses, it's just this energy that he exudes optimism and energy.\n\nAsha Sharma (41:16):\nThink about it. We all choose to someone who just said this to me and I thought it was great, \"We all choose to close the door on our kids every single day to go work on something.\" And so you have to work on something that is deeply moving to you and you have a deep belief that is going to make the world a better place and I think that's why it's vibes. I think you have to follow and have a sense of duty towards a mission that is bigger than yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (41:45):\nIt makes me think of a line that I've referenced a couple of times on this podcast that hits people really hard that the only people that'll remember you working late are your kids.\n\nAsha Sharma (41:54):\nOkay. I don't know where we're going with that, but that was like, now you're like, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:02):\nIt's too much. We've gone too far. Oh man. Okay. Well let ask you this. What's driving you?\n\nAsha Sharma (42:04):\nWe could have said our customers, we could have gone a different route on that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:09):\nThis is the real stuff. What's driving you? What's driving you? What's keeping you excited about the work that you're doing?\n\nAsha Sharma (42:17):\nWhat AI will help us do from a workforce perspective, what it will help us do from a healthcare perspective. My mom has cancer and I think a lot about how we might find a way to solve the form of cancer she has in my lifetime and I never thought that was possible three years ago. All of that's deeply profound and the thing that I personally think a lot about now that we know that we're living in this time working with such powerful technology is the effects of it and how I can best build a platform where people can make use of it.\n\n(42:52):\nSo the reason why I work at Microsoft is because the whole ethos of the company is how do I help people and businesses achieve more and more for me in the thing I think about at night outside of GPUs is I think about will my son have classmates in the future? And that's not because agents are going to replace them, it's because the fertility rates are declining. The average birth rate in the '90s when we were growing up was like three and now it's 2.3 and in 2050, it's estimated to be below replacement and I think that AI can have such a big effect on it and already is.\n\n(43:42):\nIt was just reading about a hospital in London that's able to improve pregnancy rates by using AI to match eggs and sperms and their cutting costs at the same time. You saw with the ChatGPT-5 launch yesterday. Such an amazing story about how ChatGPT is helping in healthcare. Stanford is one of our big customers with the platform that I build and they're working on using AI for tumor reviews and it's just like, it is these sets of things that will move humanity forward and expand our lifetime and give us the privilege to solve 100-year problems. And so that's why I'm excited and that's why I do what I do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:22):\nYeah, especially in your role where you're building the platform that enables all of this, I could see how impactful that could be. Asha, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or share or double down on of anything we've talked about before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAsha Sharma (44:39):\nWe touched on it a little bit, but I think that with the advent of agents and products that think and can act and reason, there's going to be this new wave around RL and I have a deep belief that that will become one of the most important product techniques of the next season or at least the next few seasons.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:00):\nAnd RL is reinforcement learning?\n\nAsha Sharma (45:02):\nYes. Yes, exactly. I believe we will see just as much money spent on post-training as we will on pre-training and in the future, more on post-training. We talked a little bit about Nathan Lambert's study where his review was that when a model hits 30 billion parameters, it makes more sense to fine-tune and optimize that 50% of developers according to surveys are now fine-tuning and we know fine-tuning is good, but if you actually go through the full loop, you can get better results.\n\n(45:30):\nSo I think there's a bunch there and I think there's a whole new set of infrastructure and platforms and companies that will be created that are all around this part of the stack. And so I think it's an exciting time to be in the platform space, but it's also an exciting time to be starting companies and be thinking about those problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:48):\nI want to make sure people truly understand what you're saying here because not everyone truly understands post-training, pre-training. What's the simplest way to understand the difference there and just why it's such a big deal that investment is moving to post-training?\n\nAsha Sharma (46:02):\nThe way that I think about it is to create a foundation model, it requires a tremendous amount of compute, a tremendous amount of science. Expertise as we're seeing which the cost for scientists or the average value is raising dramatically and I think an expertise that we've seen isn't everywhere in the world right now. And so it's just a big CapEx investment to do that.\n\n(46:33):\nWith this explosion of models that we talked about in the beginning, there's a lot of good models to choose from for different domains. And so I think that you just get more leverage economically, you get more leverage from a taste perspective of how you actually want to steer a model if you're actually doing reinforcement learning or some sort of fine-tuning to actually start to optimize what's off the shelf for some outcome like price, performance, quality.\n\n(46:58):\nIf you think about that, that's not crazy, right? Ranking is an age-old optimization problem where you don't want to just take what's off the shelf because there's amazing frameworks and UI and components that the world is react components that are out there. You still want to tailor the experience to a set of use cases or a set of people. I think it's just the same industrial logic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:22):\nSo in practice, what this means is there's a GPT-5 model. You're saying there's a lot of opportunity and a much more efficient way to spend money, which is take something like that and then train that on additional custom data that you have, whether it's data or just reinforcement learning, maybe even with humans to align it with what you wanted to achieve?\n\nAsha Sharma (47:41):\nYep, and it could be your own data, it could be data that you buy, it could be synthetic data, it could be something else, but I think that we're going to start to see more and more companies and organizations start to think about how do I adapt a model rather than how do I take something off the shelf as is or invest a bunch of money and building my own models.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (48:06):\nYeah, I forget. I know Cursor, when he was on the podcast, he shared that they have a bunch of models that support your experience with Cursor and over time, they're just going to have their own thing. I forget who it was, Windsor for one of those guys just uses their own model now, they don't just plug into Claude.\n\nAsha Sharma (48:22):\nI'm much more in the model system camp. I believe in model diversity. I think that in experience like Claude, like Sonnet 4 is awesome for a set of use cases versus GPT-5 is different for different use cases. I think that there's some tasks where you care about the latency of the model. You're cool with the thinking time or you want a quick retrieval and things like that. I think the beauty is there's a lot of models that can help you achieve that, and so I'm much more in the model system rather than one model to rule them all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (48:58):\nIs that the right term? I've also heard ensemble model, ensemble of models.\n\nAsha Sharma (49:01):\nI think about an ensemble of models as a set of multiple models that then you can fine-tune and deploy independently, but at this point, we're all making up different terminology to define things that we have deep beliefs on that have limited sets of data points because everything is moving so fast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (49:18):\nYeah. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\n\nAsha Sharma (49:23):\nI'm very excited for our lightning round and I'm turning down the lights\n\nLenny Rachitsky (49:27):\nAnd then it'll come back on I imagine in one second. Okay. First question, what are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nAsha Sharma (49:34):\nAt work? It's probably Thinking Machines, so it's all about treating the cause, not the symptoms. The prototypical example is if you want to solve traffic, you don't actually put up speed bumps or speed limits, you actually have to solve walkability and mobility and why people actually use cars. Outside of that, personally, the CMO of Instacart recommended to me Tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow and I read it last month and last year and the year before because I love it so much. It's like this beautiful story over 10 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:12):\nMm-hmm. What are some favorite recent movie or TV shows you really enjoyed?\n\nAsha Sharma (50:18):\nFormula One, saw it twice for all mankind. For all Mankind, I like season four. I don't know, I like playing alternative theories to how the space race might have looked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (50:32):\nDo you have a favorite product? That you recently discovered that you really love? Could be tech, could be gadgets, could be clothing.\n\nAsha Sharma (50:36):\nSo I just joined the board of the Home Depot and we're doing a little renovation project and so there's this new, well, new to me DEWALT power pack and they use pouch cells and so it's like 50% lighter, but with all the power and it's awesome for drills and things that I need to lift up with one hand that feel heavy. So I love that.\n\n(50:59):\nWe also are testing out this new brilliant, smart home kind of system. So it's four inches of high-res middleware that allows you to connect to everything and I've reached peak dissat with the explosion of all the technology required to actually use your home. So it just might be the middleware that sticks, but we'll see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (51:22):\nDid you say dissat? Is that short for dissatisfaction?\n\nAsha Sharma (51:26):\nYes. Sorry. I'm speaking in acronyms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (51:28):\nWhoa, I've never heard that dissat. I love that. By the way, I love that you're on the board of the Home Depot. What a different part of the spectrum of work.\n\nAsha Sharma (51:40):\nYeah, it's been awesome. The very first board meeting, the head of philanthropy has been at the company for decades and she said, \"Welcome to the greatest company on the planet.\" It's pretty special.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (51:52):\nThey're like, \"Microsoft.\" Is there something you've learned from working with them that you've brought to Microsoft?\n\nAsha Sharma (52:00):\nLook, it's new, it's this year, but I've long worked on products that had that impact. So when I was at Porch, it was pros. At Instacart, we had 600,000 shoppers and obviously, the Home Depot has associates. One of my favorite things about the company culturally is they have this inverted pyramid where instead of having executives at the top, the associates are at the top and the stores themselves are headquarters and then the traditional HQ is support.\n\n(52:35):\nAnd so it's so customer-centric and when I think about amazing execution and creating these durable long-term institutions and how culture and ideology and leadership is formed, I think about that and I think about at the end of the day, AI is going to have an impact on every single person and every single job. And it's amazing to just spend time with people outside of our bubble and really try and learn what their real pain and problems and how they think about AI and how they think about technology and what we need to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (53:09):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to? Sharing with friends or family?\n\nAsha Sharma (53:18):\nI used to use the minimize regret framework and it's great, and I've used that for a long time. I think that probably once I got into my adult years and started to have a family and things like that, my just worldview changed a little bit and it was all about maximizing option value and it just gave the things that I naturally cared about like family and health and trust and relationships.\n\n(53:51):\nIt was just a new level of value associated with those because all of a sudden, learning rest on the weekend can compound in the future or having good health can compound in the future. You don't have to trade that off of working extra hours or the importance of family and all of those things. And so I think that my worldview is when I'm 70, it's not about what do I look back on in my life and count the number of regrets, it's really about looking forward in the number of adventures I will still have because I have accumulated this wealth of skills and trust and people and family and impact and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (54:31):\nSpeaking of skills, the internet tells me that you're a second degree black belt in Taekwondo. Why? Oh gosh. Is this true? And then I have a question about it.\n\nAsha Sharma (54:44):\nThis is true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (54:45):\nOkay. That's incredible. Why is this embarrassing? That's an incredible thing.\n\nAsha Sharma (54:52):\nI am generally embarrassed anytime anything is discussed about me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (54:56):\nOkay, great. No problem. What's something that you learned from Taekwondo that has helped you with life or work?\n\nAsha Sharma (55:03):\nTaekwondo is more mental than it is physical. And so I think that's the same with all of our jobs and making product. I think it's like mental clarity, it's courage. It's the ambition to see things through and be unwavering. And so I think that's literally what it taught me outside of meditating, which probably took me the entire time to actually learn to meditate and clear my head. But yeah, I think it's awesome. I think everybody imagines flying psychics or running up a wall and you can do those things too, but the real value is the mental pursuit of it all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (55:47):\nAnd you can do those things too. Wow. Okay. I'm good. I got to get into this. Asha, this was awesome. Is there, oh, actually two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to maybe follow up on anything, if you want people to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAsha Sharma (56:02):\nYou can hit me up on LinkedIn or email or text. I think all of those are traceable. Look, how can you be helpful to me? I think we're all early in this journey and great platforms that are built on great use cases and built on great customers, and so if you have feedback, you have ideas, you have things want AI to be able to do to help you achieve more, I'd love to hear it. I think the thing about all of these changes is that all of these new products and use cases will be developed everywhere, and so I'm always just thinking about how can we be the platform to support that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:40):\nAmazing. Asha, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAsha Sharma (56:42):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (56:44):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The ultimate guide to Martech | Austin Hay (Reforge, Ramp, Runway)\n\n## Transcript\n\nAustin Hay (00:00:00):\nFrom 2010 to 2020, we had the golden years of deterministic matching where it was very easy to run an ad and understand with precision who installed the app. Maybe you didn't know their name, but you actually would know their IDFA and you could tie that to their PII. You can't do that anymore. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting, right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I am paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a per certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred.\n\nLenny (00:00:52):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview you world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hardwood experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Austin Hay. Austin is one of the smartest people in the world on the field of MarTech, aka Marketing Technology. He's advised companies like Notion, Airbnb, Walmart, Postmates, Robinhood, even Pete's Coffee and Mars on their MarTech strategy and tactics. He's currently head of marketing technology at Ramp. Before that, he was VP of business operations at Runway. Before that, he was VP of growth at mParticle and the fourth employee at the Unicorn Branch Metrics. He's also a teacher at Reforge on this very topic of MarTech. In our conversation, Austin explains what exactly is MarTech, how it fits into your growth organization when you need to hire a MarTech person and what to look for plus his favorite interview questions.\n\n(00:01:43):\nAlso, his favorite tools, frameworks, team structures, and emerging platforms that he's most excited about. This episode is for anyone who's responsible for growth and is curious about ways to optimize your approach and how marketing technology fits into that. Enjoy this episode with Austin Hay after a short word from our sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS.

Austin, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAustin Hay (00:04:03):\nLenny. Thank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:04):\nWe are going to get super nerdy today and we're going to dive deep into the very cool field of MarTech. How excited are you about us chatting about MarTech?\n\nAustin Hay (00:04:15):\nI'm so excited. Because it seems like you might be one of the first people in product and growth to talk about MarTech.\n\nLenny (00:04:21):\nWow, okay. That makes me even more excited. Yeah, it's something that I haven't fully understood and so I'm excited to dig real deep. So, let's start with just the basics. What exactly is MarTech and then what does someone who is in MarTech do?\n\nAustin Hay (00:04:35):\nSuch a good question. Because marketing technology is like this very amorphous, cross-functional discipline that lives at the crossroads of product and growth and engineering and marketing. It brings together processes and systems from a wide range of disciplines. And I think really the way to think about marketing technology is it's a product manager whose specific role and focus is the system or the third party or first party platform because marketing technology can mean a collection of third party tools, which is a lot of people think, but as a company scales and grows actually it could include a collection of first party homegrown solutions that you build yourself with or in addition to third party. So, I like to think about marketing technology more as one piece is people and process and the other is the system and the platform. And that probably sounds pretty familiar to what a lot of product people think about their world as, and that's how I define MarTech.\n\n(00:05:31):\nAnd then you asked this other question around what exactly the role of somebody in MarTech, and maybe we'll talk about this a little later, but it's such a function of the size and the stage of the company that you're at. At Airbnb, I would say Dmitri who you might've worked with was the MarTech guide. He managed a lot of our Airbnb's, the first and third party tools. Airbnb at that size was, I don't know, maybe 800 people or so. And so it makes sense to have a function with product and engineering resources. A small startup for example, when I was working with Siqi, we were just talking about this at Runway, there was no such thing as MarTech. There was me and Tanner and Siqi standing up tools and using them because you just have to use the tools to get the job done. And so I would say on the spectrum of what is MarTech, you really have to look at the size and the stages of the company and as you grow you start to see it become more refined or pronounced.\n\nLenny (00:06:17):\nSo, if someone listening to this that has done growth or has a growth PM may be like, oh, but this is sort of what I do. What is the difference between someone that just runs growth or has a growth team versus someone that's specifically a MarTech person?\n\nAustin Hay (00:06:30):\nAt some levels there's maybe no difference. There's a lot of startups I would say are 30 people or less where you have a growth team and your growth acquisition person is using a CDP to send data to their ad network to run their ads because that's part of their job and maybe they are the MarTech person. And actually you find a lot of people who consider themselves MarTech professionals now having started in growth or user acquisition roles because they had to just use tools in order to get their jobs done. But what I would say is as a company grows and scales, it moves from being a community or village driven aspect of your products to being something that's centrally owned. If you're a startup, again, like 30 to 40 people, everybody might chip in to manage your CDP or use Amplitude or build a first party solution on top of those.\n\n(00:07:16):\nIt's a mixture of first and third party tools and engineering and product and marketing all work together on it. That doesn't scale though. As you cross a hundred to 200 people, somebody has to be responsible for knowing how data flows through tools, how it's worked, what's the schema. And that's not even considering procurement and legal stuff. You have infinite liability if you don't manage your contracts well. And so usually around I would call it a hundred to 150 people is the critical mass where you can't just have a village approach to systems and tools much like in the IT org, if it was a village approach to SSO businesses would be in a lot of danger. That's where you typically start to see the question of, all right, we need a systems and tools person. We need somebody to manage these systems and manage that platform.\n\n(00:08:01):\nAnd there's a variety of ways it can go. I've seen it go just into pure product that's with a product operations org and a product ops person actually will manage a lot of third and first party tools. I've seen it go into the IT org, Walmart for example, at a really big scale. They had a MarProd function which was marketing products. It was product within the marketing function or product that was designed to serve marketing. And then of course you can have more traditional routes like you can have marketing technology as a single standalone unit or business technology as a standalone unit. Some of this depends too on whether the business is B2C versus B2B. Classically in a B2B business you see it in rev ops or some types of systems role because you have to serve not only users coming into your funnel, but then the businesses that you're serving afterwards.\n\n(00:08:46):\nThat's also where you typically see tools like Salesforce coming into play and more advanced CRMs. In a B2C business, your user funnel is actually really simple acquiring users and you're getting them into your product and then product is taking them over. There's no additional CRM, so usually your CDP is the source of truth and that's where you might actually see marketing technology fit in with growth a lot more. Just some examples like at Postmates, I worked for them for a long time as a consultant. Marketing technology was just part of growth. We had a director of growth even before that, Siqi Chen who's the CEO of runway, and I guess you were his first manager as I just learned, he was the first VP of growth and marketing technology was just part of growth and product owned that as a system.\n\n(00:09:30):\nAs a different example though, at Ramp we're big enough and we're a B2B company, but we have a B2C top of funnel where we try to acquire users and get them to fill out our application to get a credit card. We have a distinct revenue operations team that's broken into business technology and marketing technology. So, there's lots of flavors of how it can exist. I think that's kind of the interesting and fun part of Marketing Tech is that it's not just one single version of the world that you apply to many companies, there's like a million variations that I've seen and they all kind of look to solve the same problem.\n\nLenny (00:10:00):\nSo, to make it even more specific and really simple for people to think about what someone in MarTech does, essentially it's using technology and tools to drive growth. Is that a simple way of thinking about this one specific roles?\n\nAustin Hay (00:10:11):\nTotally. That's exactly right. And I have this adage I always say, which is tools are just meant to solve problems. And the problem set for marketing technologists and business technologists is you focus on the tools.\n\nLenny (00:10:24):\nAnd so when someone currently say listening doesn't have a MarTech person and they're thinking about, hey, is this a gap we have? What is that slice of work that a MarTech person would take if they currently have say a growth team or a growth PM that's leading growth and a growth team around them?\n\nAustin Hay (00:10:40):\nThis comes up all the time, by the way, I talk to businesses every year that have this problem of we have a growth team, we're growing pretty fast. We have a guy that we hired, usually an engineer who stood up all these tools for us. Or it could be gal too just to be clear, but this person has been here for two years and knows all of our systems really well, but now they're becoming overwhelmed. They don't have enough time. The systems are too complex. This is the flavor of story that I hear so often around startups who have hired a great growth person and managed tools and systems, but at some point they reach that point in time where it's no longer manageable by one person or even a set of people. And that slice of works looks like setting up new tools, building new tools on top of them because a lot of times you'll take a third party tool, call it like a segment or an amplitude, and you'll build tooling in your own stack behind it to power something much more advanced.\n\n(00:11:35):\nAnd everybody thinks that marketing technology is just the third party tools, but actually it's designing, architecting and building that stuff on top of your third party tools. That's how you actually have a lot of velocity is thinking about not just build versus buy. It's build and buy now. So, you buy the tool to get 90% of the way there and then you build the cool thing on top with the other 10%. And so that architecting decision usually falls on this person. The one really unsexy part of it, which I tend to love because it's really high leverage is the contract part. When you start out as a business, you sign any contract you want with a third party because you're just trying to get going. You have much bigger problems, product market fit, staying alive, runway. But at some point as you scale and you're starting to make money, now you start to care more about not just how much money you're making but how much money you're losing usually from contrasting SaaS tools.\n\n(00:12:24):\nAnd so that's where you start to have more scrutiny around what types of deals are we signing, what are the terms? Do we have liability exposure? What's it going to cost us if we actually scale? And it's great that we have this cool rate at 500 MTUs, what happens when we have a million MPUs? So, I worked at mParticle, which was a CDP provider for a long time and I was their VP of growth and part of their SaaS vendor strategy is like, how can we design these cost structures in a way so that at the company scales we make more money? That's just part of the business. And so if you have that mindset of, well, I'm looking out for the business not just now, but two 30 years in the future, that's where you can also have a lot of value from a systems or marketing technologist.\n\nLenny (00:13:05):\nMaybe a sign that you should start thinking about a MarTech person on a growth team is what I'm hearing is you're starting to accumulate all these different tools and maybe there's a sense that you could be a lot more efficient in connecting data and the backend infrastructure for how you think about growth and how you drive growth and measure growth.\n\nAustin Hay (00:13:24):\nYeah, efficiency and pain. I would say pain drives people more. It's like, hey, we can't do something because nobody knows this thing. We can't do something because we don't know the best way to set up these tools or to change these tools or we can't even move forward where a business plan because we're worried that changing our tools might have an impact. And usually this is related to email marketing tools and data tools, so like CDPs and folks like Braze interval and just because a lot of times your email is the thing driving recurring customers to come back to your product and use it. So, you can't actually sometimes make the changes you want without understanding how something was set up in the first place.\n\nLenny (00:14:03):\nYou talked about where this person would live in the organization. There's all these different places. I talked about revenue team, maybe the ops team, maybe growth team, marketing team. What's your general advice for who should lead the hiring of this role and also just roughly who should they report to?\n\nAustin Hay (00:14:21):\nSo, I have not to shamelessly plug my Reforge course in the fall, but I'm going to be shamelessly plug my Reforge course in the fall. We have this awesome matrix that we built that shows where this person should live, what they do, who they should report into, and it's all part of the fall course if you want like the deep dive into it. There's going to be a section on it, but just the gist of it is I first like to break it down into two dimensions. First is a B2C company or B2B company. And then the second dimension is how important is it to you that this person report into a specific function or not? So, first with B2C and really maybe a simpler version of that is centralized versus decentralized. So, we have B2C, B2B, centralized, decentralized. In a B2C organization I think actually thinks it's quite simple.\n\n(00:15:08):\nMost of the time your tools, your marketing tools are intended to help the growth team. The growth team has a job to be done, which is to spur user growth and tools are just meant to solve the problem. So, marketing technology's job is to serve the growth team. Now it obviously serves product and analytics and data, but its key stakeholder and customer is the marketing or growth function. And so I think it makes a lot of sense that if you're designing an org under a CMO or a marketing person, you put marketing technology alongside your head of growth or maybe reporting into your head of growth depending on the seniority of the person. And that works quite well. The key thing there is you just want to make sure that this marketing technology person is a really strong technical architect or some type of technical operator because they're going to be your representation to the product in engineering orgs.\n\n(00:15:53):\nNow, some people take a little bit of a slight twist on that. They say, hey, I have a product manager who manages growth that comes from the PM side. You could have a platform PM that serves the same thing in MarTech and they're responsible for all internal platform systems. And then you get into questions of does that belong in product ops or not? And I'm not going to go there. But for B2C, that's the centralized function. For B2C decentralized, what you do instead is you just say like, hey, we're going to have one of these systems, people in every org. Product is going to have a product ops person and growth is going to have a growth ops person, engineering will have engineering ops, and then we kind of divide the lines based on what tools they're managing. I generally don't see that working very well just because as you add more operational people, it just creates more systems.\n\n(00:16:39):\nAnd so unless you're a massive company where you need that type of scale, I think most startups should avoid that decentralized model. And then for B2B, I think B2B is really messy because not only do you have pure B2B where you're only selling to enterprises, but you have this concept of B2B2C, which is where you're actually selling to users and to businesses sometimes at the top of the funnel and the bottom, but also sometimes at the same time like notion. Notion sells to users so, they have a little growth acquisition funnel at the top, but then they also sell to businesses. And I find there's really, again, there's two ways decentralized or centralized actually at Ramp we've gone back and forth between the two models. We started centralized with the Rev ops group, we decentralized it and put marketing technology into the CMO org and now we're rolling it back into the revenue operations org Largely has to do with who is our customer?\n\n(00:17:28):\nWhose problems are we solving and where are resources allocated? Because if you have a decentralized model, then you run the risk of having to have lots of resources decentralized across the team. And the question is, can that function actually get work done or resources spread too thin and the priorities on align that it makes it challenging to get work done. And yeah, I would just say especially on B2B, for people out there listening, there is no right answer. And I even think that marketing technology could live in product, it could also live in engineering. Some of this has to do with who is the leader of this function. If it blends more towards ops, meaning managing processes and systems, then yeah, maybe you want to decentralize it and keep it in its representative function. If you have a really technical leader who was an architect or a PM that might indicate where that person should actually be leading their team. So, it's very case specific, which I know is a terrible answer, but it's the way it is.\n\nLenny (00:18:25):\nMakes total sense. If someone were to hire someone like in Austin, are you doing the work yourself? Are you an IC for quite a while or do you end up building a team, say engineers that are building some of this infrastructure, how does that usually play out?\n\nAustin Hay (00:18:38):\nI think all marketing technologists at some level are ICs. I think it's a great job personally, because I get to be an IC and a manager. You have to be an IC in that, you are the most senior technical expert on all first party and third party systems. So, you have to know really well how third party tools work and you don't know that without doing the work yourself. So, I do find that some of the best marketing technologists have at least at some point in the last five years, been an operator and expert managing tools and systems. And then usually the teams are small and super cross-functional.\n\n(00:19:10):\nSo, what I would say is more important to look for than how many people has this person managed is how well can they manage upward, laterally and downward because they're going to have to go talk to the head of rev ops if they want to change something in Salesforce, they're going to have to talk to the VP of product if they want to make a big platform change that touches something else. They're going to be relying constantly on data resources from their head of data. So, I think that this person, the secret sauce is more of how good of a cross-functional team player are they. I almost view them like a true quarterback every [inaudible 00:19:41] says people are quarterbacks. But really marketing technology because it lives between so many departments, it plays that role of having to call plays and pull on different departments.\n\nLenny (00:19:50):\nAnd because it sounds like you don't have a team to do some of these things and you need to convince people to help you out.\n\nAustin Hay (00:19:56):\nTotally. Yeah. It's a game of persuasion and salesmanship. You have to convince people why the problems are big and especially as you get bigger, a lot of the decisions or problems of marketing technology are not about rapidly making a huge transformation. It's slow transformation that can have big implications. I'll just give you one example. Like lots of big companies I talked to have two CDPs or two attribution tools and it's like there's the cost problem. How do we get rid of this secondary tool to reduce the cost? Maybe it's a million dollars, but there's also the complexity and decision-making problem. How do we make people move and work faster by not having the complexity of asking, which tool do I use in such a simple decision?\n\n(00:20:39):\nAnd then you get to a really big scale at Walmart where your problem isn't even. How do we consolidate the stack and make it so tools that are helpful for people, but how do we prevent from getting back to that state? How do we put safeguards in place to make sure people actually have access to the tools that they want and can solve their problems? But we're not introducing duplicative tech into our organization because a really well-known, sorry to put SaaS vendors on the spot here, but well-known SaaS vendor plays the land and expand motion. You get in small and then you grow your business. Well, that's a distinct problem for businesses that are trying to control costs and simplify the way the world works.\n\nLenny (00:21:15):\nI want to talk about tools that you recommend and use most often, but I'm thinking maybe we start with a different question, which is around just what does your day look like as a MarTech person? What are you doing day to day and from the lens of your growth PM listening or a leader listening and what could this person do for me and how much leverage can I get if I were to find a MarTech person?\n\nAustin Hay (00:21:37):\nThere's half of marketing technology, which I would call somewhat administrative and high leverage. It's managing PI requests and PI technology, managing administrative stuff like contracts and admittance to tools and permissions. This is all at a big company scale. You probably don't do this when you're a small company, but that stuff matters because give you an example, you give edit access to somebody who wants HubSpot and they send a fake email test to a million people and now you're on Twitter being embarrassed as a company. It's like-\n\nLenny (00:22:12):\nDoes that happen to you?\n\nAustin Hay (00:22:13):\nIt hasn't happen to me. But I've gotten the emails from certain companies where it's like, this is a test and it came from an intern.\n\nLenny (00:22:20):\nYeah, same.\n\nAustin Hay (00:22:20):\nYou're like, that's just permissioning gone wrong. So, I think a big part of the role is designing systems that are automated to handle that stuff because ideally you don't want to be sitting around in your computer all day clicking one conductor request to approve permissions. You should look at the role, look at the experience of tenure and department and make a decision about which accesses you get. So, automating that is a big part of my job. The manual part of my job, which I feel like is actually really fun, is again the designing systems and contracts for the future. So, it's about how do we design a system and create a vision and persuade people about what our system technology can look like over the course of one to two years, the time span that I usually look at. And then how do you change state from then to now? Some of that has to bring in financials and contracts. That's where this plays a role. What are our contract terms today? What's the price we're paying? What is our growth going to be?\n\n(00:23:12):\nCan we build a financial model to show how much it's going to cost us both in terms of operational efficiency and actual real fixed and variable costs to end up in that state? And then how do I create a graceful argument to persuade people that we should spend engineering time and resources? And usually it nets out pretty clear. It's like if it's less than a certain amount, how do you justify spending any engineering time on it? You have to wait for the problem to become big enough. But then back to your other point around how do I give growth managers out there something useful. I would say the big thing that people forget in an early stage of a company's lifetime is that the company will outlast you, hopefully. You will not be the last growth manager unless the company fails. So, I tend to take a little bit of a different approach than most, which is like I think you should always be thinking about the future.\n\n(00:24:02):\nThat doesn't necessarily mean you should make design choices that over index towards the future so much that you miss product market fit or you make poor product decisions. But when you set up tools and you pick tools and you implement them, you should be thinking, what's going to happen a year from now if I don't change anything? And is this going to be a catastrophic situation or not? And then try to take actions to mitigate that risk. Some examples are like if it's $2,000 to get SSO and two days to set it up and that prevents you from having a security problem where somebody downloads all your users, it seems like a great investment.\n\n(00:24:37):\nAnd guess what? Over time, if you don't do that, you're going to eventually have to hire an IT person to go and set up SSF for all your tools. So, some of this is more of just being a good steward about managing first and third party tools with an eye towards the future. It's always a trade-off, right? Because the more time you spend when you're building product early in a company's lifetime, that time could be spent on other things. So, if you waste it managing third party tools or setting up correctly, then maybe you miss out on a key product feature. So, I think it is a tough balance to strike.\n\nLenny (00:25:06):\nComing back to the different kind of roles within the growth umbrella, if someone has someone leading paid growth let's say, and they're just like a paid growth person, do you also find a MarTech person to work alongside this person? How connected would you be to someone that's just responsible for paid growth?\n\nAustin Hay (00:25:24):\nMaybe a key differentiator too. We didn't talk about this in the beginning, but there's marketing technology and marketing operations. So, in my mind, this is just my own kind of mental framework is marketing technology has tech in it. So, it's usually an engineer or somebody with an engineering background doing that function. Marketing operations is usually not always technical. Maybe a systems analyst or business analyst could be somebody really, really smart, but they may not have an engineering background. So, I think that's a key distinction too. And you typically see that in B2B where you'll have mar ops function, which is setting up campaigns, sending email blasts, debugging, doing analytics work, SQL queries, all semi-technical work but not engineering based. So, in my mind when we talk about marketing technology, I'm really thinking it as an engineering based role and even by background, I'm not a software engineer, but I was a civil engineer and I learned how to program and I went through a bunch of coding to get there.\n\n(00:26:21):\nSo, that's my way into the engineering world. And you typically find that a lot with marketing technologists in particular is they either are software engineers or they've gotten enough experience to moonlight as software engineers. And so we get to this problem set of a user acquisition person. How would they rely on a marketing technologist? Well, I think the most superhuman user acquisition people out there are engineers and they don't need a marketing technologist because they set up the tool themself. They know how the paid campaign runs and they just do it all. And you'll typically find these super humans at small startups where the engineer is just told by the co-founder, hey, go figure out how Facebook ads work. And superhuman is born. More often though that doesn't happen. Or those people once they do it once, they never want to do it again. So, you'll typically find the role split and that's the natural thing that happens.\n\n(00:27:13):\nAs you scale, you divide responsibility and you'll see you'll have the person who's responsible for bidding and acquiring users and paying down those campaign costs. Then you have the person who's in charge of how does it all work? How do we get this thing to actually run? And that's very similar to what we have at Ramp. We have an amazing user acquisition team. I know Sri Batchu was on here a while back. He hired a guy named Cody Morgan at Ramp who has a user acquisition team. And the way to think of it is, my job is to help support them in running all their campaign needs and when they have a directive from the CEO that says we need to improve CAC or change any of our metrics, it's my job to partner with them to help them do that. And actually one of the coolest and most fun projects that we worked on early when I joined Ramped is we were optimizing.\n\n(00:27:55):\nWe're trying to get top of funnel data all the way down to the bottom of the funnel and tie it with opportunity data so we could send that back to the ad network so that rather than optimizing your campaign off of when a user clicks a button on the website, you're actually optimizing it off of did the opportunity occur and what was the kind of ideal value for that opportunity? And you're sending that data as a synthetic event back to Facebook and all those guys. So, it can be really cool and super advanced stuff depending how deep on the funnel you get and how complex your business is.\n\nLenny (00:28:25):\nSo, you're generally not running campaigns of your own unsafe Facebook or AdWords. You're mostly as a MarTech person supporting people who are doing that.\n\nAustin Hay (00:28:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:28:35):\nAwesome.\n\nAustin Hay (00:28:35):\nHelping them use tools and technologies to do it.\n\nLenny (00:28:38):\nGreat. Do people give you goals? Are you responsible for growth goals of your own? And in general, are MarTech people, should they have goals and growth goals on their plate or are they just there to support people who do?\n\nAustin Hay (00:28:52):\nOh, that's a great question and I would like, maybe this is at the end of the podcast, we ask people about this because I would love to know what is a better version of goaling? So, there's two ways that I've thought of it. One is my goals are directly tied to the people I'm serving. So, if user acquisition has, I mean we do, we have a growth goal and we have a CAC goal at Ramp. So, my goals are tied to them, so I'm going to help make sure that that is achieved, but then there's also a cost and efficiency goal that I internally think is valuable. Whether or not the business thinks it is valuable, it doesn't really matter. I come from a sales background and I like to run lean and efficient teams, and so I'm always thinking to myself, how much were the tools when I came in, how much are they now?\n\n(00:29:34):\nHave I set us up for success so that as we grow, our cost per user or cost per seat comes down and how much more efficient are we because of that? The ideal world is that you actually are growing as a business making more money, hiring more people, acquiring more users, and your total cost of tooling per person goes down. That's like the dream. And there's lots of ways you can build that financial model, but I mean that's what I think most marketing technology leaders should strive for is to make sure that they're controlling costs over time because most businesses don't. There can be some goals that are discreet in nature that are not cost-efficient, but more like net capability related. So, it's like, hey, we want to design a first party system that's world-class that achieves these three goals, right? Maybe you want to incorporate artificial intelligence into some part of our product platform and incorporate third party tools.\n\n(00:30:25):\nAnd those are more like discrete product goals. In the same way that a business might launch an external product goal to launch a feature, they sometimes also might have internal product goals, clean up our revenue operations systems, make our email marketing system better. In particular, email marketing is one I see come often a lot with small businesses and even medium-sized businesses where they'll have picked a tool at the start of the company's lifecycle and as the company has grown, they've outgrown that tool. They need to move to a Braze or Marketo. And so there'll be a big six-month initiative to say, we just got to switch. That's the goal. We have to safely get off this small tool to a much bigger, more complex tool that's going to cost us more. It's a lot more complex, but we need to do it without losing money. That's usually the job of a MarTech person in some type of change transformation effort.\n\nLenny (00:31:14):\nPerfect segue to where I wanted to go, which is tooling and your recommendations and favorite tools. And so maybe we start with just what do you find as a good starting tool stack for people starting to think about MarTech and basically growth, and then what does it end up being generally?\n\nAustin Hay (00:31:32):\nIn terms of stack, again, we think about B2B and B2C. B2C I would say the stack was largely solved from 2017 to 2020. We've had like a renaissance of the data architecture, so what I'm going to do is I'm dig through B2C then and now and then we can go B2B then and now.\n\nLenny (00:31:52):\nGreat.\n\nAustin Hay (00:31:52):\nOkay. So, B2C, if you back up to 2016, 2017, you have segment and the rise of the CDP. Consumer based businesses have to collect a user and tie a bunch of data to them and then track their actions to send it out to performance ad networks and email marketing tools and product analytics tools. And so you would see this very commoditized stack. It would be like CDP in the middle bunch of tools connected. The promise of the CDP was you integrate one SDK, your engineers don't hate you send all the data to the other tools you can create audiences.\n\n(00:32:26):\nGreat. Lasted for a long time. The thing about it though that I think really changed around 2020 is that the cost of ownership of warehousing became much cheaper. And so 2021, you start getting to the place where it actually makes a lot of sense and is really easy to store all your data in a warehouse model all your data in the warehouse, and to do it without needing a vast data team. I would say Airbnb was probably doing all this well before anybody else was, but they had the main advantage of a lot of money and a lot of resources. So, now come 2020, it's cost-efficient to have a data team with your own warehouse and to manage data centrally in something like Snowflake. So, now this question is like, okay, well we got to get data into the warehouse, but how do we move data around is totally different.\n\n(00:33:11):\nAnd that's what really led to the rise of reverse ETLs. So, now you can actually build your own CDP and lots of businesses already have, I'm consulting with a well known financial trading platform a couple of months back, and they have a CDP, they have all this internal data in their warehouse, but they have not been able to activate it because it's pretty old architecture. Everything's batch based end of the day. What they need is a reverse ETL. They don't need to take that data and just get it out into the world. So, they need the reverse ETL component or the transformation component of a CDP. And so I'd say now today when we think about B2C businesses, you can either go to the traditional route, buy CDP, hook up all your tools, third party.\n\n(00:33:52):\nI think that's a great move if you do not have a lot of engineering resources because you're not spending a ton of time and energy on a warehouse and all the modeling that comes with it, you're just spending time to implement one SDK. I think if simplicity is the name of the game for your business, CDP, Centralized Stack, great move. If you are an advanced engineering culture and you are cutting edge and you're going to do a bunch of modeling in DBT and you already have Snowflake, you should move towards a model of using a reverse ETL. What it means is that there's a way to get your data into the warehouse and then how you activate it is completely independent from the CDP. And so what that means is actually you can have lots of different variations of the stack.\n\n(00:34:31):\nYou could use Amplitude as your CDP, collect all your data, stream it into Snowflake. They actually now have an integration with Snowflake that lets you feed data directly out of Snowflake, and then you could use a reverse ETL to just pipe that data wherever you want. There's a really good section though, again, sorry to self aggrandize, but there's a really good section in the Reforge module this fall that talks about what happens when you have multiple ways to move data. You buy amplitude for your CDP and you're moving data to your warehouse. Amplitude is a bunch of integrations, but you also have reverse ETL and you can move data out of your warehouse.\n\n(00:35:05):\nWhere do you choose? And I would say a lot of businesses get in trouble when they don't have a methodology or a system for how and when to move data from one place to the other, so they just do it haphazardly, right? And the key in systems management is you want to design a process for doing it some type of waterfall or mental model for when it makes sense to move data directly from Amplitude, which is the ingestion point of your data stream or from the warehouse where you can model it and make it better. I think the key is just having a philosophy and approach. There's not really one answer, but that's all B2C. So, B2B I would say ... Yeah, go ahead.\n\nLenny (00:35:40):\nBefore we move on to that one, you mentioned reverse ETLs. What are some examples of products that are reverse ETLs so that people can look them up?\n\nAustin Hay (00:35:47):\nYeah, I personally think the reverse ETL is a capability. It's the ability to move data from a warehouse to a tool. So, technically speaking, you'll find reverse ETLs in CDPs and as standalone products. Segment has a reverse ETL function they just launched, and Particle has a reverse ETL function they just launched. Rudder Stack, which is a CDP has always had a reverse ETL function where you can take warehouse data and move it to different cloud infrastructure. Then there are distinct standalone products. Census, which was back Bay 16Z and Hightouch are the two standalone reverse ETLs. And like I said, I'm an investor in Hightouch, love their work, we use them at Ramp. At the end of the day, you should pick tools because they help solve problems, not because of anything else. So, we can come back to that if you want.\n\nLenny (00:36:32):\nWonderful. Great, great. Yeah, that was perfect. Keep going.\n\nAustin Hay (00:36:35):\nOkay. Yeah, so we talked about B2B, or sorry, B2C. B2B, I probably don't have as much history as say people who survived the dot-com crash in 2008. I started really my career in B2B in 2014, so I'll share a little bit of my experience and I'm just hopefully just saying this because listeners may chime in and be like, oh man, this guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about, which is totally fair game. So, 2014 though, I remember working at Branch, I was working for our COO Mike Molinet, who's now at this really cool company called Thena, but at the time I was working for Mike, and as we talked about before, oftentimes growth stacks just appear because you're given a challenge. And I remember sitting in this tiny room with Mike. We were over in Palo Alto, right off the fills in Palo Alto in this tiny room.\n\n(00:37:27):\nIt was boiling in the room like so hot we were sweating and we were mapping out on a whiteboard how we would design our first version of our system, like how we capture leads, how we get them into Salesforce, how we would email them with a little tool called Outreach at the time, that was still a startup. And I'll send it to you after this if you want to show them to viewers, but it's so MVP, but it still models what a lot of people have today. There's some ingestion point for your data. There's Salesforce, there's some type of outbounding tool, there's an enrichment tool, and then a lot of other Jerry rig stuff hooked up to Salesforce. And for the most part, that's how B2B still exists today as you have Salesforce and then the whole world and the universe revolves around Salesforce. You just have more advanced tools, you have Gom and stuff like that.\n\n(00:38:12):\nI think the big change though, and what is really fascinating and has been fun to watch is in the last two, three years, you now have this whole rise of B2B2C, which takes all the complexity of the top of funnel user acquisition system and stuffs it right alongside your CRM and how you build an elegant system there in that space, I think is one of the most complicated and intricate pieces of being a MarTech person today. And some of it just has to do with the data language. Like all these B2C tools were designed with two objects, a user and an event. And so if you're not a technologist, it's like object orientation is how you kind of think about the world. There's only two concepts for the world in a user acquisition based system. A user who's a person either anonymous or known coming into your website and the things that they do on your website or application, and you use all that data to acquire them or model them.\n\n(00:39:03):\nIn a B2B business you have all that complexity, but at the end of the day, you might not really need it if all the person is doing is it's just the company is signing the contract and then you don't really care what happens afterwards. You might track users and events inside your application, but it's not for the acquisition, it's for the retention of the user. B2B2C is fascinating because you have all the complexity at the top, but then how and when do you tie a user to a company or some type of entity object, and what tools do you need to do that and where do they live in the system? And do those tools actually have competing priorities? Let me give you the greatest example of this that happened at Notion when I was consulting to them at Chris when I was consulting to them and at Ramp is having both HubSpot and Salesforce.\n\n(00:39:45):\nBoth are CRMs, both have the ability to track users and companies, neither are CDPs. And how you actually map the data from HubSpot to Salesforce kind of determines how much hell you're in, and there's really no good solution. It's just like you have to figure out for yourself, how do you want to acquire use at the top of the funnel? How do you merge them into the bottom of the funnel of the Salesforce? And again, there are lots of options or versions of the world. You could use Amplitude only and collect all your user and event data and then merge that into Salesforce directly. You could collect all your data in Amplitude or Segment and then post that to HubSpot, which then posts that to Salesforce. But of course, as you make these decisions, your systems becomes more complicated and more than one person can manage. So, there's this trade-off between complexity and resources that you always have to juggle.\n\nLenny (00:40:33):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you're using the same data sets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser. If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google.\n\n(00:41:23):\nIt's only going to become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny. There's this big question within B2B and B2C around how to do attribution. Well, it's a never ending struggle. I'm curious if you have any pro-tips or best practices or tools that you use to improve the way attribution happens at a company.\n\nAustin Hay (00:42:09):\nActually, I listened to your pod on multi-touch attribution. I'm forgetting who you were with at this point, but it was like I was loving it because it talked about MMM and MTA specifically.\n\nLenny (00:42:19):\nYeah, that was a newsletter post actually, not even a podcast.\n\nAustin Hay (00:42:22):\nYes. So, back to our conversation around division of responsibility. I'm not always the person you should talk to create an MMM model. I'm not a data scientist. I know how to make MMM models and I know what they are.\n\nLenny (00:42:36):\nCan you explain MMM briefly?\n\nAustin Hay (00:42:38):\nMixed Media Modeling. And MTA stands for Multi-touch Attribution and it's these two ways of measuring the world and marketing to understand how you should allocate resources to campaign spend. MTA and MMM though are both underpinned by how you collect data. They're both informed by the user object and the event objects that you collect on your website or your application that then lead to the data that data scientists use for MTA and MMM. That's the connection between data and MarTech is often the tools and systems that we build and stand up and manage are what are used for these very complicated growth, experimentation and attribution results at the end of it. And one of the most discreet things you can do for MTA, because I get this question all the time around, hey, do we need MTA?\n\n(00:43:21):\nWhat should I do first touch or last touch? Should I do both? And there's actually really, I can send you this guide, but there's six or seven things you can do to basically futureproof yourself from needing either one. Because most businesses either start with first touch or last touch and then eventually want to move to a multi-touch attribution model. And for those who don't know what that is, first touch is where you kind of collect the data about where somebody first came from. Last touch is where you collect the data about where the person last came from. So, an example, would this be like if I went to Lenny's Newsletter from a Google ad and that's all he has? That would be my first touch and my last touch. If I first came from a Google ad to Lenny's Podcast, but then later I came from a Facebook ad or I don't know direct, then that would be my last touch.\n\n(00:44:06):\nAnd so it's this question of does the Google original first Google Channel get credit or does the second one the Facebook or direct get credit? And the first touch attribution model, a hundred percent goes to the first channel and the last touch attribution model, a hundred percent credit goes to the last touch. And a mixed attribution model or multi-touch attribution model, you're trying to figure out how to split the difference. And usually the evolution for businesses is they start with first touch or last touch, then they go to splitting it literally 50/50. And then somebody gets angry because they're not getting enough credit and they say, we've got to go to MTA. And there are both first party solutions for that and third party solutions for MTA. But back to the main thing, the main point is if you think about what you're collecting, this is for website businesses, you're collecting the referrer, like in the URL where the person's coming from, and you need any UTMs associated with that person.\n\n(00:44:58):\nAnd you also need any parameters from the advertising networks that might give them the ability to counter a conversion. Every ad network out there has little things they stuff into your URL that tell you that you came from them. Facebook has FVP, FPID, they sometimes encode it. Google has this thing called Google Click ID, which is just a really long string of characters that don't matter unless you know how to decode it. But all advertisers, and for the longest time advertising worked by putting parameters in URLs, pushing somebody through to your website, collecting those parameters and then passing it back to the ad network so they could get credit for it. And so in my mind, the best practice that everybody should stand up from day one is to basically design the system for MTA and then use whatever makes sense as you grow.\n\n(00:45:45):\nAnd so the way that I typically recommend to people is like imagine when a user comes to your website, you collect the URL, collect the referring URL, collect all the additional marketing parameters that you might want, [inaudible 00:45:57], TikTok ID, Microsoft ID, you should just make a list of them. And if you don't have that list, I can give them to you. And then you should collect all UTMs. So, in the URL, you're going to have UTM campaign, UTM medium. Most marketers use this to note what the campaign type was. Now the thing is that UTM is only going to be specific to the moment in time that the person came to your website. So, back to example about Lenny's podcast. If I come to LE's podcast and I came from a Google ad, then my UTM is only for that Google ad.\n\n(00:46:28):\nSo, I have a Google Click ID and I have a UTM. So, what you're got to do is you've got to store those parameters locally on the device. Either was a browser or whatever. You got to store it as UTM first campaign, UTM last campaign. And what you do is every single time that a person comes, you replace the last campaign or the last value with the one that's there. So, say the last one was Facebook and then I come later from a direct mailer ad you replace the UTM last medium with the new one. Now what's happening if you're using third party tools is that you're collecting this user information when the person's on the website, you're going to collect it both as a user attribute and as an event that way. What's going to happen on the backend for your data warehouse team is they're going to see a user profile that has both the first attribution information and the last attribution information.\n\n(00:47:20):\nAnd then for all the stuff in the middle, you're firing off a page view event with first and last, where the last might deviate if there were multiple steps in the middle. So, what they can do is they can just coalesce over all the last UTMs they've seen on all your events by user to get both their first one, all the ones in the middle and the last. And so this isn't actually that complicated to set up. Most people just don't do the work early on. And then when they want to go back later and have MTA results, they don't have the data to do it. So, one of the things I tell people who are debating this is let's just get the infrastructure right from the beginning.\n\n(00:47:55):\nLet's set up so that you have users, you have user attributes, you're collecting first and last UTM on users. You're firing events with all those. There's some other more complex things you can do too. You can set them in first party cookies and you can also set them in your third party cookies for your tooling vendors. At the end of the day though, what matters is you just are collecting this information from the beginning. That way when you actually want to progress your attribution model, you don't have to wait a really long time to start gathering that data.\n\nLenny (00:48:24):\nAmazing. I love the details that you're sharing. I don't know where else people can find this sort of advice. It sounds like a core part of this is one, just having a data warehouse where you just throw all this data into, and two, having a taxonomy that you can rely on and do multiple things with down the road. Is that roughly right?\n\nAustin Hay (00:48:42):\nYeah, I think that's right. The taxonomy though, I think what's interesting is it's very much guided by your third party tools. And again, that's the reason why I think companies often miss the mark here is because they're not thinking about what can my tool actually allow me to put into it in the first place.\n\nLenny (00:48:59):\nJust to make sure I understand what you're saying there, you're saying generally maybe third party tools limit what you can do, which set you up for hardship later. And maybe what you're saying is do that yourself, that tracking piece, is that roughly what you're saying?\n\nAustin Hay (00:49:14):\nYeah, I think that's right. The way to think of it is if you build your own data warehouse, your schema is unlimited. You can do whatever you want. You can design product schema, you can design user schema and event schema, but most third party B2C tools don't allow you to control the schema. There's only one CDP I know that does that, that's Snowplow. The rest are there's a user object and an event object. So, you can either stuff data as a user property onto the user object or you can stuff data into the event and fire it off as an event, but that's what you're working with. So, what I'm saying is most people just don't think about the object orientation of the third party tools they think about and they don't design their website traffic or their app traffic. We didn't talk about app, which is a whole different slew because doing attribution with Iowas 14 is much more difficult.\n\n(00:50:07):\nBut even in the website version of the world, people will often just collect UTMs and think that their job is done and it's like actually it's more complex. You have to think about first and last, think about the steps in the middle, design it so that you're putting it on the user profile and in the event. And so this goes back to the main thing that we were talking about earlier, whereas the job of a marketing technologist is to think often one to two years down the road about what we're going to need to solve for and design systems in an elegant way, not to break the bank, but to at least be the minimum viable product to actually get there. And a lot of my job, and I think the job of marketing technologists is trying to preserve that future state in the most minimally invasive engineering and resource way possible.\n\nLenny (00:50:48):\nYou've talked a bit about thinking ahead and a bunch of tools and platforms, and I'm wondering are there any new and emerging tools, platforms or even growth channels that you're keeping an eye on or excited about or finding more and more useful?\n\nAustin Hay (00:51:02):\nI'd be remiss if we didn't talk about Threads, right? Threads is super interesting. The question will be how quickly can they stand up an API for advertising and what does that look like or do they just blind it in with the existing meta and Facebook architecture? One of the caveats that I'm sure a lot of performance marketers out there will agree with is Facebook has a conflict of interest in reporting, right? They want you to spend money, so obviously they want to report the best results. And that's the reason why attribution parties like Branch and AppsFlyer exist is to somewhat curtail that conflict of interest. And so I'll be really interested just to see how attribution works, especially when you're moving from Instagram to Threads, from Facebook to Threads. Will it be the same architecture, will be the same advertising platform? Will they try to do something new?\n\n(00:51:52):\nSo, I'm keeping my eyes on that. Reddit is also a very interesting place to convert now. They're opening up their conversions API, and I'm seeing a lot more investment in Reddit just because you can have embedded ads now that almost look like they can be posts that you can comment on. I think it just speaks to the maturity of the advertising business. What's happening in the background of all this is ad attribution from apps has become a lot more difficult and mostly aggregate. From 2010 to 2020, we had the golden years of deterministic matching where it was very easy to run an ad and understand with precision who installed the app. Maybe you didn't know their name, but you actually would know their IDFA and you could tie that to their PI. You can't do that anymore. It's very challenging.\n\n(00:52:35):\nEven when you can do it, the results that you would get are pretty low because nobody's going to be opting into giving you their IDFA. So, what that means is these ad networks are becoming more complex, sophisticated, and interesting right at the same time that it's harder for marketers to really understand how they're spending money. And so I'm paying a lot of attention to how marketers make decisions with probabilistic data because most of the work that I'm doing now is actually saying, well, given that we don't have determinist data about a certain audience or where somebody came from, how can I find other information that will create a model for 30% of the population and we can use that to extrapolate to a hundred. So, probabilistic matching and probabilistic attribution I feel like is a skillset that more marketing technologists and marketers should just get familiar with the way that we make decisions today.\n\nLenny (00:53:27):\nWow, I hadn't heard of this concept before. And that's how people are starting, or at least you're suggesting that's how people should start thinking about growth results and impact is less, here's how much this ad drove, the likelihood that this ad did this had this sort of impact.\n\nAustin Hay (00:53:46):\nAnd it's not the case with all channels, but it's specific for apps that have mobile apps, they're going to be impacted by it because they just aren't going to be able to discreetly identify one-to-one the person that came from a campaign. They'll know that a group of people came from a campaign, but they won't be able to make measurement with those people alongside other attributes. For website, it's not the same, but there are lots of things that are making it more challenging. One is browsers now are stripping out those URLs we talked about. So, you're just seeing a bigger and bigger percentage of people being counted as organic that actually came from a paid advertisement because when they got redirected to your website, the browser truncated all those URL parameters. The second thing is cookie blockers. We talk about all these third parties before.\n\n(00:54:30):\nThe way that third parties often collect information is they drop a cookie in your browser that tracks you, if you've heard of Segment, which is one of the most well-known CDPs of the last few years, is they implant a little third party cookie on the site that contains an anonymous user ID and all of your attributes as you're navigating the site. And then once you log in, they convert that to a known or non-anonymous user ID.\n\n(00:54:53):\nUsually that's tied to some type of entity ID or a user record. And at that moment in time, if you come back and they see your cookie, they kind of know who you are. Now, if you're blocking cookies, that means you're basically remaining anonymous throughout the entire user journey until you log in. Not to mention a lot of people have lead funnels where you need that information to actually understand what the user is doing before they convert. So, if you're blocking third party cookies before they even get a chance to convert, you have no information about where the person came from. You just saw that they signed up, and so it might as well be organic.\n\nLenny (00:55:26):\nSo, you talked about how many people are trying to get used to this new world of ATT and much harder to measure attribution and all that. Is there anything you've learned that has worked well to help you recover from that a little bit in terms of measuring what's happening? Is there any tips you can share or anything you've seen work?\n\nAustin Hay (00:55:44):\nYeah, I mean I think a lot of people are just gravitating towards MMM now without really understanding when MMM is useful or not. I don't know if there's a company called Recast. I think you're an investor. Am I crazy?\n\nLenny (00:55:57):\nI am. And that's who wrote that article that you mentioned actually.\n\nAustin Hay (00:56:01):\nThat's right. It's Michael and it was somebody else, I can't remember the name besides-\n\nLenny (00:56:04):\nIt was another Mike Taylor.\n\nAustin Hay (00:56:06):\nI'm not an expert on MMM, so I'm not going to be able to comment to quite the degree that they have. But when I spoke with Michael, and when I think about MMM, a lot of my conversation is this actually really realistic for our business right now? Do we have the data to run an MMM model and how is it going to change or chart the course of our performance ad marketing business in light of having this information? And when I think about it through those lens, most of the time businesses are not ready for MMM. They actually just be an MTA and they need better probabilistic modeling. And I know that's not a super spicy take, but I'd just say at least at Ramp and what I'm seeing at other businesses right now that are operating, it's much more of like we're going back to the days where we understand in broad strokes how much each of our campaigns is driving in advertising revenue.\n\n(00:57:00):\nWe're not able to tie that discreetly with the user journey. And we know that some percentage of this user base might have been lost or organic. So, in light of those, how do we make spend? And then also you can be pretty smart. You can do, for example, geo-based testing on billboards. Try to isolate that as a factor if you withhold all other confounding factors so you can be smart. Coordinating these types of campaigns though is really challenging, especially if you're a really big business, let's say runs online advertising throughout the US and you're trying to do targeted billboard tests in an isolated number of cities across the states coordinating to turn off demographics, make sure there's not isolating factors. It can be really challenging. So, there's not a silver bullet right now I don't think.\n\nLenny (00:57:42):\nAwesome. Just a few more questions and then a broader question I want to ask. So, say you want to start hiring the next Austin, first of all, what do you look for in the person? What are signs that they're probably going to be worth chatting with? And then what are some interview questions you'd like to ask to get a sense of how strong they are?\n\nAustin Hay (00:58:02):\nSo, the first thing that I always gravitate towards is just intellectual curiosity. And I know that's very, maybe a little bit overrated, but I think you can tell pretty quickly if somebody's just interested in the world and learning things. And the thing about third party tools is you are constantly learning. You'll never be an expert in everything because there's way too many tools to be an expert on, I forgot what publication, I think it's MarTech editor in chief or something. There's a publication that I subscribed to and everything is classified as MarTech and the diagram is huge, like cover a wall. Now I don't believe everything like that is MarTech, but even if a fraction is, there are way too many tools in technology to ever be an expert. So, you have to be both very interested in learning and very willing to quickly learn if you want to be in the space.\n\n(00:58:50):\nAnd so I generally look for intellectual curiosity as the first sign. The second thing that I think helps people a lot who have intellectual curiosity is they're scrappy in engineering. They might not be the best engineer possible, but they know how to get around. They know JavaScript, they know Python, they can read API documentation and make an API request. They have enough base knowledge to basically understand how to solve a problem that an engineer might do even if they themselves are not an engineer. Now obviously you can get lucky sometimes and you'll find the engineer who never wants to be an engineer again and decides to move into something less technical. And in those cases they're super powerful, but I haven't met a lot of those people in my life. And also there's just some business dynamics to it. You could probably make more as a backend engineer than as a MarTech guy.\n\n(00:59:41):\nSo, you probably just pursue the pathway that makes more money. It's like a little bit of a utility function. So, I look for intellectual curiosity. I look for basic engineering scrappiness. And as a side note, I would say lots of people out there, the advice that I give them is you don't have to go get a software engineering degree. You can teach yourself, I am self-taught. You can take a coding academy online. I think you get enough knowledge through being able to do web programming or some type of backend programming. So, I would say it's not more than a six-month investment for anybody to really get the skillset that's needed. Obviously once you get the skillset, you can build upon it with years of experience afterwards. But if you're new to the space and you're in marketing ops and you want to get more technical, or if you're a user acquisition manager who did paid performance, but you're like, I really want do things end to end.\n\n(01:00:33):\nYou can just go pick up some software skills and you probably are going to be pretty dangerous from that. And so those are the two things I gravitate towards. There's obviously many more, but those are the first two. The questions that I like to ask is what does I like to ask people how they prepared for the interview. This is not, I can't take credit for this. My wife told me about, gave me this idea and I loved it. I think it was a16z partner. But I love the question because when you ask, hey, how did you prepare? You're really asking how does the person think? How did they plan? How did they take things seriously or not? What did they read? What did they do? And if you have to prompt them to tell you all the things they did, then they're just not a systems thinker.\n\n(01:01:17):\nBut if they're like, hey, actually I read these things, I did this. I woke up, I went for a run. The more interesting complex the answer, the more interesting complex the candidate. And so I love the question because it just gives you a really good understanding of the person on a whole, like right out the gate. And then the other question I like to ask is I like to ask, so you're coming in tomorrow to our marketing tech system and by Friday you have to write up a report on all the things we should change. What do you do? And I like to ask that question because it pretty much signals out people who are biased versus not. People who have tooling biases will immediately just like, we should implement this tool because I used it before and I really like to hire people who are not tool specific, who are more tool agnostic and they think about tools as being things to solve problems as opposed to tools being things that you just solve because you've already solved it one way.\n\n(01:02:12):\nThis isn't a gripe and it's certainly not intended to slice at PMs, but one of my observations of a lot of PMs is they just pick the tools they've already used before because it's easy and it's a shortcut for them, which I understand, but problems are not always the same. So, tools shouldn't always be the same. So, I like to pick people who think about the problem set and the solution space more and they ask questions about what problems you're trying to solve, which I think is much more of an actual PM mindset of trying to work backward from the problem as opposed to just taking the problem and regurgitating stuff that you already know.\n\nLenny (01:02:45):\nAre there any flags you look for that tell you maybe this person isn't someone you want to be working with?\n\nAustin Hay (01:02:51):\nI answer that question on two spectrums. One is if I'm hiring as somebody who's hiring an IC versus I'm getting hired. So, one of the red flags whenever I'm approaching a company to work for them is I'll ask for their company financials and a company that's not willing to divulge their financials to a director level or above person, I don't want to do business with because that means they're hiding something. Or they have a culture where they don't trust the most senior leaders of the organization. Either is a bad choice in my perspective. So, that's one of the questions I always ask when I'm going up for a job, when I'm hiring somebody. Red flags, I feel like one of the false flags not a red flag is more like when there's a gap in somebody's job resume, everybody gravitates towards that and it's often really explainable.\n\n(01:03:39):\nA good example is I was hiring somebody once who had a two-year gap in their resume. We didn't end up hiring the person, but they went through all the stages and we didn't hire them, not because of them, but because the job got removed and this person took two years to get a philosophy degree or maybe it was a poetry degree and then also taught himself to program. So, it was a really enriching two years and there were lots of ways that I could see them bringing their past experience and the way that they took time off together to be a really well-rounded candidate.\n\n(01:04:12):\nSo, I would say I look less for red flags and more for false identifiers on the resume application that may shortcut me towards the decision. Another one is just school people just look at your school where you went to undergrad or grad and they kind of make a decision one way or the other. And I feel like that's also can be a really bad shortcut because there's some amazing founders, for example, who went to school as you maybe had never heard of. Yeah, I know that's not a good way to answer the question, but I don't have a good way of looking for red flags, but I do tend to spend a lot of time on netting out of false flags.\n\nLenny (01:04:49):\nThat was a great way to answer the question. I want to move on to something totally different, and this isn't something I've been asking people, but I'm curious if there's something here then maybe if there is, I'll start asking this more regularly. I'm curious if there's just any frameworks that you've found especially useful in your work or even life. Does anything come to mind?\n\nAustin Hay (01:05:07):\nOne thing that I want to build, so if I ever build this, maybe it'll be a newsletter for you, is just a one-page doc of the most useful life frameworks and they're just the words, and so you obviously have to know them, but I feel like I come across really good frameworks all the time and then I forget them. So, I just want a one pager of Lenny's Life frameworks.\n\nLenny (01:05:07):\nOkay, we're starting this right now.\n\nAustin Hay (01:05:30):\nOkay, great.\n\nLenny (01:05:31):\nWe'll have number one.\n\nAustin Hay (01:05:31):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (01:05:31):\nI like this.\n\nAustin Hay (01:05:34):\nOkay, so I've already said this and you've promised to put this at the top of the list, so I'm really excited. It's just tools are meant to solve problems and I tell that to every person I hire. I repeat it consistently at Ramp and all of my consulting gigs. And it's not just the words, it's the spirit of it. Tools are really just meant to solve problems. You don't have to buy a tool to solve the problem. You also don't have to buy a specific tool to solve the problem. And I think it embodies so much of what marketing technology is trying to do. It's trying to help people understand their problems and then actually take action on them using tools and technology that are most first party and third party. And most people just focus on the tool part and focus on the buying and integration part.\n\n(01:06:16):\nAnd so I think if you consistently remind yourself that tools are just meant to solve problems, then you really get into a space where you as a systems' person can be an advocate for your marketer or your product people. I think sometimes there is a little bit of a tendency for people to think that people who manage and set up tools are just interested in managing and setting up tools, but really at the end of the day, we're trying to help people actually do stuff. Then there's this PPS framework that I talk about a lot, which is problem, people and system. So, whenever there's a challenge that comes up like at Ramp or in a consulting gig, I like to first say what's the problem? Who are the people involved and what system does it impact? Usually because people just jump straight to the system. They're like, hey, there's this problem, I just need to solve it with the tool. Hey, I'm trying to do X, Y, and Z. Can you just give me admin permission straight to the system?\n\n(01:07:07):\nSo, if you back up though first you understand the problem like, hey, what is this person trying to solve? What is their discreet issue? A great example is I'm a sales manager and I want to make it so that every time I hire somebody, I don't have to go through this really tough process of onboarding my staff. All right, so that's the problem. Who are the people that involves, does the sales manager need permission from the CRO? Do the sellers need to be trained? Is there some other confounding factor that we're not aware of why we don't want to just automate this thing? Once you have an understanding of the people and the problems that you're trying to solve, then it's really, really easy to design the system to solve that. And so that's my number one framework for technologists in particular is like don't just jump to the system, think backwards, start with the people and the problem and then move to the system solution.\n\n(01:07:52):\nAnd then another one that I've already mentioned too is it's B and B as opposed to BVB. So, build and buy as opposed to build versus buy. People all the time just think the second that you're talking about implementing a tool or procuring a solution, it's, Hey, I want to build this thing or I want to buy this really expensive thing. Build versus buy is a very narrowly constricting decision tree. If it's only build versus buy, then you've already made the decision that you can only do one or the other, which means you're already fighting somebody at your organization. Build and buy means that both of you can win and you can actually create a solution that is not only unique but saves the company time and resources and makes everybody happy. It's more of a consensus driven approach. Whenever I hear in a meeting or a call or some discussion about how we have a tool and it's really expensive and we want to build in herself, I try to just use the build and buy framework to tee people up and say, what about the problem?\n\n(01:08:59):\nCan we buy? What about the problem can we build? And where does it make sense to invest our resources and our people accordingly to get the optimal outcome? A great example is a company that I was consulting for was thinking about building their own AB testing tool. And actually we had the same problem at Ramp recently, and they're like, well, we just think we should build ourself. This is core to our technology. We have the engineering resources to do it. And they were evaluating it to build the entire system themselves or buy a third party, I think it was split.io or something like that. And the entire engagement was basically designing a financial model to show them that they could make a lot more money, save money, move faster if they just bought the third party tool at the lowest possible cost and spent all of their resources that they were going to spend building it, building around it and making it their own. And there's lots of, I hate the word synergy, it's just so yucky.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nI don't mind it. I think it communicates what you want to communicate, and I feel like people don't say it as often anymore, so maybe it's okay.\n\nAustin Hay (01:10:00):\nYeah, because they're afraid. There are mutual benefits is a better way of saying it, if you build a tool custom to yourself when you've bought a tool because the vendor at that point is committed to you and they want you to be successful, so you often can get accelerated outcomes if you build on top of a third party than if you just build it yourself. A great example is say you buy one of these AB testing tools and you build around it and you're a large customer of them, but you've invested a lot of your own engineering resources to make this solution your own.\n\n(01:10:31):\nIf they know that and they care about you, they're going to be willing to actually make you happy in the moments where you need a change from them, say some SDK change or a new feature or something like that. A framework that I talk a lot about in my Reforge course is about building a stack. Everybody asks, hey, how do I build my stack? What should I do? What tool should I use? Even you earlier were like, what's the golden stack? Tell me what five tools should I get?\n\nLenny (01:10:57):\nJust tell me.\n\nAustin Hay (01:10:58):\nYeah, yeah. I'll tell you at the very end, I got to hold out. Otherwise, you'll ditch this podcast.\n\nLenny (01:11:04):\nThat's right. Yeah. Wait until the end. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAustin Hay (01:11:14):\nThe only thing I had wanted to fit in, which I feel like is maybe a framework or maybe just a really good decision-making philosophy is this concept of thinking gray. Have you heard of it before?\n\nLenny (01:11:26):\nNo. Go on.\n\nAustin Hay (01:11:27):\nOkay. So, Steven B. Sample is a professor at USC. He wrote a book called The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership, really great book. It's one of his principles. There's actually a lot of great principles in the book, but this is the one that I think has stuck with me the most in my career. And the concept of thinking gray is so often in life and in our jobs, we are forced to make decisions very quickly. We have to think black or white about a problem set or a solution, and then decide. One of his tactics is this concept of thinking gray, which is actually to not decide for as long as you possibly can before you have to decide. It's really challenging because it involves this little thing called patience, which I do not have a lot of, most of the time, and I know most people don't as well. But it's particularly really relevant in systems thinking and product because so often we believe that we have to make a decision because our boss is telling us because there's an OPR, because we feel the pain because somebody's complaining to me.\n\n(01:12:30):\nBut actually in reality, you don't have to make a decision at all. You can just let it sit for a while. And this also applies to, I think, how you move through the world and view people. A lot of times we will meet somebody in a company setting or in a business setting, and we are quick to make decisions about them. We even asked me questions about how I hire people very quickly. We're looking for shortcuts to make decisions about evaluating people. One of the best pieces of advice though about thinking gray is it gives you the grace to not decide about people until you have to decide. So, obviously for an interview decision, you have to decide.\n\n(01:13:05):\nYou have to decide yes or no. But so often you'll come across people and you'll meet them once or twice. And I feel like there's this tendency in the back of everybody's brain to be like, do I like this person? Do I want to work with them? And the question often is not that it's do you have to even make a decision right now? And by leaving yourself to have space to decide, you actually open up the possibility that in the future you'll make a better decision. So, I think that's a really good lesson for systems, and it's obviously a lesson that you can apply to the rest of your life too.\n\nLenny (01:13:37):\nAustin, that was awesome. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nAustin Hay (01:13:43):\nI'm so ready, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:13:45):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAustin Hay (01:13:49):\nSo, first book I already mentioned, but say it again. It's The Contrarians Guide to Leadership awesome book. Second book that would be really good is the Art and Adventure of Leadership by a guy name Warren Bennis. And these are more philosophically leadership books. They're less about technical specs on how to run a business. So, you have to be into that.\n\nLenny (01:14:10):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show.\n\nAustin Hay (01:14:12):\nI'm currently watching for the first time Suits, which I'd never seen before, which I think is pretty good because the story arc of every Suits episode is that there's a problem. Then they solve the problem and then the problem is solved at the end. So, it's very gratifying for anybody out there who's a high anxiety person who just wants to have this story arc resolved at the end of the episode. But if that's not your jam and you like excitement, also watching Silo, Witcher. For comic relief, there's Our Flag Means Death, which is hilarious. Have you seen that show?\n\nLenny (01:14:44):\nNo, not Our Flag Means Death.\n\nAustin Hay (01:14:46):\nNow you need to go watch it. It's about black beard and gay pirate captain. So, strongly recommend that. And then for just really dumb comedy, What We Do in the Shadows is hilarious.\n\nLenny (01:14:59):\nWhat was that? What We Do in the Shadows?\n\nAustin Hay (01:15:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:02):\nOkay. Wow, a lot of recommendations. Thank you for that. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?\n\nAustin Hay (01:15:09):\nSo, I talked about what you did to prepare, but the other one that I think is really good because it forces people to get vulnerable is tell me about the most difficult or challenging thing you've overcome in the last year in your life. It doesn't have to be work related, it could be personal. And I think it's a great way to just reset the atmosphere, make people dig a little bit deeper into who they are and be more vulnerable. And I find usually it also helps calm them down because if they shared them one of the most challenging, difficult, and hard parts of their life, then all the other questions just are pretty easy. So, that's one of my favorites.\n\nLenny (01:15:43):\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nAustin Hay (01:15:46):\nThis sounds super dumb. It's called cal.com, and I'll tell you the story first. I've been a big Calendly user for a long time, but Calendly is pretty expensive. If Calendly is listening, you want to give me promo, cool. But it's very expensive. And then I also just found that it is not always graceful at syncing multiple calendars from both businesses and consulting gigs and personal, and I had trouble remembering my Calendly link. I don't know. The interface is like circa 2016. So, really looking for something a little bit more notion like with a Command K interface and just integrations that work. And cal.com has not failed me. It has been awesome. So, if people are looking for new Calendly tools, strongly recommend.\n\nLenny (01:16:30):\nWow, I never heard of this. What a great domain, cal.com.\n\nAustin Hay (01:16:32):\nI know, right. Killer.\n\nLenny (01:16:34):\nWhat is a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself or share with other people, either in work or in life?\n\nAustin Hay (01:16:42):\nI just think a lot about the power of appreciation, and one thing that I've just been thinking a lot about recently is the challenge that people might be facing in their daily lives. I actually was recently listening to another podcast by Adam Fishman, and he had Brian Balfour on. And Adam's basically just interviewing a bunch of dads, which is cool. But the nice thing about being a little bit older in your life being a dad is that you maybe have seen hardship before. And this podcast is great at just exploring the stories of people who I really admire and go through their hardship. And in that it's been a very profound experience, understanding the type of challenges that people have gone through in their lives, people who have lost mothers and fathers early in life, people who have lost children. I myself, my wife and I lost her dad last year.\n\n(01:17:35):\nWe lost two grandparents to COVID, we lost our dog. So, I think that the way that it ties to appreciation is if you can understand what people are going through and you start to view them a little bit more as a human and understand what's beneath the surface of work, who are they? What do they care about? What are the things that are driving their life forward? It just makes you so much more appreciative for what you have and the good moments when they're actually there. And this doesn't just apply to life. It's also like business too. It makes winning a lot more fun when you know the hell that people have gone through. That's just something I like to talk a lot about with people, especially folks who are younger in their careers who maybe have only seen wins describing what the losses look like so they can picture in their mind and then have some experience when they go through it. It's a big part of my shtick.\n\nLenny (01:18:23):\nWhat an excellent answer. I am definitely going to keep asking this question. For people who are still listening here is the promised Golden Stack.\n\nAustin Hay (01:18:32):\nOkay, so Golden Stack. If I was a B2C business, I'd buy Amplitude for my CDP, I'd buy customer IO and maybe I'd upgrade to Braze in the future. I put everything in Snowflake, I'd buy high touch to reverse ETL, all that data out to my ad networks. For attribution, probably AppsFlyer from a mobile app, if not Branch, but it'd probably be AppsFlyer first. So, that gets you, you got AppsFlyer, Amplitude as your CDP and product analytics, Customer IO for email. Snowflake for your data warehouse, Hightouch for streaming all the data tools. That's like golden stack today if I were implementing it for a B2C business. For B2B, roughly the same, Amplitude. If you need an attribution tool, if it's B2B, actually, if it's a web only business, probably we use Branch because Branch is better for web.\n\n(01:19:23):\nSo, you have Branch, Amplitude, connect all the data to Salesforce. Hopefully at some point in time somebody builds a better Salesforce. That'll be for our next podcast though, Lenny, can't cover that today. And then reverse ETL is Hightouch. So, very similar except the only difference is what do you do for an email tool? A lot of people use HubSpot. I would try to go away with Customer IO as long as I could and then I'd move to Braze afterwards. So, a big difference is just Braze versus Customer IO for B2B.\n\nLenny (01:19:49):\nFinal question for you. I heard that you're a drone pilot and I'm curious, what is the coolest place you've flown your drone or the coolest thing that's happened with your drone?\n\nAustin Hay (01:19:57):\nSo, this actually gets back to our intellectual curiosity thing. Maybe I just search for weird people when I hire because I just love when people do interesting things that are unrelated to work. And the story is during COVID, I didn't really want to just better myself online through a bunch of educational platforms. I just felt like it would be a little bit soul crushing to sit in front of my computer screen and learn how to do statistics or whatever. So, I was trying to look for things that were interesting, niche, outside of my domain knew nothing about. And the three that I came up with were, I learned to fly a drone. I became a CFP, certified financial planner and I became a notary. And it's just because they seemed really useful things that had nothing to do with my work and would learn about something completely interesting and different.\n\n(01:20:46):\nSo, those are the three that I chose. The drone stuff, it actually was funny. I started flying here in DC. I live in Virginia, but maybe a mile outside of Washington DC and around DC there's a restricted air zone. And so after I did my FA drone pilot license and I became a certified drone pilot, I really went down the rabbit hole of trying to figure out how to fly a drone in DC, because I've seen them around, but obviously it's a national security and I'm probably dramatically mutilating the exact experience. But as I went to do this, it was very complicated, archaic, but also funny because it was all online. You have to go file out a form, you get a letter from a local representative who says you're in good standing. So, we found a councilman that I just knew. And then you have to fill out all the stuff.\n\n(01:21:39):\nThis paperwork, the site looks like it's from 1994. There's an office literally in DC where a person approves you. Then you have to let go and get a police officer to effectively babysit you while you fly this drone. And so I did all that and I got to the point where I was going to get babysat and I called our local police department and I was like, yeah. So, I talked to the office, I just need an officer to come out and meet at this time. And they just laughed me off the phone.\n\n(01:22:04):\nThey're like, we're not going to send a police officer to watch you fly a drone. And I just thought the thing was really funny because yeah, it makes sense. Why would they waste taxpayer dollars to have me fly a drone? But it was a requirement. So, I ended up not being able to fly this drone in DC. But if anybody's listening and they know how to fly a drone and they want to fly, I would be totally down. I have two drones. I have a Mavic Air 2 and a Skydio Enterprise, which Skydio is a really cool company as well if people are looking for drones.\n\nLenny (01:22:33):\nOkay, so you're saying if people have an awesome drone and they live in Virginia, they should come contact you and fly some drones together?\n\nAustin Hay (01:22:38):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly. But just not in DC.\n\nLenny (01:22:42):\nAll right. Well, Austin, I think we delivered on the promise of making this extremely nerdy and in the weeds, and I think we've solved a lot of people's problems. I feel a lot of gratitude for you, and I feel like we taught a lot of people about MarTech, which was my goal. So, thank you again for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you other than coming to fly drones with you?\n\nAustin Hay (01:23:05):\nSo, first find me online LinkedIn. Threads, I actually have Threads. I don't have Twitter, like hot take, I think Twitter ruins people's careers. I've already seen multiple careers ruined by Twitter. Some people just don't know how to shut their mouth. So, I'm not on Twitter, but I am on Threads and I'm trying to figure it out. So, if you want to document Threads, you can. I'm on LinkedIn and then I have my email address on LinkedIn too, and I'm always willing to talk to people.\n\nLenny (01:23:28):\nAmazing. And is there any way listeners can be useful to you?\n\nAustin Hay (01:23:31):\nYes. I have a marketing technology course coming out with Reforge in the fall. If you're a practitioner of MarTech or you're interested in MarTech, would totally love for you to take the course, would love to your feedback in particular. I love to stand on this podcast and act like I know a lot about MarTech, but I'm still learning. And so I think it would be awesome to just get feedback from the community about what was interesting and helpful, what wasn't there, and we can improve upon. And then the other thing is, if you're ever looking for MarTech help and you want to reach out, that's great.\n\nLenny (01:24:02):\nAmazing. Austin, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nAustin Hay (01:24:04):\nThank you for having me, Lenny. It was a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:24:07):\nThe pleasure was all mine. Bye everyone.

Being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different from what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else. Being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, \"Hey, I'm going to make this thing better, and just charge you more money for it.\" It has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, and for us for a long time it was when someone says, \"Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?\" I'd be like, \"Try and send me a dollar that I can use now,\" and there was only one app you could do it with.\n\nLenny (00:36):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Ayo Omojola, Ayo co-created and scaled Square's popular Cash Card, alongside the hugely popular Cash App. He's currently chief product officer at Carbon Health, one of the biggest and fastest-growing health tech companies in the world. He's a former founder, he's on the board of Pinwheel, and he's an angel investor in companies like Mercury Bank, Fair, Modern Treasury, and dozens of other startups. In today's episode, we dig into lessons from building and scaling the Cash Card and the Cash App, the importance of differentiation when you're building a consumer product or any sort of product.\n\n(01:17):\nHow to successfully build a startup within a startup, how to succeed in both fintech and in health tech, plus my favorite part of the conversation, a handful of incredibly insightful and practical principles and philosophies around hiring, team-building, leadership, and going deep on problems. Ayo is such a fascinating human and leader, and I am excited for you to learn from him. With that, I bring you Ayo Omojola, after a short word from our sponsors.

Ayo, welcome to the podcast.\n\nAyo Omojola (04:12):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny (04:13):\nI have a feeling this is going to be a really fun conversation, I was doing a little research on you ahead of this chat and I found this interesting thing that you did in the past, where I found you answered over 100 questions on Quora about people trying to ship stuff and mail stuff, and I have no idea what's going on there. And so, tell us what is going on there.\n\nAyo Omojola (04:32):\nIn 2015 I'd been at Cash App for about a year, had massive burnout from the last company, went through IC, kind of like did a hard pivot, imploded a little bit, stuff kind of picked up, sold the company eventually. And my brother, who's my co-founder, and I had this idea, and I think it was actually from printing and mailing my section 83B for something that I'd done. And I was like, \"Why can't I just go onto the internet and do this?\" And so I had this idea to build an application where you could give it a document and an address, and we would print it and mail it for you. And it was right around when Lob was founded, which was...\n\n(05:13):\nLob is like this printing and mailing API. So we built this thing called Mailform, I think it's like one of the top consumer print and mail things on the internet. I'm sure many people who listen to this will have used it for... And then we had to figure out how to grow it, and the way that I actually learned how to do SEO was running around the internet, trying to find ways to tell people that we did this, and that they would find us. And we actually ended up, funny as it turns out, we ended up building a whole sort of SEO content infrastructure around it that has really impacted my thinking. But all the answers on Quora were me just trying to get people... You know, if you remember like 2014, Quora was like this massive thing.\n\n(06:00):\nSo all the answers on Quora were me trying to get people who might be thinking about the problem that we were solving to realize that we exist.\n\nLenny (06:06):\nThat was my guess, it was going to be either user research on the space of shipping and mailing things, or it was a growth tactic, and it clearly is the second. You're saying this product still exists, that some people can still use?\n\nAyo Omojola (06:17):\nYeah, yeah, it exists, a lot of people use it. We have maybe customers that you've heard of and use. I won't say their names, because I don't know if they want me to do that. But you know, I would say there are a couple of large delivery tech companies that use us to mail 1099s, W2 forms, what have you.\n\nLenny (06:39):\nHoly moley, okay. And this is just a side project of yours?\n\nAyo Omojola (06:42):\nYeah, one of many.\n\nLenny (06:43):\nAmazing. Let's talk about your Cash App experience, which I imagine was a pretty transformative period in your career. And from my understanding it had a major impact on the success of the app and the business that was built there. To give folks a bit of scale and understanding of just the Cash App in general, can you just briefly talk about how big was it when you joined, like the scale of the app, and then whatever you can share about just the scale today.\n\nAyo Omojola (07:08):\nWhen I joined Cash App was probably sub 50K actives, like people moving money. Today I think it's north of 50 million actives on a monthly basis, will all different types of money movement, like Bitcoin, PP, card, stocks. And I think it's something like north of 70 or 80 million actives on an annual basis.\n\nLenny (07:35):\nWow, okay, great. What I want to talk a bit about is that Cash App to me is a rare example of a huge consumer app success story, I've been angel investing for a while now and I've just learned how rare consumer apps work. Like, they never work, and this one worked. Even within a big company, you think that there's a huge chance of something working if they have the support of a big company, and the platform, things like that. Still, they almost all fail. And so what I'm curious about is, what do you think you all did most right, one to launch it successfully in the consumer space, and then two, to keep it growing and scaling to where it got today?\n\nAyo Omojola (08:13):\nMy perspective is that, and I think this is a, people don't like this kind of answer.\n\nLenny (08:22):\nI'm exciting to hear this.\n\nAyo Omojola (08:23):\nBut the thing Cash App did right was like 10 things, not one. There were like 10 things that actually best in class, like insane talent density, insane focus, very strong at fraud, a lot of the way Brian, and Dustin, and Jesse, and Dangi tried to organize the amount... Like you know, with Jack's support was just really firewalled from the rest of the square, the hero customer was the consumer, not the merchants, so it was like literally in 100% of the trade offs the consumer's needs came first. And that's a very, very hard thing to do, instead of accommodating like... It made people angry, actually. Really insane focus on design, incredible depth in... This is the thing that I think you will appreciate, but it's very hard to appreciate just as a consumer of things, people would be like, \"Hey, what's the difference between you and Venmo?\"\n\n(09:26):\nAnd the only reason you would ask that is if you just hadn't thought about it for a second. Now, today there's like a lot of convergence on features like... So Venmo's sort of caught up on a lot of the things. But at the time, Venmo didn't have push to debit, Venmo didn't have an instant. For like three or four years in the United States, the fastest and lowest-cost way to move money in the country between any two people who had bank accounts was Cash App. And I think that kind of changed in 2017, when PayPal, Venmo, Apple Cash, et cetera, kind of came out and launched all their things. And so I think actually it's possible that having done only one of those things well, Cash App might have been successful. But I think the reason it's differentially successful in the market today is the compound effect of all those things.\n\nLenny (10:12):\nWhat are some of the lasting lessons that you take to other consumer apps that you're... Like Carbon Health, for example? Or founders that you work with, because all those things are amazing, hard to replicate sometimes. Is there stuff you extract from them, like, \"Here's something that I'm going to do any time I'm building a consumer app\"? Is it like the design-related component, is there anything else along those lines?\n\nAyo Omojola (10:33):\nThis is the thing I struggle with, I saw on Twitter somebody say this comment, that a lot of times when people describe their success to you what they're really saying is like, \"This is my lottery ticket number.\" So to be honest, before I go down this diatribe I don't actually know which of the things are replicable. I just know kind of what I believe to be true, and I'm trying... Some of it worked, some of it not, et cetera. So I think Cash App, as a team we really cared about what we could do that was different and better than what else existed in market. And for us, for a long time it was instant, and if you look at all the products you'll see this sort of theme, of when you cash out there's an instant option.\n\n(11:20):\nWhen you get a cash card, we issue your card to you instantly. When you sell stocks, money's available instantly. When you sell Bitcoin, money's available instantly. Like literally, there's no like, \"Oh, circle, circle, circle processing,\" it's like, \"Available to spend.\" And I think there's something actually lasting about the concept of instant, because there still in the world today are like lots of businesses and processes that are like asynchronous, but not for any reason other than, that's just the way the world is. So I think that's like one thing that's kind of narrow. And then I would say another thing that I think is really broad is just being really crisp about why what you're doing is different and better than what exists today. And it's like, being different is not enough, because it's very easy to build a thing that's different form what exists today, because you just have to look at what exists today and build something else.\n\n(12:08):\nAnd being better is not enough, because it's also easy to say, \"Hey, I'm going to make this thing better and just charge you more money for it.\" And so I think there's like, different... You optimize for doing a thing that's different, it has to be better than what exists today, and it has to be better than what exists today in a way that matters to the end user, or to the buyer, depending on what your market is. And then after all that, it also... You have to be in a domain that matters, because it's very easy to get those three right, to build like a really... How do I say this? A thing that's different and better than what exists today, in a way that matters to end users could also just be art. Which is just like, art is a complex thing to scale.\n\n(12:58):\nAnd so you have to like, then also get the economics right, get the entire pipeline of like how you ship, how you build, how you talk about it, all that stuff has to work as well.\n\nLenny (13:08):\nI think there's some really great lessons there, just to kind of mirror back what you're saying. Just differentiation in this case ends up being really important, and if you're trying to disrupt someone doing something, like say Venmo. Like, you can't just be a better Venmo, you have to be different. And it sounds like instant was the differentiator in this case.\n\nAyo Omojola (13:25):\nFor a long time, yeah, yeah. Or rather, it was the cut through the clutter differentiator. There were actually like a lot of other sort of long tail of things that we were doing those different, but it was like, instant was the thing where when someone says, \"Hey, why are you betting on Venmo?\" I'd be like, \"Try and send me a dollar that I can use now,\" and there was only one app you could do it with.\n\nLenny (13:46):\nAnd I think the other element of this, it connects to something I'm working on in the newsletter, is when you're trying to find a big idea, especially in B2B, but in this case it worked in B2C, is just, it needs to be important, it needs to matter, like it can't be a better thing that nobody values highly, because then you will make money in B2B, and in B2C people won't even use it. So, these are really great. You mentioned in passing when we were preparing for this that Block was trying to kill the Cash App for a lot of time, early time.\n\nAyo Omojola (14:16):\nI wouldn't say like Block was trying to kill the Cash App. I think that there were many, many people who worked there that absolutely... And I mean this in the nicest way, identities were tied with Square being a merchant business, believed that the investment in Cash App could have been better deployed elsewhere, didn't want to work on consumer. There was just like a myriad of... And then look, I'm sure people who were there [inaudible 00:14:44], like we probably also made mistakes, and didn't communicate well, and didn't sell it well, and so on. But there was a crazy amount of friction, I'll put it that way. A thing I will 100% give Brian credit for is, he was really effective at making sure that we had a shot.\n\nLenny (15:04):\nZooming out for a moment and thinking about just Square and Block, and how they operate as a product company and as a business, is there anything that you've taken away from that experience that you bring with you to where you are now? Which, I want to talk about next.\n\nAyo Omojola (15:16):\nI don't know necessarily if this was intentional, my guess is it was probably just like a consequence of Square going through, going public and trying to be sort of a rigorous financial institution. I think when you are in a large organization, trying to do a actually new thing, I think small teams are better than big ones, period. And forcing the teams to be like super, sort of thoughtful about hitting milestones and actually adding value, because there's this thing people say about like, \"Hey, the startup within a startup, everything's fake.\" And the reason I think it's fake is because when you're a startup you actually worry about paying the people who work for you, and when you aren't inside of a company you just don't.\n\n(16:02):\nAnd there is just a difference between having that existential fear of, \"Are we going to be here tomorrow, and not?\" So I think a consequence of not having that existential fear is that it's easy to just be like, \"Hey, I need more resources,\" and the organization has some habits around how you acquire resources, and if the leadership of the... If the leadership building the new thing happened to be good at that, you can have growth in a new project's people size that doesn't match the new project's success and potential. And I think that actually ends up... It ends up being a tax over time.\n\nLenny (16:36):\nThat's a really good point, I didn't think about asking about that. But in this case it was a startup within a company that did well, and I also agree, it rarely works and it did here. What is it do you think that was so central to making it work? I know you just talked about it, how would you summarize just like, \"Here's the thing everyone should do when they're maybe starting something small within a big company that's new\"?\n\nAyo Omojola (16:57):\nThere are some macro things where, I do believe we were children of fortune, like mobile, et cetera. When I joined Cash App a lot of the people working on it were fairly tenured, both at Square and just like in their careers, and had done sort of really meaningful things. And as a consequence, I do think there's like... This is a thing I haven't quite been able to articulate well, but there was something around a small, tightly-knit senior team super focused on a problem. And the smallness means just like, less prior miscommunication, and then the tightly-knit means a lot more trust. And then I think Brian was obviously just, he'd been at Square for a long time, he knew the organization well, was a color operator on there, knew like talent, like who was good that he wanted to bring on board.\n\n(17:52):\nAnd I think that combination of things... Well, not my guess is, there are other things. But I think without that thing, it would actually have been really, really difficult.\n\nLenny (18:02):\nI think that's an awesome lesson, just like a small, trusted team that has seniority, and leadership trusts to operate and not just like, \"Hey, what the hell are you doing? It's time to share faster.\"\n\nAyo Omojola (18:15):\nThe Cash App team stayed super senior for a long time.\n\nLenny (18:19):\nMm-hmm. And you said small, how small would you... Was it/what do you recommend when you say it should be a small team for something like this?\n\nAyo Omojola (18:27):\nYou know, a lot depends on the thing, I don't think there's a one-shot answer. When I joined Cash App it was like 11 or 12, and it wasn't much more than that for like a year. And I forget how big it was when I left, but we had real scale in a real business before we had a real head count, I guess is the way I would say it.\n\nLenny (18:27):\nLove it, yeah.\n\nAyo Omojola (18:53):\nAnd you kind of had to fight for every head count. And I think the head count at this point was a Sarah Fryer thing from Square, she was just really, really disciplined about making sure that if you were trying to bring people on and spend the company's money, you really just fight it.\n\nLenny (19:07):\nI think that's a really good takeaway. Let's transition to talking about what you're currently doing, Carbon Health. You went from consumer fin tech to consumer health tech, first of all just real quick, just how did that transition happen? Was that something you planned, or is that just like you went on exploring and that's where you ended up?\n\nAyo Omojola (19:22):\nIt was more I went on exploring, that's where I ended up. I'd say there was maybe three parts, there's one part where when I was exploring there was this guy, Russell Fradin, who now works at Carbon, who had... He introduced me to like a third of my network in Silicon Valley. And basically he said, \"Hey, there's this guy who's amazing, he was the founder of Udemy, and now he started this company called Carbon Health. His name's Eren, you need to talk to him.\" And I was like, \"Sure.\" And Eren, I met, and Eren is brilliant, and also had this crazy way of explaining a complex problem in a way that made the solution obvious. And so he was like, \"Oh yeah,\" like, \"Here's how we're going to do it, and here's the thing we spent two and a half hours together.\"\n\n(20:17):\nAnd then at the end I was like, \"Oh yeah, this is obvious, somebody should just build this thing.\" And then I think the second part was, I think everyone's the hero in their own story, I'm no different. So I think when I left Cash App, and when I was thinking about [inaudible 00:20:33] I was thinking of starting a company and doing all this stuff. And one of the muscles that we really just spent a lot of time building Cash App was going really, really deep into like the regulatory sort of wallpaper of the problems we were trying to solve. And so we would have sessions where we'd be sitting in a room, like product, engineering, legal, compliance, et cetera, with some regs literally blown up on a projector screen, and a section of text highlighted, and being like, \"Hey, what does this really mean?\n\n(21:02):\n\"Okay, what if we build a product this way? What if we structure money movement this way,\" et cetera. And so I casted myself instead as, \"Hey, what if I could be good at regulated businesses, instead of just good at money?\" And that was the way that I tied the two together. There were a bunch of other sort of very personal ego things, like, \"I want to build a team that's mostly founders.\" Both my parents were doctors, and I'd been through some sort of scary experiences in the healthcare system. So there was just like a part of it that was about sort of mission and background, but the career part was really about, how do you stick the two things together? And I also wanted to learn... There was this thing that happened in my like fourth year at Cash App where I was like, \"Oh, there's this other thing that we have to build that would be amazing if we actually built it.\"\n\n(21:54):\nWhich is what Pinwheel, the company I'm on the board of, actually is. So I was like, \"Hey, we've got to build this platform for payroll,\" it's like the last giant money movement thing that hasn't really come to move the needle in a long time. And I couldn't get the organization convinced to build it, which kind of is what it is, A. And B, I was like, \"Oh, I want to have that insight. Can I have that insight of like what the second thing is faster the same time around?\" And I am sad to report that three years in Carbon, I have not had it yet.\n\nLenny (22:27):\nYou've got a lot going on, I am not surprised. So I was going to ask, what draws you towards highly-regulated industries being at Cash App? And I like that you already went there, basically you just found that that's maybe the thing that you could get really smart at, and that applies to a lot of different markets. That's an interesting insight about yourself, like, \"This could be the thing that I get good at.\"\n\nAyo Omojola (22:48):\nYeah, yeah, or differentially better at than other people.\n\nLenny (22:51):\nYou kind of like mentioned this off to the side, this idea that you like to hire founders. And can you speak more to that, just like what that means in your day-to-day, and then maybe how your team looks today. Is it mostly founders, or some [inaudible 00:23:05]?\n\nAyo Omojola (23:04):\nYeah, yeah. I think the team looks today about half and half. So I had this experience going through IC, where... And just kind of growing up, my career in Silicon Valley, where I knew a bunch of founders who were absolute beasts, like incredible people, could do amazing things, and they would bounce off organizations. They would be like, \"All right, I'm going to go work at Amazon,\" and just not last. And when I was at Cash App I went through a bunch of hiring processes where I was like, \"Hey, we should try and hire some founders to do this, look at these companies,\" et cetera. And a thing that would happen that... And this part really isn't about founders, although founders are like one way sort of this happens.\n\n(23:49):\nBut a thing that would happen quite often is, by the time that as a hiring manager you get a bunch of resumes to look at, like you post the job, a bunch of people apply, you're partnering with a sourcer, by the time you get a bunch of resumes to look at they've screened out everyone that doesn't just like fit inside a box. And it's like, at Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and then at certain set of schools, and then a certain type of experience, et cetera. And so what would happen is like, if you just happened to not look like that profile I don't even see you. And I would say, \"Hey, I would like to hire some non-traditional candidates here who were like founders or whatever,\" and I would just never get it.\n\n(24:33):\nIt was almost like the machine just worked a certain way, like there was an algorithm, and the algorithm was upstream of me. And I had this belief that sort of these people that I had seen, many of whom have now gone on to start companies that are doing quite well, would be incredible value add. Like basically, it's kind of like, if you could just hold onto a rock for a little bit it can take you pretty far. And so this was one of the things I talked to Eren about actually, early on when I joined Carbon. And I was literally in the job posting, I'd be like, \"If you've been a founder before, even if your startup has failed, please apply to this.\" Because [inaudible 00:25:15] anything common among founders too is, there's like this sort of imposter syndrome that goes hand-in-hand with the chip on the shoulder.\n\n(25:24):\nAnd so my team's much smaller now than it was, but I probably I think the whole time that I've been at Carbon, hired about 15% founders. And I'm actually 100% certain the thesis was right, and I think it just came with costs that were kind of theoretical at the time, and now they're real. I think like the two big costs are if there's any waste or bullshit in your organization, like they fucking see it right away and call it out. And so there's this like, you have to... There are just these scenarios where I'd just be like, I just have to sit and listen to somebody tell me all the things that we're doing wrong. So there's one, it's a way to cut through bullshit, that's one cost. And then I think the second cost is, and I say cost as in like it is not better for the organizations. You have these people come in, they're incredible.\n\n(26:30):\nAnd you really can only keep them for like two, or two and a half years. And so what ends up happening is, they're just like, \"Oh, I want to...\" Obviously if you're going to be a person that starts a company you're ambitious, so they're like, \"I'm going to run a team somewhere else, I'm going to go try some other thing, I'm going to go build a company.\" And so it's kind of like a team that I think is differentially higher output, but also differentially higher attrition on the market.\n\nLenny (26:55):\nGot it. I was going to ask about the cons, and I like that you shared them already, because I imagine working with a lot of founders adds a lot of stress too.\n\nAyo Omojola (27:02):\nYeah. I mean, it is unequivocally awesome, like I love it. And I think that the unexpected pro also is, I do think it levels up the team. Like people in a team that is very founder-dense really likes it, and we ended up over time in Carbon like, there was lots of people who founded companies here in multiple functions, not just profit.\n\nLenny (27:24):\nToday's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered this stuff, actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio, and unlike most electrolyte drinks there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten, or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes, also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams, and the Marines.\n\n(28:05):\nYou can try LMNT totally risk-free, if you don't like it you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny, and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drink, L-M-N-T.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty. While we're on this topic of team-building and hiring, do you have any other lessons and approaches that you've found to be effective in hiring or team-building? Just general rules of thumb, or philosophies?\n\nAyo Omojola (28:46):\nMy biggest thing, and I say this all the time, is when you're hiring you pick the people, but they pick when. So you're actually like, there's these people... There are many, many people on the team who, the time between when I first met them and the time when they joined the team was like months. There was one person who was like, a year and a half almost. And so the way that I operationalize that is, I'm meeting people all the time, and I am just like, \"Hey,\" like, if I meet somebody I want to work with, I'm like, \"Hey, how can I add value to your life so you will consider me somebody who you would like to work with one day, so that when the time comes and there's an opportunity for us to work together, you're actually open to it, as opposed to just some guy that you met on a Zoom one time.\"\n\n(29:31):\nAnd I would say that's like the biggest... The biggest thing is just like, trying to be like, one of my core philosophies in life is that everybody wants something. And most of the time it's not something you have to give, or you can connect them to. But, if it is something that you have to give, or you can connect them to, it's criminal not to, actually. It's like, imagine you, like just imagine you having a conversation with somebody, and that person, knowing that you want something, having it, there's no cost enough to give it to you, and they just don't do it. How crazy is that? And so the way that I sort of bring this to life is, if I meet somebody who I want to work with, I'm like straight up with them about it.\n\n(30:16):\nAnd I'm like, \"Hey, I hope we can find a way to work together one day. In the meantime, it looks like the things you want are not to work with me right now, but they look like this kind of [inaudible 00:30:26] things which I'm aware of. Can I connect you to this person, this opportunity, what have you?\" And it's not my thing, like actually Russ did this for me when I came just looking by for the first time. He was like, \"Hey, I'm not going to invest in your company, I think it's stupid. But here are all these people who might, go meet them.\" And that was like transformational for me, and it has turned out that over a long enough time horizon it does come back, and you just don't hold the cards close to your chest, just give them away.\n\nLenny (30:54):\nIs there a story or an example of that that comes to mind of you doing that for someone else?\n\nAyo Omojola (30:59):\nNo, it's a little bit of a professional hazard because I'm an angel investor, and so I do this for a lot of my founders. But I probably made 600 intros last year, and that probably drove like, at least one person signed up somewhere as an advisor, a couple people took some jobs, a bunch of angel investors invested in companies, a couple of companies found leads for around like, I think it's... I'm not special in this way by the way, like a lot of people do this. It's just, I am very aggressive about it.\n\nLenny (31:30):\nAnd you're also connected to a lot of people, as you've shared, because of all these things you've done, and the fact that you prioritize this. I think it's a really cool combination of, you really prioritize connecting and helping. Plus you know a lot of people from all the work that you've done, and there's this element you just shared which is just like, give people things that they want, because [inaudible 00:31:49]-\n\nAyo Omojola (31:49):\nYeah, I'm a reasonably good matchmaker, except in love. Never once introduced two people that dated.\n\nLenny (31:57):\nLet's talk about... No, we'll move on from that. I also think I'm zero, zero for some denominator, I don't even know. I'm going to keep fishing this pool of kind of philosophies of how you build product, and then we'll come back to Carbon Health. I was reading something that you wrote about how you're really big on understanding the thing, like going deep on stuff, just generally as a product leader and as a collaborator. Can you just talk about your approach there, and where you apply that philosophy?\n\nAyo Omojola (32:27):\nThis I took away from Cash App, there was... When we were working on the Cash Card, the very first... This is like 2015, 2016, the very first iteration of Cash Card, the head of design at Cash App, this guy Robert Anderson, who's an amazing designer, please hire him if you can, had like this design. He was like, \"Hey, I have this design, we're going to do this thing.\" And I'm like, \"Great.\" I get some sketch files, maybe? PDFs, pre-figma. We mailed them to some card vendors, and the things they send us back are like, you would put this out as the product in your life, in the world? Like, what are you doing? And the consequence, Brian was like, \"Hey, we just need somebody to go figure out how to get this thing made.\" And so I ended up spending a long time just going to different card manufacturing factories around the country, to figure out how do cards get made, what are the possibilities?\n\n(33:26):\nIs there new tech we can take advantage of, will the people even talk to us? Is the thing we're talking about even possible? And we ended up doing... At the time there was a... I wouldn't say like super new, it had been on the [inaudible 00:33:38] for a few years, but it wasn't on mainstream cards yet, this concept of laser engraving. And it turns out that the machine that you use to make laser-engraved cards has like thousands of combinations of settings, which all create like a different physical effect. Like you can increase the power setting and literally burn the plastic, and you would get kind of a red, rough texture. And you could decrease power settings, decrease the aperture, and you would get like a really fine, smooth consistency.\n\n(34:09):\nAnd this is like, again, a thing that I learned, which we went through. Between plastic, the overlay, the paper, the envelope, and the finishes, easily 1,000 combinations before we got to like the first version of the Cash Card that was shipped. And there's a team still there, still doing like literally physical card objects that are not the same as anything that exists in-market, just like going into differentiation thing. And then a lot of the stuff we did around our regulatory work, around prepaid, building a digital wallet, et cetera, made me realize that like a thing that would happen very frequently is, you want to work on something and you go talk to an expert. And usually for most people, an expert is not like, hey, the most expert person in the world, because that's a very, very hard thing to know who that is, especially when you're not an expert.\n\n(35:08):\nUsually an expert is the most tenured person in the world in the domain that you're questioning, and the length of tenure, and the depth of experience actually can vary very wildly from person to person. And so what happened is like, you go ask somebody something, and they would give you an answer which is like the thing that they believe to be true, they're not lying and it's not malicious, and it's just fucking wonk. And you just have to keep pushing until you get to an answer, like I don't really know the right way to articulate this all the way. But its kind of like, you can't stop until you get to the end. And that's one of the reasons why being in a domain that matters is really important, because that's a very, very expensive activity to do if you're in a small team environment.\n\n(35:55):\nSo the way that I apply that today, and I'm sure people at Carbon will tell you this, is I end up asking lots of questions that people think don't matter, because I'm like, \"Hey, we're trying to optimize something.\" And usually what I find is, when you're trying to optimize something for the first time they haven't optimized for it. You actually have to re-measure it, you have to re-instrument it, you have to like rebuild all the queries, all the visuals, et cetera from scratch. You have to look at them like 15 different ways, and then every time two things are incongruent you have to go and figure out why, and it's just like tedious work. And in regulated industries, and I think this is...\n\n(36:38):\nMy guess is this will end up being true in almost any complex environment with a lot of variables, that are kind of... And the more sort of constrained [inaudible 00:36:48] they are, I think actually the more this matters, you can't avoid the details, you just have to get into them. And if you don't, you can still do well but it's actually more than likely fortune than skill.\n\nLenny (36:58):\nYou said you ask these questions that don't matter. Is there an example recently? Because that's a really interesting concept, of just a question you asked, or questions you like to ask that are just like, \"God damn it, why are you asking these questions?\"\n\nAyo Omojola (37:10):\nYeah. I have, there's like one from yesterday where-\n\nLenny (37:12):\nYeah, perfect.\n\nAyo Omojola (37:14):\n... there is a field in a database table that tells you why a payment was made. And there's a bunch of values in that field that are very articulate, like, \"Hey, this payment was made because it was co-pay, this payment was made because it was the patient was visiting without insurance,\" right? And then there's like a field, and it's empty. There's a value that's just null, and we use null as like, \"Hey...\" The way null is described is, after a claim is adjudicated and complete, and the patient has a balance, we leave that field blank if we're just billing the patient for their balance. The problem with that is, if there is any other exception or reason why a payment might occur, and we're in a complex environment, we have over 120 clinics, there's a lot of humans who can press the pay button in a bunch of different places, you will not know if it's included in that field, in that null value field.\n\n(38:15):\nAnd so this is like one of those things where I'm in the middle of a Slack with a colleague who's like, \"Why are you asking this question?\" And I'm like, \"I just need us to put residual balance in that field, if that's what it's for. That's all I'm asking.\" So I do that a lot, and you know, I think people hate it.\n\nLenny (38:37):\nDid they actually go ahead and do that?\n\nAyo Omojola (38:39):\nWe're in the middle of it right now.\n\nLenny (38:40):\nYou're in Slack? Okay, right, okay, I love this. So I made a list of kind of these lessons, and I really like this area we're diving into, of just your kind of philosophies to work in life. So just the ones I wrote down is, the importance of going deep, and doing the thing yourself, and not trusting that somebody's response is the end. I love the way you phrased it, of don't stop until you've reached the end, this idea of helping people if you can, connecting people and the power of that, having founders, and working with founders. And clearly the story you just told is very founder mentality, of just like going in the warehouse and trying 100 different cards. Is there more here? What else have you found to be an important approach to leadership, or product building, or things along those lines.\n\nAyo Omojola (39:29):\nYeah. Can I say one caveat about the first one I think you wrote down?\n\nLenny (39:34):\nYes.\n\nAyo Omojola (39:34):\nIt's not that you have to do everything yourself, it's that the person who you trust in the execution role, they have to become the expert. They have to be like, they can't stop until they hit the end. And, I don't know. I think in all these places where strong, ambitious people are trying big things, so much value is lost when the person in the execution role isn't really in command of all the details, and is like... So I think the reality's like, to do ambitious things you have to work with people, I can't do everything myself and I know that. The real lesson there is, it's not like I have to, just, somebody has to. And you know, they have to know that that's like what you're holding them accountable for, and that you trust them to do that, and the organization's trusting them to do that as well.\n\nLenny (40:30):\nHow do you actually operationalize that? It sounds like part of it is to hire founders who naturally want to do the thing well. Is there anything else in terms of how you set up the team where like, this person has power to do the things that need to be done? Is it like an autonomy perspective? Is there anything else you do that allows for that in a product team, in a company?\n\nAyo Omojola (40:48):\nIt's like a trust but verify, and I think it's just almost never enough for someone to say, \"I can't do it because X person said.\" It is, \"I can't do it because we are contractually obligated to do this another way, and if we do not honor the contract these will be the consequences.\" And another thing I like to do kind of along this is like, \"Okay, articulate to me what actually will happen if we don't do it this way. Like, what will break? Like, are they going to fine us, is the patient going to be...\" Do you know what I mean? Because in my mind there are many things that are used as excuses, because some person's understanding of how some regulatory thing works from like their last job is being applied here, where you're literally creating a worse experience for your consumer, for your patient. I'm like, \"Why would you... If we're not here to try and make the experience better for them, why are we even here?\"\n\nLenny (41:43):\nLet's come back to Carbon Health for a bit, I just have a couple of questions that I wanted to touch on. One is just about starting a company in healthcare, in health tech, there's so many companies that launch every day, every week, trying to make the healthcare industry better in various ways. But for all these reasons, I don't know, the incentives are off, there's regulatory capture, there's things take a long time, things just like often don't work. Carbon Health is an example of something that is working really well. What is your advice often to founders who want to go after the healthcare space as a tech company? What do you need to know, what should you do right, do wrong? What is your advice there?\n\nAyo Omojola (42:23):\nYeah, so one thing I would say in healthcare that fortunately or unfortunately I think is true, is very often the way to make things happen is network-dependent, not necessarily about the merit of the thing itself. So it's just like, there's companies that exist because the founders know the CEO of every major payer in the country, and so there's just like a deal they can get, or data they can get that's not available in any other context. So I think there's just a thing there of understanding if that's the business that you're in. I think in Eren and Caesar's case in Carbon, because we're direct to consumer, we're not trying to sell to payers, we're not trying to sell to employers. And Eren, obviously just hugely successful, [inaudible 00:43:13] person starting the largest education platform on the planet at Udemy.\n\n(43:18):\nThere was actually really, really good founder market fit, he was a person who had very, very technical, and had a ton of DTC success doing another thing that was DTC. But there are businesses, like there's a company that I recently invested on working with, where the founders are incredible and very, very technical, and not super high on network. And so a lot of what I try to do with them is like, \"Hey, I need this person to talk to this person. And then also, this is like a really crisp, specific use case that you need to optimize around.\" And maybe I'm wrong, who cares, I'm just some guy. What does it matter what I think? It doesn't have to be what I think, it just has to be crisp. And using that as a way to like... Because the more crisp it is, the easier it is going to be for you to know who the decision-maker and the organization you need to get to is.\n\n(44:05):\nBecause I just find... I'm sure you see this in B2B, this is so much... There's just so much leverage in knowing the person in the place who actually has their finger on the button, versus trying to network your way in, and people don't want to spend their social capital introducing you to this department, or they've just got like 19 other things going on. So I think that network thing is just a thing that sticks in my mind, that when I see a lot of healthcare tech startups swimming through the soup, a lot of it is about there's some organizations that have to navigate to get to the right decision-maker, and they have to do it 100 times. And so much of it is like, just waiting for the guy who promised me the intro to make the intro.\n\nLenny (44:48):\nThat is really good and practical advice. Before we wrap up, I want to give you a chance just to describe Carbon Health for folks that may not be familiar with it. Just like, what is it, where can you use it, how do you sign up, who's it for?\n\nAyo Omojola (45:00):\nYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh great, yeah, very, very happy to do this ad, it is a paid ad because Carbon Health pays me. So-\n\nLenny (45:08):\nNo-one's paying me, I'm losing in this situation.\n\nAyo Omojola (45:12):\nI'm paying you in prestige, Lenny.\n\nLenny (45:14):\nYes, in wisdom, in insights, and your attention, yeah.\n\nAyo Omojola (45:17):\nYeah, exactly, exactly. So, Carbon is an extremely vertically integrated healthcare provider based in the United States. By extremely vertically integrated, what I mean is we build and run the clinics, the providers work for carbon, and we build and run the software, and we run the entire operation, and it's all like full stack in-house. And when I say we build our own software it's like, wait, how you book, how you pay, the literal buttons that the provider presses to say, \"Hey, Lenny's blood pressure looks good,\" all of that is software that we build in-house, all the way from front, from like the patient clicking book an appointment on Google.com to the claim being sent to the insurer, we build the whole thing full stack ourselves.\n\n(46:04):\nWe have, I want to say 130 clinics around the country, I believe we're in about 17 states. We do virtual care, I think we're one of the biggest healthcare providers in California, and we do both urgent care and primary care. And the thing that gets me super-excited about Carbon is, a lot of the experiences we build are the things that as a consumer, you believe should exist in healthcare. So I want to say, last year we launched this diabetes program where you slap on a continuous glucose monitor, you link it to Carbon, and it streams your blood glucose measurements directly into our EMR natively, and your providers can see it and interact with you around it. They can help intervene, they can tell you like new dietary, lifestyle choices to make. And we're going to do that with every device at some point, on some scale, and you don't have to pay $200 a month to use it. $200 a year-\n\nLenny (46:04):\nAmazing.\n\nAyo Omojola (46:55):\n... to use it, sorry.\n\nLenny (46:59):\nAmazing. Well, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, I'm going to go through them pretty quick. We'll see what comes to mind, no pressure, you can skip them too if you want. You ready?\n\nAyo Omojola (47:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (47:13):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nAyo Omojola (47:17):\nThree-Body Problem, Children of Time Trilogy, and Stormlight Archive.\n\nLenny (47:24):\nAnd are these all sci-fi books?\n\nAyo Omojola (47:26):\nThe third is fantasy.\n\nLenny (47:29):\nGood clarification, great. Amazing. I'm reading an epic sci-fi book right now called The Fire in the Deep.\n\nAyo Omojola (47:37):\nOh dude, amazing.\n\nLenny (47:39):\nOkay, yes.\n\nAyo Omojola (47:40):\nSo, something that's going to really piss you off... I don't think this is a spoiler.\n\nLenny (47:43):\nDon't, don't, no spoilers, I'm almost done.\n\nAyo Omojola (47:45):\nIt's not a spoiler. The story's not finished.\n\nLenny (47:52):\nMm-hmm, there's like additional books that aren't done yet?\n\nAyo Omojola (47:55):\nYeah. And I don't even know if they're being written, it's brutal.\n\nLenny (47:58):\nThat's okay. I find that the first book, except for the Three-Body Problem where the first book is the worst book, I feel like with this and many of these books, the first one is like... I'm just going to stop I think at the first one, that's my plan.\n\nAyo Omojola (48:11):\nSo I'd say, the other two are in my opinion very clever explorations of types of intelligence, from [inaudible 00:48:19]-\n\nLenny (48:18):\nExcellent timing for studying what might happen with AGI. Great, I love where this is going. Next question, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nAyo Omojola (48:29):\nWar of the Worlds was exceptional.\n\nLenny (48:32):\nIs that recent?\n\nAyo Omojola (48:34):\nYeah, there's one that I think that it was a three-season thing, just ended maybe last year. And it's like a kind of more modern take, and it's just very thoughtful, and it's sci-fi, but such deep drama. I also love Succession, but I haven't got through season two yet.\n\nLenny (48:52):\nMan, this season is incredible.\n\nAyo Omojola (48:55):\nI know, I know.\n\nLenny (48:56):\nYou've got to get there, you've got to get there.\n\nAyo Omojola (48:58):\nI know, I had to mute it on Twitter because I was like, \"You guys are ruining it for me.\"\n\nLenny (49:01):\nOh man, that's impossible to avoid. You just have to delete your Twitter account, I think is the only strategy. There's an amazing Twitter account called No Context Succession, and they just-\n\nAyo Omojola (49:11):\nLove it, love it.\n\nLenny (49:12):\n... yeah, and they just tweet random clips. But it's going to totally [inaudible 00:49:15]-\n\nAyo Omojola (49:15):\nMy favorite Succession meme is the Kendall on the phone, \"It would be good to connect, it would just be good to connect,\" just like, such a metaphor for life.\n\nLenny (49:27):\nInteresting, very subtle. Oh, I see what you're saying. That feels so appropriate to you, Ayo. Just connecting people, it's like the core of your being. I could see why you love that meme. Next question, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring, interviewing?\n\nAyo Omojola (49:43):\nThis one's not super crisp, it's like there's kind of two sides to the question. It's like a, tell me something you did that worked out but not for the reason that you thought it would work, or tell me something you did that was a good decision that didn't work. Like, tell me a bad decision that worked out, or a good decision that did not, is like I think the way to frame it. And it's a lot of like, my process is just teasing out introspection, it's just like, \"Are you a person who is reflective about the decisions you've made, and why they worked, and why they did not, and incorporating that into your model so you make different decisions?\"\n\nLenny (50:14):\nFinal question, do you have a pro tip for mailing something or shipping something from your experience helping everyone on Quora mail and ship stuff?\n\nAyo Omojola (50:24):\nI'd say my biggest hack is like, if you're doing anything local where you're just like taking something point-to-point, Uber can do it for you.\n\nLenny (50:32):\nMm-hmm, a courier.\n\nAyo Omojola (50:33):\nI literally sent somebody cookies recently, and I was like, \"Oh.\" A guy showed up at my house, I gave him a bag of cookies, and my friend texted me a couple hours later and was like, \"Thank you.\"\n\nLenny (50:47):\nThat is a hack. Ayo, this was amazing, you're an amazing human, I really appreciate you making time for this. Thank you for being-\n\nAyo Omojola (50:47):\nThanks, man.\n\nLenny (50:53):\n... here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, but more maybe ask you followup questions? And, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAyo Omojola (51:02):\nI am on Twitter @ay_o, and I write at kunle.app, K-U-N-L-E.app. And the way listeners can be useful to me is tell me what I'm wrong about, I love that. Just be like, \"Hey, you said this thing. It's false, here's an example of why,\" I love that.\n\nLenny (51:23):\nI love these answers to this question, because people love to leave comments on YouTube, and so we'll see-\n\nAyo Omojola (51:23):\nOh, sweet.\n\nLenny (51:29):\n... what comes in. We'll see what the YouTubers find for us.\n\nAyo Omojola (51:31):\nOh God, what did I just sign up for?\n\nLenny (51:33):\nWe'll find out, here we go.\n\nAyo Omojola (51:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (51:36):\nAll right, well thank you again so much for being here, and bye everyone.\n\nAyo Omojola (51:40):\nAwesome, thanks for doing this. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (51:45):\nThank you so much for listening.
