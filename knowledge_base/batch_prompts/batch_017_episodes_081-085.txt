I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Normally, I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful companies. But today is going to be a very different and unique episode. I launched this podcast about six months ago. We've done exactly 50 episodes at this point. We've also done over 2 million downloads since we launched. The podcast is a top 10 technology podcast across Apple and Spotify globally. And I believe there's about 40 to 50,000 subscribers or followers of the podcast across Apple and Spotify, which is all very exciting and kind of blows my mind.\n\nLenny (00:00:47):\nSo what I decided to do with this final episode of the year is to look back at the 10 most popular episodes that we've done so far. So what I'm going to do is count down from the 10th most popular episode to number one and play a clip or two from that episode that I found to be most interesting or that's been the most popular. I've never done this sort of episode before. We'll see how it goes. I think it's going to be really interesting. If it's not, we will never do it again. And if it is, awesome. Either way, enjoy. We're going to get right into it after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n Adam Grant (00:01:19):\nHave you ever wondered what makes great minds tick? I'm Adam Grant and on my new podcast, Rethinking, I'm trying to find the answers. Every week I interview some of my favorite thinkers to learn how we can bring out the best in ourselves and others. I talk to defying rock climbers, Oscar-winning filmmakers, creators like Lin-Manuel Miranda, entrepreneurs like Mark Cuban and thought leaders like Brene Brown. Find Rethinking on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Amazon Music, or wherever you listen.\n\nLenny (00:01:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been?

April is the author of obviously awesome. She, in my opinion, is the smartest person in the world on positioning and how to figure out positioning for your product. And here's April describing the five steps to figure out your product's positioning.\n\nLenny (00:03:06):\nSay that you're a PM or founder that's ready to start figuring out their positioning for their product. What's the first thing that you do?\n\nApril Dunford (00:03:15):\nI actually think the first step in a good positioning exercise is to really understand what do we have to position against? So put another way, it's like saying, what do I have to beat in order to win a deal? So in positioning work we call this competitive alternatives. Now, how people mess up this first step is, I say competitive alternatives and they think competition. So things that look exactly like me. But in B2B we kind of have two sets of competitors. We have status quo, which is whatever the company is doing to attempt to solve the problem right now, even if it's crappy and not great. And then there's, if the company does decide they're going to buy something different, they usually make a short list. So, it's whoever else lands on the short list. I need to be able to put a stake in the ground and say, I got to beat all that in order to win a deal.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:10):\nNow most folks will discount the status quo, but they shouldn't because in B2B we lose about 40% of our deals to, \"No decision,\" which actually means we lost to the spreadsheet, we lost to pen and paper, we lost to interns. And if we're not positioning well against that, we're never going to get the customer to come off of that. So I got to win against status quo, but I also have to win, most of the time, if it's B2B, you don't just buy the first thing you come across, you make a short list of alternatives and I got to win against those as well.\n\nApril Dunford (00:04:44):\nSo step number one, what am I positioning against? Once I have that stake in the ground, then I can start thinking about what makes us different. So the easiest way to do this is, okay, this is what I have to position against, what have I got capabilities wise that the alternatives don't have? So feature function or even capabilities of the company, which could be pricing or professional services around other things that you've got, but also capabilities of the product. What have I got that the alternatives don't have? And I can make a giant list of these things. And then I can translate that stuff into value by going down the list and saying, okay, we have this great feature, so what? Why does a customer care about it? What is the value that feature enables?\n\nApril Dunford (00:05:31):\nWhen I do that mapping over to value, what generally happens is I end up with two or three value buckets or value themes. And quite often those value buckets or value themes are different than what I would've gotten if I got all the smart people in my company together and said, hey, why does everybody love our stuff? When I do it this way I'm ensured that those value themes are differentiated and not just things that are generally valuable, but any alternative could get it done so why are we even talking about it? So in my mind, that's kind of how we do it.\n\nApril Dunford (00:06:07):\nOnce I've got differentiated value, then I can start thinking about, well look, I could sell this product to any company that has this problem, but not everybody cares about this value the same way. And so what are the characteristics of a target account that make them really, really care a lot about that value? If I do some deep thinking about that, that's going to be my definition of a really best fit customer.\n\nApril Dunford (00:06:31):\nAnd then the last piece of positioning of course is market category. And so again, a lot of people will just start with market category and then try to back up, which I think is crazy 'cause then we don't have any way to judge the goodness of a market category. But if I've got, look, this is the value only I can deliver, these are the kind of people that really care a lot about that value. If I start thinking about positioning is like the context I position my product in, then the best market category is the context I position my product in such that this value is kind of obvious to these people. This is my long-winded way of doing it, but this is the only way I know how to get positioning done.\n\nLenny (00:07:17):\nNext up is Crystal Widjaja, who is a longtime chief product officer at Gojek. She's currently chief product officer at Kumu, and she's one of the smartest growth minds that you probably have not heard of. Here is Crystal talking about why most analytics efforts fail at companies.\n\nLenny (00:07:32):\nI want to shift a little bit to post that you wrote that maybe he's winning more popular posts, you wrote on the Reforge blog called, Why Most Analytics Efforts Fail. I'd love to hear your broad overview of why do most analytics efforts fail and then how do teams avoid this, maybe what are two to three things they can do?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:07:51):\nYeah, I'm actually pretty surprised at how much noise that has generated because I guess it came from a place of frustration where I kept telling people like, you are doing this wrong, here's how you should probably be doing it. But I think it resonated a lot with Foltz because they recognize all of those symptoms but they weren't sure why it was happening. So to say, oh, this is the thing, instrumentation is what's wrong. I think it's a very actionable thing. It's probably one of the most solvable problems out there. It just takes some time and mental model shifts to do it well.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:08:27):\nSo a lot of people look at tracking data as how do I track my OKR? How do I know if I'm going up or down? But they don't use it to track or identify insights. So I will use the example of using Twitter for, \"News\" when in reality they're actually using Twitter for entertainment. Do not treat metric gathering as entertainment. It's not there for you to be like, oh, that's interesting, how novel, and then not act on it. So real news is information that changes what you do in the real world. And if you don't change what you're doing, what you are doing is just getting entertainment. So let's use that as a premise.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:09:13):\nThe next step in instrumentation is to look at the fact that measurements do not equate to insights. A measurement would be an observation, it's a data point in your database. So the example being power users do four times more bookings is an observed fact because your transactional database obviously says that that is the case. But it's not an insight because it doesn't have context, it doesn't give you information that lets you act on it and better understand the problem.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:09:45):\nSo another example would be if I see my girlfriend hanging out with a guy, I don't know. That is an observed fact that you see in the real world. You're a hypothesis could be that your girlfriend is cheating on you, but the insight, the actual fact might be that she's not cheating on you, it's her cousin. And now your insight is I am paranoid and I need to change my behavior to be less crazy. So, the insight will provide value when you have this why answered. Why is this person doing this thing? Here's why. And then you are going to act differently.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:10:25):\nSo for our purposes, if we look at a Goodfood user will transact and is more likely to use a voucher. That's a fact, that's an observation. But it's not an insight. An insight would be something like Goodfood users who are power users are more likely to use a free shipping discount on a high GMV basket versus non-power users. And that actually tells you how to change your marketing approach. It tells you in what circumstances does someone do this When it's a high GMV basket, give power users the ability to get a free discount, but do not do this for non-powered users because they won't convert any better than they normally would. So that helps you change your marketing spend, it helps you understand the decision points of power users versus non-power users. The insight is instrumenting properties into an event so that you can segment who is doing what behavior and make some hypotheses on that observation, test that hypothesis and then you get some causal representation of whether or not that hypothesis was right.\n\nLenny (00:11:43):\nThe eighth most popular episode of the year is our very first episode with Julie Zhou. Julie was a longtime design leader at Facebook. She's now the founder of a company called Sundial. She also wrote the bestseller, the Making of a Manager and her newsletter, The Looking Glass, was a huge inspiration to me that helped me start my newsletter. Here is Julie sharing her advice on getting over imposter syndrome.\n\nLenny (00:12:06):\nGoing back to your time at Facebook, you've made it sound like you just kind of like, ah, I joined as a designer, figured out design became a manager, and then somehow you became VP of design and it sounded too easy. That's an insane trajectory for someone to follow. Do you have any thoughts or advice on what contributed to your success rising through the ranks that quickly for folks that are just early in their career maybe?\n\nJulie Zhou (00:12:30):\nAbsolutely. And I want to make it really clear, I would say that the first seven or eight years that I was at Facebook every single week I felt like an imposter. I had no idea really what I was doing. The constant refrain in my head is like, well, do you really deserve to be here? Do you really know what's happening? You're not really prepared for this job. You've never done this before. What do you have to be put in this situation and get to do what you do? And that was really a constant refrain in my head.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:13:02):\nBut looking back, I think it probably took me about seven or eight years until I became a little bit more comfortable with that. After seven or eight years I could look back, I could see all of the things that I got to work on, I could see all the ways that I had grown and learned in that experience. And something clicked for me where I realized it's kind of two sides of the same coin. Being in an uncomfortable situation, being in a position where you feel like, hey, do I really know how to do this, I'm not prepared for it, kind of coincides with the fastest and most intense periods of growth in one's career. I started to realize, well maybe it's not so much of a bad thing. Maybe if I constantly putting myself in this situation where I haven't seen this problem before, that's also what's going to push me to grow and learn.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:13:53):\nSo yes, you asked for specific advice, I think there's two things. The first is, well, I was lucky I was in the right place at the right time. I was at a company that was scaling. And when you're at a company that grows, there's always a lot more opportunity to then be able to try something new, to raise their hand, to volunteer for things to be just thrown into because somebody has to do it because it's a growing company and there aren't a lot of other people. So the first piece of advice I would have would be like if you want those types of opportunities, sometimes you just have to be at a smaller place and you have to be at a place that is going through that rate of growth.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:14:30):\nThe second thing is embrace the fact that it's okay to be in a position where maybe you don't know what to do, you haven't been trained for. It does coincide with that intense learning. Maybe approach it with that sense of curiosity and that sense of, yes, it's hard, yes, I might be an imposter and I might feel that way for a while, but this is also what's going to help me get there. It's going to be what forces me to do the work and in that process learn and become better.\n\nLenny (00:15:02):\nIt's amazing to hear that you had imposter syndrome for such a long period of time and you basically ran design for the Facebook app, right?\n\nJulie Zhou (00:15:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:15:11):\nIt's kind of an empowering, inspiring insight that someone that at your level went through that for so long and made it through that. Do you have any other advice or thoughts on just for folks that are going through that? Because I have that to you for a number of years, just like, what the hell am I doing here? People are going to see I don't really know what I'm doing and it's all going to crumble as soon as I make my next mistake. Do you have any other advice there for folks going through that themselves?\n\nJulie Zhou (00:15:34):\nI think that so much of just exactly what you said, Lenny, I think so much of it that helped me was realizing that everyone feels this way to some extent. And that's also why I always want to talk about that. Because I feel like sometimes you can see from the outside you're like, oh, this person has this title, they have this position, they have these responsibilities. Clearly they've made it, they know what they're doing. But that's never the case.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:15:58):\nI mean, logically, let's think about it. If you're going to do anything new for the first time, how are you ever going to feel totally comfortable, totally prepared? Every time there's something new that you hadn't encountered before it's always going to be a little bit rough, you're never going to feel like perfectly at ease. It's only upon doing something multiple times that you start to see the patterns, you start to realize, okay, it's going to be all right. Even now, the people that I talk to, the people I really look up to, the people who I think are role models and mentors for me, I mean they regularly also share with me that it's the same. They still encounter things that are unprecedented. If we work in tech, I mean the rate of change, the rate of the industry and companies and these new experiences that we have, that never goes away. That's just par for the course. So I think that feeling always exists.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:16:55):\nWhat I have learned is that there are better tools in your toolkit for dealing with it. One of them is of course me just reminding myself that if I feel uncomfortable, okay, other people feel that way too. Everyone does. It's totally natural. But then to also find other pieces in that toolkit. One is I am much better at asking for help now than I was earlier in my career. I used to actually just try and hold it all in. I was like, hey, I better fake it till I make it. If everyone thinks that maybe I'm coming to the table like I know it then I can fool them.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:17:30):\nNow I realize I was preventing myself from being able to get that support and that empathy and that camaraderie and that advice that would've helped me actually grow faster and maybe with a little bit less pain in the process. So one of the things I've learned is it's okay to ask for help. It's okay to reach out to people who both may be going through the same things you're going or maybe are a step or two ahead of you in the journey, who have actually gone through that and have lived to tell the tale and can tell you it's going to be okay. Because often that's just what you need, you just need people to tell you it's going to be fine. You're fine. You're good. You've got this. That's so meaningful whenever we sometimes feel down about ourselves. So that's another, I would say tool in the toolkit, asking for help, finding groups of support.\n\nJulie Zhou (00:18:19):\nAnd then I think the third is it's also okay to just be vulnerable and just talk to people about. I found that some of the most meaningful conversations I had, whether with people at managers or whether with my own reports is when we can be much more open about what it is that we find hard, what are we struggling with? And in that way you actually form deeper connections and people are more able to help out. We can spread the load a little bit. We can put our heads together and brainstorm a better way to solve the problem. And I find that too, even as the head of a department or a founder, it's not going to solve everything myself. I'm never going to have all the answers. Sometimes by just sharing what the problem is by sharing the load, we're all going to collectively come up with a better solution.\n\nLenny (00:19:14):\nNext up is Shishir Mehrotra, CEO of Coda, former VP of product and engineering at YouTube, PM at Microsoft. And here are two my favorite clips from Shishir. One where he shares his favorite interview question using a technique called Eigenquestions and his PHSE career growth framework.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:19:32):\nI have an interview question I ask, it's a very simple question and it's a coded Eigenquestions test. And the question is, a group of scientists have invented a teleportation device. They've hired you, Lenny, to be they're sort of business counterpart, bring this to market, product [inaudible 00:19:50] this question actually worked well for [inaudible 00:19:52]. But say, you could be the product manager for this thing, bring it to market. What do you do? That's the whole question. Usually people will start asking a bunch of questions and say, well, tell me more about this device. What does it do? How does it work? And is it big? Is it small? Is it fast? Does it disintegrate things or not? Does it need a receiver and a sender? Is it safe?\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:20:17):\nI'll just let those questions come out and at some point I'll say, okay, nice job generating all the questions. Turns out these scientists, they kind of hate talking to people and they're kind of annoyed by all your questions. And so they've decided that they will answer only two of your questions and after that they expect a plan. What two questions do you ask? And interestingly, all of a sudden, like the sharp product managers, engineers, basically every role, they very quickly find what are the two, one or two eigenquestions on this topic.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:20:48):\nThere's no right answer, but I'll tell you one of my favorite ones is as a product manager said, okay, if I had to ask two questions, the two questions I would ask, one is it safe enough for humans or not? And that was a very crisp way to get to just safety. How reliable is it? Didn't ask how reliable it is, how many bits in the middle of this... He's like, just tell me it's safe enough for humans or not. And the second one is it more expensive CapEx or OpEx? Is it more expensive to buy them or to run them?\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:21:15):\nAnd then he took those two questions and he said, get with those two questions, I can form these quadrants. And you can say, oh, it's safe enough for humans and they're very cheap to buy, but expensive to run. Then you probably run them like human fax machines. You put them everywhere you can and you say, hey look, it's expensive to use but you'll all have the ability to teleport anywhere you want and this is how we're going to run it. But the other hand, they're very expensive to buy, but cheap to run. You probably have to place them very strategically, in which case what you probably do is replace airports. Airports are pretty strategically placed in places where people are trying to get around places. If it's not safe enough for humans, then you've got a whole different class of use cases where you go value what goods are transported in very costly ways. And people come up with, do you do the most expensive things? Is hell supporting people's replacement hearts, is that a really demanding thing? But these two questions kind of get to the heart of it.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:22:15):\nThe question's totally made up, no teleportation device exists, at least not yet. I find that people's ability to learn the method is significantly higher if it's low stakes. That question by the way, if you ask a kid that question, hey, teleportation device, you get to ask two questions, almost every kid will quickly get to two pretty good eigenquestions. Kids are incredibly good at simplifying these things down, it's actually a skill we remove from ourself. I'll hear candidates tell me things, I guess I would ask them what size it is and why would you ask them what size? What decision is that going to allow you to make, to know what size? And sometimes they can explain it, sometimes not and don't get hired. But then actually the thing I'd say about it is there are eigenquestions everywhere. I mean you can take any product out there, I'll do it with my kids a lot, and they'll say, I was just riding with my younger daughter and she said, how come there's three gas stations in the same corner? Why do people do that? That's a really insightful observation. What's the eigenquestion? How do you place a gas station you can almost take anything and say, what is the question that really drives this answer.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:23:27):\nIt stands for problem, solution, how, execution, PSHE. So here's how it works. So if you're sort of a junior product manager, what happens? You get handed a problem, you get handed a solution, you get handed the how, go talk to this person, write this document, run this meeting, so on. And all you have to do is execute, run that playbook and that's all we expect out of you. You can become a little more senior, we hand you a problem, we hand you a rough solution, you figure out the how. You figure out the how we're going to organize this? What are the milestones? How we're going to get it to market? How we're going to the meetings? What are the rituals? All those things show up in the H.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:24:05):\nAt some point you become a little more senior, we hand you a problem and you come back with the solutions and we judge you on the creativity and the effectiveness of the solutions. And at some point you're senior enough that you tell us the problems and you say, hey, I know you told me to go work on activation, but actually I think our issue is brand or I think our issue is quality or I think our issue is whatever it might be, and that's sort of the pinnacle of this way of thinking about it.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:24:30):\nNow just back to this picture for a moment, one of the interesting things that happened was the teams went and they evaluated their teams on these two ax axis and they end up with this sort of curved line between them. It's not linear as you work your way through. And what happens is early in people's career, they mostly sit at that E point, you get handed a problem and handed a solution, handed a how, and you just execute and they gradually grow in skill. Later in people's careers, similarly, you're at that P level, just do bigger and bigger products. And it's like the job of being an entrepreneur or CEO or an owner or so on is just kind of do bigger and bigger projects.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:25:06):\nBut in the middle the slope changes and all of a sudden it's not really about scope, it's about PSHE. And there's a circle drawn here for what I like to call the trough of dissolution. What happens in that phase, I was talking to the calibration companies about this, the reason we call the trough of dissolution [inaudible 00:25:22] is for the employee, for the person, this is a confusing time. Everything about leading up to this moment from high school and college has been about scope. And at this point you're all of a sudden told, we're not judging you on scope anymore, we're judging you on this PSHE thing. That's very confusing.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:25:39):\nTo the calibrator, to the manager, it's also very confusing because all of a sudden the way I put it is the difference between a level three and a level seven may not be scoped. They may do the exact same job, it's how they do the job that matters and here's some language for how they do the job. So PSHE became a very sticky way of thinking about it. It turns out that this way of evaluating people is actually not that specific to product management. It's really easy to see why you do the exact same thing for engineers and designers and so on. But to pick one that may not be as obvious, I'll pick salespeople. A very common thing people do with salespeople is they evaluate them based on quota attainment. It's like the easiest thing to do is take the salespeople and rank them by who hit their quota and who didn't.\n\nShishir Mehrotra (00:26:21):\nYou go ask the sales team, who's the best salesperson and what you'll realize, and they'll say, quota statement is just a signal for how good you negotiate your quota and pick the right territory. And they say, really, you want to know who's a best salesperson. They say, well, so and so, I mean she can sell anything and she can be in the region that's growing or the region that's shrinking or the new product or the old product. If you think about that terminology, it's very similar to PSHE thinking. This is the person who can come into a new space, identify the right problems and solve them. That's what makes a really great salesperson. So it could become my framework for evaluating talent in sort of all sorts of ways. You might recognize a pattern of being a great P thinker, it's very correlated with being good with eigenquestions. Can you spot the right problems is very similar to can you spot the right questions? Can you decide what's important?\n\nLenny (00:27:10):\nOur sixth most popular episode is with Kristen Berman, founder of Irrational Labs on using behavioral science to improve your product. Here is Kristen describing the three Bs of behavioral change.\n\nKristen Berman (00:27:22):\nThere are so many mistakes that humans make and we can call them biases, heuristics, our team uses psychologies. What are the psychologies that drive us? And so to tackle this, our team basically has created a model of behavior change we call the three Bs. And this summarizes the most important psychologies that drive user that are important to the product managers and the marketers. We've used this at Google, Microsoft, LinkedIn, so all the companies that we work with and they now use it.\n\nKristen Berman (00:27:51):\nSo the first B of three Bs framework, first B is actually not a psychology, but it is the most important part of behavior change and it should kind of be obvious. If you think about behavior change, behavioral economics, it is behavior. In order to change behavior, you have to pick a behavior that you want to change. So companies are really good at outcomes, but just not as sharp at picking the behavior.\n\nKristen Berman (00:28:14):\nAnd when I say behavior, I mean action. The thing that you want someone to do, by the way, the only wrong answer here is log in. So it's really, it's not about logging in, it's about what you do after you log in. And when we're consulting teams would be like, we need to get uncomfortably specific. We say just really specific in the behavior. So example, if I'm Peloton PM and I'm working on the app, I would say something like within 7 days of somebody starting the app they do 2, 10 minute workouts with two different instructors. Now obviously that is wildly specific and you'd probably be very happy if they did one workout with one instructor, but the reality is if you don't define that behavior, you're going to change, you can't actually define the psychologies that affects someone's decision making when doing that behavior. So that's a first B.\n\nKristen Berman (00:29:02):\nSecond B, again, is probably pretty obvious and is very critical, it's just barriers. So we need to reduce the barriers to doing the behavior. And there are two types of barriers we look at. One is logistical, so this is just the stuff in our way could be entering a credit card, could be any form field. And then the second is cognitive. So the cognitive barriers get in our way as well. These are things like uncertainty aversion, this is optimism bias, information aversion. Status quo, big one. It's just you do the same thing today that you did yesterday, your job-\n\nLenny (00:29:38):\nCan you talk about those three you just threw out there, just briefly? I'm curious about the specific biases while were there.\n\nKristen Berman (00:29:43):\nYeah, so uncertainty aversion, when something is uncertain or we're not... So I'll give you an example. If you're Lift, there's logistical friction, which is wait time. But then there's also this uncertainty of is it going to come on time? When is it going to come? And with this uncertainty, you're probably going to look for other options. You're going to open up Uber and say like maybe it'll come faster. And so when there is uncertainty in our life, we either look for other options or we just don't make a decision at all. This is by the way, very big in healthcare where when you're very uncertain about something, you may not even go to the doctor or you may just make the wrong decision.\n\nKristen Berman (00:30:24):\nSame with status quo effect. Where we kind of underlying status quo effect is this idea that we always take the path, not always but majority of... You don't really say always when you're talking about human behavior. Human behavior is very complex. But more often than not, we take the path of least resistant. So we do the thing that's easiest and typically the thing that's easiest, it's the thing that we've done yesterday and the day before. So when you're asking someone to do something different, which is what most product, especially startups, are trying to do, you actually have to increase their motivation or make it easier, reduce the barriers to get them to do that. And so status quo effect, it's a big, big one that folks are fighting.\n\nLenny (00:31:03):\nAwesome, thanks for sharing this.\n\nKristen Berman (00:31:05):\nThe third B is benefits. So this is where you want to increase the not just benefits, but the immediate benefits of doing something. So we are all present bias, which means we prioritize our present self over our future self. So there are plenty of reasons that somebody, your customer, your user should take an action, but you actually have to give them a reason to take an action today. So as an example, if you're Asana and you're trying to get someone to log a task, the right thing for them to do is log the task because it's going to get their project done on time. You're going to have a collaborative and communicative team that you're going to want to be on. But one of the real reasons we may log a task is because of completion bias, we want to see the checkbox. We may log it because of social desirability bias, where other people see that we're getting our work done, there's a notification that goes to my teammate when I complete something. So these are the immediate benefits that we have to build into products and features to drive use.\n\nLenny (00:32:06):\nAwesome. I definitely have completion bias, I left checking those freaking check boxes.\n\nLenny (00:32:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\nLenny (00:32:51):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time Lenny's Podcast listeners, get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:33:29):\nThe fifth most popular episode of the year is with the great Elena Verna on B2B growth. Elena is currently head of growth at Amplitude. Prior to that, she was CMO at Miro, she was senior vice president of growth at SurveyMonkey and she might be the smartest person in the world on B2B growth. Just putting that out there. Here are two clips from Elena. The first on why retention is so important to your product and why it's so important to get right. And the second on what to put into your freemium product versus your paid product.\n\nElena Verna (00:34:00):\nI think every single company has to first focus on being product led and retention, period. The only way that you will ever have any chance of acquisition being product led is if you nail your product led retention. Let me break it down. Retention falls into two main KPIs, which is activation and then engagement. If your product is not able to activate and more importantly engage via habitual loops and be in the habit forming zone, then you'll have no chance to hooking an acquisition engine into your product. Because acquisition and product led means users and buy it or users refer or users create content that attracts other users.\n\nElena Verna (00:34:41):\nWell, if your users are not habitually using your product, there's less and less opportunities for you to actually create any sort of product led acquisition. So never start with product led acquisition. You first always have to start with product led retention, activation, and engagement. Then you can choose, is your product has a relationship of one to many? If it has a collaboration at its core, say Slack or Miro or even the Amplitude. Or does it have more of a single mode relationship? So let's say Snowflake, there is not one to many relationships there between users. Well, if you have one to many relationships, product led is a fantastic way for you to prototype that model. If you don't have them, then it becomes increasingly hard. Most of the B2B products don't have that one to many relationship, so it's very difficult to stand up product led acquisition. So you rely on marketing led and sales led and that's fantastic, those are fantastic growth models as well.\n\nElena Verna (00:35:39):\nThe only other question becomes in the self-serve monetization, that's product led. Otherwise you go in the sales led and you chase after those large contract values. And you can still be product led and monetization with sales team via product led sales or you can just be self-serve if you have a specific segment that is valuable for. But the question there is your use cases and your market matureness to handle self-serve or do you need that sales touch? Every industry and every sector is going through transformation at different velocities. So even if you don't have that product like sales or self-serve in your industry now, I guarantee you it will pop up in the next 10 years. And if you are not going to introduce it, you will get disrupted by it.\n\nLenny (00:36:31):\nFor a product leader or founder who's thinking about what they should make free in their freemium model, do you have kind of a mental model of how you think about here's what you should make free? Or, is that too big of a question for a quick answer?\n\nElena Verna (00:36:44):\nSo I mean you first have to align on what your strategic value of free is. I do have a general framework of saying freemium has to check one of these boxes. Does it help my indirect monetization? So some sort of virality or network effects. If it does, I'm probably going to make it free. Does it suffice for every single user regardless of their complexity? If it does, then it's probably commoditization of the feature anyways and I should make it free. Does it help my aha moment? If it does, then I definitely want to have a POC as part of my free and I'm going to put it in the free offering. Does it create habit loops for me? So let's say notifications or some sort of channel communication. If it does, then I'm probably going to put it for free. So anything that actually creates friction for my growth model, I'll probably gate it in the paid. Anything that promotes my growth model, I will put it into free. Now it is very heavily dependent on your actual monetization strategies. So it's a little bit of over encompassing statement, but at the end of the day, I'm thinking about it very much. How does free help me achieve my growth model outcomes without sacrificing monetization potential?\n\nLenny (00:37:57):\nOur fourth most popular episode of the year. Just to put this out there, the next three have came in really close to each other so you can kind of mix and match them in order. But at this point, the fourth most popular episode of the year is with Ethan Smith, CEO of Graphite, and just general SEO guru. Here are two clips from Ethan, one on how people often under invest in SEO. And two, signs that SEO might be right for your product.\n\nEthan Smith (00:38:23):\nI think people under resource SEO a lot of times and over resource ads. So if you're Zillow, you're going to spend tens of millions of dollars on ads, or if you're eBay, you're going to spend tens of millions of dollars on ads. Why would you not have a really great SEO team? Like the amount of traffic you get is probably equal to that. So if you're going to spend a hundred billion on ads, why would you spend $50,000 on SEO? That doesn't make sense.\n\nLenny (00:38:46):\nWhat are just attributes of a product or a company that tell you that SEO could be a growth driver or a massive growth driver? Because I imagine SEO isn't useful for everybody. How do you think about that?\n\nEthan Smith (00:38:59):\nThere's two big things. The first thing is the addressable market large, SO'S the addressable market for SEO large? And for most categories it is. The second is, do you have authority, you have existing traction? If you start from zero and you have no traction. So we talk with seed stage companies and series A companies, typically they don't have a lot of authority and it's too soon. And Google doesn't want you to just be an SEO site and they want you to be a credible domain before they rank you. And if you're starting from zero, they don't have enough signals that you are.\n\nEthan Smith (00:39:33):\nSo the way that we assess that is, the first signal I'll look at is what's your traffic? What's your current traffic? And your non SEO traffic is actually an authority signal. So I'll go into SimilarWeb, I'll put the domain in, I'll look at the total traffic and I'll want to see at least I would say 1,000 visits a day roughly for non SEO at least, if you have five visits that that's very little. And then the second thing I'll look at is the number of referring domains. So I'll go into Ahrefs or Semrush and look up the total number of referring domains. I'll try to have at least 1,000 roughly referring domains. You could grow with less than that and less than 1,000 visits, but it's much harder. And the more you have, the easier it is to grow and the faster you can grow and the more you can grow.\n\nEthan Smith (00:40:19):\nAnd then in terms of the addressable market, that's a little bit more complicated, but most markets are pretty large actually in SEO, but we want it to be large. So With Power is actually an interesting example. So they're a clinical trial lead gen site. They want acquire people to take clinical trials. How many people are typing online, I want to take a clinical trial? Not very many. But the number of people that could be taking clinical trials is very large. And so if we target the persona, what's the key demographic of who might be a candidate for taking clinical trial? It's very, very large. So we can then create content that targets that, like gig economy or college students or people like that. So if you think about targeting the persona, most sites have a very large addressable market.\n\nEthan Smith (00:41:08):\nBut the way that I would think about the addressable market is that which is what product am I offering? What are the use cases for that product? What is the persona? What's the size of that? And then I would assess that typically by looking at external benchmarks. So if I'm a shopping site and I haven't started yet, I can look at other shopping sites, I can see how much traffic they have. So again, I can go into SimilarWeb if I'm Wish.com and I want to see what my traffic potential is, I can put in Walmart and Wayfair, put it in SimilarWeb, look at their total traffic. SimilarWeb's free for all of this. And then I can get a sense of how big I can get.\n\nEthan Smith (00:41:47):\nThe one other thing I'll mention is that there are product competitors and audience competitors. So for something like, I'm at a WeWork right now. So for WeWork, I could look at the traffic for other rental office companies or I could look at companies that are ranking for the kinds of things that I would want to rank for. And they may not be direct product competitors. FinTech is interesting. So for Robinhood, Robinhood could look at other sites that allow you to sell stocks in crypto or they could look at Investipedia. Investipedia doesn't allow you to buy stocks, but they have a bunch of traffic. It's not a product competitor, but it's an audience competitor. And so these competitors basically can tell you what the size of that market is. So that's how I think about the addressable market. So ideally it's large, it typically is. And then the more authority I have, the more I can compete. If I'm starting from zero, it's probably too early. But once I have traction, SEO can then multiply that traction.\n\nLenny (00:42:41):\nWe are now in the top three. Who could it be? Drum roll. The third most popular episode of the year at this point, Shreyas Doshi. Shreyas was a longtime PM at Stripe, before that he was a PM at Twitter at Google and is generally just an incredibly insightful and helpful human constantly sharing his wisdom on Twitter, and now he has his own course on Maven. Here is Shreyas describing the LNO framework, which people have brought up so many times after this episode and that I've personally found incredibly useful.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:43:14):\nWhen I just joined Google as a relatively new PM, this is back in 2008, for the first three years I was overwhelmed and stressed. And that was because, one, I was a new PM in this really high performance environment. I was working on some important products and launches and I just had too much to do. And I look back at that time, and it was perhaps the most stressful time of my career. Where I would work long hours, et cetera, but even at the end of the day, I'd feel highly dissatisfied because my to-do list was endless and I wasn't able to make a dent on it. I was also a little bit of a perfectionist. So I was like, no, no, no, I need to do this well. And yeah, I was just constantly I would come home and talk to my wife and kind of basically just complain to her about how I'm not able to make progress or as much progress as I want. That was accompanied with not being able to sleep very well because I was concerned about how much output I was producing and whatnot. So again, very stressful time in my career.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:44:28):\nAnd then things changed when I discovered the ideas related to this LNO framework in a blog post. Unfortunately I can't even find that blog post somewhere, but it had some ideas that I took and then kind of created this LNO framework on myself, which is essentially that as a product manager or as anybody in a creative high impact, high leverage role, all your tasks are not created equal. There are actually three type of tasks that you end up doing in such a role.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:45:04):\nSo there are L tasks, which are leverage tasks. And the L tasks are such that when you put in a certain amount of effort, you get 10X or 100X in return in terms of impact. So those are L tasks, leverage tasks. Then there are neutral tasks, so that's N. And those are tasks where you basically get what you put in or just a little more than that. So you put in 1X and you get 1.1X. Those are neutral tasks. And then there are overhead tasks where you get back, again in terms of impact, you get back a lot less than you actually put in. And it turns out that many people, people who are ambitious or are perfectionists like myself, they by default treat each of these types of tasks the same way and therein lies the problem. So this was the epiphany for me back at Google when I kind of discovered some of these ideas.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:46:07):\nWhat I realized that is that among the things in my to-do list, there are actually only very few L tasks. And so it made sense for me to focus a lot on those L tasks, to take on those L tasks when I was feeling most productive, most energetic during a certain time of the day. And, for the L tasks, let my inner perfectionist shine because I'm going to get so much more in return. It makes sense for me to spend that time on that PRD for instance, related to an important feature that will meaningfully impact our revenue. I'm going to spend more time on that than I ordinarily would. So now where does that more time come from? Because it cannot come from just working more hours. Well, it comes from spending less time on N tasks and O tasks. And so there are some tasks that you do, a classic example of an O task is say an expense report. It sounds silly, but I used to try to make my expense reports really good.\n\nLenny (00:47:16):\nWow. That's funny.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:47:19):\nSometimes that made no sense. But I was like, no, no, no, I need to do that. And again, this is the silliest example, but there are many examples. And something I realized is that the same type of activity can actually be either an L task or an N task or an O task. So what's an example? So say like a classic PM activity of filing a bug report. And so many companies have these bug templates, et cetera, et cetera, like that you use to file a bug report. Well, it turns out that filing a bug report, depending on the situation, depending on what type of bug it is, can actually be an L task, high leverage task, and over there you want to file a very detailed explicit bug report. In other cases might actually be an O task, where you don't fill out the template that diligently and you don't add 15 screenshots with annotations, instead you just have one screenshot and you hit submit on the bug report. So that shift where usually for the same type of activity we provide the same type of engagement.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:48:30):\nLast example I'll use to illustrate this is taking notes. It turns out even taking notes, taking notes, synthesizing them, and then sharing them can actually be an L task, an N task or an O task depending on what type of notes they are. After I understood this, previously I would just send all notes like I tried to make them really good, which took a lot of time. But then I realized, well, this is a meeting where, yes, I need to send notes, but it's just standard stuff. I just need to quickly list out, all people need to really know is the three action items that came out of the meetings, who owns them. That's it. And it is not about something highly strategic or controversial. Well, in that case, I'm just going to send the notes out the moment the meeting is over, I'm just going to hit send because I've already taken the action items. I'm not going to try to make my notes look great so that others can appreciate, oh Shreyas always sends great notes.\n\nShreyas Doshi (00:49:29):\nOn the other hand, if it was a product review with the CEO about a very contentious topic that you have gone back and forth multiple times and now you made a decision about something, you want to perfect those notes before you send them out. You want to get the language right, you want to be very clear on what the decision is so there's no room for misinterpretation so you don't backtrack afterwards. Or people say, well, but I thought we said this. So that's a case where it's an L task. And yeah, I would say just spend an hour or even two hours perfecting those notes because it's an L task. So hopefully that helps illustrate some of the ideas behind the LNO framework.\n\nLenny (00:50:13):\nRunner up for the most popular episode of the year is my conversation with Marty Cagan. Marty is the legend of legend of product managers. And I'm not surprised this episode was incredibly popular. Here are two my favorite clips for my chat with Marty. One talking about why big companies are just bad at product often. And two, the four steps to be a good product manager.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:50:36):\nSteve Jobs shared his theory from 1995 for God's sake. His argument was, as a company gets bigger, product historically became less important. The people in a company that would be celebrated were marketing people, salespeople, finance people. Because if a company stops innovating, these are the engines for growth. Sales, marketing, or not growth with finance, but cutting cost. And his argument was this happens over time. Pretty soon, these are your leaders, they're the ones that have been promoted. So then what happens? Good product people don't want to work there anymore and they leave and they go to a company that values product. I think that's a better explanation than any other that I've heard. And it was so prescient because when he said this, this had yet to even happen to so many other companies, but it still happens all the time.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:51:47):\nI hate the idea those companies that have separate product owners, because product owner is just an administrative role. Product owners almost never have the skills to be a product manager, and that's a problem. But let's just say there's a product manager and nobody's ever coached this poor person and so they really don't know much. So the first thing that product manager needs to do is get themselves prepared to contribute to their team the way they need to.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:52:14):\nIn general, that means four things. First of all, they have to really get to know the users and customers. The second thing is they have to be an expert in the data. How is your product used? How is that change over time? What's the sales analytics? What's the user analytics? The third thing is, and this is usually the hardest one and it's the one that your stakeholders will judge you on, is you have to learn the different parts of the business. You have to know how it's marketed, how it's sold, how it's paid for, how it monetizes. If there are any compliance, regulatory, privacy, security issues, you need to know what those are. So that you have to convince those stakeholders that you understand what the issues are and you understand what to look for and that you convince them that if there's ever any question you will bring them a prototype that they can see and make sure it's okay. So you need that trust with the different parts of the business. The fourth area is you have to know the competitive landscape, you have to know the industry, you have to know the trends.\n\nMarty Cagan (00:53:20):\nThose are the four things you bring to the team. Realize the designer doesn't have this info, the engineers don't have this info. If the team is going to be an empowered team and they're going to come up with solutions, they need somebody on the team that brings this knowledge, and that is you as product manager. That is the single biggest area empowered teams fall down, the product manager is ill-equipped, or a nice way of saying incompetence.\n\nLenny (00:53:49):\nAnd finally our number one most downloaded, most popular episode of the year, which raced to number one as soon as they came out, is with the one and only Matt Mochary. Matt is a full-time CEO coach. He's worked with CEOs of companies like OpenAI, Coinbase, Notion, Rippling, Angellist, so many other amazing folks that I could just keep listing. In this episode. There are just so many nuggets of wisdom, and I could share 100 clips from just this one episode, but I'm going to choose just two. One, the power of small teams and how small teams often get more work done. And two, advice for having hard conversations with your employees and with people in general. Enjoy.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:54:31):\nMy companies have done a lot of layoffs, and here's why, the companies that I coached. Back in March of 2020, there was a chance that the world economy was imploding. Now, of course, by April and May we realized that wasn't the case, that the tech world kept going. In fact, it was even flourishing. But in March of 2020 we didn't know that. And so if you were being fiscally responsible, you needed to prepare for that eventuality, so you needed pare costs. 80% of costs in any tech company is payroll, is humans. So if you're going to pare costs, you actually have to let go of humans. So almost every one of my companies did, some on the low side of 5%, some on the high side of one company that was is a hotel company let go of 40% because that looks like their business was about to get obliterated. The results were crazy.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:55:29):\nWithin 60 days of each layoff, the CEO reported back to me, it's insane, I don't know how this happened, but the company's now operating better. I'm not talking on a relative scale. I'm talking on an absolute scale. We're putting out more features, more code, our NPS is up. Whatever it is, what whatever department is performing better. And the only answer for it was we've got less people. So it's this coordination, issue is reduced with fewer people in the organization things work better. That's the big realization that most people never discover. So they hit product market fit, they get tons of money for investors, nudged higher, higher, higher, higher. But every additional human you have in your organization causes extra overhead and geometrically so, because now that you have to keep all those people informed, give them all context, make them all feel heard. Because unless they feel like they're contributing and you understand what they're saying, then they feel ignored and they feel passed over and they feel disrespected and grumpy.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:56:36):\nSo there's this morale problem that exists. So there's this friction of information flow and a morale problem that grows and grows and grows. And really the only answer is, I mean, that's why people bring me in because they're growing, growing, growing, and things are breaking. So I have a system that keeps things together. But it doesn't make it like perfect, it just makes it so that the company doesn't fall apart. But really the ideal is just to keep the team super small. And that's what WhatsApp did. That's what Instagram did. That's what Linear is doing right now. That's what Notion has been doing for a while. And those to me are the real success stories.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:57:17):\nWhenever I have a difficult conversation I start it off, hey, this is going to be a difficult conversation. I want you to take a few seconds and prepare yourself. You are not going to enjoy this. What I found is that the way the amygdala gets triggered is often because of surprise. So if you give someone just a few seconds to mentally prepare, then the amygdala often doesn't get triggered nearly as hard because if they're aware that they're going to go into fear, if they're going to go into anger, they're going to go into sadness, then they can see it coming and they go, oh, that's what it is. But if they don't see it coming, just surprise and all of a sudden, it grips their whole brain and now they're in it and they don't even know they're in it. So, that's the first thing I do. This is going to be a difficult conversation. Are you ready? Person says yes. Then I share the news. I'm letting you go. Here's why, da, da, da.\n\nMatt Mochary (00:58:14):\nThen the second, I deliver the message. The third thing is now they're feeling emotions, strong ones. Even though I warned them, they're still feeling them. Now, you want them to be able to release those emotions. And so I say to them, my guess is you're feeling a lot of anger right now, fear, sadness. Is that true? And if so, would you be willing to share with me what you're feeling and what you're thinking? And sometimes they don't answer but many times they do and they share with me and they let it out, and that's important to allow them to let it out. And then I make them feel heard and I actively listen, and that makes them realize that I'm not trying to run away from the pain that they're feeling. I'm not trying to leave them alone with it. I sit with them as they have it, and then I try to help them get through it.\n\nLenny (00:59:06):\nAnd that's our top 10. It was actually really hard to make this list because all 50 episodes have something really fascinating and interesting to share. For example, if you need help with pricing strategy, don't miss the Modavon episode. If you want to get better at communication, don't miss the episode of West Cow. If you're building a marketplace, there's the Hockenmaier episode. If you're trying to figure out your marketing and how to build your marketing function, don't miss the episodes with Emily Kramer and Ariel Jackson. I could keep going, but I'm just going to stop here. I encourage you to check out the full list of episodes in case you're currently facing a problem that one of the episodes can solve.\n\nLenny (00:59:40):\nTo close, this podcasting journey has been so much more fulfilling and exciting and interesting than I ever expected, and I'm so thankful for you for listening and for supporting this podcast, telling your friends about it. I'm also really thankful to our wonderful sponsors for supporting this work. In terms of what's ahead, basically more the same. More amazing guests, more topics that maybe you haven't thought about, that you need help with, maybe more amazing topics that you know need help with that I want to help you solve. I'm still learning how to interview, how to do this podcast, how to make it more amazing, and so my goal is just to continue to refine and iterate and continue making this podcast better and better.\n\nLenny (01:00:22):\nWith that, I'd love to hear from you. What do you love about this podcast? What do you hate about the podcast? What annoys you? What do you find most interesting? I'd love to hear your feedback.

And man, that's not even in the top 10. It's bad, I've done it, it's awful. It's really bad, but far worse is to be in a company that won't die, a zombie, undead company that you hate, but you can't leave. Oof, have I met people like that, and we're having a mental health crisis among founders that's not talked about enough. People have started to talk about the downside mental health risk, obviously the stress of being a founder is hard, but look what's happening to the people that are so-called successes? When you build a company and you sell it out and it becomes something that you find abhorrent, man, maybe you get rich, but it's not good. And so building a company you hate, that becomes a maligned force in the world, that you have to go pretend you weren't involved with or like you feel complicit in... That's way, way worse, and I wish more founders would take that more seriously early on.\n\nLenny (00:00:58):\nToday, my guest is Eric Ries. If you're not familiar with his work, I would be shocked. He is most famous for creating the Lean Startup methodology and movement and also his incredibly influential book, The Lean Startup. He also coined more terms and concepts that are part of the tech culture than anyone I could think of. He currently spends his time advising founders and startups. He was a former founder and CTO, and currently is the founder and executive chairman of the Long-Term Stock Exchange.\n\n(00:01:24):\nThis is now my favorite episode of the podcast and I can't wait for you to hear it. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground, including the current state of the Lean Startup movement, where he sees things heading, what Eric would redo if he could do it over again, misconceptions about the methodology that frustrate him most, how AI will likely impact product development in startups, how to think about MVPs correctly, when to pivot and when to stay the course, also, how to build a business with values that are aligned with human flourishing. Also, tons of amazing stories and lessons, and there's just so much gold in this conversation. And so with that, I bring you Eric Ries, after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Sanity. Your website is the heart of your growth engine. For that engine to drive big results, you need to be able to move super fast, ship new content, experiment, learn, and iterate, but most content management systems just aren't built for this. Your content teams wrestle with rigid interfaces as they build new pages. You spend endless time copying and pasting across pages, and recreating content for other channels and applications, and their ideas for new experiments are squashed when developers can't build them within the constraints of outdated tech.\n\n(00:02:33):\nForward-thinking companies like Figma, Amplitude, Loom, Ride Games, Linear, and more use Sanity to build content growth engines that scale, drive innovation, and accelerate customer acquisition. With Sanity, your team can dream bigger and move faster.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEric Ries (00:04:50):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\nThis just feels very surreal to have you on the podcast. It feels like a surreal experience. You're such a legend in product and in startups, and I'm just really excited to get to learn from you and for listeners to get to learn from you. And my first question, what are you up to these days? I know you work on the Long-Term Stock Exchange. What else is going on in Eric Ries' life?\n\nEric Ries (00:05:10):\nIf you can believe it, The Lean Startup came out in 2011, so it's been a little while now and it's been such a crazy ride. And basically every year since it came out, I keep thinking, \"All right, that's the end. Surely that's enough.\" And just each year it gets crazier and crazier, and new things come my way. So, I'm building the Long-Term Stock Exchange, LTSE, I'm sure we'll talk about, and I spend a lot of time still with founders and with big company execs trying to answer their questions about how to build companies in the right way.\n\n(00:05:41):\nObviously, been sucked into a lot of AI stuff of late, as everybody is, and one of the interesting things that actually surprised me is I spent a lot of time the last 10 years working on the issues of governance and corporate governance and how companies should be structured, not really with an eye towards technology in particular, but just with long-termism and humanism really at its core, and it turns out that those questions have just become really acute for AI companies. So because of my work on governance, I wound up meeting with and getting to work with some of the top AI companies, so that's been really interesting, but I feel like I go where the issues that are on people's minds go, and it kind of pulls me into new and really interesting things all the time.\n\nLenny (00:06:23):\nAmazing, so I'm going to want to talk about all those things as we get into this. Something I wanted to mention is I feel like people don't give you enough credit for how many core concepts of startups and product building you've either invented or popularized. So what I know, obviously Lean methodology, then there's the term MVP, then there's the term pivot, and then also I think A/B testing, customer development, continuous deployment, vanity metrics as a term, I'm guessing there's many more, and then the Long-Term Stock Exchange. And I think the theme I get from this is there's a lot of first principles thinking that you've done, and so just a couple of questions here. One is, did you think you'd have this much impact on startup culture and language? And then just, where do you think this comes from, this first principles thinking that you seem to be really good at?\n\nEric Ries (00:07:13):\nWell, first of all, thank you for saying all that. That's giving me too much credit, but I like the idea that it's going to balance out the too little credit I ostensibly get somewhere else, that's great. To answer your question, no, I didn't know this was going to happen. This is so embarrassing to admit now, but just to give you a sense of how different the world is now than at the time of the financial crisis, I was so embarrassed to be blogging, that I didn't put my name on the blog. I published it anonymously because it wasn't a thing that people did and people told me it would be career suicide. And there were so few startup bloggers at that time, that the top three all reached out to me personally because they saw it in their referrer logs on their website. That's how little traffic they got, that when a new person started writing about their thing and linking to them, they were like, \"Who is this guy? What's going on?\" It was a very different time.\n\n(00:08:07):\nAnd I had just finished a startup. I had left a startup that was being successful, and I had this reputation among VCs that I could make engineering teams be supernaturally productive. I had the magic pixie dust. And so, they would ask me to come in and work with their teams and I would be like, \"No, listen, honestly, I'm not that special. It's nothing to do with me. It's just this framework. I have these ideas that are helpful on a team when they adopt them.\" And they would pat me on the head and be like, \"Yeah, kid, I'm sure that's great, but can you please bring the magic pixie dust to my company anyway?\"\n\n(00:08:38):\nAnd I would go and have these meetings, and I'm not making this up, people would yell at me in the meeting. I would get yelled at. In fact, I would be asked not very kindly to leave, and I'd be like, \"I don't understand. What are you yelling... Why are you mad at me? You asked me for this meeting.\" And they'd be like... I'm just telling you what I witnessed with my own eyes. We at IMVU, we shipped product 50 times a day on average at a time when people were lucky to be doing it monthly if they were really advanced. Remember, it wasn't that long ago that we put the year the product came out in the name of the product. That tells you what cycle times used to be. That was considered normal, and people were like, \"That's impossible. That could never work.\"\n\n(00:09:15):\nAnd at that time, I wasn't even propounding a theory or anything, I was just explaining what I had seen and people couldn't believe it. And so I had this great idea, if I write some of these stories down, then when someone asked me for these... I was doing these meetings all the time. I didn't understand the way Silicon Valley worked at that time, I didn't understand why this was happening to me, having these meetings, and I said, \"I'll write the story down and then I'll send people the essay, and if they think it's crazy, then we don't have to have the meeting and I won't get yelled at.\" That was really as far ahead as I was thinking at that time. And then it basically took over my life, and I was being asked to speak, but people really wanted to unmask the anonymity. Who is this person? And so I came clean, I identified myself and started writing and speaking and working with companies, and it became a whirlwind.\n\n(00:09:58):\nThe first principles part of it, I don't know, I've always been wired that way. I feel like maybe I'm a failed scientist. I wish I was actually good at chemistry or something. I could have actually been a real scientist, but I always really had a respect for the truth for scientific thinking. That was a big cultural value that I was raised with. My parents are doctors, it was just definitely part of my upbringing, and I was really into reading stuff that worked that way. So, it was very natural for me. I felt like as I had success as an entrepreneur, I wanted to know, why does this work? And people gave me advice. All the advice used to be of the form, \"Steve Jobs once did this thing, so if you do it too, you'll be like Steve Jobs.\" And it's like, well, he also wore the black turtleneck. Is that also part of the... Help me understand, why does it work and is it still appropriate? Does it make sense for that industry or not? I didn't like these just so stories.\n\n(00:10:44):\nAnd I realized looking back, I didn't have this understanding at the time, but looking back, I feel like first principles thinking, it really has two components that people pretend are one thing, and it's more one than the other. A lot of my work is just descriptive. It's not actually telling people what to do, it's simply giving a name and a concept to a thing that already happens. That's the funniest part. In the early wave of criticism against Lean Startup, people were very angry at the idea that I was saying that a startup is an experiment like, \"You can't treat a startup like an experiment.\" I was like, \"Well, you could treat it however you want, but it is an experiment.\" People would like, \"Well, people don't like the concept of pivot.\" This anti-pivot people, anti-MVP people every once in a while come out of the woodwork still to complain about it.\n\n(00:11:25):\nIt's like, \"well, I'm not telling you that you should pivot. I'm just saying that is what it's called when you change the strategy, but try to have fidelity to the vision.\" It needs a name because we do it all the time and even when we don't do it, we talk about doing it. We can't reason about it, we can't... And so this is descriptive part, and then that's the real work, honestly, is just saying what is... To me, the big question from the beginning was, what is a startup really? Why is it so different from a big company? Why are none of the best practices that I learned in my career work? It was like a survival mechanism, I want to know. And then once you've identified what it is and laid out the original principles of what you're trying to do, the prescriptive parts are just a matter of deductive logic.\n\n(00:12:10):\nIt's like, \"Well, given that we've made this hypothesis, what are the implications of that?\" And of course, the prescriptive parts are important because that's how you learn whether your hypothesis is correct. So, that's the other thing I think people don't appreciate. People call me a first principles thinker, which I love that, it's a big compliment, but I feel like it conjures up for people this idea that I sit in a cave for years and years and conjure up the magic idea. It's like, no, I wish people had all the outtakes of all the concepts I've tried. Lean Startup was not my first try, the conceptual vocabulary. It's not the first time I got it right. It came through a lot of trial and error, a lot of trying to figure out what works and doesn't work, first in my own career, in my own work, then trying to give advice to other people and trying to translate what worked for me to see what would work for them, and then to answer the questions that I thought were the natural ones.\n\n(00:12:57):\nUnder what circumstances does it work and when would it not be appropriate? What predictions does the theory make that we could then go see if are true or not true? And then the bigger picture thing is, what are we really doing here? What does success even look like? That, I think, is the thing we all really grapple with is it's very easy to come up with a theory or a method or a process that produces the maximum of something, but then it's like, \"Is that thing good? Is that actually helping us accomplish some kind of goal?\" And so, I think that first principles thinking is very helpful for that too, but I don't know. I guess to really answer your question, the true answer is I don't know. I've just always felt like I was wired that way. I have a love of ideas and want to know why things work.\n\nLenny (00:13:39):\nSo to me, a couple of takeaways from what you just shared. One is just you're wired to think in this specific way of thinking very logically, scientifically, I have a similar feeling where someone tells me a story... The way I started writing partly is people kept asking me questions about how Airbnb did stuff because they're building their marketplace. I'm like, \"Here's what they did, but who knows if that was the way to have done it?\"\n\nEric Ries (00:14:01):\nExactly. Did they succeed because of that or in spite of that?\n\nLenny (00:14:05):\nLet's dig into the Lean Startup method and methodology. It feels like we haven't heard an update on just how things are going, where it's going, how popular it continues to be. I'm curious just, what's your sense of the state of the Lean methodology in the Lean Startup movement?\n\nEric Ries (00:14:21):\nOh, it's an interesting question. We used to do a Lean Startup conference every year, and then I stopped because of COVID and we haven't resumed yet. So, it was like we used to have an annual opportunity to bring people together, assess the state of things, hear the latest updates and stories, and then I really feel the lack of it, I miss it. We tried to do online versions, but it didn't feel right to me. And that's partly COVID and the thing that our world has been going through the last few years, but it's also partly I didn't understand what it would be like to start a movement until I'd actually done it. And I remember the first conferences we did, the first events we did had the feeling of a religious revival. People were like, \"We've got the new thing. We are going to stick it to the man.\"\n\n(00:15:04):\nAnd I really thought, \"My job is going to be to lead these hordes into battle.\" I really had a martial metaphor. I used it just a second ago, combat of ideas. I was ready for, the old ideas are going to fight us to the death and we're going to win it, and it's not like that at all. We charge onto the field and no other army ever came to charge us back, just we won by default because the people who were doing it the old way didn't really like it or want... It was very few defenders of the old way. There were very few people who came out and said, \"Actually, no, Stage-Gate is actually still the correct product idea. You've got it wrong.\" It never happened, and in fact, the fancy startup people went from dismissing it as totally pointless to complaining that it was overhyped and over before ever passing through the intervening stage of finding out what it was. That was really interesting. I'll never forget, TechCrunch had an article, this is years and years ago about how Lean Startup is overhyped, and I was like, \"You haven't even talked...\" That was the first entry point to talking about it. I was like, \"Could you at least learn to use the word pivot correctly and then criticize it for being overhyped? Is that all possible?\" So, it went from insurgent revival to just the default thing that people did. Even the people that disagree have to carry the meme in order to criticize it. So, it was fascinating to find myself on the other side of this thing, and I would meet young founders coming into the industry for the first time, and they're like, \"It seems obvious,\" and I'm like, \"It was only five years ago that people thought this was so crazy they're yelling at me, now you think it's obvious?\"\n\n(00:16:48):\nIt's really interesting to have something go from controversial to obvious, and of course, tons of people who were really opposed to it at the beginning came back. Now they say that they knew it all along and they were my big... You see how it changes people's minds. So, it's hard to generate that religious energy and excitement around something that everyone views as obvious, and it really was hard for my... Just as an ego matter, I want the validation of the winning and the this, and I realized at a certain point that the victory is not that this fancy company used it or whatever, the victory actually is in the stories that people tell me about how the book was helpful to them.\n\n(00:17:26):\nThat's the whole ball game. No one had to lose in order for us to win. People don't do this as much anymore, but occasionally someone still who wants to make a fight between Lean Startup and Agile or Agile and design thinking or this and that... And I tried really hard. If you look at Lean Startup, it's full of citations and connections to Six Sigma and lean manufacturing and design thinking and customer development and DevOps and software craftsmanship and everything I could find. I really wanted to show how these things work together, and then we went through a phase where people wanted me to make it into a religion for real. People used to write me and say, \"So-and-so on the internet is right about Lean Startup in they're wrong. You need to make them stop.\" It's like, \"What power do you think I have to make someone stop writing? I think they can write whatever they want.\"\n\n(00:18:13):\nAnd then the other thing that people said was, \"Well, Lean Startup is about this particular set of practices. If someone finds a new practice, they're at heretic and need to be excommunicated.\" And it's like, \"Guys, no, no, no. I wrote extensively in the book... Did you read? It's a scientific theory, which means that whatever works is Lean Startup. So if someone comes up with something new and it works, we can't be threatened and upset about it, we have to adopt it.\" Well, when you have that attitude that whatever works is the thing that the truth is what matters and people's quiet moments of helpfulness, that's our metric of success, it kind of takes the hype and drama and stuff that drives press coverage and what takes it all out of it, and I don't miss it at all. I feel much happier doing that than I ever did when... I used to travel a lot and do a lot more public stuff, and I think partly, again, one of the changes of COVID and conferences went away for a while, so it was a quiet time, but I feel like it's actually been really amazing. That's what victory looks like. They don't throw you a parade and say the thing... And even though people who are your critics will still grumble about it, but at the end of the day, the new entrepreneurs who come in just take for granted that this is the conceptual vocabulary of entrepreneurship, and then they do with it what they will, and I've learned to really appreciate that. As much as my ego, of course, likes to get into fights with people. It's like, \"No, that's actually better, and that's what winning looks like.\"\n\nLenny (00:19:41):\nIt's so interesting that it's just you've done so well in communicating these ideas that it's just become part of the culture, and people don't even think about, \"Oh, Eric Ries came up with all these things.\" I also feel like people push back at you on the things they disagree with, and then they never give you credit for the things that work great. It's only like, \"Oh, no, MVPs don't work anymore.\"\n\nEric Ries (00:20:05):\nOnce a year at least, someone still writes to me and says that we should have used a different term for MVP, that the misconceptions around MVP are driven by the choice of the term. And I always write them back and say like, \"Please tell me the better term and popularize it and I'll use it. It's a great idea.\" I'm more aware of the limitations than anybody else. And I'll tell you another thing that I think people don't appreciate enough, everyone wants to be a thought leader these days. It's like a disease. When Clay Christensen died, I knew him and admired him a great deal, and his endorsement of my work was one of the most important...\n\n(00:20:39):\nFor me, from the old guard of management thinkers, for him to say that it was worthwhile was really a big deal to me. And yet there was this big debate, it's now a little bit older now, about whether he's responsible for all the bad things people have done in the name of disruption. And the first part of me is like, \"That's an outrageous slander on Clay. That's so unfair, a bunch of tech bros like use disruption as a code word for all kinds of dumb stuff has nothing to do with his theory, has nothing to do with his work.\" It's like, \"Have they even read the work, man?\" I was one of his defenders, and especially after he passed, I was very emotional about it, it's not fair.\n\n(00:21:16):\nBut then the more that I've sat with it, the more I thought, \"Gosh, maybe we are a little bit responsible for the things we put into the world,\" and it's terrifying because of course, you can't control what people do, you can't control... A lot of people are willfully ignorant. Whenever someone says something where I'm like, \"Gosh, five seconds on Wikipedia, and they could have found out the truth about the thing they're talking about.\" So, we live in an era where ignorance is optional, that's cool, but also a little bit scary. So I think taking on that responsibility, this is true for anyone who makes a product. I think it's not actually unique to authors at all. When you make something, put it out into the world, on the one hand, you don't have any control about what happens next, and yet I do think we bear a certain responsibility about, was it in fact a net positive? Was it helpful to people?\n\n(00:21:59):\nIt's part of what motivates me to try to really get it right and not just get it right for my own satisfaction, but get it right as evidenced by what happens when people use it. And that's why testing and experimentation is such a big part of my life and my theory. To me, that's how we square the circle of our responsibility in a highly uncertain world is you go find out what happened when people use the idea and if it's not right, even after their misunderstandings, it's still not right, then you've got to make it better and find a way to communicate it more clearly, so it's kind of an eternal challenge, but I think an important one.\n\nLenny (00:22:35):\nAlong those same lines, is there a misconception of Lean Startup or any of the other things you put out that just really frustrates you, that just is a recurring misconception that people just continue to get wrong?\n\nEric Ries (00:22:47):\nI wrote an article, God, five or 10 years ago. God, I can't even remember how many years ago now. It was like Top Misconceptions About Lean Startup, and it was like, \"Number one, lean means cheap, so if you're doing Lean Startup, it means you're not raising money.\" And it's like, \"That's not true.\" And then kind of I remember what they are... And they're all still prevalent, nothing's changed. I could write that same article today. It's like, \"Lean is opposed to having a vision. If you were really visionary, you wouldn't do experimentation. Experimentation leads to local maxima,\" and whatever.\n\n(00:23:20):\nI read it in somebody's book that that's what Lean is about. And I was like, \"Man, did I forget to write it in the...\" I was so gaslighted that I actually went back and cracked open a copy of the Lean Startup, and I was like, \"On what page do I address this?\" It was like on page nine in the introduction, one of the first things in the book, I was like, \"Phew, I did say it,\" so that's pretty common, that turn the crank thing about optimization, that's pretty common, and then pivots, people perennially misunderstand what a pivot is, and again, whether that's a descriptive or a prescriptive thing is really tricky.\n\n(00:23:54):\nI feel like at this point people are just being willfully ignorant. It's okay to criticize Lean Startup, that's no problem. It doesn't bother me. I think it's good to do, it's healthy to do so, but to just trot out those same old things, how does that advance the state-of-the-art? And how does that help entrepreneurs in any way? And I'm not even really sure what they're trying to accomplish by doing that. That's the thing that I've grown confused about is, what is the purpose of this discourse, other than just to kind be reflexively contrarian? I don't know.\n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nAnd get some likes on Twitter/X.\n\nEric Ries (00:24:27):\nMaybe you're right.\n\nLenny (00:24:29):\nSo along those same lines, so you wrote the book 12 years ago. If you could go back and change something in the book, is there something that you would want to change?\n\nEric Ries (00:24:39):\nOh man, I would change everything about it. It's actually why I won't let myself do it. When I was a consumer of books, I hated it when authors would come out with a second edition that would destroy what was beautiful about the first edition, including the mistakes because in their attempt to put disclaimers on everything and make everything more nuanced, you'd totally lose the thrust of the argument of the thing they were trying to do, and their own becoming famous really messes with you psychologically. So, you don't want to expose your readers to that. Go get therapy, don't destroy the thing that made your book amazing. So as an author, of course, I think so many elements of it could be improved. The one that is the most glaring to me... Well, I guess there's two. I'll mention two just because they're relevant.\n\n(00:25:26):\nOne is I'm a little embarrassed, there's a chapter towards the end of the book where I talk about the scaling of Lean Startup. So it's like, \"Okay, you've had success. Now, what are the principles for how you scale up a big enterprise now that has many Lean Startups within it?\" And stuff like that, and I don't think I wrote anything wrong in that section, but I really cringe to read it now because it's so blithe and just like, \"Step one, do this. Step two, do that.\" It makes it sound so easy and so simple.\n\n(00:25:53):\nAnd of course, I've subsequently written a whole book longer than Lean Startup just to illuminate those principles and explain how they work in real life because I actually had the privilege of getting to go do that with companies at really extraordinary scale. So, I'm a little embarrassed now to be like, \"I made it sound so easy.\" I hate to mislead any entrepreneurs into thinking any part of entrepreneurship is going to be easy because it's just setting people up for disappointment. And the other funny bit is, you know that meme on Reddit, the Star Wars meme where Anakin Skywalker says, \"I'm going to change the world for the better,\" and then pause, and then she's like, \"For the better, right?\" I feel like that is the meme of our time for the tech industry. Every company was about changing the world and we forgot to ask, for the better? I always just took it for granted that our goal was to make the world a better place. That's the values I was raised with. That's what I thought we were doing, and I was railing about it for a while. I would get depressed. Remember, don't be evil? And there's been all these moments in the tech industry where it seemed like we were going to really do something extraordinary, and then just the things that these companies become is so depressing. And I was like, \" Well, I at least made it clear.\" And then I was like, \"Did I?\"\n\n(00:27:04):\nAgain, I actually went back and reopened the book and I was like, \"Did I tell anybody that they should change the world?\" And if I did, I assume I specified for the better, and it's actually right there in black and white. Right in the introduction of Lean Startup, one of the... It's like a throwaway line, \"This is the technique that will give the entrepreneurs of tomorrow the tools they need to change the world.\" And I'm like, \"No, I should have said for the better. I didn't know I had to say it. I thought it was obvious. I thought we all agreed.\" So, I kind of feel like that is also a major oversight and I'm making light of it now, but it's had catastrophic consequences. Not really, I don't think Lean Startup has led people in that way. I think it has much more to do with other social forces, but I feel bad that I missed my chance to take a stand on something that has turned out to be quite important.\n\nLenny (00:27:47):\nSo, you saw me tweet a call for people to ask questions.\n\nEric Ries (00:27:52):\nYes, I'm really excited.\n\nLenny (00:27:53):\nSo, I have a few questions from the audience. The first is around the concept of MVPs. So Karri Saarinen, who was actually on the podcast recently-\n\nEric Ries (00:28:03):\nOh, great.\n\nLenny (00:28:04):\n... Founder of Linear, had a question around MVPs. And his question is essentially, If you still believe that MVPs, essentially shipping very basic versions and iterating is the way to go, given that user expectations have risen a lot in any markets, iOS apps, for example, web productivity software, things like that.\n\nEric Ries (00:28:22):\nI love that question because first of all, I get it a lot, and also it's important for us to really understand. People think that MVP is about a specific tactic. So, an MVP is like a bare bones, stripped down the thing that will crash your computer, but it's not anything to do with MVP. MVP is simply for whatever the hypothesis is that we're trying to test, what is the most efficient way to get the validation we need about whether a hypothesis is true or not? And so, part of a successful test is to understand what are the demands of customers in our market. Now, the funny part is people have a real fear of failure in product we all have this deep, deep, deep fear. So the first answer is, you think user expectations are high in the iOS App Store, you should try the purchasers of battery backup systems for data centers or people who build deep sea oil drilling machines or jet engine.\n\n(00:29:22):\nI've worked with companies where the standards are actually really high and it makes iOS apps seem like pretty basic. It's like, \"Well, nothing blows up like your app,\" but even in these really high end industries in really high stake situations, the cost of offering someone to buy something that they don't like, it's really not that high. They just say no, and a lot of MVP is just about containing the liability of making a mistake. So yes, one of the things I really encourage people to do is go find 10 customers, not 10 million, but find 10 customers. Get them to use the product and have them tell you what's awful. That's okay, and I used to be so upset... When I used to launch a product if customers would argue with me, people used to be like, \"You idiot, I can't believe you launched this product without features X, Y, Z. They're so essential.\"\n\n(00:30:11):\nAnd I would be like, \"You're wrong...\" I'd got to get mad at them, but then I got a little smarter. I'd be like, \"X, Y, Z, you say?\" And I'd be like taking notes, \"Oh, interesting.\" Now, sometimes X, Y, Z would be the exact next three features of my roadmap, and again, I would want to argue with them as, \"I know knew that...\" And I eventually used to be like, \"Oh, thank you for that wise feedback.\" And then when we launched X, Y, Z, they would feel a sense of ownership. \"Wow, I'm the one who told him to do that. He wouldn't have even done it.\" But of course, the thing we're really afraid of as entrepreneurs, I think if we're really honest, it's not that people say, \"You idiot, you didn't launch without X, Y, Z,\" people will say, \"You idiot, you launched without A, B, C.\"\n\n(00:30:44):\nAnd you're like, \"What the hell is A, B, C?\" Never heard of that. That's the much more common response that I get. So, let's grant the premise of the question that expectations are high, and if we launch an app and it doesn't meet people's expectations, they won't like it. First of all, what really are the consequences of that? In an early part of Lean Startup, we had to do a lot to explain to people the difference between a product launch and a marketing launch. And you can launch the product to customers without telling anybody that you did that. It's okay. No one's going to find out, it's not going to be big news. And of course, once you're a big successful company, that's a totally different issue where now you put your corporate brand on stuff, but if you're an actual startup, nobody cares. So, it's okay to try it.\n\n(00:31:29):\nBut the other thing that I think people don't appreciate is that MVP is very flexible. So, if you tell me... When I work with entrepreneurs, I'm like, \"Listen, I'm sorry, our customer is... The bar is here and the thing just has to be that good.\" I'm like, \"Excellent, and it can't have very many features, I guess, can it?\" They're like, \"Well, what do you mean?\" \"So, you just told me the bar is way up there, so we better do just the one critical feature at that level of quality, and then if that works, we'll do the next one.\" And then of course they're like, \"Oh, no, no, no, I need to do all the features at all the quality.\" It's like, \"Well, then what are we testing?\" It's like, \"By the time you find out whether that's any good...\" And if you look at the pivot stories, I'm sure you found this too.\n\n(00:32:06):\nVery often 90% of the work in the first version is thrown away no matter how high quality it was. In fact, as an engineer, that was part of my original disillusionment with the Agile software movement then ultimately with Lean Startup is that people promised me that if I followed these best practices, I would eliminate waste from my work, but if I build something that customers don't want, that's the ultimate waste and nobody protected me from that. So, I don't really care how high quality the initial MVP is because quality is defined by the customer. And if we don't know who our customer is, we literally don't know what the word quality means. So, that's where I think founders really run into trouble and everyone's like, \"Well, I'm Steve Jobs, I'm this, I have the magic taste.\" And it's like, \"Well, first of all, do you have the years and decades of failures and experience from which that taste derives?\"\n\n(00:32:55):\nIf you do that then I'm like, \"I'll give you the benefit of the doubt.\" And if you don't then, \"Definitely don't rely on that, definitely do some experimentation. Go get those scars.\" But even if you have a taste, if you're completely right, what can it hurt to double check? My view was like, \"Oh, let's have 10 customers look at it and have them throw up about how it's so horrible, that at least confirms that we're on the right track.\"\n\n(00:33:13):\nAnd then we call it establishing a baseline when we talk about innovation accounting and the metrics side of Lean Startup. Let's go find out how bad the situation is right now, so that we can then know that we improve from it. Because the thing I actually see from people who in the name of quality will wait a long time to ship a product is they ship it with really high quality and nobody uses it, and now we don't know why. Is it because our idea of quality is wrong? Is it because the value prop is fundamentally... I feel like building a high quality wrong value prop is nothing to be proud of. There's no craftsmanship in that. I once had a company that built a really beautiful product, amazing land, everything was awesome, but there was a JavaScript error where when you clicked the download button, the signup button, whatever, it didn't click. So, they launched this thing and it had 0% signups.\n\nEric Ries (00:34:00):\n... click. So they launched this thing, it had 0% signups and they're like, \"It's a catastrophe. We made the wrong value prop.\" It's like, how do you know? From one experiment you can never know. You have to be willing to do a series of experiments. Again, the logic of MVP is just, products take time to build. The best products in the world, everything takes time. It takes a month, a year. AI will mean I could build any product I want instantly. But it's not instantly, it's going to take time.\n\n(00:34:28):\nDuring that time that the product is under construction, there's going to be some moment in time when you have half the product. Just logically speaking, you first have 10%. When you have half the product, let's have customers use half the product. Well, it doesn't cost you anything extra. You had to do it. You build a natural experiment anyway. Have them use it and tell you it's only half as good or it's unusable, because it's so bad. Excellent, good.\n\n(00:34:51):\nThe startup literature is littered with examples of people where less is more, where the crappy small thing they did turned out to be more valuable than the competitor. I'll just give you one example, one of my favorites. I come from 3D graphics and avatars and metaverse stuff, which of course, now is bad. It's one of these things goes through these hype cycles and I'm like, \"Are we actually in the hype cycle or are we the drops?\"\n\nLenny (00:35:12):\nI think it's trending up right now.\n\nEric Ries (00:35:14):\nAre we trending up again?. It's really hard for me to keep track. Even while I was working on it, every few years it was either the future or nobody wanted to do it. I bet sales of [inaudible 00:35:25] crash, you'll probably have that cyclical thing to them. When it's hot, people read it, otherwise not. Anyway, we built a version, our first version of IMVU we built with 3D avatars in a cafe or in a scene. The avatars were all anchored in place because we didn't have the technology called inverse kinematics. We didn't have the technology that would allow an avatar to stand up and walk. When you do this 3D grab, it has to work perfectly. The feet have to actually glide along the surface and it doesn't look right. You wind up in the uncanny valley and people find it horrible. So we're like, \"Can't have that.\" So we just have the avatar to sit there. People felt the product was claustrophobic. They would always be like, \"The Sims lets me move around. Why am I stuck here in the chair?\"\n\n(00:36:01):\nThat was a very common thing in customer feedback. We were like, \"We can't afford to do the expensive thing. We couldn't do it, couldn't do it.\" One day as a hack, as like a little demo, I was like, \"Well, I'll just change it so that when you click in the scene to a different spot, we'll just stop rendering the avatar in the first place and we'll put it in the second place.\" We didn't even do the proper cut. The camera would zoom over there. It was really ugly. I was really embarrassed about it. I was like, let me just play around with it and see what happens.\n\n(00:36:29):\nWe shipped it to cut and I was like, this is below the quality bar. I felt bad as the engineer. Everyone involved felt really bad, but we had committed ourselves that we're going to try to experiment with stuff. We're going to see what happens. This is before Lean Startups existed. We didn't even have the concept of MVP. We're going to try it and just see what happens. We shipped it and nothing happened. No one cared. I was like, whew. Then we used to do these daily tracking surveys. We'd just sample people and ask them what they think of the product. In the tracking surveys, people started to say that IMVU was the most advanced avatar product they'd ever used.\n\n(00:37:03):\nPeople would be like, we used to be compared to the Sims unfavorably. Now people would be like, more advanced than the Sims. I was like, what does this mean? How did we get more of, did we improve our 3D graphics design? No one could understand why they were saying that. We used to do customer interviews. Finally, a customer was like, \"It's so great, man. In InView, when you want to go somewhere, you teleport. The Sims, you got to wait for the guy to get up and walk around. It's so annoying.\" We were just like, \"Oh, my God. Embarrassing.\" We didn't do inverse kinematics for a really long time.\n\nLenny (00:37:35):\nI love that story. Something that I'm learning as you talk about MVP is that the idea of minimum is very fluid and very context specific. Essentially, the message isn't, build something low quality and simple. It's, figure out what is that minimum bar for your market and product. The message is just build as little as possible, whatever that is for you.\n\nEric Ries (00:37:57):\nYeah, as little as necessary. It's fascinating. I'm not joking, I've worked on jet engines and robotics and cancer therapies and all kinds, I've worked on stuff anyway, and LTSE, it took us 10 years to build the MVP for LTSE. So it doesn't necessarily mean cheap low quality. It's just whatever your hypothesis is, whatever you actually believe is going to work, let's put that thing to the test. That's all I really want. When I work with companies, first time founders especially are usually very stubborn about this and they don't want to do it. It's like, \"Look, you tell me what you believe. I don't have to be right and I want to just double check that you're right by however we do it.\" And then once people actually start to turn that idea over in their mind, they often will be like, \"Well, you know...\" A classic one is like, we can't sell the thing until we build the physical equipment.\n\n(00:38:48):\nIt's like, is your product bought in a showroom where people see the physical equipment? No, they buy it from a brochure. So it's like, \"Okay, well how about we send them a brochure and ask them to pre-order it?\" And then it's like, what? I can't do that. I can't have a crappy brochure. It's like, who said a crappy brochure? We can build a really high quality brochure in a tiny fraction of the time it takes to build the actual machine. And then it's like, well then what are you talking about, it has really good fonts and it has pretty pictures? Maybe. What's your theory, right? You tell me what do you believe about... And they're like, \"Well, actually what matters is the quality of the specifications of the equipment in the brochure.\" It's like, now we've got the leap of faith assumption. Let's go find out.\n\n(00:39:29):\nAnd they're like, but hold up. But we don't know what those specifications are going to be yet. It's like, well, I saw this 500 page plan over here. What do you want it to be? It's like, well, it'd be really great if customers would accept this set of performance characteristics. Well, let's go promise that because maybe they'll be like, \"That's great.\" And I'll give you one example. I was mentioning data centers. There's a team that sold equipment and data centers. They had a serious high-end team of PhDs working on research to make the thing way more efficient and they're going to win a Nobel Prize in material sciences in order to make this product a reality. And I convinced them, instead of paying three years and $18 million, so you don't make the thing, let's go take a brochure, take it to some customers.\n\n(00:40:13):\nAnd I'll never forget, they took the thing into the brochure, they took it into customers and customers laughed them out of the room and it was nothing to do with anything they cared about. It was nothing to do with efficiency where they're like, we would never buy this. And they were like, \"But you haven't even looked to page two to see how efficient it is.\" They were like, \"We don't pay for efficiency, we build data centers. How much they cost to operate is somebody else's problem.\" You're like, \"Oh my God.\"\n\n(00:40:37):\nThat's the thing people don't appreciate, is these insights are so obvious in retrospect that everyone's convinced that it won't happen to them. When I teach students at Lean Startup, they're like, \"This is so dumb.\" They do one case after another in business school and they're like, \"Dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy, dummy, right?\" They're like, \"I would never make that mistake.\" And I'm always like, \"Look, you don't have to argue with me. Just call me back when you get a job. And when you make one of these mistakes, remember we had these conversations and go read the book then.\" And I guess by random chance there are some people in the world that just never made a mistake.\n\n(00:41:11):\nThe dice, you roll enough dice, somebody had the experience that dice came up double sixes every time. Okay, so there are those people and they give a lot of the advice in the world, but I don't know that it's necessarily those of us who don't have the double six luck should necessarily be following it.\n\nLenny (00:41:26):\nThis will be a really good segue to talk about pivots because again, a big part of your message is a lot of the work you're doing is just going to go to waste anyway. Why spend all this time building it? But just to put a final point on this idea of MVP, because a lot of questions came in around just like, what is an MVP? Ben Silbermann, the co-founder of Pinterest, has this quote, he didn't ask a question in our thread, but he has this quote-\n\nEric Ries (00:41:47):\n[inaudible 00:41:47]\n\nLenny (00:41:46):\nYeah. And his quote is, the hard part about MVP is that you don't know what minimum is. You don't know what viable is. And so just to give founders who are trying to figure out what that line is, some very succinct advice, how would you describe just helping them understand, here's how far you should go with your MVP.\n\nEric Ries (00:42:05):\nHe didn't say, you also don't know what product is. That's true. I can't tell you how many times a service has turned out to be a product or vice versa. People embody their insight about customers in the wrong way all the time. That's super common. That's funny.\n\n(00:42:20):\nAll the criticisms of MVP are really just people expressing their frustration with how uncertain startups are. It's like, yeah, it really sucks. This is not a good way to make a living. If you want to retain your mental sanity, if cognitive dissonance, if you find that painful, this is not the right job for you. Because it's really hard to hold in your head, I have this ambitious vision. I know what's going to work. You got to do confidence, get everyone together. There's no substitute in this world for a human being stepping forward and just saying, \"I am going to make this thing happen.\" And if you do that, you're putting yourself away on a limb. It's really difficult. It's really hard to admit that. And I also do not know how to make it happen. That's the truth. Whether you admit it or not, that's the truth.\n\n(00:43:02):\nSo that's why I say let's just double check. So simple, succinct advice. The first tip is, write out the list of features that are necessary in your MVP. Cut it in half and cut it in half again and build that. Honestly, if you just do that, that's really not that bad. The nice thing about MVP is it's one of those U-shaped curves where if you get even in the vicinity of optimal, you're going to be fine. And most people's natural idea of what is necessary is so laughably wrong. People are naturally off by usually one or two orders of magnitude, right? Very common for you to meet a team that is trying to do 100 times more work than is necessary to test their assumption.\n\n(00:43:38):\nSo first thing is just, try being uncomfortably small in the thing that you actually make. And if you're having trouble with that in the startup way and the SQL Lean startup, I really go through because it's really more for a corporate large company audience. I really go through, okay, if you want to have a process for determining what to do here, you should first brainstorm your leap of faith assumptions and categorize them this way and select them like this. Okay, now for each assumption, brainstorm the metrics you might use. Select the metric you want, what is your learning metric, and then from there, brainstorm, MVP, score them according to this formula and then use that to help people.\n\n(00:44:17):\nAnyway, people can follow that if they want. The thing I learned is that if people are having trouble coming with MVP, the problem is usually upstream in the chain of deductive reasoning from the vision down to the MVP. Usually people are just not super clear on what do I want to learn, and the most common reason is because people don't want to admit that they don't know. So as an entrepreneur to say that we want to test to find out what customers want is really hard.\n\n(00:44:41):\nI'll give you an example from my own experience. LTSC, I said, it's taken us 10 years to get the thing approved and going. It's a really very difficult product to build. One of the early iterations of it that didn't work, we were building on partner infrastructure. It was a very different product back then. I don't want to get into all the legal nitty-gritty, it's kind of dry. But anyway, it took us six whole months. It took us time, we had to raise the money, build the team, do all stuff, get all the lobbyists and lawyers, everything in place, and then we had to go do this partnership agreement. The partnership agreement itself took six months to get in place, and then we had to go to the SEC and get approval. And so it was a very complicated multi-stage process. Probably took, I think I just described two years of my life end to end there.\n\n(00:45:23):\nAnd the whole time I was talking to the team about our goal with this whole thing is to learn what is actually necessary to get customers to list on our stock exchange. Our goal was learning. People were like, but I thought our goal was to get this contract done. I thought our goal was to, it's like, well, yes, but the reason we're doing those things is so that we can learn whether this is actually going to work or not. And so I remember, I'll never forget during the contract negotiations, people were like, we got to take an extra week to deal with this point, and I'd be like, \"We don't have an extra week.\" It's like, but this thing's taken two years. What's a one week? I'm like, \"No, every day is so [inaudible 00:45:54] we have to get the learning as soon as possible.\" And I was constantly haranguing everybody involved.\n\n(00:45:58):\nWe got to go faster, faster, faster. You've got to give on this point, people were walking all over us. We were getting just destroyed in the negotiation. I was the weakest lamest person, rather just like, we got to raise the money, anything to get speed. Anyway, long story short, we get all the way to the end. We get the thing approved by the SEC staff and then we get ambushed. And long story short, the SEC withdraws their approval and the whole thing is dead. The partner, we have to break up the partnership agreement, everything goes to hell. And I thought the company was going to die, and it was a totally miserable time. It was one of the worst things that ever happened to me in my life. I was totally upset. And in retrospect, I can laugh about it because it turns out, of course, it was the worst thing that ever happened to me, but it's actually the best thing that ever happened to me, as a lot of startup things are.\n\n(00:46:39):\nBecause from that, we were able to pivot into the thing that ultimately got us approved. The reason I tell this story is every bit of work we did that went into that partnership agreement for almost two years turned out to be a waste of time because in the end, the partnership agreement fell apart. So if we had won a few extra [inaudible 00:46:58], my margins would've be higher if we'd extracted more fees from the partner or we would've had less liability. People always like, well, we have the liability for this and liability for that. And I think about all the things, this thing was 100s and 100s of pages long to document. None of it mattered. In the end, the partnership was never consummated, no customer, nothing ever happened.\n\n(00:47:15):\nAnd the interesting thing and reason to the story is that the people who went through that experience with me were so much faster on the next thing that we did. It was really amazing to see because they were like, \"Now I understand what you mean.\" Most people live very coddled lives that have not actually really dealt with this kind of failure in their business career. Obviously in their personal lives, they'll have all kinds of trauma. And you know, they'll work at a crappy company and have a horrible experience, but they haven't experienced this specific thing where you are the hero of the hero's journey. You are the protagonist of the story. And the thing is not just a setback, but you just die.\n\n(00:47:48):\nIt actually fails. It's so psychologically damaging that even people that have had that experience, a psychological defense mechanism is to tell themselves that that didn't happen. And you know it better than anybody, how many startup founders are adamant that they didn't ever fail, they didn't pivot. Everything's exactly the way they saw it at the beginning. And it's like, I've been around enough startups to know how often that is just not true, but we need to tell ourselves that story. But anyway, the number one lesson of the scientific method is if you can't fail, you can't learn.\n\n(00:48:19):\nAnd so if you set yourself up in a position where psychologically you can't admit that something didn't work, you can't learn. And that really is the essence of MVP. It's just like whatever the catastrophic thing that's going to destroy your company is going to be, we just want to find out as soon as possible so that there's still time to do something about it. We don't just die and move on.\n\nLenny (00:48:38):\nI'm actually seeing this a lot right now. I'm an investor in a bunch of startups, and so many of them are failing right now, and they built such beautiful products, such amazing products that they spent years just like crafting, making so great. And then it's all for naught. And there's actually been a theme on the podcast recently around the importance of craft and design. And I'm curious just to get your thoughts on just when it makes sense to invest deeply into the craft and experience of a product versus the minimal viable product approach. Do you start very simple and then invest, anything's there?\n\nEric Ries (00:49:17):\nYeah, well, I think that's a great question. People use the word craft to refer to so many different things. I personally find a tremendous beauty in simplicity. So I would much rather people do one thing extraordinarily well than 20 things half-assed personally. And how many products do you use? You're like, God, there's like 92 buttons on here of which I only ever pressed one. Could you have made that button have a really nice feel? I would've sacrificed all this other stuff. And I've actually worked on microwaves and refrigerators and stuff with actual physical buttons. And even your crappy kitchen microwave that you paid $60 for at Walmart or whatever, if you've never seen one of those things manufactured, actually the amount of craft that goes in behind the scenes to wire up every one of those buttons that are never pressed by a human being, it's actually really painful if you start to think about, wow, that's a lot of human energy being wasted.\n\n(00:50:08):\nSo the elements of craft I think are critically important. First of all, part of craft is perfection. Perfection is an attribute of quality. And we have to go back to the first thing. In order to know what perfection is, you have to know what the customer believes. You have to know, you have to be perfect for some purpose for some person. Some people will just say, \"Well, I'm just going to build for myself and that way I solve the problem.\" That's totally fine, if that's true, if that's you, go nuts, you might only have a market of one, but you'll be happy. So be it. And there are startups like that where it's like, well, I don't care how big my market is. I'll just build for all the people like me and I have a huge tribe, then I'll be hugely successful. If not, I'll just be an artist doing my thing. I have total respect for that.\n\n(00:50:44):\nThat's like the ends and the methods are totally aligned. Where people get into trouble I think, is when they want to use craft as an excuse to not get any feedback. So what I tell people is first of all, there's an element of craft that is just like whatever you do, how are you going to go about it? Whether you're building an MVP or a fully featured whatever thing you're doing, I'm a software engineer by training. My code is a certain way, I have a certain craft in the way that I write software because I think that's the best way and that produces the best outcomes. I will never compromise that. And compromising that in the name of going fast is stupid. Write crappy code. You spend more time firefighting than you do writing code in the future.\n\n(00:51:23):\nSo a certain amount of craft is just about keeping your options open. And actually it's very much favorable to speed, using the right primitives, having the right abstraction layers, using the right tools in the right way, having high quality people in your team, all those things that you go faster, not slower. And a big part of Lean Startup is about helping teams get into that optimal configuration by acting as a speed regulator. Because there's such a thing as optimal speed, which we can get into if people are interested.\n\n(00:51:48):\nBut another part of craft is just an excuse for just avoiding feedback, making things pretty in the way that I want them to be because I want them to be that way. And even there, when I meet people like that, people are just like, \"Sorry, my artistic ethos is this and it has to be this way.\" Then I'm like, \"Excellent.\" Then that's not one of your leap of faith assumptions that you're willing to test. So be it. Don't pretend to test it, just be like, I'm not, we're just going to do it this way because that's how we do things and it's fine. And I think when company has a core value, I'd rather go out of business than violate my core value. I also respect that too.\n\n(00:52:25):\nBut then that to me, that means having a respect for craft, for design, for perfection, that increases the need for experimentation and testing for all the other stuff, because we've already invested a huge amount of our energy and force into this thing that we really care about. Well, then the other stuff, and do we also have to do this fancy press campaign? Do we also have to go put the founder's face on billboards and put them up around town? Are those all part of your craft? I just feel like people use that as a catchall excuse to do all kinds of stuff.\n\n(00:52:55):\nBut I think the idea that craft is a signal to your customers about the things that you actually care about and that you're going to take care, it is part of making a promise to customer that they're going to believe. If that's your thesis, that doing an MVP that lacks craft doesn't test the thesis. So I think people want to set up a dichotomy here that doesn't really exist. I'm totally in favor of that when people have that authentic desire. But I also meet a lot of people that are just faking it. They don't have taste, they don't have a design ethos, they don't have... So if you don't have that stuff, where are you going to get it from? Well, good news experimentation will get you there if you let it, because you'll eventually learn the habits of mind, the patterns of the things that work, that make sense.\n\nLenny (00:53:38):\nI really like that advice of, as a founder, build the company you want, if you want to build, why create a business and a company you're not excited to be working on? And if you end up failing, it's on you. That was a big mistake it turned out, but at least you tried and you're not building a company you don't want to work at. And then as a product leader, I don't know how much, if you have as much control to build a product the way you want, but try basically.\n\nEric Ries (00:54:01):\nI always tell people to just get fired for doing it the way you think is right. There's nothing that was a faster career accelerator than being known in the industry as the person who stands for that principle so much that you got fired over it. The people that magnetizes to you are going to be way happier. You're going to be so much happier being a place that appreciates that. That was a big career accelerator for me. Not that I actually got fired, but I was willing to be fired for my beliefs. And I remember sitting there, I was going to a board meeting where for sure I was going to be fired. And I was like, \"Well, I just don't believe in building products the conventional way.\" This was again before Lean Startups. So I was like, I didn't even have a language for it, but I had a strong conviction that the way I was doing it was the right way.\n\n(00:54:41):\nAnd I was like, well, I'll be known as the guy that got fired for that and eventually someone will want to work with me because that's what they want. If nobody wants that, then I'll go find a job in a different industry. I don't want to be an industry that doesn't... That's how I want it to be. And I think that people don't appreciate the extent to which... People act like having a startup fail is the worst thing that can happen to you. And man, that's not even in the top 10. It's bad. I've done it. It's awful. Okay, it's really bad. But far worse is to be in a company that won't die, a zombie undead company that you hate but you can't leave. Have I met people like that. And we're having a mental health crisis among founders that's not talked about enough. People started to talk about the downside, mental health risk. Obviously the stress of being a founder is hard, but look what's happening to the people that are so-called successes. When you build a company and you sell it out and it becomes something that you find abhorrent, yeah, maybe you get rich, but it's not good. And I mean, the other day a friend was telling me about a friend of his who sold this company, exited for, I say $300 million or something, made a lot of money and committed suicide not that long later. People follow the Tony Hsieh story. I knew Tony, it was a horrible tragedy. What's going on? So I just feel like there are worse things than having your startup fail. And so building a company you hate, that becomes a maligned force in the world that you have to go pretend you weren't involved with or you feel complicit in what... That's way, way worse. And I wish more founders would take that more seriously early on.\n\nLenny (00:56:16):\nThat is such an important point and something I see a lot too, just companies, the founders started that are just alive, but they were almost never going to succeed, and they're kind of stuck. They don't want to shut it down, they don't want to give money back. What advice do you give those sorts of founders that you feel like are just stuck in a zombie company like that?\n\nEric Ries (00:56:35):\nIt's really hard. I mean, of course if it's going to fail, you should shut it down. But everyone's like, but I thought it's always darkest before the dawn. And it's like, sometimes it is. But you know what else that's really dark? When you're dead. So everything comes back to, I used to tell people, the most uncomfortable laugh line in my early talks about lean startups, when I talked about, people used to talk a lot about steep jobs in the reality distortion field. And I would be like, okay, you're in the reality distortion field. You're on the flat part of the hockey stick. How do you know the business plans? I actually lived through this once. There's a business plan, the business plan says six months after launch, we'll have almost no customers and almost no revenue. And that's when the hockey stick will commence. And I remember being there in month six being like, we are on time, on budget this plan is cheap.\n\n(00:57:24):\nEverything's happening just like the plan, hockey stick to commence. I'm walking to my watch. And then we just stayed on the flat part into the far horizon and people would laugh and I'd be like, okay, now if you're following a startup leader, or you yourself are in the reality distortion field and you're on the flat part of the hockey stick, how do you know if it's ever going to stick? Or you're just going to be... And people would be like, \"Ha ha ha ha.\" And that is a really scary situation. It's like we all have these moments of doubt and sometimes the right answer is to overcome the doubt and go for it. And it's actually part of the genius of the startup system. People people criticize venture financing and all the problems with the Silicon Valley and of course, we do it to ourselves so there's plenty of things to criticize.\n\n(00:58:10):\nOne of the genius things about it is at the end of the day, you do run out of money. You're forced to declare bankruptcy, that's actually a really positive feature of the system. So a lot of founders just can't do it. But I will say, the thing I try to ask people to do is really take some time to introspect and just ask yourself, do you actually want to be here? If you could magically wave a magic wand and you were to start a new company right now, would it be this one? If it's not, there's no indentured servitude anymore. It's okay. It's okay to move on. And then the question is, then everything moves into a tactical conversation about shut it down, give the money back, do a really hard pivot into the new thing.\n\n(00:58:51):\nIt depends a lot on the specific factors of the situation, but I think we do founders a disservice if we act like this is easy, or I mean, and it's gut-wrenching and it's really difficult and not to be too spiritual about this, but it really goes right to the issue of ego identification. For so many people, they are their company, and so for the company to die, they also must die. It feels like you're going to die. And I think that's part of the mental health problem. So people as they get older, as they mature, as they have a spiritual practice, I hope they can learn to dis-identify with the company and not feel like it's so personal, so that it is possible for the company to die without them dying. And then they can take what they learned into the next company or into the next pivot or the next iteration of what it should be.\n\n(00:59:38):\nOr sometimes the right thing to do is just to step aside and let a different CEO take over. There's so many ways you can go about it. But as with any pivot situation, the hardest part is always just to admit the facts as they are. And then you do it yourself versus just like, what is the situation? Is it working? I can't tell you how often people just can't accept it's not working. And you get investor updates. How many investor updates have you ever received where it's like, we're crushing it, everything's going great, and the very next investor update is, we're out of business, giving money back. It's like, well, your last investor updates said you were crushing it. There was absolutely no indication there was any problem. No, of course it wasn't an indication, but we're just lying about it. So don't be that person.\n\nLenny (01:00:18):\nThat's actually an amazing segue to where I wanted to move to, which is around pivoting. So I've done a bunch of research on consumer startups, B2B startups, and the numbers I see, and I'm curious if you see similar numbers is around a fifth of consumer startups, ended up pivoting to a completely different product and almost half, like 40% of B2B companies ended up pivoting to a completely different product. Does that sound right from your experience?\n\nEric Ries (01:00:42):\nYeah, that does sound right. So it's interesting, I used to do this exercise for founders where I would tell them the story of IMVU two different ways. The first way is one in which we got everything completely wrong and just sounds like we were to complete idiots and we had to pivot so many times. And then I would tell the same story again, but where we got everything right and we were geniuses and everything that happened vindicated. And then people wouldn't believe me. I was like, \"Both stories are true.\" Choosing which elements of what actually happened to emphasize and where to put your weight, you can tell the story. So yes, I would say there's the percentage of people that know that they pivoted and then there's another percentage of people that didn't admit it, but they actually did. And it's really hard to assess from the outside.\n\n(01:01:25):\nI mean, I know this from having worked with enough startups where I know the outside story and I know the inside story, and they're just really different. I mean, Paul Graham used to boast about that as one of the features of Y Combinator, that the founders they would get to come to the dinners would tell you the true story of what really happened, and that was critical information you couldn't get anywhere else except at Y Combinator. And I was like, wait a minute, is he saying that everyone just lies on stage when they tell the story publicly? I don't know if that's something to boast about. You're calling all your guests liars. And then I've hosted a lot of those events. I'm like, oh yeah, people lie on stage. I see. So I think part of the problem is just trying to find out the truth of what happened is really challenging. But there's another element that I think is interesting, which is, so pivot is defined as a change in strategy without a change in vision. So we have this idea that the founder has the vision, then they try to figure out how to make the vision happen and they find a different way, but the vision stays constant. But the truth is a little bit more complicated than that, because the founder's vision also evolves. Founders discover what the vision actually is through the process of building the company. So again, not to be spiritual about it, but I actually believe that building a startup is in large part a process of self-discovery. You actually are discovering what is true about the thing that you yourself believe. And partly that's because when we fantasize about the vision that we never have to make any trade-offs, the product is infinitely popular, infinitely cheap, everything's great.\n\n(01:02:50):\nIt's just like there no trade-offs to be made, where real life forces us to make trade-offs. And then you find they're like, \"Oh, I have to choose?\" Would I rather have a high-end product only for really rich people or would I rather have a product for this industry or this sector or this group or that group? It can be painful, but also founders learn to talk about the things they care about over time.\n\n(01:03:12):\nSo I mean, go on YouTube. If you've never watched the interview with Zuck on his couch at Stanford talking about Facebook, it's remarkable. Just some college news person just happened to catch an interview with this guy at a critical moment in his life when he just didn't know what he was talking about yet. And now he's really ambitious. Now Facebook's vision is this really ambitious thing and people are very at pains to say that he always had that vision from the beginning. And he talks about it all, and that may be true, but the documentary evidence exists, and I'll just give you one of my own stories about that.\n\n(01:03:48):\nIn one of my companies, we moved offices relatively early on because we started out in a really, really crappy small office and we moved to a larger space. And I remember sitting in that office when there was just five of us and we sat down and we had a meeting where we specked out what we would now call the MVP as well as the longer term vision for the company. And we had this whiteboard and all of us debated what features should be in and out or what should be on the whiteboard. And I can remember writing down, I have a visceral, I have a physical memory of writing down the things that were going to be necessary for the company to succeed and being right, and my co-founders arguing with me about not having their perspective and their being wrong, and I'm like, good thing.\n\n(01:04:29):\nIt's one of the things I remember telling this story. Anyway, we moved offices shortly after that time and that whiteboard was lost, and then years later we moved offices again and someone was cleaning out an old storage closet and that whiteboard was just happened to have gotten shoved in the closet. Someone pulls it, they're like, \"What's this?\" And I looked at it, I'm like, \"Oh, that's the whiteboard we used to hang in our main conference room, and it still had the notes from that meeting sitting there on the whiteboard.\" I was like, this is so cool. Historical moment. I'm taking a picture. And then I'm like, wait a minute, this is weird. It's in my hand. It's recognizably in my own handwriting, but many of the things that I'm writing there are horrible ideas. I'm like, that's not what I thought back then. I was on the other side. That's my co-founder's bad idea. That's not my idea.\n\n(01:05:20):\nAnd I had this realization that it's not just that I learned something through the course of building this company about strategy. My own understanding of the vision of what we were doing was different, but the thing that's so critical to understand is I even to this day have no psychological memory of having changed my mind about it. I still have the original memory of writing those things on the whiteboard, and I really thought someone was playing a trick on me at first because what I could witness with my own eyes on the whiteboard contradicts my actual memory of the thing. And I was like, which of us is right? And of course, I had to admit, the physical evidence, you got to win out.\n\n(01:06:00):\nBut I think it's important also to understand how much that is true. And that's like, again, go back to why science is so important. Why do we write all the elementary things about science? We write our hypothesis down, we subject our things, we do that because human psychology is so buggy and people who are fighting with their generative AI chatbots and stuff are starting to see, those are nothing but a reflection of human theory of mind. So we're starting to see it in alien creature that, wow, our intelligence has all these weird behaviors and gaps and things, and of course we want our robots to be perfect, but it's like, well, first look in the mirror and realize that you yourself carry all those cognitive biases and you've got to put in place a structure to get around them or they're going to destroy you.\n\nLenny (01:06:42):\nThat is an incredible story. It makes me think about, I think it's exactly what you said, not only are the stories you hear often intentionally not accurate or true, and they're kind of a myth that have been created, but also you forget exactly what happened and you tell a story that didn't really happen. That's wild. Imagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census, are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with a LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date.\n\n(01:07:35):\nWith LinkedIn ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs, and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B. In tech, LinkedIn generated 2x to 5x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner.\n\nEric Ries (01:08:00):\nHave two times the buying power of the average web audience and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100s credit on your next campaign. Just go to linkedin.com/podLenny to claim your credit. That's linkedin.com/podLenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\nLenny (01:08:22):\nSo you talked about pivoting. I never knew this about the term pivot is that you keep the vision the same. And I actually have this list of companies, B2B companies in this case, that pivoted. In their cases it was very different. Let me go through them real quick. And I'm curious, what do you call it if they don't keep the vision consistent? Segment started as a university classroom lecture tool. Loom, which just sold for a lot of money to Atlassian, started as a marketplace for companies to hire subject matter experts. Slack famously started as a game called Glitch. Box apparently started as a box to put photos and content in on Facebook. And Retool started as Venmo for the UK.\n\nEric Ries (01:09:04):\nThat one I didn't know.\n\nLenny (01:09:05):\nI found that out through Twitter where one of the YC partners replied and shared that story with me because I also didn't know. And I think that's a good example where no one ever tells you that fact.\n\nEric Ries (01:09:15):\nRight.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\n[inaudible 01:09:16].\n\nEric Ries (01:09:15):\nIt's like well, that's an important part of the story to know. Exactly, exactly.\n\nLenny (01:09:19):\nI think it was a quick pivot. I think they got to YC and they're like \"No, let's do something else.\"\n\nEric Ries (01:09:22):\nThis is why it's so hard to evaluate from the outside because oftentimes there is a thread of connectivity that from the inside makes sense why we went from this thing to that thing. And it's often something unusual. It'll be something like well, while we were building the game we had to do this thing first because our values were like, you can't build a game without this thing. And then this thing turned out to be more valuable than the game. And then you're like \"Oh, why are we building this game? This is the thing we actually really care about.\" So people are like \"Well, I thought your vision was to build a game.\" I was like \"Well, maybe but why did they build that thing first? Other people build games without building that thing.\" So that's why I say it's a process of self-discovery. Oftentimes the vision is discovered more than chosen in these stories. And from the outside it can seem really, really weird. And part of it is also that some people really need the failure of the first thing to appreciate what is great about the second thing.\n\nLenny (01:10:22):\nI think Segment is a good example where they tried a bunch of stuff and then they posted this random thing on Hacker News and it just blew up.\n\nEric Ries (01:10:28):\nSometimes it blows up so much that you're like wow, that's amazing. But oftentimes the new thing will get 100 signups. And if you'd started with that as your first thing you would've be like \"100 signups who cares.\" But if you've done 20 things in a row with zero signups, man, you're like \"God, somebody likes this thing.\" Sometimes it's your first try but sometimes not.\n\n(01:10:46):\nAnd again, not to go back to Facebook all the time but that's such a famous story that people know it. In the movie, there's that famous scene where they live in the house in Palo Alto and they run into Sean Parker and does the ... Apparently that's real, and they really were living in that house. They really were working on Face ... But the thing that gets missed from the story is that Facebook's already started at that point, it's already being successful, and they're on the break between semesters on the summer. And Dustin Moskovitz, and Mark Zuckerberg, and Adam D'Angelo, and I forget who else are living in this house together.\n\n(01:11:18):\nSomeone told me this story about what they were actually working on at that time. It wasn't Facebook. Zuck and D'Angelo had already moved on from Facebook and decided it wasn't successful enough and they were like ... One of them was working on a system where you could use gestural controls on your webcam to program computers because they wouldn't get carpal tunnel. They were sitting on Facebook and it was ... I should ask Dustin if this is true. I believe Dustin Moskovitz taught himself to program so that he could keep up with the demand of people who wanted to open Facebook at new schools because the virality was so insane. And I was like wow, you can be even building Facebook and not know. People are like \"Well, if I told you that story without telling you the name of the founder you'd be like that's no visionary.\" I'm like \"No, it's Mark Zuckerberg.\" No one has ever accused him of having a lack of vision, but somehow this is true.\n\n(01:12:13):\nSo I feel like part of this is about just admitting the complexity of these stories is a little bit more ... There's more to the story than you really realize. These are imperfect people. And the pivot is really about learning, right? The original idea of the pivot was one foot anchored in the thing, one other foot moving from basketball, right? Anchored in what you've learned and yet so connected. So if it was truly a complete shutdown, start over again, nobody and nothing in common I would be like, that is not a pivot. But that's just actually quite rare.\n\n(01:12:42):\nUsually, there's some critical insight or element of the first thing that is carried over into the second thing. And if you were there, if you know the story, you'll be like oh, wow, that makes sense in retrospect. And again, I think this cuts against our whole idea. The thing we think it's like to be a visionary is you just ... You know all the answers. You're like a biblical prophet who sees the future. But that's not what it's like. It's really much more about having the courage to see the world as you think it ought to be and then dance with that wherever it takes you. I think it's a much more element of courage than of intelligence or anything else.\n\nLenny (01:13:19):\nYou're so full of amazing stories, Eric Ries. I never knew this Facebook story. Thinking about a founder who is maybe going through a period of considering a pivot ... There's a lot of startups right now just not struggling. Not struggling but struggling.\n\nEric Ries (01:13:35):\nThe 2021 Vintage is having a rough time.\n\nLenny (01:13:37):\nExactly. I'm curious just what advice you have for founders that are trying to decide, is this time to pivot? Should we give up? Should we stay the course? Just any tactical pro tips.\n\nEric Ries (01:13:49):\nSo first of all, if you're asking whether you should pivot or not you probably know the answer already. That's the first thing to just straight up say. People call me sometimes they're like \"I want to know if I have product market fit.\" Well, the fact that you have time to call me and ask me this question already tells me the answer. If you have had product-market fit you would not have time for this. When it's working there's no time for naval gazing, there's no time for ... If you've never lived through a company going through product market fit it's such a rush, it's such an insane thing. The whirlwind of it is so amazing and so horrible at the same time. There's just no time for anything else. If you're not sure you're sure. So that's the first thing is just can you admit it to yourself? Can you do it?\n\n(01:14:29):\nIf you admit that it's not working then what do we do? What I really ask people to do in these situations ... It's like give yourself a fixed period of time to take some decisive action and see if it feels better. If you can't agree that it's not working then okay, can we take six weeks to try to make it work? We have this assumption, we're going to try to test it, and we're going to ... Instead of working on the 29 other things that we have to do in the future, can we just spend all of our time 100% on the one and only one thing that matters right now? And just go heads down on that for a fixed period of time and see can we move ... Is it possible to move the needle in that thing?\n\n(01:15:07):\nBecause one of the things that is true about startups when it's not working is that they're stuck in this law of diminishing returns where you just ... You can test yourself. Everything you try doesn't work, nothing works. It's like Thomas Kuhn and his theory of scientific paradigms. One of my favorite things that he talks about is that when an old paradigm is replaced with a new paradigm it's usually only because the old people die out and the new people replace them. A lot of researchers are like why does that happen? It's not that the new people are magically smarter than the old people, it's just the old paradigm gets to the point where there's no more experiments to run that are fruitful. And young, ambitious people want to run productive experiments. And the new paradigm gives them a thing where every experiment reveals something really amazing and they just naturally gravitate. It's not actually a formal process of abandoning the old and going to the new.\n\n(01:15:55):\nAnd that's true here too. Most people are not consciously able to let it go, they can't do it. So okay, find yourself a paradigm where the experiments are productive. I can't tell you how many startups I've been where they're like \"It's up to the right.\" I'm like \"Oh, really?\" It's like \"Yeah. At first it was 10%, now it's 10.5%, then it was 10.6%, then it was 10.65%, then it was 10.657%.\" You're like \"Guys, yes, it's up and to the right but it's not what you need it to be for this to work.\" So give yourself a fixed amount of time on the current thing if you have to. Once you say, \"Okay, the thing's not working.\" Do we have enough time for something new? Could you give yourself six weeks to try the new thing? If you're a bigger company you'd be like okay, we're in a ... Maybe you can't have a whole company work on it but can we have a team? Somebody, at least one whole human being, not a part-time committee. Somebody is full-time heads down trying to make the new thing work on a deadline.\n\n(01:16:52):\nAnd if you're a small team and there's only three of you, can you just put the whole thing on pause for a minute and give yourself a fix? If it was one weekend, that would be better than nothing. What can you actually afford? It'd be nice if it was six weeks but if it's only one weekend, no problem. What is the new thing you want to do? Now that you've agreed among yourselves that you're going to do that for a fixed period of time, everyone go around the room and say, \"If I could start this company over again the thing I wish we were doing was.\"\n\n(01:17:19):\nAnd no one wants to go first, but since everyone's going to have to do it you're like \"Okay, I wish we were doing this other thing.\" \"Why?\" And sometimes the first person goes and everyone's like \"I've been wanting to say that same thing for months.\" And it's like \"Wait, we all actually secretly want to do this other thing but we all are afraid to let the others down.\" It's like \"That's actually great new\" ... \"Well, good.\" Don't mourn that 18 months of your life you just wasted, be excited about the fact that you actually are on the same page about the new thing.\n\n(01:17:49):\nAnyway. Everyone says the new thing. See if one of them stands out to you, do that one. If you all agree do that one. If you have three things that you're equally excited about do them in order. Everyone gets one month. We've got three months of money left, well, the first month we'll do the first thing, second one we'll do ... And we'll just see if anything sticks. And then sometimes people do that and they're like \"I'm just exhausted, I just want to die.\" If everyone goes around and says, \"I'll just give the money back it's okay, don't die. Let the company die it's all right.\" When you raise too much money, and you've got your cap tables all messed up, and you ... I feel like for our 2021 Vintage brothers and sisters, sometimes you just need to try again with the right capital structure, it's not possible. Make the structural changes you actually have to make to give yourself a chance to do something you care about. If you don't have that what are we doing here? Life's too precious for that.\n\nLenny (01:18:43):\nThat is awesome advice. Very tactical, very real. On the point you just asked of what would we be doing? What would you want to be working on? I imagine many people today would be answering AI-related products. And this is a good segue to where my next question is just, how are you seeing AI change the lean approach, product development, the way teams are run? Trends and changes you're seeing in all of the stuff that we've been talking about?\n\nEric Ries (01:19:10):\nI mean, we're entering into a really interesting phase of humanity, and technology, and civilization. To know the right answers to those questions requires empirical knowledge that nobody has. That's exciting about it. And also, of course, some people find it terrifying. What I'm seeing so far is that, first of all, people are afraid of AI. But not really afraid of AI they're afraid of corporations with AI. AI doesn't do anything by itself, it has to be embodied and deployed by humans who have bad alignment. And so everyone's talking about AI alignment. I'd be a little more sanguine about AI alignment if the company's doing the aligning were better at aligning their human intelligences. I'm blanking on whose law it is. Always these named laws. So the idea that your software comes to reflect the organization that produces it is somebody's law. Conway's law maybe.\n\nLenny (01:19:59):\nLet's call it Ries's Law.\n\nEric Ries (01:20:01):\nNo, please don't. I forget whose law. Anyway. That is going to be true on steroids in AI where we're training in machine intelligence and we're transmitting values to it. Those are going to be our organizational values. And tech has severely underinvested and neglected in creating governance and alignment structures to have those values be explicitly embodied in the organization which is why so many of our companies have become disappointments, and so many people feel betrayed by the companies they themselves help build. It's actually sad. So AI is going to force us to take those issues seriously no matter what.\n\n(01:20:35):\nYou asked about how it affects lean startup. At the end of the day, AI is a management technology. The thing it does is manage intelligence and other intelligences. Watch people struggle to make AI agents work. It's been really interesting to me how often I've played with a lot of those tools myself. It's amazing how often you program the agent and it will be like okay. You give it a task like go take over the world or whatever, go make a really successful ice cream stand. Or you give it any task you want and it'll be like whatever. These AIs are programmed to never say no so whatever you say it's like no problem and it'll be okay.\n\n(01:21:08):\nFirst step, write a business plan for taking over the world, and that will spawn a new agent with a new AI. Be like okay, your job is to go write this business plan. And sometimes it'll go try to write the business plan, but oftentimes it'll spawn ... The subtask will be like oh, first thing I need to do is spawn an AI agent that knows how to take over the world and have it write the business plan. Everyone will just pass the buck to somebody else. It'll go into an infinite regress. It's like, first thing we need to do is research this. And then the thing that comes back, and now we've learned to research that we need to research 10 more things. Each of those 10 things require researching 10 more. So many ways this can go wrong.\n\n(01:21:44):\nAnd anyone who's been a middle manager who reads these transcripts will be like \"Tell me about it, buddy.\" I once was doing an AI agent and I wanted it to write me a 30-day course. A transcript or a 30-day course for teaching people lean startup. Someone had asked me to do that. And I was like great, I'll have the AI do it for me. And it was amazing. It was like okay, no problem. Day one, what is lean startup? How does it work? Day two topic, what is an MVP, how's it work? Dot, dot, dot continue like this for 30 more days and you'll have a 30-day course. I was like yes, because I know that but could you please fill out the other 30 days? It was like no problem and it spawned a new subagent. It was like, given these two as an example please fill out the other 30 days. And it was like got it. And it was like how to do a task in 30 days.\n\n(01:22:27):\nWell, first look at these two tasks, then create similar things for 28 more days, then return the results. It's like no, no, I'm asking you to do that. If you ever watched the Monty Python no, can't guard him If he's a guard skit, it's like that. We're talking past each other. It's really interesting to see how AI, as we learn to understand it we will be able to develop different ... It will really change management a lot because it changes the individual span of control quite a lot.\n\n(01:22:58):\nOne of the most hard problems in management is that in order to touch a lot of things we need a lot of hierarchy because just the expansion factor of each one has this many reports, has this many reports, this many reports. That's what's required in order for us to summarize a large amount of information. If you have 100,000 employees they're having 100,000 ... Doing 100,000 things, the CEO needs to know what's going on, that's really difficult. So there's this massive amount of human labor required just to summarize and understand what's happening. Well, AI's really good at summarization, it's actually one of its main strengths. In the not to distant in future it'll be very easy for someone to just be like \"Summarize for me everything my company is doing.\" You won't need tons of middle managers to do that for you it'll just know. We don't even know what we would like to build organizations where those powers are available to everybody.\n\n(01:23:49):\nThe last thing is, people are very focused on whether this is going to lead us to utopia or dystopia. Most people have a very firm conviction about what's going to happen, and therefore what needs to happen now to prevent something bad from happening. So you have the people who are like \"We have to stop, pause, blow up the data centers because it's going to be this bad thing.\" People who are like \"We have to have government intervention to prevent research on this thing, we have to ban open source. For every one of the things somebody wants to do somebody else is saying, \"That is actually the thing that leads to the dystopia,\" right? Banning open source is what leads us into a corporately controlled autocracy that's even worse than the thing that you were afraid of.\n\n(01:24:26):\nA very common question I've been getting from people in the industry who are having an existential crisis about what should they do with their life in the face of this AI. And as you say, all the people whose startups are failing are like I want to be working on AI. Okay. For everyone who's got a grass is greener attitude about that ... The people that are actually doing it, and quitting their jobs, and going to work on AI, the first thing they confront is What should I do that will have a positive effect? It's actually really difficult to find out some ... Everything I propose doing someone's telling me that that's actually the evil thing to do and vice versa. A big part of lean startup has been ... For me, it's been just about learning how to deal with uncertainty in my life, right? So how do you deal from a business perspective? How do you deal with situations of high uncertainty? And it could be scientific, it could be experimental, it could be ... Just all these different values that are about coping with uncertainty.\n\n(01:25:18):\nAnd so the question people are asking me is basically, how do you take ethical action in the face of high uncertainty? And so the framework that I've been using I found very helpful and I hope other people will get something out of it is ... The aperture of possible futures that AI makes possible is so incredibly wide. And Predicting it requires a really deep understanding of a bunch of empirical questions, as far as I can tell, nobody knows the answers to right now. So given that it's not knowable what's going to happen ... You're not an expert enough. As far as I can tell nobody knows. The people who are most expert are actively doing the research to try to find out the thing that will help us predict. There's nothing you can do about that, you've got to wait for someone to go find that thing out. The thing that makes sense is to pick actions today that make ethical sense in a wide variety of future scenarios and do those. And what's really interesting is that takes people out of total paralysis about it into there's actually some very clear things that we should do. Whatever your doomsday scenario is we need more transparency right now, right? That's critically important. We need more state capacity, we need more competent leaders, we need companies who are committed to certain values. It changes the way that we think about these technologies in relation to ourselves as individuals.\n\n(01:26:34):\nAnd that's really my goal, in my work here, is just like how do we get people off the sidelines and into the fight doing things that are actually likely to be worthwhile? As I'm talking to you I'm like oh, it sounds a lot like the idea that most of the work you do in a startup is going to be thrown away after you pivot so don't do that work. It's not really a special unique insight it's just taking the same approach to coping with the uncertainty of entrepreneurship and now applying it much more broadly because everything's about to change.\n\nLenny (01:27:01):\nIt sounds like this connects a lot with the work you're doing now around governance and long-term stock exchange. And I want to get into that. But before I do, I'm curious if personally you're finding AI to be useful in some part of your life using a tool? Or, if there's a more interesting example of a company using a lean startup approach with AI integrated, is there anything that comes to mind of just something that you've seen to be practically valuable with some of the AI tooling?\n\nEric Ries (01:27:26):\nWhen GPT-4 was first launched, I saw a friend of a friend just was posting a friend of theirs. A story about someone who was using it for cold sales outbound right when it first came out. They had downloaded a list of 10,000 Shopify stores with metadata, which I googled you can buy that for 100 bucks. They just told GPT to the roll of Python script for each store. GPT-4, please pitch this store owner something that my outsourcing company could build for them and be really creative about it. He didn't even read the emails he just sent them one after the other. And when the person would reply he would look in the email to see what he had pitched them and then talk to get the person on the phone.\n\n(01:28:12):\nThe things that it pitched were so wildly creative and cool, it was really interesting. They were in the tone of the store, they were really ... They used clever puns. So he was showing me screenshots of the person writing back being like \"You had me at blah, blah.\" It was very good sales prospecting. So okay. That's an incredible story about experimentation at a super high rate. We could never have done anything like that even five minutes ago and now it's going to become completely routine.\n\n(01:28:41):\nBut it's also a story about how all of our communication channels are about to be supersaturated with AI-generated experimentation whether we want it to or not. If this technology holds the way we think it will, it's pretty clear that every company is going to be sending just huge volumes of AI- generated email such that people are going to need AI-generated email clients to read the email for them and summarize it for them. People make jokes about, I'm going to write three bullet points, my AI will turn that into an email, send it to you, your email will redact it back to the three bullet points. Couldn't we have just exchanged three bullet points in the first place? We're wasting a lot of silicon. A lot of GPUs were burned to move these three bullet points from point A to point B.\n\n(01:29:24):\nI don't think that's as silly a story as it sounds. I actually am excited about the possibility of AI-powered marketplaces to be far more fair than the way we do it today. Because if you think about that story, the problem fundamentally is that you have a massive number of people who could create things for store owners. And if all of those people emailed every store owner on the planet every day what they could do, it would be an overwhelming amount of information. So neither side is really capable of doing that. But AI is capable of doing that.\n\n(01:29:56):\nSo imagine a world in which everybody is required and it's also ... But it's also really easy to do, to define a procurement policy. What am I interested in buying, right? What problems do I want to solve? What am I interested in buying? What information do I want to have? And my agent reads my inbox for me with this filter and applies the filter completely fairly. It doesn't matter if I played golf with so-and-so last week or whatever, just if the proposal comes in and it's credible, and the AI is really diligent about making sure it's not spam, then it will bring the thing to my attention. But it won't show me the email, I won't be tricked by its clever Al Ries-style positioning nonsense.\n\n(01:30:34):\nIt will give me the essential information that \"Hey, did you know that there's this thing that could actually save you a bunch of money?\" You're like \"Oh, okay, great.\" That is so much better than advertising could ever be. And it's also way more fair. We could then say, \"Okay, actually, we would like every conceivable vendor to send every ... As many emails as they want at any time, just blow me away with all the things your thing could do. Let your AI go crazy trying to convince my AI that your thing is actually good. That's not wasted time, that actually create a lot more fairness in the world, and create a really even playing field for procurement for information. Think about journalists and pitches. You just see so many situations where we've established hierarchical gatekeeping structures because that was the only way to manage the volume of information that had to be processed for that thing to happen. When those limits are removed it could be terrible but it could be really awesome.\n\nLenny (01:31:27):\nI love your optimistic vent on all the things we're talking about, I really respect that. And that might be a good segue to the final thing I wanted to chat about which is just the stuff you're working on now. So you talked about you're working a lot on helping companies with their governance. Also, I think you work on company culture, and helping companies make money, and profit, and build real businesses. And then that, obviously, connects to long-term stock exchange. Can you just talk about what it is you're spending your time on there and where you see big opportunities?\n\nEric Ries (01:31:54):\nYeah, sure. I mean, I think it's one of the big, big, big issues that we're grappling with. If I compare the questions I get asked by founders today versus 10 years ago, these issues are so much more in people's minds than they were back then. When I work with a founder for the first time, we'll often do a thought exercise that's like \"Okay, we've talked about culture, we've talked about the company, it's like okay, great, why should anybody trust you?\" They're like, \"What do you mean?\" We're talking about companies now building stuff that is so invasive into people's lives, so much more powerful than it was before. And really honestly, this is just about taking seriously the rhetoric about changing the world.\n\n(01:32:33):\nAnd so many tech companies, when they're raising money are going to change the world in fundamental ways. And when they're being asked to take moral responsibility they're like \"I'm just a little database vendor.\" It's like you can't have it both ways, buddy. Are you the Superman who's reordering the whole world to your whim? Well, then you have moral responsibility for the outcomes. That's a hotly debated point right now but I feel like it's actually super ... People have already made it clear in their rhetoric where they stand there, they're just trying to evade that responsibility.\n\n(01:33:02):\nSo the next gen of founders aren't ... Don't find this complicated at all. People feel a real sense of responsibility to make the world a better place for the real things. Okay, great. I'm working on so many companies that are straight out of science fiction. I mean, the company that does travel from San Francisco to Tokyo in one hour. And you're like, it's unbelievable. Actual weather changing. The real thing where you're like, we're going to change the amount of habitable land on the planet and solve famine and drought forever. Obviously AI, there's these just incredible possibilities and ... In nanomaterials and quantum computing. I could go on. There's just so many cool things going on.\n\n(01:33:42):\nBut they all have really dire consequences. I mean, I was talking to a really advanced biological AI company where ... Imagine having an LLM. Imagine ChatGPT but for biological compounds. We'd be like \"AI, could you just synthesize for me a molecule that has these properties just described in natural language?\" And it's like \"Sure.\" That could be incredible. Think about the cures and the diseases. That's going to be an amazing transformation on technology. But it has such obvious risk and downside that we have to take it really seriously. Why should anyone trust you with this power? And people always say the same thing, \"Well, I'm a really good guy. I'm your bro, man. I've got good intentions.\" It's like \"Well, who gives a crap about that, you could die, you could be replaced. Some investor could sweep you.\"\n\n(01:34:28):\nHow many stories can I tell you about startups where the investors change management involuntarily? The fundamental problem is that no individual person can ever make promises on behalf of an organization, it's not possible, it's a category error. You're replaceable. And the reason is because organizations are actually alive. They are superorganism with their own soul and their own life. We are their selves and organs when we make them. Founders don't create them we birth. And that's different. We don't own them, they're not slaves. We nurture them. That's different. If you want your organization to be trustworthy, the promises it makes ... If you want to win the public's trust by making promises they can believe, you have to embody those promises in the structure of the organization itself so that even if you weren't there the promise would be kept.\n\n(01:35:20):\nAnd people act like that's impossible but there are lots of examples. I mean, think about the code of medical ethics and the Hippocratic Oath. In the US if you want to do healthcare you have to have a care delivery organization that is staffed and run by doctors, not by private equity guys. There's all these things. Where we know how to build structures that are organized around some purpose, so what should that purpose be?\n\n(01:35:44):\nI was talking to a former Googler ... I hate to pick on Google because they've always done a lot of good things in the world. But they're, I think, the locus of a lot of tech people's disappointment in the world. And so this is nothing unique to Google but I just happen to be talking to an ex-Googler. And he was talking about the values, and the company, and his disappointment, and what had happened in the many years that he'd been there, the good and the bad. I said, \"Okay, answer me this question. I'm going to ask you two different things, and for each thing I want you to tell me, what is your assessment of the probability that this thing will happen in the future? Thing number one. What do you believe is the probability that Google will file its next quarterly report on time?\" He was like \"100%.\" I was like \"How 100%?\" I'm like \"As certain as the sun will rise, bet your life on it?\" He's like, \"As certain as the sun will rise 100%.\" I was like \"Excellent, I agree.\"\n\n(01:36:26):\nA second question. \"What is the odds that Google would be complicit in something that would make them money but at the expense of murdering somebody?\" He's like, \"They probably wouldn't do that.\" I was like \"Probably, 100%. As certain as the sun will rise.\" He's like \"Well, no.\" I was like \"Oh really? What do you have?\" I said, \"Well, come on, what if they're running a self-driving car as they kill somebody and they cover it up? What if they will a social media product and it's conflicted in a genocide? Facebook went through that.\" He's like \"I don't think they would do that on purpose. The difference between the thing that is certain and the thing that we don't know.\" I was like \"Okay, why is that?\" We treat that normal. Of course, companies file that report sometime. Is it because in the human heart fidelity to finance rules is hard coded, but care for other humans in their life is not? People don't give a crap about quarterly reports.\n\n(01:37:14):\nWe have built a massive apparatus in these organizations to make sure that certain things happen. Companies are really good at things that they care about, and therefore we can learn something interesting about the things that they care about by what they choose to be good at and what they perennially are not good at. My view is that what it means to be a for-profit company, we've gotten it wrong. We're basically incorrect. Making a profit is actually about maximizing human flourishing. That's what it means to be for profit. So our current category says that Philip Morris is a for-profit company, and the Smithsonian is a not-for-profit but that's just backwards. Smithsonian does a lot more good in the world than the Merchants of Death at Philip Morris. I think we've just gotten confused. All forms of making money are the same but we all know that that's not true. There's exploitative extractive ways of making money, and then there's truly additive ways of making money that actually create net new value.\n\n(01:38:08):\nAnd so if companies are dedicated to human flourishing and they want to be the company that will create net new value, and they don't want to become a bureaucratic nightmare, they don't want to become a rent-seeking blob of discriminate math. We don't want that to happen. We have to encode those promises into the company in a deep way. And I think that's really what governance is about. The whole ESG movement, all the discussion about this has gone totally off the rails. Philip Morris has actually great ESG scores it's absurd. How can that possibly be right? We have to find a better way forward.\n\n(01:38:43):\nAgain, going back to lean startup and first principles. Once you go back to that first principle and say, \"What would it look like if every person in a company felt a fiduciary duty to promote human flourishing? How would you do it? And what would be different?\" I've started to meet founders who are building companies like that and it's almost unrecognizably different. I've been framing this, of course, in terms of the big things. Obviously, if you think about the weather control startup. That needs to be right, not just because if a super villain and got their hands on it would be really horrible but also because you can easily imagine ... They got bought by some private equity firm who's like \"This is awesome. We can now put every town in a zero-sum competition with their neighbor for the good weather and extort them both from\" ... That would be just as horrible. We don't need superviliany for this. None of us should want our technology to be used in that way so we need to prevent that from happening.\n\n(01:39:33):\nSo when we put that in that ethos, we make that part of every decision, we finally can create the environment that people really want to work in just to make great products. I feel like most people I meet just want to work on something awesome. And we act like giving, that just happens. But I've worked with so many companies now, even the ones that are really truly great ... You go meet a team who says, \"We had the island of freedom, we had the full\" ... We were able to do it exactly right. That's one of the most satisfying experiences in my career.\n\n(01:40:06):\nYou ask people, \"Why was it\" ... \"How was it made?\" And they're like \"How was the product made?\" \"No, how was the island of freedom that you lived on made?\" And they're like \"I don't know, ask my boss.\" I've done this exercise. I've asked the boss, and the boss's boss, and the boss's boss. And sometimes I'll go all the way up, and it'll be like \"Well, actually the founder of the company, who's still around, made it so.\" But sometimes no one knows. And you're like \"Who's in charge here? The board is in charge.? They're like \"I don't know. The CEO asked me to serve on the board.\" The company chose its own board, the board chooses the C ... It's all self-referential. And it's like where did it come from? We view it as an accident, it just happens sometimes. But that's because we're not engineering these beings to create the outcomes that we really want. And I just think this is a blind spot.\n\n(01:40:52):\nAs company builders, we're so focused on the product and not nearly focused enough on the organization. We tend to say at the surface level stuff like culture, we don't get into the deeper stuff. So, yeah, I think as builders, as an industry, we need a new movement to say. \"We are going to build companies where human flourishing is the thing at the beating heart. We're going to wield that as a competitive advantage to not only change the world for the better but also make a lot more money.\"\n\n(01:41:17):\nThat's the crazy thing about it is these companies are worth a lot more than their competitors. Without naming the company, I talk about a company that is an incredible ethos of love and just ... It actually loves their customers, it's amazing. Everything cascades down from that central premise, including the instruct ... Every CEO I meet is so frustrated all the time. I can't get people on the same page. I tell them what to do but they don't listen. It's like maybe part of the reason you're having trouble with this is the strategy you're communicating does not actually make sense to people. Well, this one really makes sense. Treat your customer like you would treat your own parents. People are like \"Oh, that's actually really easy and clear, I understand exactly what that means.\" And so their customer loyalty is unbelievable. Can you imagine what their retention is like if you-\n\nEric Ries (01:42:00):\nAnd so their customer loyalty is unbelievable. Can you imagine what their retention is like, if you actually felt... You call customer service and it's like you're reaching your guardian angel rather than some bored customer service rep? It's amazing. So their competitors are like, \"This is not fair. It's unfair to compete with this. This thing is a monster.\"\n\n(01:42:17):\nBut when you're going to a customer like, \"Hi, would you rather work with a company that's owned by some private equity schmuck, or a company where some of the prosperity you helped me generate gets reinvested in you and your community?\" It's a competitive advantage to do the right thing. So I feel like that we're going to have a new wave of founders who take that seriously, who are going to just... They're going to steamroll. It's going to be really awesome to watch.\n\nLenny (01:42:42):\nI can see how you started a movement, maybe accidentally. I am mesmerized, I am sold. If people listening are also sold and want to build a company this way, what can they do? Is it work with the long-term stock exchange? Is there something they could do to help move their company and product team and business in this direction?\n\nEric Ries (01:43:00):\nI feel like there will come a time when there's a lot of resources about how to do this, and there aren't a lot right now, so it's a bit thin. I'm working on it, but we're still trying to figure out the right way. But I am hoping to start doing some events and some things to talk about this stuff, so people should feel free to reach out or follow me on the usual places.\n\n(01:43:19):\nIf people want to do it themselves, talk to your lawyer. This is definitely one of these \"talk to your lawyer\" moments. I've worked with enough companies, I've actually been around long enough that I've worked with multiple companies that have gone from zero to IPO and beyond. So I have personal friends who've taken their company public who are now extremely wealthy, and who sometimes even call me and are like, \"Hey, I run this massive multinational company. Can we talk about this very specific situation that's come up at work?\" I still am involved in those companies. I still get to hear sometimes what it's like to actually do it.\n\n(01:43:49):\nAnd one of my main takeaways of that entire process is that it's always too early until it's too late. So what happens is people hear something like what I'm saying, like, \"Oh yeah, we need to make sure... Here's some things you can do.\" Obviously you can become a public benefit corp or a social, what's it called, in California, a social purpose corporation. There's legal designations you could take. That's fine. You could talk to a company that, because their startup involves building a technology out of something that comes out of indigenous cultures, they took 10% of their company and they put it in a foundation, the trustees of whom are tribal leaders from the cultures that they interact with, and those people that has an economic role and a role in governance. You can establish a foundation like that.\n\n(01:44:31):\nYou can do what's called the board mission pledge where the people on your board are required as a condition of being on your board to pledge that they'll use their business judgment under Delaware law to support the mission, not just the narrow interest of shareholders. You can build, we call it an LTSPV, which is basically a financing instrument that operates like a regular SPV, but every LP in the SPV has to sign a contract to say that they will support the mission of the company if you ever want to do something like a B Corp version, or if there's ever a situation where it's unclear whether they're in favor of you doing the thing that's right by your stakeholders long-term, they're pre-committed to that, and we assign trustees to oversee those shares rather than just the narrow interest of the shareholders.\n\n(01:45:10):\nI can go on and on. There's all this stuff you can do. So I get companies, I got founders excited. I've been getting founders excited about this for a long time. I've now been long enough at this that the founder will go to their lawyer and the lawyer will say, \"Listen, sounds great, but you don't need to do that right now. You can always do it later.\" And they're like, \"Okay.\" And then the companies going bigger and they'll do some financing round. Each financing round, it's like, \"Is this the time?\" \"Ah, that's fine, we could just do it later.\" And then it's like 18 months from the IPO, they've hired a CFO and there's a bankers and the whole thing's on rails, and the CEO's like now, \"Hey, did we ever establish that foundation thing for our non-employee stakeholders?\" And they're like, \"Huh?\"\n\n(01:45:44):\n\"The thing, remember we talked about, you said it was too early?\" \"Oh yeah, I remember that. Have we done it?\" \"Oh no, it's too late.\" \"It's too late?\" \"The thing's on rail, shareholders wouldn't like it.\" The banker's like, \"Oh, you don't want to put that in your IPO prospectus.\" It's like, \"Wait a minute, when was the right time? You're telling me that 18 months ago, July 3rd through 7th, there was a four-day window and it was the right time? It's never the right time. Why is it never the right time?\" And I've seen founder after founder after founder get steamrolled. One of the only exceptions I know is a mutual friend of ours who actually stopped the IPO process and was like, \"No, I won't file the paperwork.\" They tried to steamroll him and file the paperwork without him, and he said \"No, until I see this thing in there, we're not doing it.\"\n\n(01:46:24):\nAnd it was a very contentious thing, took a tremendous amount of political capital. I admire him immensely for doing it, but most founders don't. Most founders just go along, and the thing never gets done. So the most important thing is to sit down with your lawyer and just take them through a few hypothetical situations and ask them, are you properly protected against this specific thing? For example, if tomorrow Philip Morris shows up... Pick your favorite evil. I've used Philip Morris because my dad's a pulmonologist, so I grew up as Philip Morris as the ultimate of evil corporations. But pick your favorite evil corp. If they show up tomorrow and they offer you $1 per share more than your company is currently worth to buy it from you and your investors in order to use it to sell cigarettes to children, do you have a fiduciary duty to say yes or a fiduciary duty to say no?\n\n(01:47:11):\nBelieve it or not, if you went to a fancy law firm and they filed for you the standard articles of incorporation that are used in Silicon Valley, most governance experts upon reading those documents would say, \"You have a fiduciary duty to say yes.\" If that doesn't horrify you and make you want to jump out a window, I can't help you at all. And if you don't care, fine, I got nothing to say to you. If you don't care, you don't care. There are really sociopathic people in this world, and they build sociopathic companies, and I can't help you.\n\n(01:47:39):\nBut if you do care, sit down with your lawyer and just be like, \"Hey, is this true? Could this happen to me?\" And they'll be like, \"Yeah, obviously.\" And you'd be like, \"If I'd like to prevent that, what could I do?\" And they'll be like, \"Well, your investors might not like it. Investors like it this way. It maximizes their returns.\" And you're like, \"Yeah, but that's not what I asked you.\" And your lawyer is good enough to know the answer to this question. What can you do? And if they can't go back and rewind the video that, Lenny, I just had named a bunch of things. You can do founders preferred shares, you can do all this stuff.\n\n(01:48:10):\nJust ask them about some of that stuff. And don't ask them, \"Should I do it?\" Ask them, \"Tell me for each thing, can you give me the pros and cons of doing it?\" And then they'll be like, \"The pros are it might actually allow you to save your company's soul in a dire situation like this. The cons are investors might not like it too much.\" So sit there and be like, \"Hmm, I'd like to do it. That sounds good. Thank you for advising me on the pros and cons. You work for me, you're my lawyer. I'd like to implement this thing.\"\n\n(01:48:33):\nAnd honestly, just pick a few of them to get started with. And over time, what you need to do, last piece of advice, every founder wants the one weird trick, this is how Lean Startup started too. People were like, \"Can you just tell me the one weird trick to keep my company innovative forever?\" It's like, there's no one weird trick. You want to do the right thing, it is a relentless and constant process. We need to build a structure of the company so that at every level, at every moment, every decision the company makes, somebody in the room making that decision feels like they have a fiduciary duty to do the right thing.\n\n(01:49:06):\nIf that's the outcome you want, then this is going to be a perpetual process of constantly trying to find ways to create the alignment that is needed between the governance, the management structure, and the actual operations and culture of the company. Those are not separate things. They're actually only one thing, because it's just one being. You have a skeletal system, a muscular system, and a circulatory system, but those things are not separate. They work together to produce you, the being. And the same thing is true for these governance structures. So I think most founders are under-indexed, under-invested in that, and that's why we get to these horrible outcomes.\n\nLenny (01:49:38):\nTo give founders a little ammo in doing this, because as you said, investors are not going to be excited to sacrifice profits, employees may not be. Other companies that you can share that have done this and have implemented some of these things that are public? And if not, what confidence can you give founders to be like, \"Many, many amazing companies have done this and it's actually not that hard\"?\n\nEric Ries (01:49:58):\nI don't like to name specific company names in venues like this, because then people always are like, \"Well, but what about...\" It's just, people like to do the whataboutism thing too much. And also I like to let companies speak for themselves. I have way too much confidential information, and I just have to be really careful about it. But nothing I'm describing here is hypothetical or unreal. I have witnessed this many, many, many times myself, and every story I tell, it's a real company that you can meet. They're real people that are out there.\n\n(01:50:24):\nAnd they're not always the loudest. The loud voices in our industry tend to be the ones that have something to sell, and these companies are just quietly doing the right thing. They don't really need to tell you about it because they're doing it. So there's an inverse proportion to the loudness and controversy and meanness of the thing, and how likely it is to be accurate, unfortunately.\n\n(01:50:47):\nWhat I will say is this is kind of an open secret in the world. So here's the thing that really surprised me. I thought the way that we build companies, like the standard corporate governance practices that we all do, must be well established in research. They must be well backed up. It must be the only and best way. But when you start studying these things, you find the exceptions really fast. I got into this because of Toyota, only because I called the thing Lean Startups, I wanted to borrow stuff from lean manufacturing, I studied Toyota.\n\n(01:51:18):\nWell, Toyota has a really weird corporate governance system, which is part of the old Japanese keiretsu system where the Toyota family is intertwined in its ownership with their supplier... By modern standards, it's a terrible rat's nest of disastrous corporate governance practices. But if you look at the literature, everybody who studies Toyota is like, \"Well, the reason they're able to do this awesome stuff is because they have a philosophy of long-term thinking.\" I used to be like, \"Well, how can you have a philosophy of long-term thinking if you're subject to quarterly returns?\" And they'd be like, \"Oh, they don't pay attention to that stuff because they have this other structure.\"\n\n(01:51:48):\nI'm like, \"Oh, that's weird.\" So for a while I was like, \"Oh, I guess it's just Toyota. We should build more Toyotas.\" But then there's all these family run companies out there where the family has produced this outcome. And then I started to meet foundation controlled companies. It's funny, OpenAI is the hottest new thing. OpenAI is a nonprofit foundation with a wholly owned for-profit subsidiary. I thought that was like, \"Wow, OpenAI.\" That's actually very common. There are a lot of companies like that in the world. In certain European countries, it's actually 20 or 25% of the companies, public companies, are all structured that way. So it's actually totally normal.\n\n(01:52:21):\nAnd I did a talk for one of those companies a few years ago, and it blew my mind, because when I would go there and talk to them, I was talking to their CEO and their leadership and I was like, \"Oh, what's it like to deal with the public markets and quarterly?\" And they were like, \"Well, we don't do that.\" I was like, \"Oh, is that a major source of competitive disadvantage? You guys are a nonprofit.\" And they're like, \"Are you kidding me? We crush our competitors, because they have to waste time on all that stuff. We don't waste time on it.\" I was like, \"Oh.\"\n\n(01:52:48):\nAnyone ever heard of Warren Buffett? Why do his companies have a competitive... People are always like, \"Oh, if you're giving up profit, your investors might not like it.\" I'm like, \"These companies are world destroyers.\" What are we giving up? That's why I go start with the wrong definition of profit. We'll actually make a ton more money if we do it this way. And Amazon, for all of its flaws, the long-term thinking and the customer centricity, that's a major source of competitive advantage.\n\n(01:53:14):\nAnd I've worked with Amazon, I've worked with many of their competitors, and the funny part with competitors sitting there, they're like, \"Oh man, Amazon's entering our market, and we need to do X, Y, Z.\" And I'm always like, \"Do you think Amazon's doing X, Y, Z?\" And they're like, \"Oh no, they don't have to do that stuff. We have to do all this bullshit that our investors require and the activists and whatever.\" It's like, \"Well, if you're competing against them and they don't have to do that crap, maybe you should try doing it their way.\" And they'd be like, \"Oh, our investors wouldn't like that.\"\n\n(01:53:36):\nI was like, \"Your investors want you to get your butt kicked by Amazon? Are you sure?\" So I actually think... One of my realizations here is that the investor centric view of corporations, what's called the shareholder primacy theory of corporations, it's just wrong. It's wrong even if all you care about is maximizing returns for shareholders. Shareholders have this propensity to be the person who killed the goose that laid the golden egg, and it's been going on for 150 years. These case studies go back to the 19th century. This is an old, old, old idea.\n\n(01:54:03):\nAnd the solutions are actually all hidden in plain sight. So I was reading a research paper the other day that studied some of these, I think it was in Denmark, foundation controlled companies versus level matched public companies that are not foundation controlled. And they found the foundation controlled companies outperformed from a financial performance perspective.\n\n(01:54:19):\nAnd I was like, \"How is this not the most incendiary result ever?\" If this is true, so much of the indoctrination we've all received about what it means to be a for-profit company is just wrong, because those companies should be riddled with slowness and agency problems. I know the theory so well, I can tell you all the things that ought to be true. If those things are not true, what's up? And then I was like, \"Wait a minute. I've been to these foundation controlled companies.\" I've been to Hershey, it's just controlled by, the founder donated the shares to a foundation that runs a school.\n\n(01:54:51):\nI've seen it with my own eyes, and even having seen it with my own eyes, it took me a while to realize, \"Wait a minute, this is an open secret.\" So I was kind of horrified to find out that this is well-known, and yet was never offered to me. How come no one ever offered me the chance to build a company this way? And if you study even OpenAI or any of these companies that are now structured this way, it's always very idiosyncratic. They were on the standard path and then something happened that allowed them to do something unusual. And I was like, \"Well, I don't understand why we have to wait for it to be idiosyncratic. Why don't we do it on purpose?\"\n\n(01:55:20):\nAnd so I started to conceive of this idea, I call it the spiritual holding company, basically the thing at the center that is responsible for the soul of the overall ecosystem of companies, that is the enterprise. And you can see that obviously in the OpenAI example, if anyone has studied the anthropic long-term benefit trust, it is not coincidentally structured that way, but you see lots of examples where that's what's done.\n\n(01:55:47):\nAnd I started just pitching it to founders and said, \"Look, let me try to show you what the benefit of this would be.\" And I've been amazed how many founders break down. I've had founders start crying with me where they're like, \"This is what I always really wanted to do, but I never felt like... No one would talk to me about it. I didn't think it was possible. I want to put... There's a critical stakeholder I want to put at the center of everything I'm doing, or there's some reason why we're doing this, and I want that to be the thing.\" I was talking about a startup who's trying to get... And again, it's not like a Kumbaya thing, do-gooder whatever, virtue signaling bullshit. It's a competitive issue.\n\n(01:56:20):\nThere's a company that is working to recruit academic researchers to leave their lab and come work for the startup full-time. It is one of the most difficult recruiting challenges there is, because it's not talking about kids out of some school. It's tenured professors who are leaving behind a very good life to go do this thing. They would only do it if they profoundly believed in your mission, but they're not naive.\n\n(01:56:41):\nAnd the first question every one of those people ask is, \"How do I know this technology's not going to be used for evil? I have complete academic freedom. I'm going to give that up for you. Make me believe that this is the real thing.\" And if you're like, \"Well, we believed in some manifesto and we're good people and we got money from some investor who's promised you he's going to be a good guy,\" that is not going to cut it.\n\n(01:57:04):\nAnd so they're having to do the whole thing, sit down with their lawyers. \"What do I have to do to make this promise real for these people to make them want to join?\" And I've just seen that over and over again. If we have the courage to do it, it can solve what are really today considered insoluble business problems. So it's cool, but I think it's scary for people to feel like they're doing something different. And so I think over time we'll get more of these stories on the record. There'll be more precedent for it. But I got to say, not to hearken back to Lean Startup too much, but I'll never forget sitting with early people who were like, \"What's the proof? What big company is doing this?\" And I'll be like, \"Just wait. If you don't want the competitive advantage now, you can get it later.\"\n\n(01:57:46):\nAnd many of the people... Look back on who was profiled in those books. Many of the early Lean Startup adopters are very successful people today because they didn't feel like they had to wait. They were able to think for themselves and apply the principles in their own life. And I don't ask anyone to take this on faith. This is not like, \"You have to do what I say.\" It's more just like, think for yourself. If this makes sense to you and no one can explain to you why it's a bad idea in ways that you find compelling, give yourself permission to at least try it and see what happens.\n\nLenny (01:58:13):\nWhat a beautiful example of first principles thinking, looping back to our very first question. I think this is going to be the longest episode we've done yet, which is amazing. Also, I think it might be my new favorite episode, so that's a good conversation.\n\nEric Ries (01:58:13):\nThank you for saying so.\n\nLenny (01:58:27):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We'll see what sort of lightning we find. Are you ready?\n\nEric Ries (01:58:34):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:58:36):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEric Ries (01:58:40):\nThere's a book called \"The Enlightened Capitalists\" that is just a hundred years of people trying to fix this problem and failing, and the detailed case studies, and no founder should ever read it end-to-end. It's too depressing. But it's important to know some of these stories of founders that they're willing to talk about their regrets on their deathbed that they wish they had done differently. And for those who think there's one weird trick, this will help disabuse you of that notion, but it's helpful to understand that mistakes have been made before so that we can do better going forward.\n\n(01:59:11):\nOn a happier note, I really want more people to read Ken Liu's \"The Dandelion Dynasty\". It's a silk punk fantasy series, but it's written by... He's a wonderful writer and it's like, if you want to see what real optimism about engineering and the ability of engineers to change the world, but transformed into a totally different environment, it's just such a great read. The audiobook is really good also, and I've been kind of plugging that lately.\n\n(01:59:38):\nAnd then if you want just something that's pure fun, it's not really the season for a summer read, but also a really good audiobook is the Murderbot Diaries by Martha Wells. She's just such a great writer, and I know it's a very frivolous thing on the surface, but there's actually a lot in there, and I won't ruin it for... Nothing I would say would be a spoiler, but there's actually a surprising amount of depth for what is really just a fun action adventure kind of read. I can't wait. I hope it is someday made into a movie. If they do it justice, it'll be really terrific.\n\nLenny (02:00:12):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nEric Ries (02:00:15):\nI really have been try... I don't have time anymore. I have young kids, so my media consumption days are extremely, extremely limited. But I've been kind forcing myself to slog through a bunch of the Disney+ Star Wars series, which have been almost universally disappointing with the exception of Andor. For those that have not seen Andor, it really is very good. Not good for a Disney+ Star Wars show, it's actually good for television, which I couldn't believe when I saw the premise of it.\n\nLenny (02:00:41):\nAlso a huge fan of Andor, and I've recommended it many times. And I feel like now every new Star Wars series, I'm just comparing it to that bar, and it's not...\n\nEric Ries (02:00:47):\nThat's the problem. It's like, if they would just make that creative team or they would just let them make shows, it would be okay. It would redeem all the rest of their failures.\n\nLenny (02:00:56):\nYeah, or just keep making sequels. I'll watch them all. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask people when you're interviewing them?\n\nEric Ries (02:01:03):\nMy favorite interview question of all time is to ask people to describe a best practice that they learned in their career and to really get into it. Like, \"Tell me the story of how you learned the best practice,\" you just let them go on, and then you'd be like, \"Great. Tell me a situation where that best practice would not be applicable.\" Most people can't do it.\n\nLenny (02:01:23):\nSo interesting. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like? Whether it's an app or something physical.\n\nEric Ries (02:01:31):\nI was just singing the praises of a product to a friend. It's the most boring and stupid product ever. It's just a humidifier. And you'd be like, \"Okay, how can you mess up a humidifier?\" But actually, it's very difficult to get it exactly right. There's all these little attention to detail craft. We were talking about craft, it was on my mind. It's a very humble appliance, and it's actually, I've gone through 10 different models trying to find something that doesn't drive me...\n\n(02:01:58):\nBecause you want to run it at night, but if it has a light and it's on all night, that's really annoying. If it makes a noise, that's no good. There's all these things where you're like, \"Boy, if anyone had used the jobs to be done framework for one minute on what this physical device is supposed to be, this is the product they would've built.\" And I can't believe... It's so interesting in modern capitalism, there's so many categories where there isn't a product like that, or there's just one. You're like, \"How come every product is not like that?\" And the forces we've been talking about are the reason why it's funny to see it represented in such a humble object.\n\nLenny (02:02:30):\nWhat is the actual humidifier that you found?\n\nEric Ries (02:02:33):\nIt's the Levoit 300S ultrasonic humidifier. Lavoit 300S. It's just a really well-made $60 appliance. It's nothing special.\n\nLenny (02:02:45):\nThey're about to see a spike in sales. Go Lavoit.\n\nEric Ries (02:02:49):\nSomewhere, somehow, there was a product management meeting where they talked about how to make this thing, and I can picture it right now. Somebody was like, \"Look, the way we make these things sucks. Can you please let me just put the thing that's normally on the bottom, let me put it on the top and let me put this in there and put that in there?\" And someone was like, \"Who cares? That's going to add 3 cents to the cost and reduce our margins by whatever.\" And someone was like, \"No, really think we should do it right.\" So we like to reward people like that.\n\nLenny (02:03:15):\nYeah, and this is going to take us off-topic potentially, but I've been thinking more recently about how most often the best stuff comes from just one person's singular control over how to do that thing over and over and over.\n\nEric Ries (02:03:27):\nYeah. There's actually, if you study Toyota production system, they have this job that's called the chief engineer. I wish more founders knew about this, because when you become large, it's important to be able to empower the founders that work for you and not just only see yourself as the founder. So the chief engineer is the person with the moral authority over an entire line, like a car from start to finish.\n\n(02:03:47):\nAnd I don't know if this is still true, but back in the days when people were writing a lot about Toyota, inside the company, the car is not called a Toyota Camry. It is called \"so-and-so san's car\". And the thing about the chief engineer is they have no reports. Nobody works for them, they just have what's called the big room, if you've studied that whole thing. There's a place where they are, and they have a small staff, but they have the design and the car, and as the number of people who work on a car, it swells up and then it comes down. Because you have the design phase and then you go into production, and eventually the number of people goes back down.\n\n(02:04:21):\nThe most important thing you have to do in a product is make trade-off decisions. And if you just let people make their own trade-off decisions, it's totally different. It's really difficult to have any kind of coherent design like thrust. So the idea is like, \"This is the person who makes those.\" If there's a fight between two departments about how much the thing should cost or if someone asks a question, like, \"Listen, I can improve the aerodynamics of the thing by this much, but it will cost this much, and it will mean we have to take this button and turn it from metal to plastic,\" you have someone who can actually be like, \"No, that button has to be metal. We made a promise that this is going to be.\" Or \"Button doesn't matter.\" You just need someone who knows that thing. It has to be that you can keep it in somebody's head. So yeah, called the chief engineer.\n\nLenny (02:05:00):\nJust when I thought we were done with golden nuggets in this episode. That is so interesting. I think that makes so much sense, and I also agree that should happen more often at companies. Wow.\n\nEric Ries (02:05:09):\nYeah, it's very much missing structures.\n\nLenny (02:05:12):\n[inaudible 02:05:12] All right, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself, share with folks, something that you come back to often that helps you do the right sorts of things?\n\nEric Ries (02:05:22):\nWell, I won't get into the whole explanation. The motto is that nothing real can be threatened, and nothing unreal exists.\n\nLenny (02:05:30):\nWe'll have a whole other episode just unpacking that. Amazing. Final question, you invented a lot of terms, a lot of concepts. Is there one that you don't think caught fire and that kind of spread as much as you thought it should?\n\nEric Ries (02:05:44):\nOh, yeah. Yeah. I got tons. I got tons, man. The cutting room floor is full of so many things. I went through a really extended period of trying to use... But it was before Lean Startup, I tried to use cell biology as the metaphor for a startup. It should have been... I wanted something more biological and less mechanical. I never got one person to understand what I was talking about. It did not work.\n\n(02:06:06):\nBut I'll tell you the one that surprised me the most. This is such a small one, but I really thought that this would take off and people would be way into it. I did a lot of writing about it and then I couldn't get it to stick. So everyone knows viral loops. There's also engagement loops, and I was like, \"Oh, just like we have viral loops, which is about how products grow, we should also have engagement loops, which is about how people stick.\"\n\n(02:06:28):\nAnd there's a science to stickiness, and people have written about that from the point of view. \"How do you make your product more addictive?\" But that's not really what this is about. This is about being able to model the dynamics of how customers flow through. And a version of that is in the Lean Startup. We have what I call the law of sustainable growth, which is a situation where new customers come as a natural side effect of the actions of past customers.\n\n(02:06:52):\nAnd so that is obviously true of the viral loop. Everyone knows the paid engine of acquisition where you have, whether your marginal profit per customer drives your ability to invest in customer acquisition. But there's also what I call the sticky engine of growth, which is kind of like the vestige of this idea that made it into the Lean Startup. But I actually think that that's a whole really interesting thing where, if you think about, the way to think about it is if someone is living their life, having a happy time, then for some reason they use your product, why did they use your product? What made them come back to your product?\n\n(02:07:24):\nAnd it's actually, there's not that many things it can be. It might be because you gave them a synthetic notification like, \"Hey, please come back to my product,\" and they did. It could be because some kind of organic notification took place, that is, like, they got an email from a friend on your platform that was like, they got a notification that was driven by... One of the most successful customer emails of all time is PayPal's, \"You've got money, click here to take the money.\" It has a very high click-through rate, maybe second only to Facebook, \"Someone has tagged you in a photo, but we're not going to tell you which photo it was. So you better click, right?\"\n\n(02:07:58):\nSo something happened. If it's not one of those two things, then it's got to be because of positioning. Something in your brain on its own told you to use that product. Why did you go start playing World of Warcraft? Did you have to get a notification to remind you? You like playing it, no one had to tell you. You like you doing it, or something happened in your life that made you need, you're hungry so you went to the thing to get the food.\n\n(02:08:25):\nBecause those are the only ways by which people come back to a product, those all can be measured, studied, and understood to the same level of precision as we have with viral loops. I can't for the life of me understand why viral loops gets all the attention and no one is remotely interested in the science of engagement. I was a time when I thought engagement loops would make me way more famous than Lean Startup ever would. I was very, very wrong.\n\nLenny (02:08:49):\nThis also reminds me that you also, I think, were the first person to talk about growth as loops and these specific loops and a growth engine, which now a lot of people talk about.\n\nEric Ries (02:08:57):\nYeah, [inaudible 02:08:57] growth is mine, yeah.\n\nLenny (02:08:59):\nYeah. So wow, we discovered another one. I imagine there's many more. Eric, this was incredible. I definitely think this is my new favorite episode. Thank you so much for being here.\n\n(02:09:07):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you a line if they want to reach out potentially? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEric Ries (02:09:13):\nYou still find me at theleanstartup.com. I'm @ericries, E-R-I-C-R-I-E-S, on all the usual places, although I really don't do a lot of social anymore, so joining my mailing list at theleanstartup.com is probably the best way to keep track of the major things that I do in my life. And then, yeah, I do try to get on some social from sometimes to make some announcements. And if people want to reach out, I'm just eric@theleanstartup.com.\n\nLenny (02:09:35):\nHow can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEric Ries (02:09:37):\nOh, that's really sweet. Honestly, people need to just take these ideas and do something with them, and then you learn something from it, and then tell me what happens. That's all I want in exchange. Just tell me what happened. Even if you... The people I've learned the most from are the people that tried to use my ideas, thought they were the stupidest thing they ever heard of and doesn't work and they're mad. Tell me, I want to know all about it, because really my job, the way I see myself is, my job is just to try to understand these things. I just want to know the truth. If I'm wrong... I don't like being wrong, I'm as attached to my ideas as anybody else, but I try really hard to find out what is true. So if you discover something new, please tell me. That's all I ask, is let me know.\n\n(02:10:18):\nAnd if you don't try, then how are you ever going to discover anything new? Every day I meet people who've just heard about Lean Startup for the first time. For me, it's so old... Every day people read the book for the first time and they have a question about... So if that's where you're at and you just discovered it, excellent. I wrote a couple books. You can go read them, please [inaudible 02:10:38] for those ideas. If you're someone who's jaded and you're like, \"Oh, I'm so tired of hearing about Lean Startup,\" I mentioned a few new ideas in this conversation. Go try one of those. And even if it doesn't work, or if it does work, or even the people I've learned a lot from are people who, they tried it, and in the process of it not working, they had another even better idea, and then they went and did that.\n\n(02:10:59):\nWell, go do that. All I ask is you tell me what happened. I want to learn from people who are making this happen. And I hope as we come together as a, not just as a Lean Startup movement, but as a startup movement, as a group of people who fundamentally believe that we can make the world a better place through the building of organizations from scratch. We have that as our belief, that the future is not scary. Newness is not something to be feared or opposed, but there is a responsible, methodical, value-creating way to make positive change in the world. That's an ethos that is not universally shared, and that if someone's listening to your podcast, my assumption is you're in our tribe. So we have a collective responsibility to think about, \"What do we stand for beyond just my company, my founder, my story, but what do we as a group? What are our shared and collective values, and how do we make those manifest in the world?\"\n\n(02:11:53):\nI'll leave you with one last idea. We collectively have so much power it's crazy. Because the system the way it works now, what I've learned about our current, what they call late-stage capitalism, financialized engine of capitalism, is that it is value-destroying in so many ways. And although markets discipline companies and they require them to create more value than is destroyed to stay alive, new companies, the ones that we've built, are so valuable.\n\n(02:12:21):\nThe core insight that makes the thing is so valuable that the being that you've built can withstand so much damage before it collapses. And yet, if you look at the average tenure of companies in public companies, you just look at average CEO tenure, all the metrics you look at are really grim here. We're destroying companies faster than we create them, such as that the total net number of public companies in America is down more than half from a peak that was in our lifetime. It's not that long ago. What's going on? Well, the system requires a steady supply of fresh meat to replenish that which it destroys.\n\n(02:12:54):\nAnd if you're listening to this podcast, you probably are one of the peddlers. So you're the manufacturer of the thing that the system requires for its basic survival. And so as a matter of fact, we as a group, we get to set the terms by which this is done. And so if we want to stop selling our beings, our babies, our children for money, we don't have to do that. If we want them to have a certain ethos themselves in the world, we want them to be trustworthy counterparties and do something for the people we care about, we can insist that that is the precondition upon which we will give our everything to.\n\n(02:13:26):\nAnd so I don't want to say that I know all the answers or that my values are the ones that should win out, but I do think that we do have a certain shared set of values that we ought to be more ardent in defending. And I hope your listeners will take that to heart.\n\nLenny (02:13:40):\nA beautiful and empowering way to end this. Eric Ries, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEric Ries (02:13:46):\nMy pleasure.\n\nLenny (02:13:47):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(02:13:50):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Inside Bolt: From near-death to one of the fastest-growing products in history | Eric Simons\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nThe rate you're growing is absurd. You're in this cohort of companies that are just growing at rates that we've never seen in the history of startups.\n\nEric Simons (00:00:05):\nThe company was on the verge of going under when we launched Bolt, and what ended up happening is, in the first two months it went from zero to 20 million of ARR. And we've already crossed 30 million of ARR, with the current rate we're on, our forecast for the year is we want to get to 100 million of ARR.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:22):\nThis is just non-stop wild shit. How is this possible? What has allowed you to grow this much, this fast, with such a small team?\n\nEric Simons (00:00:30):\nMost importantly, it's been the people. It's rare to find startups where you have the core group of five, six, seven people that have been there for five years plus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:38):\nYou basically were building a tech first, and then looking for a problem to solve later, which is often what people tell you not to do.\n\nEric Simons (00:00:44):\nI think that's the hard thing about being an entrepreneur. There are periods of time where you have to make judgment calls that are not going to be the consensus view. You got to have confidence in your convictions on how to best play the hand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nA lot of people see these stats, and they sometimes don't see that there was also years and years of work before that.\n\nEric Simons (00:00:59):\nIt was kind of like, Bolt's this overnight success, seven years in the making.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):\nToday my guest is Eric Simons. Eric is co-founder and CEO of StackBlitz, which makes a product called Bolt, which is currently neck and neck with Cursor for being the fastest growing product in history. They're currently the number one most popular web AI code app with over three million registered users. Two months after launching last October, they hit 20 million ARR. At the time of this recording, they're approaching 40 million ARR. The story of Bolt is wild. They actually started the company seven years ago, and were about to run out of money and shut down. But they realized the tech that they'd been building for the past seven years, called WebContainer, was perfectly suited for building AI products in a browser. So they launched the product with a tweet, and as Eric describes it, it was an overnight success seven years in the making. If you'd like to better understand the cutting edge of AI coding apps, and where things are going with AI and product building, this episode is a must listen.\n\n(00:02:02):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Eppo is a next generation A-B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth, and for understanding the performance of new features, and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis, in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(00:02:52):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more, with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time, and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged analytics cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A-B testing flywheel.\n\n(00:03:21):\nEppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.

Full disclosure, real estate investing is boring. Prediction markets are exciting, meme coins are a thrill ride, even the stock market can swing wildly on a headline. Hello, Deep Zeke. But with real estate investing, there's no drama, or adrenaline, or excuses to refresh your portfolio every few minutes. Just bland and boring stuff like diversification and dividends, so you won't be surprised to learn that the Fundrise Flagship Real Estate Fund is a complete snooze fest. The fund holds $1.1 billion worth of institutional caliber real estate, managed by team of pros focused on steadily growing your net worth for decades to come. See? Boring.\n\n(00:04:24):\nThat's the point. You can start investing in minutes, and with as little as $10 by visiting fundrise.com/lenny.

This is a paid ad.\n\n(00:04:49):\nEric, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nEric Simons (00:04:52):\nThank you for having me. Yeah, I'm stoked to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:54):\nFor folks that are not super familiar with Bolt, what is Bolt?\n\nEric Simons (00:04:58):\nIt's really simple. You go there, there's a text box, and you tell it what you want to build. Whether it's a web or a mobile app, and so, it's kind of one of these text to app building tools that have become pretty popular over the past few months here. And it's not just building a static site, or something like that, but you can actually build full stack, real software with databases, and hosting and et cetera, just from prompting. And in a ridiculously short period of time, it's not like you're spending hours and hours or days, putting this together. You can get results in like, a minute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:36):\nLet's just share some numbers about the scale of what you're building. The rate you're growing is absurd. You're kind in this cohort of companies that are just growing at rates that we've never seen in the history of startups, and you guys are at the edge of that. Share some numbers about how things went when you launched, and where they're at today.\n\nEric Simons (00:05:53):\nYeah, when we launched, the company was on the verge of going under when we launched Bolt, our company StackBlitz. We'd been around for seven years building web-based development, environment stuff. And so when we launched this we were like, \"This would be amazing if this added a 100K of ARR over the next couple of months.\" And what ended up happening is, in the first two months, we went from zero to 20 million of ARR. And I think we're on month four, or four and a half or something like that at this point, and we've already crossed 30 million of ARR, and we're on the verge of crossing 40. By the time this comes out, it appears that we're going to be at 40 million ARR. So it's just, the scale of the growth of the revenue has been nuts.\n\n(00:06:41):\nAnd of course, that correlates with insane user growth, as well. We've added three million registered users just in the past few months here, and monthly active users is around a million, I think at this point, per month. So it's just been... I've never seen anything, I've been doing startups for 15 years, I've never seen anything like this. Everyone I've talked to, our investors, or et cetera, there's not a lot of corollaries to what's going on here. And it's kind of extraordinary, because our company wasn't doing AI stuff six months ago. We had no AI products, and just out of nowhere we, from almost death of the company to being the number one buy traffic revenue, et cetera, like AI Cogen app, that's totally web-based, in the world. I think the only other startup ahead of us is for Cogen, just in general, would be Cursor, and the option revenue at this point.\n\n(00:07:45):\nAnd so anyways, it's been a heck of a ride. And our team's like 15, 20 people, so it's just dealing with, we're going to be closing on 100,000 customers, and our support team's like three people. So we're trying to scale as fast as we can. So it's just kind of mind-boggling, just the scale of the demand, and how we've had to turn things around to match the demand as best as we can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:14):\nMind-boggling is an excellent way to describe what you just shared. A million monthly active users, you're at 40 million annual recurring revenue, five months into the business. Is that right?\n\nEric Simons (00:08:26):\nYeah, single digit. Yeah, single digit weeks. That's the current track rate that we're seeing for the thing. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):\nI think, are you guys are the fastest growing startup in history?\n\nEric Simons (00:08:37):\nI mean, I think it depends on probably where you peg the number. Because yeah, we're here to just build great products, and just push the limits of what's possible with the technology. And I think that we do our jobs well, kind of crazy things can happen, but I mean, the current track rate we have, we're going to be exceeding the forecast for Q1 with the current rate we're on, and our forecast for the year is we want to get to 100 million of ARR. And now, I think there's been a couple, that would either be on par with Cursor, or ahead of them, or something like that.\n\n(00:09:19):\nAnd I think there's going to be more things like this, too. I don't think that... It just, there's something really, I think a lot of people are in disbelief about it too, where they're like, \"This is, okay.\" And this is from when we were at, got to four million ARR, five million ARR in the first month. I would talk with people and they're like, \"Okay, yeah, but that could go to zero.\" And then it went to 20 the next, \"Ah, it could go to zero,\" but now we're closing on 40.\n\n(00:09:40):\nSo from my view, I was also very skeptical, as this. I've never seen anything grow like this, right? And so part of me, for like a month I was kind of waking up waiting for the day where it just was like, \"Okay, it's over.\" You know what I mean? This crazy thing happened, and now it's not. But that data just hasn't come. And you see this happening with Cursor, you see this with a lot of these other AI startups. And the value proposition is real. The free market is filled with rational actors. People are coming to these tools because it is solving problems, they're able to do way more for way less cost, than it would otherwise. And that's why I said, I think we're going to see more of this, whether it's in coding or other verticals, or whatever. In a sense, it's almost like maybe the new normal, as AI just continues to get better. But, anyways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):\nLet's get to a demo of Bolt, so people can actually see what this looks like in action. And as you go through it, if you can even point out stuff that is different from other products in the space, say Lovable, VZERO, Replit, that other folks have heard about, that'd be useful.\n\nEric Simons (00:10:57):\nAwesome. Cool. Yeah, so this is Bolt, you just go to bolt.new. Things that I think are really interesting about Bolt. One is, it's just dead simple. Whether you're logged in or logged out, it's the same UI, it's extremely simple, it's just a text box. And I think that the biggest difference between Bolt and the other stuff out there, it's actually subtle. It's not like something you'd necessarily see in the UI, but it's how fast it is, and how reliable it is.\n\n(00:11:23):\nAnd this is because of how we are actually doing the compute, because what's going on here is when you type into, whether it's Bolt or another product, it has to spin up a dev environment to actually make that application. So there needs to be some operating system somewhere that's running it. Everyone else runs those things on cloud servers, which those can take minutes to boot up, and they often will run into issues, and then you can end up literally stuck and have to contact support to get it done, and get it unstuck.\n\n(00:11:49):\nWith Bolt, and for the past seven years, what our company's been doing has been building an operating system that runs inside of your browser locally, using your CPU. So we have a very permissive free tier, and it's insanely fast, and it's insanely reliable.\n\n(00:12:02):\nSo if I want to, just as a quick example of this say, \"Make a clone of Spotify,\" and just hit enter. This thing's already getting to work, and already, on the right here, this is a full dev environment. This is an actual operating system, running inside of my browser. And I can run commands on it, et cetera. And really, what you're seeing down here, this terminal and kind of what's backing it, this is what took us really five, six, seven years to build, and make so reliable. There would not be a Bolt without this technology called WebContainer, that allows us to run an operating system in the browser.\n\n(00:12:38):\nBecause what's going on here is, our AI agent for Bolt has bidirectional communication with this operating system. It's writing code, it's running the dev server for this thing, it's going to go ahead and spin this up. You can see how fast this is, in a matter of 60 seconds I said, \"Make me a Spotify clone,\" and now we have one. And it looks pretty darn good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:55):\nThat looks really good.\n\nEric Simons (00:12:58):\nAnd that's one of the other aspects around Bolt is, this technology we made for the operating system side, the guys that have been working with us for the past five-plus years on it, before this they were actually doing machine learning AI stuff. And so when it came time to write the agent for Bolt, we had just an incredible amount of in-house expertise on how to actually merge these two different technology sets, to have this really reliable experience that produces really beautiful, really functional stuff. So that's based on what's really cool about the Bolt experience.\n\n(00:13:32):\nThe other thing is, a lot of these products it's like, you can make something, but often you want to actually have a URL where you can share this. Having, maybe even attach a domain to it, or whatever have you. So with Bolt, we actually have built-in integrations with production grade hosting providers like Netlify, and for databases with Supabase.\n\n(00:13:53):\nSo if I go and just click the deploy button here, this is actually going to run a production build of this project we made here. And again, this is doing this entirely inside of my browser, so it doesn't cost us anything to do this. So again, you can do this for free, and it has gone ahead and deployed this on a real URL, on Netlify. This is live, I can share this with anyone, and if I want to buy the domain spotifyclone.com, and point it at this, I can click this link here. That will kick me into Netlify, I can attach this to my account, buy a domain, point at that thing. And then from there on out, whenever I'm prompting Bolt to make changes to this application and hit deploy, that goes live on my public website.\n\n(00:14:36):\nSo this is the simplest way to build a web app that's ever existed. That was one of the key realizations I had, a couple of weeks into the thing, I was seeing people use this for personal use cases. Like medical donation sites, or weddings, or whatever. And I was like, \"Don't these people know that Wix or Squarespace exists? Should I tell them?\" And then it hit me. Those things are so complicated to use. I don't know if you've ever seen just the UI of these things, but they're crazy complicated, and that's just for building a static website. There's no way you could actually build a functional app. And that's like, with Bolt, if we were to sit here for another 30 minutes, we would have streaming. You'd be able to make playlists of different MP3 files, or whatever. You can just keep prompting this thing to keep adding functionality.\n\n(00:15:25):\nSo that's, I think, some of the cool core experience of both here. I can show you something cool that we just launched, if that would be of interest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):\nLet's do it.\n\nEric Simons (00:15:32):\nSo this is like web apps, right? Web apps are amazing, but often you want to have a native app. And it's hard to build web apps, it's even harder to build native apps, that can actually, that you can then go put in the app store. And so we partnered up with a company called Expo, and their entire business is making, basically, React Native tooling and this ecosystem that makes it super easy to build beautiful apps, and actually get them in the app store.\n\n(00:15:57):\nAnd so right here, I'll zoom in a little bit, we have this little, \"Build a mobile app with Expo.\" So if you click that, we kind of instruct you on how to just prompt mobile apps into existence. So yeah, let's make another Spotify clone that's an actual native mobile app. Let's say, \"Make a Spotify clone,\" go ahead and hit enter. And what this thing's going to do is actually, again, spin up a operating system here, where it's going to boot up the Expo tool chain and actually go and make a mobile app for us.\n\n(00:16:28):\nAnd what's cool about this is, we could actually preview it just in the browser here, but once this thing's done and it boots up, it's going to show a QR code, we're going to be able to scan it, and in real time actually basically have a test flight of this native application that we can try it on our phones, and as we keep prompting you'll see it making changes and stuff. This is kind of the first time that, you don't have to be technical to make production grade web, full-stack web and mobile apps. At this point I've done nothing that requires developer knowledge to do any of this stuff.\n\n(00:17:10):\nAnd I think that's what a lot of people are really excited about with this, and you know, the majority of our audience are people that are not developers, that are using this. They're PMs, they're designers, they're entrepreneurs. Because these are people that have always been great at building products, but previously, the only way that they could get their ideas into coded software was through a developer's fingertips. And now, they can deal with their own, through prompting.\n\n(00:17:37):\nSo you can see here, we've got this little QR code. I'm going to go ahead and scan the thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:43):\nI'm going to do it, too.\n\nEric Simons (00:17:43):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:44):\nBy the way, I love that you had just enough things to say until it finished. That was pro.\n\nEric Simons (00:17:50):\nJust as I planned, you know? So on my screen it's booting up, it's bundling the JavaScript of this thing, and it's beta. We just launched this last week, by the way. So if you can kind of see on my screen here, I actually have this Spotify looking app, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):\nWow.\n\nEric Simons (00:18:07):\nThat, you know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:09):\nThat looks like, exactly like Spotify.\n\nEric Simons (00:18:11):\nIt looks exactly like Spotify, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:11):\nIt's good.\n\nEric Simons (00:18:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:14):\nWe're going to be sued right now, so let's be... You're doing too good a job with this. No, that's amazing.\n\nEric Simons (00:18:24):\nYeah. So it's pretty cool, right? And so what's cool is that, and as you keep prompting on your device, it'll just keep reloading. Without you having to kill the app, you can actually see the functionality getting added. And so, in this use case that you and I have right now, it's like if you and I were building an app together, we could be on other sides of the planet and you could actually be not just seeing a screenshot of the thing, but actually touching it and feeling it, and putting it through its paces.\n\n(00:18:47):\nAnd so a lot of product teams, I mean, this is just changing how people do product development. It's faster to do this than design a whole bunch of Figma frames, necessarily. Right? So.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:59):\nWe're going to spend a lot of time on that. Okay, this is incredible, this whole episode so far is you just blowing my mind and I imagine listeners' minds, just over and over and over. I don't even know where to go with all this, sometimes.\n\n(00:19:09):\nYou made a really important point, that you worked on this for seven years before you launched Bolt. A lot of people see these stats, zero to 40 million ARR in five-ish months, and they sometimes don't see that there was also years and years of work before that. And the reason that you guys have been so successful is all the work you did that allowed, that built this WebContainer technology, it sounds like. Is there anything there that's worth sharing, you think, of just that part of the journey? I know we'll go through the origin that all, where Bolt came from, but I guess just that WebContainer component specifically. That feels like a huge deal.\n\nEric Simons (00:19:44):\nA hundred percent it is, yeah. And I would say this is, surprisingly to me, it's still one of the contrarian viewpoints of our company. Because over the years it was like, when we first... And that, the WebContainer was the bet, that we made the company on. Just to be clear. StackBlitz was a browser-based, deep technology play on, \"Can we make a web assembly based operating system that can boot in a browser, in like a hundred milliseconds, and run full on development tool chains?\" That was really it.\n\n(00:20:21):\nAnd we'd gotten the idea for this, and the insight that this might be possible, because back when my co-founder and I came out to the Valley, he and I grew up down the street from each other in Chicago, we wrote code together at 13, and been building stuff ever since. And we came out to the Valley in 2012, and we just had the good fortune of bumping into Dylan Field and Evan Wallace when they were building Figma, in the early days. And that was, I don't think a lot of people know that Figma was also a browser-based deep technology play. Their first pitch for Figma, they didn't have a design tool. Their first pitch was this 3D ball dropping into water, inside of a browser town.\n\n(00:21:00):\nAnd the pitch basically was, \"Browsers have this new capability called WebGL,\" the predecessor to WebAssembly, \"and with these things, for the first time, you could actually create a graphics rendering engine, that you could then build a design tool on top of. But you're going to have to write that rendering engine from scratch, because nothing exists that can just compile into WebGL, or whatever. And if you want the performance you need, et cetera, it's going to take us years to do, but if we do it, we think this will change everything for design.\"\n\n(00:21:35):\nAnd obviously, we know how that story has panned out now. And back in 2017, 2016, 2017, Albert, my co-founder and I, saw the same sort of story begin to play out, but for web development and development environments. And specifically there was some stuff that landed in browsers like WebAssembly, shared memory, service workers, these different APIs. And we were like, \"Oh, wow. It should be possible, theoretically, to write an operating system in WebAssembly that could run Node.js, and NPM and all the tool chains on top of it, that you need to do web development.\"\n\n(00:22:12):\nAnd that would be huge, because setting up developer environments, it's a pain for beginners. A lot of people churn out. The first thing you do when you learn how to code is not even learning how to code, it's how to set up your computer to even start writing the code. If you go join Netflix, or any of these other fan companies, the first month or two is you being onboarded, to run that stuff on your computer and set up your environment. And we're like, \"If we could just have that be something, you click a link and it just boots in your browser, that'd be huge.\"\n\n(00:22:42):\nIt's also, if you look at the other productivity apps that have really worked on the web, they've all had this compute model, right? Figma, when you open a Figma document, there's not like some cloud VM that gets spun up for you to render the documents. You're dragging things around. It's using your CPU and your memory to do the work. Same thing with Google Docs. That's the only model that's ever scaled to a billion users. And so, when you look at Cloud IDEs, like Cloud 9 was the first one, back in 2009 or so. The way these have always worked is that your browser's basically doing nothing, when you go to that. Every user that gets connected, there has to be a cloud VM that gets spun up for them, and then your browser's just taking your keystrokes, sending it to the server, and then sending back the results of it. And that's how all these other AI code, text to app sort of tools work. They're all using cloud VMs.\n\n(00:23:34):\nAnd the problem is, on a small scale it can work, but as you scale it up, I mean there's not even a 100 million VMs to rent, on the planet. But there are a billion devices that you can run this stuff on. Because that's kind of what we've seen with Bolt where, if you want to build a product that's going to be able to scale to that size, you have to look at all factors and go, \"We have to build, make sure the technology provides the best experience, zero latency, transient cost.\" There's a permissive free tier, because the other problem with the server is, you end up, if you have a free tier, people are mining Bitcoin on it, they're DDoSing people using your servers. So inevitably, you have to nerf these things and roll them back. But if it's all done on the end device, it doesn't matter.\n\n(00:24:18):\nSo anyways, WebContainer was the key piece, and what we struggled with, it took us four or five years or something, to build WebContainer. What we struggled with for the years after that was just how to build a product around it, because developers loved it, but they weren't using it in ways that they would pay money for. And as much as the nerd side of me wished that that would be enough, that it was like, building cool technology was enough. It's like, \"It's not. We're here to build a venture scale company.\" And so that was kind of why we were high at the end of the journey, where it was like, we're taking shots on goal. And at some point, this got a connected bat, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:04):\nThere's a lot of really interesting lessons from this journey, that I think are counterintuitive. One is, you basically were building a tech first, and then looking for a problem to solve later. Which is often what people tell you not to do. And it worked out, in this case.\n\n(00:25:19):\nThe other interesting takeaway here is, it feels like it's a similar moment to when AJAX came out and then everyone's just like, \"Wow, you can build new things here.\" So it feels like there's a lesson here of just, \"If there's a new technology that has enabled, something big that we think may, let's just work there for a while, and see if something comes up.\"\n\n(00:25:35):\nAnd then I think the other lesson here is just, as a founder, just survive as long as you can. Because you may find something that works.\n\nEric Simons (00:25:43):\nAll great points, all great points. Because you're dead right. And fortunately, my co-founder and I had, we had built a lot of unsuccessful stars before this. We spend most of the, or 20 times, churning through ideas on things. So when we had conviction, I was like, \"This seems like a technology that will be important.\" It seems like, the web is the most ubiquitous... The pitch or the theory in our head was like, \"The web is the most ubiquitous platform in the world, but yet it has no, you can't use the web to build the web.\"\n\n(00:26:08):\nEvery other platform, Mac has Xcode. Windows has Visual Studio. The web had nothing. And we were like, \"At a minimum, Google should probably buy this thing from us. It seems like it should probably be part of Chrome,\" at a minimum. And we thought, \"Hey, this could be a huge enabler.\" The vision of just making it as easy to build full stack applications as using Canva, it just seemed really compelling.\n\n(00:26:43):\nBut when you do that sort of risky deep technology play, you need to... And we were very good about this, like the previous company Albert and I did, we bootstrapped it all the way through to acquisition, so we understood and we were living hand-to-mouth, to bootstrap that thing. So we understood out of it how to have a low burn rate, and take a lot of shots on goal, and make every dollar stretch beyond what anyone would think is reasonable or possible. And that's how we played our hands with StackBlitz. We didn't raise money for the first two or three years of the company's life. We were bootstrapping it. When we did raise money, we barely spent it. Largely because it was like, \"We need to just take a lot of smart bets, and it doesn't make sense.\"\n\n(00:27:32):\nAnd I would just say generally, until you see pull, just people pulling the product out of your hands, you don't want to be spending money. You should be like, default, no. And when you go and buy software, you should be going, \"We're a tiny startup. Can you sell it for half?\" Everything you buy, just keep the burn rate as low as possible, because you need as many shots on goal as you can possibly get. Because you have no idea. I think just generally, for startups, that's the right way in my view, to approach it. Unless you're seeing, again, immediate demand and pull, or whatever.\n\n(00:28:02):\nBut yeah, I think that'd be, maybe the extra context I'd add on top is, I think that we ended up doing a good job of being extremely conservative. During a time in which, during 2020, through 2020 and 2021, which were times where exuberance and growing headcount was like, KPIs of companies. And were things that were being... With lot of emotional force of like, \"Hey, you guys ought to be doing this.\" And I'm glad that we didn't heed the advice, because if we had tripled the company and kicked up the burn rate, there would be no Bolt. We would've gone out of business a lot of time ago.\n\n(00:28:48):\nSo I think that's the hard thing about being an entrepreneur, I think is you kind of have to... There are periods of time where you have to make judgment calls that are not going to be the consensus view. Maybe years later, it'll become the consensus view, but you got to have confidence in your convictions on how to best play the hand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:15):\nThere's so many great lessons here, I think just this idea of just staying alive. Dalton came on the podcast, he's a partner at YC Ones, and he just had this phrase, \"Just don't die.\" And that's exactly what you guys did, seven years of just trying it until something worked, and I love that you actually were planning to shut down the company right before you launched Bolt. And I know you launched it with just a tweet, right? That was the launch moment?\n\nEric Simons (00:29:35):\nYep. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:37):\nMaybe talk about that moment of just, after launch, signs that, \"Okay, this is working. Something's different.\"\n\nEric Simons (00:29:43):\nYeah, yeah. So day one it was like, there's great reception to the tweet. We were like, \"Wow, this is one of the biggest things, launch day reception we've ever seen.\" And I think on the first day, I think we added 60K of ARR, or something. Which was like, I mean, crazy. Again, we were at 600, so we added 10% in a day. And I remember our dev ops engineer, he was the one who would flag me. He was like, \"Guys, we got 60K today. This is crazy.\" And I was like, \"Yeah, yeah. But this is launch day.\"\n\n(00:30:12):\nThere's the tech crunch, peak of initiation, in the classic startup-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:17):\n[Inaudible 00:30:17]-\n\nEric Simons (00:30:17):\n... star, yeah. I was like, \"Listen, guys.\" I'm trying to temper enthusiasm for the team. I'm like, \"This is great. Got a lot of work to do.\" And then the next day we added 80K, or whatever it was, and it just kind of kept going. And all the while, the product we put out, we built a thing in 90 days. We built Bolt in 90. So there's a lot of things that were missing in the product. Like, basic stuff, basic stuff. And which, again, we cut the right corners on the thing to get it online, but we had this just growing influx of people using it, going, \"How is there not a mobile responsive view? How are chat messages not,\" we got to 20 million of ARR without a mobile responsive view, by the way. Just throwing that out there. It was like the iPhone not having copy and paste until iPhone 5, or whatever. That was that, this was that for us, it was like, no mobile. You looked at it on mobile, it was terrible.\n\n(00:31:13):\nBut there was stuff like that, so we had to just... And then, we're a small team and so, we were completely unprepared for just the growing traffic. And there was a whole bunch, I mean, the list of problems that were happening every single day was nuts. I mean, to start, we had never had a plan on stackblitz.com for more than $9.00. We had one price, nine bucks. And so when we launched Bolt we were like, \"Again, we don't think, hopefully people like this, but nine bucks doesn't get you a lot of inference.\" And so people burn through nine bucks in 48 hours. And they're like, \"I want to buy more. How do I buy more? Why won't you take my money?\"\n\n(00:31:56):\nSo it was like, within the week we rolled out just completely new pricing plans, where you could upgrade, which ended up, has kind of now become the standard. All the other guys in the space have copied this. Where prior to Bolt going online, Copilot, all these previous AI things, everyone wanted this Netflix model where there's one price, it's like all you can eat, or whatever. And the problem is, if you do that, you want the inference cost to be kind of low, because you're expecting people to use it a lot. And so you can't do these agentic experience things, it would be too expensive.\n\n(00:32:29):\nAnd what we ended up stumbling into is that, \"Okay, actually, people are willing to pay more. People want to pay for more inference, because we've crossed this threshold where you can get a very tangible ROI.\" You know that this is providing a tremendous amount of value to you. So anyways, that was one thing, and the servers were just melting. Anthropic ran out of GPUs for us. Dario emailed me, he was like, \"Listen, we don't have anything more to give you.\" At the times, where we're like, \"How do we deal with...\" It was just bananas, for weeks. It felt like in 300, when they're surrounded by 10,000 people, and our team is just doing everything. There's 15, 20 people, just doing everything. My chief of staff and I were doing customer support 95% of the day. Anyways.\n\n(00:33:22):\nSo yeah, it was a crazy wild time. I mean, it still is. We've had a little bit more time to grow into this. And usually, I mean as a company, to grow into even 20 million ARR, you get a year at least or something, to kind of staff up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:39):\nOften, decades.\n\nEric Simons (00:33:40):\nYeah. So that was as hard, we'd go to people and kind of be like, \"What do we do?\" And the playbooks we get back are, take six months, or a year, or something. It's like, \"This isn't going to work.\" Which is funny, this is what it's all about. I mean this is, at least for me, that level of intensity, it's challenging. Fun challenges, you know?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:08):\nWow, okay. This is just nonstop wild, wild shit. So you mentioned that your team was about 20 people through all of this, you guys are growing at this insane rate, 20 people. How was this possible? What has allowed you to grow this much, this fast, with such a small team? And this 300 visual is interesting, I imagine having these Spartans is a big part of it. Just what has allowed you to do this?\n\nEric Simons (00:34:40):\nYeah, I think a lot of it again, I mean if you kind of look at where a lot of the other folks, like the Cogen types of app space, have really been struggling, a lot of it has been scaling their servers with stuff. And it was kind of like both this overnight success, seven years in the making. All of this stuff, there's no way, if you rewind to year two, there's no way we could have, we would not be at the growth on DAUs, and revenue, or whatever. There's just no way. And so a lot of it is the technology we made, and most importantly, it's been the people.\n\n(00:35:19):\nThe people... It's rare to find startups where you have the core group of five, six, seven people, that have been there for five years, plus. That's a pretty rare thing to see in Silicon Valley. It is usually, folks are at a startup for a year or two, they kind of go to another one. You know what I mean? And the problem with the turnover like that is that you can't take really long bets like the one we did. And so we've had, kind of from the get-go, again, this comes back from bootstrapping the previous company. Just having less people, and more context per head. That's just been how we do it, and we feel very strongly about it.\n\n(00:36:00):\nAnd the reason for that is, one, that you can have high levels of trust with anyone you're talking to, because you know that they have a lot of context. It's not like this person's completely in the dark, in some corner of the company that doesn't... You know what I mean? The second thing, everyone has agency to actually get stuff done, front to back. And there's no political community to get stuff approved by, there's no... So when you look at what happened with Bolt, I mean, we had engineers that were, front to back, were on a call with someone running into an issue, going and fixing it. Cooking up the UI on the spot, and landing this thing. Without involving anyone else on the team.\n\n(00:36:41):\nSo I think it was the culmination of just high trust, and people, we all just have enjoyed working together in the past. Maybe that's why, that's the only reason that anyone would ever stay at a company for that long, or whatever. And so those sorts of stressful situations, I think, are make or break. Those are make or break for any team. And so, I think that what's happened is really, it is a direct reflection of the strength and the bonds of the people that are making this thing, and supporting the thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:22):\nYeah, I think that's such an important point, that you guys have been working together for many years. Most people won't have that benefit. When you're hiring people, when you hire this initial team, is there anything you look for that you think maybe people aren't looking for enough? Anything you prioritize when you're hiring new folks? Is it this idea that they can do a lot? They can do customer calls, they can do design, they can do engineering?\n\nEric Simons (00:37:42):\nYeah, for us, and even if the folks were hiring us, hiring people that don't care about the titles, and they don't care about... It's not like they're... People, of course it's people have a career trajectory, and that sort of thing, but they really are motivated by just working on cool things, and are chucking their ego at the door. And they're there to collectively build something great, not just kind of follow, and be the brilliant jerk. Most of the people that we've hired have been in Europe. We're a fully remote company. My co-founder and I are in the Bay Area. It's funny, back in 2018, we rented an office and stuff, and we were commuting into it. Because we thought we'd hire people here, and like a year into it we were like, \"What are we doing? You and I are coming to an office for 10 people, we've hired, the people working for us are in Europe, or across the US.\" And we have one or two other people we've hired that are in the Bay Area at this point.\n\n(00:38:51):\nBut yeah, I think we kind of look for folks that are intrinsically just trying to build great stuff, and are interested. And then the first people that we hired, the reason that we found them is that they were users of StackBlitz. A lot of people, the majority of people we've hired at the company have been people that actually came from our community, basically. So when we want to hire people, we put out a tweet and say, \"Hey, we're hiring an engineer,\" and then we get DMs or whatever.\n\n(00:39:22):\nBut yeah, those are the general kind of qualities we look for, though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:28):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:39:35):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:39:53):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks, and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:15):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap, and instead use something like OneSchema. And not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:40:26):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages, from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:46):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers, and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:41:01):\nI want to ask a couple more questions about Bolt, and then I want to zoom out, and talk about where things are heading in the future. Let's talk about prioritization. I imagine you guys are just barraged with, as you described, after you launched, you're just barraged with requests. Like you said, there's a million monthly active users. I can't even imagine the feature requests you guys are getting, plus all the stuff you know want to build. Just how do you go about deciding what to prioritize, and what to actually build?\n\nEric Simons (00:41:28):\nThere's a lot of things that you just don't even know are possible to do, and so, people aren't going to be necessarily explicitly asking for them. And so there's been kind of a couple of these, where we use our gut instinct on like, \"Hey, no one's asking for this, in meaningful numbers at least. But we think this is going to be a big deal.\"\n\n(00:41:47):\nBest example was last week with native mobile app support. That's, by reception, the biggest thing we've ever launched. And it was something that, even internally at the company, some folks were like, \"This, I don't know. People are yelling about these other things.\" And it is, it's always this balance of how much are we just triaging various things, versus that new capabilities, but it was like, \"This strikes me as an important one,\" where we put some chips into the middle of the table on. And had it dead right. It's just this mind-blowing experience, and now, there's just thousands of mobile apps being created a day, that weren't before. And how does that change things? I mean, now there's small businesses that, they would've never made an iPhone app before. It made no sense. It's super expensive. Now, that's not the case.\n\n(00:42:43):\nSo there's kind of these things where it's like, \"Hey, we should go and take bets here.\" But there's kind of this, I think the best analogy would be like, it's kind of like working at a restaurant, being like a chef. There's some amount of, there's feedback from the customers of, \"This thing didn't taste good.\" And then there's like, \"Hey, we've been cooking something interesting, and this tastes... I don't know. This, I think you're going to like this. I think this is a killer dish.\" And so you kind of have to balance those things.\n\n(00:43:15):\nAnd I think it's actually, largely, a function of just years of experience doing it. I think if you kind of rewound 10 years ago, I would have had really no, I wouldn't have had just the years of getting my butt kicked by the free market, to have cultivated a sense of this stuff. You kind of have to build your own gun and stick for it, I guess is the best way of putting it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:39):\nTo unpack this a little bit further, do you have a cadence you guys work through to decide what to build, and ship? Do you have a weekly meeting every week? Because I know the answer is probably, really, \"It's just chaos constantly, and fires we're putting out constantly.\" I know that's a lot of it, but is there some kind of process that you guys have for deciding what to build, and how to share it, and just work with the team?\n\nEric Simons (00:44:02):\nWe all meet every day. Pretty much the entire team gets on a call, and we just kind of front to back-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:07):\nYou meet, like a Zoom?\n\nEric Simons (00:44:08):\nYeah, every day at 8:00 AM Pacific, we're on a Zoom for at least an hour-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:12):\nEvery day? The whole company?\n\nEric Simons (00:44:13):\nPretty much the entire company. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:14):\nWow. For an hour. Okay.\n\nEric Simons (00:44:16):\nYeah. And we just go over everything and I think we're going to probably start, as the team's kind of growing, we're going to start splintering off into different syncs, or whatever. But the thing about just having everyone in the same room every day is that, a lot of people will complain that it's... On Twitter, you'll see people say, \"Oh, it's the most expensive use of everyone's time,\" but it's like, \"Yep. But there's 0% fidelity loss in that. Everything, every day, is being audited front to back, and being discussed front to back.\"\n\n(00:44:47):\nSo when you're in these times of just extreme growth, you want as close to 0% loss, on communications. And so that's how we've been doing it, especially since Bolt went online, and I think it was the week after Bolt went online we were like, \"Every day, until we're through this or whatever, we're all getting on a phone call every day, and we're front to back doing this.\" And again, another reason why more context and less heads, every person at the company is aware of everything else going on at the company. So people can independently be making decisions that are generally, by default, more often correct than not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:33):\nThat is so interesting. I've never heard that before. Especially for company growing, that is like yours. That is super interesting, that that's what you do.\n\nEric Simons (00:45:42):\nI don't think we're going to do that forever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:44):\nYeah, yeah. Of course.\n\nEric Simons (00:45:45):\nBut, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:47):\nNo, but I think that's a really cool thing to note, that that works. And has worked for you. Where do you, so say you talk about stuff, then where do you put stuff? Where do you put your roadmap? Where do you plan? Just, what tools are kind of in the stack of the company's toolset?\n\nEric Simons (00:46:01):\nYeah, on the engineering side, we use Linear heavily. On kind of product roadmapping, we're using Notion, and kind of making PRD type stuff in Notion. And we use Figma for design. No, actually, we use Bolt for a lot of design and prototyping at this point, as you can imagine. But yeah, I think that the tooling is nothing crazy. There's nothing crazy sophisticated. I think we'll be investing a lot more, and especially as you start splintering people out of being on the same call every day, so that's where this stuff really starts to matter. Because you don't have a time where you're able to dynamically catch things that weren't going to be brought up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:45):\nI love that you guys use PRDs. I love that you even used that term. There's a lot of talk of just like, \"Oh, we got Bolt now we got all these tools, we don't need PRDs. We're just going to create a prototype immediately, and that's it.\" Talk about just why you still find that useful, and just what you put into your PRD, whatever that is for you.\n\nEric Simons (00:47:01):\nUnless there's something that's very sophisticated that we're working on, we tend to keep them pretty light. I like to just have the minimal amount of context possible, that just ensures everyone's on the same page and that the key outcomes for whatever feature that we're working on, are going to be present when we get there. Because the things that, when these arguments get really beefy, you're looking at it at, \"God, there's so much stuff to decipher.\" The problem is, a lot of people are going to gloss over it when it gets kicked to development, or design, or whatever. It's just going to start snowballing into a lot of stuff. It's just better to keep it as simple as you possibly can. At least, that's our approach to the thing. And often it's some of these things are like, \"Here's a link to a Bolt.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:46):\n\"And here's what it might look like.\"\n\nEric Simons (00:47:51):\nYeah. And not just look like, \"Here's kind of a working demo of what it will effectively feel like.\" And then, be. Because that just, if a picture is worth a thousand words, a live actual demo is worth millions. You can feel it. It's real. And that's what we're seeing, a lot of the businesses that are adopting Bolt now, that's the use case that they're using this for. Is high fidelity prototyping, because it's now faster to make real prototypes using Bolt. Before, it was too expensive. The idea of, \"And let's prototype it, the engineers' code a proto...\" It's like, that, it would take forever. It would be expensive. And now it's faster to do this with Bolt, in code, and have a real working software product, than dragging around frames and Figma to actually make a static version of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):\nSo let's actually talk about that. Just how far have companies gotten with Bolt? Prototypes is where everyone's kind of imagining these tools are at. I know that the goal isn't just to make prototypes, it's to build full scale. I imagine, long-term, Salesforce, Atlassian style companies, at scale. What are some examples of products people have built with Bolt that maybe would surprise people, in just how far they've gotten?\n\nEric Simons (00:49:08):\nYeah, I mean, especially... When you're starting greenfield stuff, you can use Bolt to build... you know. Like Salesforce, as an example. One of the first people that signed up for Bolt was this guy named Paul, and he's an entrepreneur, and doesn't know how to code. Built a CRM in three weeks, that has AI built into it and Stripe for billing, et cetera. He had gotten a quote from an agency for this, it was going to be 30 grand, and take six months. He had done in three weeks, and I think he spent 300 bucks on Bolt for the thing. So it's like, this is... And he's making money off of this. This is his start. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:45):\nOkay, so he built this, and he's selling it. People are paying to use it.\n\nEric Simons (00:49:48):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:48):\nWow.\n\nEric Simons (00:49:50):\nAnd there's many such cases of this. If you're looking at greenfield projects, 100%. Today with this current state of frontier models, you could absolutely build production grade software. You're not going to get a zero shot, but you're going to spend a couple of days, weeks, whatever. But the cost reduction there, 30 grand versus $300. It's 99% cheaper. Six months versus three weeks. I mean, it's like order of magnitude sort of fashioned delivery on the thing. And those numbers have helped, for the people that we talk to, that are building these full stack apps. People, they go to Upwork, work, they get a quote for five grand. They have it within 50 bucks. It's just nuts, what you're able to do with this thing.\n\n(00:50:35):\nAnd so I think on the flip side, a lot of the existing companies, there are very legitimate use cases where things are greenfield, spun up. A good example is public websites. Marketing pages, landing pages, whatever have you. Folks are adopting Bolt to just power those instead of using Webflow, for example. Because it's like, this is simpler to use than Webflow. And it integrates with the existing design system of the company, and et cetera. And the marketers can update it without knowing how to code, whatever. But then for product development teams, this is most commonly for, again, existing software businesses. They're using this to just accelerate the product development process, and in a way where it's not just like a Greenfield wholesale, \"Hey, we're building the entire thing in Bolt,\" or whatever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nCan Bolt integrate with your existing code base, or not yet?\n\nEric Simons (00:51:23):\nSo yeah, we can actually open up repos in Bolt. You can go and use Bolt on your code base. It kind of depends on your setup. And we do have companies, again, that have marketing sites they're using this on, or their admin panel or whatever. And I think it's going to be a use case that we see a lot more people orienting towards. These LLMs are not great, depending on how big your application is, though. These things are not quite there, where if you have something that's a thousand files or something, or more, where you're going to be able to have a really reliable, super reliable experience per se. Within a year, we'll chat a year from now, I suspect the answer is going to be different. So it kind of depends on the size of the app, the scale of the app, and if it's too big, you're looking at the prototyping, just pure acceleration of product development. And if it's not, then you can just do it entirely from Bolt.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:24):\nSo this is useful. So what would you say are the major limitations of Bolt today, where people should just know, \"Okay, it's not going to get you here yet. Maybe in the future it will.\" So it sounds like, if you have a really large existing code base, probably not the best tool yet. What else should people know?\n\nEric Simons (00:52:39):\nI would say that's probably the main one, because I think if you have a large existing code base, you're going to need something like Cursor. And you're going to need to be a developer, meaningfully, to be editing that stuff. I think outside of that, there's a, just like using any other productivity tool, like Photoshop or Figma, or like a DSLR or whatever. There's some level of education, and using the tool, and learning how to use it, that's required to really unlock a lot of the maximum capabilities of the thing.\n\n(00:53:10):\nAnd the people that we see that are most successful with Bolt, outside of developers, the people we see that are most successful are people that are amazing PMs, for example. Because these are people that understand enough about how the technology works, typically, and their job is to direct developers on how to go and improve the product. And go and look into how to actually spec this thing out in a way that's executable, without lossiness in the communication. And when you think about, \"Okay, how would you best interact with an AI developer agent?\" It's basically that. You really want to be good at defining scope, and helping it go and debug various things, or whatever have you. There's a huge overlap of the skill set of being a rock star PM, and being really good at using, frankly, any of these text to apps or Cogen tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nI love that you made that point. That's exactly the point I've been trying to make, I have a newsletter post about this. Because when all these tools came out, there was so many people saying, \"Okay, PMs are dead. We don't need them anymore. We can just build things so quickly and easily, what's the point?\" But I completely see the world the way you see it. The hard part now is, now it's easy to build the thing. Now it's, \"What the hell should we build? Can we clearly articulate what it is we want to build?\" And then, \"Can we just have the taste to know, is this right, is this correct? Is this good? Is this going to solve the problem?\" And then it's like, grow it, which is something also PMs think about. So, I completely agree. Basically it feels like PMs are, and a lot of PMs listen to this, so they'll love hearing this. To me, it feels like PMs are the best positioned role to thrive in this world.\n\nEric Simons (00:54:54):\nZero question. I mean that was, as Bolt was growing and we were like... Because we were a developer product before this, and so we expected the audience to be 100% developers that were using this. And we just kept seeing more and more and more people that were not developers using it, to the point where it's like, 67% of our users are not developers, at this point. And when I started talking to these folks, at first I was just weird, or whatever. It was like, \"Well, what's going on here?\" But then it just kind of clicked as like, \"Oh, well, this is going to change everything. The entire software world order is going to get rewritten, here.\"\n\n(00:55:30):\nBecause the way that companies are organized to build software today, totally going to change. The idea that again, PMs are the people that really understand, to the pixel level, what matters into making a great product experience. And often they're having... And listen, I'm a developer, myself. They have to go and harangue the developers to get things to be how they really ought to be, to the smallest levels. And now, how this is going to work, if you fast-forward one, two, five years, whatever. PMs, they're going to be \"writing code\", quote, unquote, instead of just writing a JIRA ticket and waiting for a developer to do it. The developers are going to be able to work on intellectually challenging tasks that LLMs are not well suited for, and still being augmented by LLMs to do it. But PMs are going to be able to go in and just make the changes themselves.\n\n(00:56:24):\nAnd what blew my mind is, it's not priced in, to any of these companies out there. And it's not reflected in the org charts of all the software companies in the world right now. That is going to completely change. The winners, at least, their org charts are going to completely change, and how they approach building products and shipping products. Completely. And it's starting, this is the beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):\nI want to follow that thread, but first of all, I want to also add, and correct me if you disagree with this. I think when we talk about PMs, that also applies to founders, like product thinking founders-\n\nEric Simons (00:56:58):\nOne hundred percent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:59):\n... very similar. And then, I think it's also important to note, if you also have engineering skills and design skills, you will be at an advantage. That only helps you. But if you're looking at this triangle of the triad of product, engineering, PM, it feels like the PME skills are the ones that will be most important and valuable. Although it'd be great if you can also be in code, and if you could also design really well.\n\nEric Simons (00:57:23):\nAbsolutely. And to me, it's the most exciting mix. I think PMs, designers and entrepreneurs that are non-technical, that's the most exciting thing to me, just because it's a brand new market that's being unlocked here. For the first time ever, these folks can directly code and build the product, themselves. Their vision, directly into the software itself. That's going to change everything. That is changing everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:48):\nSo when you talk about how org charts are going to change, what are you imagining there? Is it just fewer engineers, mostly, or what do the future org charts look like?\n\nEric Simons (00:57:57):\nGood question. And I bet you there's going to be some Gartner analysis someday, years from now or whatever that's like, \"Here's how the best,\" some term is applied to how the best companies are organizing. But yeah, I think that we're going to see developers probably being pulled off of a lot of the, generally speaking, pulled off of a lot of user interface type work. I would imagine. Except for the most complicated of those things. And you're going to see designers and PMs really, really leading the charge, and being responsible for crafting those experiences. And perhaps having a developer attached to be reviewing the code and making sure the guiding, the code that they're writing, reviewing those pull requests and et cetera. And I think maybe even the engineers are... Like you pointed out, having engineering skills is not going to hurt you. It's going to make you way more effective.\n\n(00:58:58):\nBut I do think there's going to be, the leverage that the front engineer is going to have is, it is now insane, it's only going to get more so. And so I could see there just being fewer front engineers attached to, I'm seeing more product and design folks, with one or two engineers or something. And really having a larger matching of pods like that. Something like that strikes me as probably how this is going to start trending towards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:34):\nThis touches on, we had a researcher from OpenAI in the podcast. She actually started her career, she worked at Anthropic first, as a front-end engineer. And said that once she saw what Clyde could do, for front-end engineering, she's like, \"I need to move to a different function.\" And so she moved into research, because she saw that role disappearing, potentially. And that's exactly what you're saying.\n\nEric Simons (00:59:57):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:57):\nSo let me ask you this, I don't know if you have a clear thesis on this yet, but say, you just had a kid. Say your kid is, in the future, starting school. Let's say your kid was starting college soon. Do you have thoughts on just what skills slash areas you think they should go into, versus avoid, that maybe are popular now and are going to be less popular?\n\nEric Simons (01:00:19):\nUnderstanding how to leverage these AI tools is key. I wouldn't necessarily, I think maybe getting a basic understanding of how programming works, et cetera, is great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:31):\nIt's like technical foundations, just understanding how systems work, how coding works.\n\nEric Simons (01:00:41):\nExactly. But it doesn't have to be, because I think back to if Bolt existed, like Albert and I say this to each other all the time. Since the get-go, StackBlitz, we've been building the thing that we wish we had when we were 13. And heck, for everything we built since then. And especially with Bolt. I mean, I don't know if I would've gone as deep as I did on learning how to code, and being an engineer, if that had been around then. The whole reason we got into it is we had ideas for products, and businesses, that we wanted to build. And coding was just a necessary requirement in order to do that.\n\n(01:01:21):\nAnd that said, I think people need to follow their intrinsic interests. If folks are really interested in really getting in the nitty-gritty of how computers work, and program leaders, or spark and compilers, or whatever, go for it. I think that stuff is still going to be relevant. I don't know if we're going to really have, we'll see, but to the degree that there's AGI where it's like, we don't have to think about anything ever again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:47):\nYeah, that's always the answer here. Do we sell anything?\n\nEric Simons (01:01:50):\nYeah, it's like if we're at that point, it's kind of... I don't know, I'm not sure. But I think from, at least what I feel like seems like the next at least five years of what we're looking at, I think people are still going to, there's still going to be places to specialize, and really go deep. But I think you want to go into it with the idea, not like, \"I'm going to go and learn computer science because I'm going to get a job for sure out of it.\"\n\n(01:02:18):\nI just think that's generally not a good... This is like, my co-founder and I, we didn't go to college. My co-founder dropped out of college after a semester or something, but I didn't go, because I was like, \"We're coding,\" we were doing contracting at the time, making money. And it was like, \"This is a lot of,\" you know, it would've been like a hundred grand of debt by the end of the thing, just for four years of in-state tuition, at U of I. 120 grand, I think, at that time.\n\n(01:02:49):\nAnd lo and behold, I mean there's a huge issue with this. Where people are kind of... There was a prevailing thought by society that going to college in the early 2010s or late two 2000s, that you're going to get a job on the other side. That's going to be high paying. And that just has not been the case for a lot of people. And I think that's just going to continue to be the case. But again, not to deter people from doing it, but you have to go into it being like, \"I for sure, this is what I want, and I want to go and be the best that I can possibly be at this thing.\" You know what I mean?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:30):\nI like the transfer to your kid is going to be like, \"Don't even go to college,\" potentially.\n\nEric Simons (01:03:35):\nOnly if they want to. I think at 18, it's a huge ask. I mean, it's a huge ask, not even at 18. It's like at 17, because you could go apply for colleges. It's just such a huge... Like, a six figure debt commitment to someone who's making $0, or negative dollars, and that young. Unless you really have conviction, it costs nothing to go and explore and learn for free, online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):\nI want to come back to the skills that you think are going to be most important, and let me try to mirror back a few things you said, that I very much agree with.\n\n(01:04:11):\nSo it feels like if you want to be successful in the world where AI can build things for you, more and more, what I'm hearing is get good at figuring out what people need and want, what problems they need solved. Get good at articulating it really well to the AI tools. And there's this talk, \"You don't need to be a great prompt engineer. You don't need to work on prompting,\" but it feels like it's more and more important, because you tell it something and it goes off and builds a thing. If you're clear about it, it'll save you a lot of time.\n\n(01:04:42):\nSo it's be good at figuring out problems people need solved, figure out how to articulate that problem well, and ask for a clear solution. Figure out how to grow the thing, feels like that's still going to be a need, because Bolt's not going to go and find every... I could see that still running paid ads, and stuff like that. But it feels like that's going to be ongoing need.\n\n(01:05:03):\nAnd then I feel like there's this kind of unstuck step, like helping AI get unstuck, and it feels like that's where maybe engineering skills will come in more and more. Thoughts on just that skill?\n\nEric Simons (01:05:13):\nOh, totally. Yeah. So we actually, two weeks ago I think, we announced this program called Bolt Builders. And it's basically the genius bar at the Apple Store, where as folks are building on Bolt that are not developers, they'll run into some nook or cranny where the AI just cannot figure it out, or whatever. And I think that's just going to continue to be the case for the time to come. That's our position, and that's why we spun up this program.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:38):\nAnd these are humans, that help you out.\n\nEric Simons (01:05:41):\nThese are humans. And people that we're certifying. And so, in Bolt in the coming weeks or whatever, there's going to be a button where you can just say, \"Hey, connect me with a certified expert.\" And you can chat with them live, and they'll help you get unstuck, and you pay I don't know, 50 bucks an hour. Whatever it is. And then you get unjammed and you keep prompting. And again, I just think this stuff is, it just all seems like gravy to me. Engineers get to focus on difficult challenges, not like cookie cutter, \"Let's make another CRUD app,\" stuff. They get to, debugging is challenging, and fun. And going and working on intellectually stimulating tasks, and all this stuff that's just copy pasta, over and over, all this, error app. It's just like, let the AI do all that kind of crap.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nThis is a potentially new job, for now at least, just unstuck the AI. Which I think over time, it'll get better and better, and we maybe won't need these people. But I love that it's now AI first, and person second. Versus person building the thing, and then AI. Like when Copilot launched, it was just like, \"Cool, here's a little suggestion for this function,\" and now it's flipped. \"Here's everything.\" And then, \"Oh, I don't know what to do here. Help us here.\" And then, it's like a human suggestion. Isn't that interesting? It's like, human Copilot is flipping it.\n\nEric Simons (01:06:58):\nTotally. Yeah. That's what's wild is, I think Sonnet was really the first model that flipped the equation, because that was really us, and old Cursor, and all these other things. The rapid growth started the second Sonnet went online. We actually tried building Bolt almost exactly a year ago, with the frontier models at the time. Spent a week or two building it. It just didn't work. The output, the code output was not reliable enough. It would constantly, it would be a broken app, or it would look ugly, or whatever. And then we got a sneak peek of the Sonnet stuff in May and we were like, \"Oh. Okay, we should take that project back off the shelf and green line it, because this might be it.\"\n\n(01:07:36):\nAnd lo and behold, that's exactly what has happened. But yeah, that's the big deal that is, kind of under the hood, this is... What's going on here is, a very critical threshold has been passed with LLM's ability to write production grade code and apps that actually look beautiful, and actually function well. It's not perfect, but there's kind of this zero to one moment that's happened where it's like, \"Okay, so now, yeah. Now the AI is the first thing,\" and then you're kind of popping a developer in every now and then, versus the other way around.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:11):\nI did not know that. I didn't realize that so much of this was unlocked with, like it's sitting on top of Anthropix work, and specifically Sonnet. That was the first model, you're saying, that could code well enough.\n\nEric Simons (01:08:22):\nYeah, zero question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:24):\nWow.\n\nEric Simons (01:08:25):\nZero question. Absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:25):\nThat is fascinating. Just the amount of, I don't know, revenue and business and ecommerce that that one model has unlocked, is insane. I did not realize that.\n\nEric Simons (01:08:39):\nIt is. And in retrospect, I'd mentioned, we'd never done an AI product at StackBlitz, and it's tempting. Like when of ChatGPT went online, everyone started adding AI to their products. We just didn't see a clear place for a really added value. So I was not super bullish on, you know, a lot of people were like, \"AGI is going to be here in 2023.\" You know what I mean? There's all this stuff that was being said, and I was like, \"I just don't know if I necessarily buy how fast people say that it's going to move.\" And to a certain degree, that was the correct view.\n\n(01:09:13):\nWhat I didn't really think about though, is if AI, if LLMs are going to get better at a specific vertical, which are going to be the things that it would be. And if you look at law, for example, you want to make the best LLM for looking at case law. The problem with that stuff is, it's not deterministic. The judge's ruling is dependent on society's view of things at the time, political stuff going on, the jury. There's a ton of things, that it's not deterministic. And so you can't really create a lot of training data that's going to be super reliable, and produce really good results. And you can't just make up cases and say, \"Theoretically, the judge would say this.\" Because, I mean, it just doesn't work.\n\n(01:09:57):\nSoftware is deterministic. When you write code and you hit run, it either runs or it doesn't. And that's the key insight Anthropic really had. They just went deep. And then, this is what they're doing, is just reinforcement learning on basically permutating every type of app you could ever build, and just spinning up tens of thousands of cores or whatever to do that. Just building tons of training data, and doing reinforcement learning, and making their LLMs the best in the world at building beautiful, reliable applications. I'm extremely bullish. It makes technical sense why, of anything, LLMs are going to get insanely better at writing code than probably most other types of applications for LLMs. Simply because it's something that can be extremely deterministic, and permutated thousands and thousands and thousands of times per second.\n\n(01:10:54):\nAnd so I think the broader trend here is... And Sonnet has woken everyone up. Google, and Open AI, all the... Everyone is now gunning for coding because, how big is the market opportunity to rewrite the software world order? It's trillions of dollars, or something, right? The world runs on software. So I think that just in a macro, the highest macro view, and why we went and raised money for Bolt. This seems like an extremely clear shot, there's this, you can kind of separate the hype of what people say and blah, blah, blah. When you break it down technically, this makes sense. It makes sense what's going to happen here. And for us, we're like, we are so happy to be well positioned to go and enable people to kind of ride this wave of the innovation that is here in LLMs, and is going to just keep coming, and therefore enable more people to build even crazier amazing software. So that's our world view, at least, of what's going on here at the macro.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nAnd when did Sonnet even come out? It's been a while, right?\n\nEric Simons (01:12:08):\nI think they officially, I think it was in June, when they officially put it online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:12):\nSo since June, this is the worst it will ever be, the state of AI coding. And it's already this good. And there hasn't been anything, like they haven't launched their new model, since last June. So this tells us just how quickly things are going to start moving once they launch their next model. And as you said, everyone's gunning now for this, because they realized \"We're behind on the coding piece.\" So, wow. This is going to get crazy.\n\nEric Simons (01:12:40):\nI agree. Yeah, it's been, again, there was no blog post that laid all of this out for us. It's just been kind of this-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nYou just noticed the code was really good, basically.\n\nEric Simons (01:12:50):\nAnd from there, it's just, we've been piecing together all this other stuff. So it's been kind of the thrill of a murder mystery of, \"What is going on here?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:59):\nOh, really.\n\nEric Simons (01:13:00):\nYeah. You know what I mean?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\nJust piecing together what you've seen on Anthropic releasing, is that what you mean? What have you been noticing, murder mystery-wise?\n\nEric Simons (01:13:06):\nWell, and then the impacts of Bolt, where we have people that are not technical using this. How are they using it? Why are they doing this? And then, all the stuff we've talked about in this podcast has been the result of nine months of just R&D and seeing the results of it, and then going, \"What?\" And then digging in, doing another thing and then going, \"What,\" again. And then it just keeps happening, because there's no charted course for this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:31):\nIt's like an anthropology, if that's the right term, of just watching. It's like an emergent discovery, it sounds like. Versus you had the strategy, \"Here, we're going to do this,\" where a persona to launch this thing will happen?\n\nEric Simons (01:13:42):\nYeah, a hundred percent. Yeah. I think that that's the best way to put it. It's the best way to put it. It's exactly that. And so it's very interesting to just-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:54):\nTo watch, and be a part of it, I imagine.\n\nEric Simons (01:13:56):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:57):\nAnd I think as people say, \"Okay, these are just toys, they're prototypes, it's not going to work with your existing code, it's not going to scale.\" It's important to note just what we talked about. This is a model from last June that this is possible on, and everybody's working on the next cutting edge model that will make this even better, and that's going to come real soon. Okay. Amazing.\n\n(01:14:20):\nI just have a few more questions to close out this conversation. One is just, what is coming next for Bolt? What are some of the cool new features that'll be launching before this comes out? Maybe right after this comes out, maybe in mid-March?\n\nEric Simons (01:14:33):\nYeah. Okay. So by the time, and I'm going to go back and tell our engineers, \"I said this on this podcast-\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\n\"I've committed. Sorry, guys.\"\n\nEric Simons (01:14:40):\nThis is, I found actually being a leaky faucet on talking on podcasts and stuff, my engineer is like, \"How could you tell them...\" \"You just have to ship it faster, now. You got to make it real,\" right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):\nOr we'll get AI on it.\n\nEric Simons (01:14:52):\nNo, no. Yeah. But I think for us it's like, again, we've seen a lot of PMs, designers, entrepreneurs, et cetera, using Bolt. And so, we're really looking at better fitting with the tools that folks are using to do those things today. Bolt's not going to replace them, or something. And if you're working at a company, how do you integrate this stuff with your existing business, or your existing product and code base? Because that's the question we often get from people is, \"How do I open my,\" like we're talking to one of the fan companies the other day, and like, \"How do we open our production code base in this, that's like 20 years old?\" I'm like, \"You don't. None of this stuff. That's not what you do. This is for rapid product development in your use case.\"\n\n(01:15:41):\nSo the features that we're going to be shipping, I'm pretty stoked about this one, so we've been working on this for a while and we've partnered up with a company called Anima to do this. But basically, so on any Figma URL, when you're looking at a design that you've made, if you just put bolt.new in front of that URL and hit enter, it's going to suck that design into Bolt, and turn it into a full stack app or mobile app, just out of the box.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:08):\nThat is genius.\n\nEric Simons (01:16:09):\nYeah. It's-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:09):\nAmazing.\n\nEric Simons (01:16:10):\nIt's going to be nuts. Yeah, I mean, it's really fun to use. Because whether you're a developer or designer, or whatever, going and taking that and turning it into an actual coded app. And the thing is, once it's in Bolt, you can just keep prompting from there. You're like, \"Yeah, well, add another page here.\" So you can have things that, where you want pixel perfect design, you can have it, and it'll translate one to one. And it's splitting out the assets. Anima's been doing this since 2017, Figma to code. They've got the best agent in the world for, they're the number one Figma plug-in, or whatever. And so in Bolt, it's going to just work. It's just deeply integrated\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):\nSo it's bolt.new slash, the Figma URL, to the design.\n\nEric Simons (01:16:56):\nYep. That's all you got to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:56):\nAmazing.\n\nEric Simons (01:16:57):\nAnd in Bolt, we're going to also have a little Figma icon in the chat thing. So if you go to Bolt itself, you can click it and then paste the URL, or whatever. But yeah, but it's like that. It's from Figma to full stack app in a click. Literally. That's crazy. So that one's pretty cool.\n\n(01:17:15):\nAnd then the other one that we're working on is an integration with Slack, because often when you're talking about Figmas, like Figma links or whatever, at a company, you're in Slack or whatever. So you're having conversations about, \"Hey, we should really add a page to this that does da-da-da.\" And so we're actually creating a Bolt Slack bot whose job is to basically act like a developer on your team. And so you can be, in a thread, you can be like, \"Hey, I think we should a homepage.\" \"Yeah, okay. @Bolt, can you whip this up real quick?\" And it'll go and just suck down the entire conversation history so far in your Slack, on the thread or whatever.\n\n(01:17:54):\nYou'll be like, \"Okay, cool. So you kind of want me to take this Figma URL, which I can convert automatically,\" thanks to the future I just mentioned right before this. \"I can just go and convert that thing out of the box, and then you want me to add a page to it, and then do this thing. Got it. I'm going to go do that. Oh, here's the URL where you can open it up and keep prompting.\" You know what I mean? So it's like having a developer or somebody to kind of kick this thing out. And you're just like, \"Go make this thing real quick.\"\n\n(01:18:15):\nSo those two things, I think it's, again. You start think about how our company's going to change how they're currently doing product development. And even just like, \"Hey, we need to spin up a marketing site. Here's the thing.\" We're like, \"Can you do that, Bolt?\" \"Yep. Let me go do that.\" You know what I mean? And that's why I'm kind of excited about those two, in particular, because I think it's going to be well received, and folks are going to be stoked about it. I hope. Knock on wood.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:40):\nThose are awesome features. I love the Slack piece, because when I think about agents, there's always talk about agents. To me the simplest way to understand it is just a Slack bot, just that AI can talk to you like they're a person in Slack. And I love that's exactly what you're doing. And this is this gigantic feature of just like, \"Hey, you just have this engineer now that can go build stuff for you.\"\n\n(01:18:59):\nLet me actually ask you a question along these lines, that I was meaning to ask, but I forgot. Is just, your engineering team, what are they using to build Bolt? I imagine it's a lot of Cursor. How much is Bolt, at this point, involved in building Bolt? And is there any other tools that they found useful, find useful, that are worth highlighting?\n\nEric Simons (01:19:18):\nYeah, good question. Yeah, we definitely use Cursor. Our folks use Cursor a lot. We use Bolt a lot for the product development process, like a ton, we're using it. And we're doing basically the flow that I described, where if things that need to be Pixel perfect, we're going to Figma for. And often we're taking that and we're pulling that into Bolt, because we've got access to the integration today. So pull that into Bolt and we're saying, \"Hey, go add these things or whatever.\" Or just saying, \"Hey, here's a screenshot of our UI, go do da-da-da.\"\n\n(01:19:47):\nOther AI tools that the developers are using. I think those are the primary ones. I mean, I think we've got a subscription to Claude, and ChatGPT, and things like that. But I think for development, Cursor is the main thing,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:03):\nYeah, it's cool how few tools, like there's so many AI tools, and it's interesting how few people actually end up using. It's like Cursor, Claude, ChatGPT, and then maybe another tool. Like Bolt.\n\nEric Simons (01:20:13):\nYeah. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:14):\nOkay. Final-ish question. Say somebody is opening up Bolt for the first time. What's something that, imagine you could sit next to every new user that's just trying Bolt for the first time, and you could whisper a tip in their ear to be successful with Bolt. What would that tip be?\n\nEric Simons (01:20:33):\nAnd this is like, because we have a lot of different types of users. I imagine you're talking about PMs or designers, and that sort of-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:39):\nLet's do PMs. That's a good one. That's a lot of the audience here.\n\nEric Simons (01:20:41):\nI would say, talk to this thing like you do a Linear ticket, or a JIRA ticket. That would be my advice. And talk to this like you would, like you're talking to one of the developers on your team. And what that means is, be specific on things that matter. And on things where, also, you can let it be creative. You can go to and just say, \"Hey, make it prettier.\" And it does a good job, it actually does a really good job, when you give it just, vibes. So anyway, I think for PMs it's like, you have the skillset. You know how to do this. This is, just think of this as your coworker, your developer coworker.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:24):\nI love that. Because these tools are so easy, you just go in and it's like tell it a thing, and then, cool. You have a website. It's coded, boom, done. And what I'm hearing here is, take a little time to craft your ask. It may be tempting to just start, \"Cool. Build me a serum,\" and then you're stuck with that first version. And then you're like, \"Oh, well, okay. I didn't mean that.\" So it sounds like your advice is take some time to craft the ask, and be clear about what you want.\n\nEric Simons (01:21:49):\nYeah, totally. Especially if you have a clear vision of what you're trying to build. And something reasonably sophisticated. And what I recommend everyone to do, if it's your first time trying Bolt and you're like, \"What should I have it do, and I don't have an idea\"? Tell it to build you a personal website. There's something like magic. You take your LinkedIn copy, and paste your LinkedIn bio and work experience, just like select text, copy, paste it. \"I need a website, my name is so-and-so, here's my LinkedIn history. My favorite color is blue, and I like dogs.\" And then hit paste, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:49):\n\"Make it prettier.\"\n\nEric Simons (01:22:24):\n[inaudible 01:22:24] actor. Yeah. And then, you know what I mean? And then you can hit deploy. And if you don't have a .com yet, now you can. Right? I mean, now you have a real, personalized service. I think there's kind of a moment around that where it's like, \"Oh, okay, wow. This,\" it's zero shot, zero shot 99.999% of the time. You're getting a beautiful personal website that you didn't have before, that would've taken you an hour, on Wix. If not more. And that gives you the taste of, \"Oh, okay, cool. So if I really take the time to think this through, and make a PRD, and then put that in piece by piece into this thing, the sky's the limit.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:55):\nEric, this has been just insane on so many levels. I have so much to process, I think a lot of listeners do too. Maybe as an actual final question, I saw this story about how when you were starting StackBlitz, or maybe even before StackBlitz, you squatted in the AOL office. Because you had some badge that still worked. Maybe just tell that story.\n\nEric Simons (01:23:18):\nYeah, that was the thing I was most known for. That happened like 2012, and I was 19 years old, so it's been a very long time. I think I'm 33, now or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):\nThe statutes of limitations are expended.\n\nEric Simons (01:23:30):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. But yeah, for a while I was like, \"I have to do something more notable than living at AOL. This can't be what I'm known for.\" But now people are like, \"Oh, wait. You're the StackBlitz guy, and you're the AOL guy?\"\n\n(01:23:43):\nSo when I first came out to Silicon Valley, we got into a, I was building a K12 education startup at the time, and this is back during the days where Y Combinator, they only gave you like 20 grand, and so there was this offshoot of Y Combinator called Imagine K12, it was Jeff Ralston who, I think he was CEO of YC a couple of years back. And then Imagine K12 merged into Y Combinator a couple of years after Rob went through it, but anyways, they had an office space at AOL. At the time, AOL was trying to reinvigorate the company and they were like, \"Hey, we should get young startup blood in here, so let's rent out office space to teenagers,\" basically.\n\n(01:24:24):\nSo I was there, and we ended up running out of money. 20 grand doesn't go very far in the Valley, so three or four months in, we were like, \"Oh God, what do we do?\" And I was going to the AOL office multiple times a week, because we had access cards to get in to get to the investors' offices. And I realized, I was like, \"You know, they have couches here, and they have food. There's ramen that you can microwave, and there's a gym where there's a shower, and even you can do laundry.\" And then, so I was like, \"I don't know, maybe while I figure this out, I'll just live out of here.\" And so that's what I ended up doing for, I think, four or five months. I was living out of this headquarters over on Page Mill in El Camino, in Palo Alto.\n\n(01:25:12):\nAnd then, I got away with it for a while just because the guards, the security guards, they worked 12-hour shifts. And so the guys that, when I was there at night... And I was coding, all day every day, basically. So the guys at night just were like, \"Dang, this guy works really hard.\" And then in the morning they'd be like, \"Wow, this guy is working really hard.\" And I became friends with some of them, and then eventually, I think there were also a whole bunch of Stanford students that I think they put bunks in one of the aisles. It was just started getting out control, so I think they started cracking down. And then one morning, at like 4:00 in the morning, a guard came in and threw me out.\n\n(01:25:52):\nI'm from Chicago. I don't know anyone. At that point I'm like, \"I know no one in the Bay Area.\" So I went to a Starbucks, which was not open. I slept on the table outside of the thing. And I think I hit up one of the other entrepreneurs that was in the program. I was like, \"Do you have a couch? I think I kind of need it, at this point.\" Yeah, the press got wind of it, and it was this worldwide story. But I lived on a dollar a day. That was the crazy thing. My burn rate was a dollar a day, at that time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):\nWhat did you use that dollar for?\n\nEric Simons (01:26:25):\nThis is back when McDonald's had the Dollar Menu. Literally. So it was like, I occasionally would go and get a cheeseburger or whatever. Yeah, it was ultimate scrappiness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:41):\nYou're technically homeless. From homeless, to one of the fastest growing startups in history. Eric, what a journey. This is such an interesting point in time of your life, and of just tech. No matter what happens, I'm sure you'll be extremely successful, but it's such an interesting just point in that journey. And I'm thankful that you made time to share it with us.\n\nEric Simons (01:27:01):\nIt's always good to just have the perspective of, you should start companies to keep the mindset that you're doing it to have fun. So, stoked to see where this goes, one way or the other. It's going to be interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:16):\nEric, final questions. Where can folks find online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on some stuff you shared, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEric Simons (01:27:23):\nYeah, totally. I mean, yeah, so bolt.new is the website, over on Twitter, I'm @ericsimons40 on Twitter, and I think our Twitter account is @boltdotnew, not with a period. It's like, B-O-L-T-D-O-T-N-E-W. And yeah, I'm curious to hear what folks think. I mean, this is, again, we are learning so much from the people that are coming and trying this thing out and giving their feedback. And within the first meeting of it going online, we were not the experts on how use the tool anymore, and it's been that way ever since. And so, I love hearing from folks on what they want to see next, and how this is helping them. And where they run into problems, like where we need to go and fix things. So my email address is Eric@stackblitz.com. That's Eric with a C. So I'd love to hear from anyone, whether it's a DM on Twitter, or an email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):\nAmazing. Eric, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEric Simons (01:28:21):\nAwesome. Thank you so much for having me. This is a blast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:23):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:28:26):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Taking control of your career | Ethan Evans (Amazon)\n\n## Transcript\n\nEthan Evans (00:00:00):\nPeople think invention takes all this time, but you only need two hours once a month. The thing is, once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.\n\n(00:00:09):\nSo you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, \"Let's have Prime shipping.\" Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle, a decades old idea now still getting better. The point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive.\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nToday my guest is Ethan Evans. Ethan is a former vice president at Amazon, executive coach, and course creator focused on helping leaders grow into executives. Ethan spent 15 years at Amazon, helped invent and run Prime Video, the Amazon Appstore, Prime Gaming, and Twitch Commerce, which alone is a billion-dollar business for Amazon. He led global teams of over 800, helped draft one of Amazon's 14 core leadership principles, holds over 70 patents, and currently spends his time executive coaching and running courses to help people advance in their career, build leadership skills, and succeed in senior roles.\n\n(00:01:14):\nIn our conversation, Ethan shares an amazing story of when he failed on an important project for Jeff Bezos and what he learned from that experience. We spent some time on something called The Magic Loop, which is a very simple idea that I guarantee will help you get promoted and advance in your career. We also get into a bunch of other career advice, primarily for senior ICs, any managers. We get into advice for standing out in interviews, plus some of Amazon's most important and impactful leadership principles and much more. I learned a lot from Ethan and I'm excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Ethan Evans after a short word from our sponsors. \n\n(00:01:50):\nLet me tell you about our product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers. \n\n(00:02:20):\nSidebar is a private, highly vetted leadership program, where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. \n\n(00:02:39):\nIf you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth.

I'm super excited to talk about some of the things we have teed up today and to help people.\n\nLenny (00:04:37):\nThe first thing I thought we could chat about is The Magic Loop. So you wrote this guest post from my newsletter sometime earlier this year. It is, I don't know if you know this, but it's currently the sixth most popular post of all time on my newsletter across 300 plus posts. Did you expect this advice to resonate the way that it did, and why do you think it resonated as much as it did?\n\nEthan Evans (00:04:59):\nSo the competitive part of me really wants to analyze spots one to five and figure out, do they have an unfair advantage that they had more time? But I was very hopeful that the advice would resonate that way, because I put a lot of work into simplifying it and making it really easy to understand and follow. So I'm very pleased it has, but I was hopeful it would do so well.\n\nLenny (00:05:24):\nWell, I will say sometimes they keep growing, so this isn't necessarily the terminal point for the post.\n\nEthan Evans (00:05:28):\nThe final position. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:05:30):\nOkay. So for people that haven't read this post, or maybe for folks that have and maybe could use a refresher, let's spend a little time here. Could you just briefly describe this idea of The Magic Loop that you wrote about?\n\nEthan Evans (00:05:40):\nYeah, absolutely. So The Magic Loop is how to grow your career in almost any circumstance, even with a somewhat difficult manager. It does assume that you're working in some environment, normally as an entrepreneur or with a boss. But the basic idea of The Magic Loop is five steps and they're very easy.\n\n(00:06:01):\nThe first one is you have to be doing your current job well. It's not possible to really grow your career if you're not considered at least performing at a solid level. Now, it doesn't mean you have to be the star on the team at this point, but what you can't have is your boss wishing that you were different. Like, \"Ethan's not very good.\" So you have to talk to your manager and find out how you're doing and address any problems. So step one is do your job well.\n\n(00:06:31):\nThen step two is ask your boss how you can help. Speaking as a manager, and I've talked to hundreds of managers, very few people go and ask their manager, \"What can I do to help you? What do you need?\" And so just asking sets you apart, and it begins to build a relationship that we're on the same team, that I'm here as a part of your organization to make you successful, not just myself. \n\n(00:06:53):\nStep three is whatever they say, do it. So you dig a big hole. If you say, \"What could I do to help you?\" And they say, \"Well, we really need someone to take out the tray sheets day,\" and you're like, \"Oh, I didn't mean that. I wanted exciting work. I don't want to do sort of this maintenance work or whatever.\" So do what they ask, help out even if it's not your favorite work. \n\n(00:07:14):\nOnce you've done that though, and maybe you do that a couple times, the fourth step is where the magic comes in. You go back to your manager and say, \"Hey, I'm really enjoying working with you. I'm wondering is there some way I could help you that would also help me reach my goal?\" And whether that goal is to change roles or get a raise or get a promotion, you say, \"My goal is I'd really like to learn this new skill. Is there something you need that would also help me learn this new skill?\" And the reason this works is managers help those who help them. It's just human nature. We all do that.\n\n(00:07:52):\nGenerally, they're very open to meeting you halfway and saying, \"Sure, I need this. We can rearrange it. We can find a way to meet your goals over time.\" Now for step four to work, you do have to know what is your goal, so you have to be clear on what it is you want. Well, that part's up to you. \n\n(00:08:15):\nAnd then step five is the easiest step of all. It's just repeat. So like lather, rinse, repeat with your shampoo. Step five is once you're working with your manager towards your goal and discussing where you're going, and you're helping each other, the magic of the loop is just go around and around.\n\nLenny (00:08:31):\nI was going to ask you, why is it that you call it The Magic Loop? Also, we kind of dived right in, but what is the goal of this? I guess it's pretty clear maybe at this point of this helps you advance in your career, but whatever you want to share along those lines.\n\nEthan Evans (00:08:43):\nYeah, okay. Very fair. So I called it The Magic Loop because I pioneered it with my audience a few years ago. And it works so well, that people were writing back in and saying, \"How do I turn this off? I'm in over my head now. My boss has asked me to do all these cool things, and I feel like I can't catch up, and I've already been promoted once and I need time to digest it.\" And it just seemed like it worked like magic. It worked in almost every circumstance. \n\n(00:09:15):\nThere are of course exceptions where you have very exploitative managers who are like, \"Oh, it's great. You're working harder, keep doing that, and they won't do anything for you.\" But those are rare. And then the purpose, yeah, to help you get satisfaction in your career. A lot of people are unhappy with their jobs. Many people want to move up a level or get paid more. Not everyone. Some people want to change what they're doing, they're bored. This is a path to all of that, because it's forming a partnership with your leadership to say, \"Look, I'll help you, but I need you also to help me.\" And most good managers are very open to that.\n\nLenny (00:09:52):\nWhen we were working on this, one of the pieces of feedback I had was I feel like I could just tell my manager, \"Hey, I want to grow my career. What can we work on to help me get there?\" And your feedback was like, most managers are not that good and not that thoughtful about their employee's careers. Can you just talk a little bit about that? People may be hearing this and be like, \"Why do I need to do this? This seems like a lot of work.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:10:15):\nIf you have a great manager, you may not need to do nearly as much formality. They may have given you good feedback, so you don't need to ask for feedback. They may have offered you opportunities to step up, and you've said yes to some and maybe no to others. That's fantastic. I designed The Magic Loop for the people who either don't know what to do or their manager is either not that good or just very busy.\n\n(00:10:37):\nRemember, lots of managers have great intentions to help their employees, but they get busy with their own lives, their own work, all the things they're focused on, even also their own career. The manager is often busy thinking about their own needs, and so they mean to get to you next week, and next week drifts on for a year.\n\nLenny (00:11:00):\nWhat has come up since this has come out that you would want to either add to, or tweak, or help people better understand? I imagine there's some criticism. I imagine there's a lot of, \"Yes, yes, yes. This really works.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:11:12):\nTwo things I'd love to clarify. The first is many people ask me, \"Why do I have to do this? Shouldn't my manager notice what I'm doing? Shouldn't my manager help with my career? Shouldn't my manager be planning for me?\" And what I say about that is what your manager should do and $4 will get you a cup of coffee at Starbucks. \n\n(00:11:36):\nThe point of this loop is it's in your control. It is true that a good manager would do all those things I just mentioned, but not all managers are good and some of them need some help. And the thing I would just say about The Magic Loop is it's in your control.\n\n(00:11:52):\nAnd so you can be upset that your manager isn't perfect, but move on from that and take control of your own situation. That's the first thing I'd say. The other big extension I would make is look, if you are a manager or a leader of any type, you can initiate The Magic Loop from your side, so you can talk to your employees and say, \"Hey, what are your career goals? Would you like to form a partnership where you step up to new challenges and I help you get to your goals?\"\n\n(00:12:26):\nI had a lot of success forming this kind of partnership with my employees, where as they saw growth and success, they really leaned in and like, \"This system works. You're actually investing in me now. I'll work extra hard.\" And I'm like, \"Yes, and we can grow your team or grow your opportunity,\" and it was very win-win.\n\nLenny (00:12:46):\nTo give people a little bit of social proof, you mentioned some of the folks you've worked with on this. Can you share some stories, or stats, or anything to help people understand how helpful this ended up being to folks you've worked with?\n\nEthan Evans (00:12:58):\nYeah, absolutely. I'll tell one story from each end of the spectrum. And what I mean there is entry-level people and then high level executive leaders. I had an entry-level person write me back and say, \"Look, when I learned about The Magic Loop, I was at a company and not doing very well. I started applying it. They offered me a $30,000 raise and a bigger job. And I turned it down because I got hired at this other company that was offering me even more, and I went there. And they've promoted me also,\" and he was one of the people who wrote in and said, his exact words were, \"A year ago I was made redundant.\" So he is in the UK, redundant is their word for laid off. \"A year ago I was made redundant. I got this first job and I got an offer for an increased salary, and then I got the second job and I got an increase when I joined that was even bigger.\" And he was in that situation of, \"Mow I need to sort of slow down and digest all of that.\"\n\n(00:14:05):\nOn the complete other end, one of my best people I ever worked with joined my team at Amazon as what we would call an SDE II, which in Amazon is a level five employee. He grew with me kind of following this process to a senior engineer. Then he switched to management and ran a small team. Then he became a senior manager and he relocated with my organization. He opened a new office in another city, was eventually promoted to director running his own office of a couple hundred people. And this was over the course of about eight years. He went from a mid-level engineer to an executive with a team of 800 people. Now he was a very hard worker, but over this eight years we just saw all this progress.\n\n(00:14:56):\nAnd then eventually he moved on. He founded his own startup, sold that, and now works as an executive vice president at one of the major online banks. And so his career in some sense has exceeded mine, but during that eight year span, he just grew so much. And this is the process we followed.\n\nLenny (00:15:19):\nWow, those are excellent examples. What levels does this help you with? At what level is this most useful, and then does it kind of taper out it? I don't know if you get to VP level, do you still try using Magic Loop?\n\nEthan Evans (00:15:33):\nSo I think it works anywhere from the start of your career to pretty far into it. I think at my level, I finished my career as a vice president at Amazon. It does peter out in the sense of the active. And what I mean by that is you're still doing the same thing, but you don't have to talk about it. Your managers are expecting you to step up and recognize challenges. They're expecting you to ask for resources when you need them, and you don't sort of have this level of explicit conversation around, what can I help you with? They're expecting you to anticipate what's needed.\n\n(00:16:09):\nSo in the newsletter we did together, I wrote about how over time, you go from asking your manager, \"How can I help?\" To suggesting to your manager, \"These are some things I see that seem like they need to be done. Would you like me to do them?\" To just seeing what needs to be done and sort of keeping your leader in the loop and saying, \"Hey, I noticed that we have this problem. I fixed it. I noticed we have this opportunity. I've started program against it.\" I think at the executive level, it's much more you being proactive and just keeping your leader in the loop.\n\nLenny (00:16:44):\nI think in the post, the way you described this step is this is advanced mode. Don't jump straight to this. Don't just start suggesting things, because you may get it wrong.\n\nEthan Evans (00:16:53):\nYeah, well, it's all a matter of rapport and trust. A huge part of career success is how much trust you have, mutual respect with your leadership. When they're confident that you're going to make the right decisions, they're confident to let you go. But yeah, when you're brand new or you're new to a manager, if you just jump in, you may either not work on the things they value or even find yourself working across purposes, and that isn't the right place to start.\n\nLenny (00:17:19):\nAwesome. Okay. Just to close out this conversation. You touched on this, but why is it that you think this is so important and effective? Why do you think this works so well? People may not recognize, \"I see this is the key to this.\"\n\nEthan Evans (00:17:31):\nWell, I think it's two things. First, I mentioned how rare it is for managers to be offered help. If you're a manager, you'll recognize this. If not, feel free to talk to any manager, whether your own or somebody else. Ask them how much they worry and how much they feel overwhelmed and wish someone would give them a hand. Management can be a lonely job, because you feel like you're responsible for everything. So having an ally, it's just a huge weight off people's shoulders.\n\n(00:18:01):\nAnd then I think a lot about social engineering. The social engineering's here is just the simple, \"You help me, I'll help you.\" It doesn't have to be exploitative, it's just we help those people who help us, and that's built into human survival. \n\n(00:18:18):\nAnd I think this loop works so well because it's just leaning a little bit into that behavior. So many relationships with managers are oppositional. You tell me what to do, and I'm kind of like a kid in high school who's trying to figure out how do I skip as many classes as possible and turn in as little homework and still get by with a D? That relationship won't build your career.\n\n(00:18:45):\nSome people approach their jobs as my goal is to do the least I can and still collect my paycheck. That's an approach if you're okay with where you are. It's not what I coach though. I assume people want to grow.\n\nLenny (00:19:02):\nOkay, so maybe it's just as a closing question, for people that are listening and want to start putting this into practice slash are stuck in their career and are just like, \"Okay, I see. Here's something I can do.\" Could you just again summarize the loop briefly?\n\nEthan Evans (00:19:15):\nSure. Step one, make sure you're doing your current job well. The way I explain this is when you go to your manager and ask, \"What could I do to help?\" You don't want their answer, even if they don't say it quite so bluntly to be, \"Do your F-ing job.\" You need to be doing that already. So be doing a good job.\n\n(00:19:34):\nAnd unfortunately, a good job is in the eyes of your manager in this case. You may think I'm doing great work, but if your manager doesn't, they're the ones you need to build as an ally here. \n\n(00:19:46):\nOnce you have that, go ask how you can help, do whatever you're asked, and then go back to your manager and suggest or ask, \"I would like to meet this goal. Can I keep helping you? What could I take on that you need that would also help me meet this goal?\" And that's where you start to try to bring your two sets of aims together. What do you need done, how can I get to my goal? And let's do those things together.\n\n(00:20:11):\nAnd then you just repeat this loop. You build trust, you build the relationship. And with all good managers, and even a lot of moderate managers, they appreciate the help so much, they really lean into that.\n\nLenny (00:20:23):\nI think there's two really important elements of this that you haven't even mentioned necessarily, that I think are part of the reason this works so well. One is this forces you and your manager to identify the gaps that are keeping you from the next level, which it's often vague, and then you get to a performance review, and then your manager's like, \"Ethan, you're still not good on this and this and that,\" and you're like, \"You never told me that that's the things you're looking for for me to get promoted.\" So I think there's this implicit, here's what you need to work on to get to the next level, which I think is part of step four. \n\n(00:20:53):\nAnd then you actually did touch on this that it's important to share your goal to your manager. Here's what I want. I want to get promoted. A lot of times they don't know that and you helping them understand, \"Here's what I want, help me get there.\" It goes a long way. So there's a lot-\n\nEthan Evans (00:21:06):\nManagers often fall into the trap. They chose to become managers, so they assume one of two things about you. They either assume that you want to keep doing exactly what you're doing forever, just maybe make a little more money.\n\n(00:21:16):\nSo you're an artist, you want to keep drawing forever. You're a lawyer, you want to keep writing contracts forever. Or they assume that, \"Hey, I became a manager. I'm very proud of my career. That must be what you want.\"\n\n(00:21:29):\nAnd these assumptions are natural, right? We tend to view by default that our path is great and everyone would want to be us. Now of course, some good managers don't do that. But if you clarify and express your goals, you remove that ambiguity.\n\nLenny (00:21:45):\nI actually had a period in my career where I specifically did not want to get promoted. I was very happy where I was, and I just wanted to keep doing this awesome IC role. Is that something at all you see where people are just like, \"I'm good. I don't need to get promoted,\" and then is this helpful in that in any way or is it not as big a deal?\n\nEthan Evans (00:22:02):\nSo first, I reached a point in my career where I was no longer pursuing promotion either, and I wanted to do other things. So I've lived that myself and I've used the same loop, but I used it to go do what I wanted to say, \"This is now what I want, and how do we get there? How do we create a role where I'm adding value appropriate to my level, but I'm doing this other work that's fun?\" I moved into gaming and I really wanted to do that.\n\n(00:22:25):\nSecond, I think it is still helpful because there's something you want probably. Maybe you want to work on different kinds of projects or maybe you want to work with a different higher performance team. Or maybe you want to rebalance your life and say, \"Hey, I love what I'm doing, but how can I be a star performer for you but within these boundaries?\"\n\n(00:22:47):\nSo if you truly have the perfect job just as it is, you may not need The Magic Loop. But I know so few people if you're like, \"Nope, there's absolutely nothing I could improve about my role.\"\n\nLenny (00:23:00):\nYeah, I think that your point about your goal doesn't have to be promotion. It could be work on a different part of the org, try something totally... Maybe transition to a new function that could be part of your goal. Awesome. \n\n(00:23:09):\nOkay, so along the same lines of career progression, you work with a lot of senior manager types, kind of the level of L7 and one M2-ish, and you share with me that one of the most frustrating parts of their job in that specific portion of their career is they get stuck at that level and they don't move up, and it becomes really annoying, and they're not sure how to break out of that. What advice you share with folks like that, that may be listening?\n\nEthan Evans (00:23:36):\nYeah, so it's common to get stuck there, and there are a few reasons for it. First, there are a lot of senior managers. If you think of your average director, they may have six to eight reports. How many more directors are needed? So there's a choke point.\n\n(00:23:52):\nSecond, that choke point is worse in the current economy, and in the past maybe a lot of companies, Amazon, Google, apple, etc., were growing very rapidly. And so it wasn't just you were waiting for some other director to leave. The teams were getting bigger.\n\n(00:24:07):\nI experienced this at Amazon, where over a nine-year period I went from managing six people to 800. And so I went from a senior manager all the way to a vice president, and I described I was, in some sense just riding the elevator. The elevator was going up, and as long as I managed to stay on it, I was going to arrive at vice president.\n\n(00:24:29):\nBut the other thing that causes people to get stuck is the difference between a senior manager and a director is how you lead and the work you're doing. And you can get as far as senior manager by being really strong in your function and being really good at getting things done. As a director, and as a VP beyond that, it becomes much more about influence, coordination with others, and letting go of being in all the details yourself. And so senior managers really have to change some behavior.\n\n(00:25:03):\nI often reference the book by Marshall Goldsmith, What Got You Here Won't Get You There. Not only because it's a great book classically on this problem, but because the title tells the story. All the great traits that got you to this one level won't get you to the next level where you're more expected to be thinking in strategic terms, thinking longer term.\n\nLenny (00:25:26):\nSo to someone that may be in that role today and they're not moving up, is there anything they can do? This point about just there's no roles for you, there's only so much you can do there, is the advice just wait until an opportunity arrives? Is it run this Magic Loop until something happens? Is there anything you can do?\n\nEthan Evans (00:25:42):\nI would be honest with people and say some patience is required. At this level, there is some notion of, do we need a director? Do we need a vice president? Do we have a challenge at that level that needs that person? And so promotions at this level, I often teach have two components. The first component is can I eat and do that job? Am I qualified? Do I have the skills? But the second piece is, do we have such a job that needs that?\n\n(00:26:09):\nHowever, there is a lot you can do. A lot is in your control. And what is in your control is to start practicing those next level skills. Start working with your leadership on, where can I take on a strategic project? How can I become more of an inventor? I teach some about how to sort of systematically be inventive. It's not pure magic. Edison said it's 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration. You can learn the 99%, and the 1% isn't as hard then. So you start showing those next level traits. And as I describe it most succinctly, how do you make yourself the person who will be chosen out of the eight?\n\n(00:26:51):\nAnd you can be chosen, there are several ways to move up. Your boss can leave or be let go. They can be promoted to another role. But another way is I coach now, and I have several clients recently. I was just talking to a client yesterday, her two peers were let go. They were all the same level. Her two peers were let go and she was given their teams. And she expressed that her boss had been told, \"You have too many senior managers for the size of your organization. We need to do some change in the organization, clean house, and put all your people under the folks who have potential.\"\n\n(00:27:32):\nWell, obviously she must be one of those people, because she still has her job and has more people and more to do. And unfortunately, her peers are shopping for new employment. So be that person, and that's where The Magic Loop comes in. Be that person.\n\nLenny (00:27:48):\nI was just talking actually to a senior PM leader who pointed out that with this kind of lean environment of a lot of flattening of orgs and a lot of layoffs, that this is becoming increasingly hard. Exactly what you're describing. There's just less spots, because companies are running more lean, and so you just kind of have to wait. \n\n(00:28:06):\nI think part of this advice you just shared, which is classic do the job before you have the job makes all the sense in the world. Because once people see that you can do it, obviously they'll feel a lot more comfortable putting you in that position.\n\nEthan Evans (00:28:18):\nAnd they'll be looking. I always remind people, as a leader, I want the best people under me I can have. It's not that I don't wish to promote you. If you think about my job, this helps people, right? I have selfish motivation to promote you. A lot of people think, \"The bosses there holding me down.\" Well, maybe some bosses are, but why wouldn't I want stronger, more capable direct reports? Why wouldn't I want people under me who can do more of my job? Frankly, that's the only way I can do less of my job.\n\nLenny (00:28:47):\nPlus this pressure you're always getting from your reports. So like, \"Hey, I'm ready to get promoted, because this time\"... You mentioned this word inventiveness, and I was just listening to Jeff Bezos on Lex Fridman, and I don't know if you heard this, but Jeff Bezos described himself most as an inventor more than anything else that he does. Is that something that you think about? Is that influenced by Jeff Bezos any way, that idea of being an inventor as a leader?\n\nEthan Evans (00:29:13):\nI'll say a couple things about that. First, I know you talked to my old boss, Bill Carr, who wrote Working Backwards. What I don't know is if he shared with you that after he published it, he actually realized there was a better title. He wishes that he had called the book The Invention Machine, because what Jeff was trying to do with Amazon was create the most inventive company, the company that would systematically out-invent others. And so while Working Backwards is a great title, Bill and Jeff think they should have called it the Invention Machine.\n\n(00:29:47):\nWhen I joined Amazon, I did not think of myself as an inventor, but I saw that we had these leadership principles think big and invent and simplify that pushed on that. And I said, \"I'm in trouble. I don't know how to do this.\" And I sat down and thought about that. What am I going to do? It seems like that's required. And I figured out how to become systematically inventive. So I now hold over 70 patents as one benchmark of inventiveness, and they were all created during my 15 years at Amazon. \n\n(00:30:22):\nAnd the way I did that, inventiveness actually isn't that hard. I teach about this. And to invent systematically, first you do need to be somewhat of an expert in whatever area you want to invent. So Lenny, if you and I say let's get together and we're going to invent cancer drugs, we have the problem that neither of us, as far as I know is a biologist, a doctor. We don't have the right background, we don't know what we're doing. So we would just be fumbling around I guess with a bathtub full of chemicals hoping. It's probably not going to work out that well. So you have to be something of a knowledgeable expert.\n\n(00:30:56):\nBut then the second thing people don't do is they don't spend dedicated time actually thinking. They feel like, \"Invention is just going to come to me.\" When I want to invent, I get away from all my devices. I go in a room with the problem I have, and I force myself to actually concentrate on what do I know and how can I invent? And the most straightforward way to invent is not to somehow come up with something completely new, but instead to put together two things that exist. \n\n(00:31:28):\nAnd so my example of this, I have a patent I talk about a lot for a drone delivery for Amazon, but the drone doesn't fly from the warehouse. Instead, a truck with no top drives slowly around the neighborhood, and the drones go back and forth from the truck. As opposed to the driver stopping at every house, you can have four or six drones hitting everything in the neighborhood. \n\n(00:31:55):\nAnd the way I came up with this idea is one day I was thinking about drones and delivery, but I loved military history. And so I was thinking also about an aircraft carrier and I was thinking, is there a way to have an aircraft carrier for drones? And from that, it was very quick for the light bulb to go on and say, well, what about a truck? \n\n(00:32:17):\nAnd so I have this patent, and we haven't seen this become reality yet. I'm waiting for my idea to become part of Amazon's drone delivery system, but I think ultimately it will.\n\nLenny (00:32:32):\nThat is badass. I'm imagining returns come back to the truck. We're using that rope thing that just captures them with that little hook.\n\nEthan Evans (00:32:42):\nYeah. Well, there's no reason... Same thing. When you want to return something as opposed to taking it to the UPS Store or whatever, you just put it on your porch, and then on your phone, on your app, maybe you take a picture of it so that the drone can recognize the box or you put it in a designated spot, and you push a button and the drone takes your return away. Yes, there's no reason.\n\nLenny (00:33:03):\nCan't wait for that. And it takes your dog backs in it sometimes, part of it.\n\nEthan Evans (00:33:09):\nMy dog's too heavy, thank you.\n\nLenny (00:33:11):\nMy dog's not. There's an owl in our backyard that we sometimes worry he is going to come grab our dog on. This idea of invention, this is really interesting. I didn't plan to talk about this, but for someone like say a PM on a team that wants to get better at invention, innovation, big thinking, is there a practice you find helpful here? Is it block off two hours, get a pen and paper, and just think about the specific two adjacent things working together?\n\nEthan Evans (00:33:34):\nSo that's part of the process, is put in dedicated time. The interesting thing I would say is you don't need that much time. Two hours is great, but you only need two hours once a month. People think invention takes all this time. The thing is once you have one good idea, it often takes years to express that.\n\n(00:33:52):\nSo you had the idea to have a newsletter. I know some of the history of your newsletter. You've been working on the expression of that idea for years now. Jeff and Amazon had ideas like, \"Let's have Prime shipping.\" Well, Prime is still getting better and still being worked on. It's a 20 some year old idea. The Kindle a decade's old idea now still getting better. \n\n(00:34:16):\nSo the point here is you don't need very many good ideas to be seen as tremendously inventive. Like Elon Musk, Tesla, he can kind of dust off his hands and be like, \"I am now an Edison-like inventor.\" So he keeps doing it, but you don't need that many inventions.\n\nLenny (00:34:36):\nThis touches on something else Jeff Bezos shared on the podcast that most of his innovation and work is in the optimizing phase. It's not the here's the idea, it's the making it cheaper, and better, and faster. And that's where most of the good stuff comes from. In this point of Tesla, Elon had this idea, and now the hard work is actually making it scalable and cheap enough for people to use, not just an electric car.\n\nEthan Evans (00:34:59):\nWith the idea of Jeff saying that invention is really a lot of the incremental and optimization, I completely agree with that. To invent well, you need a base idea, but then there's so much of the work is making that idea real.\n\n(00:35:15):\nAnd again, Prime is a great example of this. The Amazon Prime program was a great example of, okay, we want fast free shipping. We want this program. That was a one-time idea that they did build, but now Prime has expanded. First it was two-day in the US, then one-day in the US, now it's same day in the US. But also they added Prime Video, Prime Music, Prime Gaming. There's actually something like 25 things you get free with Prime. Most people have no idea, because you get free photo storage and this ongoing list. And all of that is that incremental optimization to make it better, better, better, better. And of course Jeff's goal, which you probably heard him say, was to make Prime a no-brainer, to where you would be irresponsible really not to be a member.\n\nLenny (00:36:06):\nI know you have an awesome Jeff Bezos story that I want to get to, but before we do that, one more question along this line of career advice and progression. So I read somewhere that you've interviewed over 2,500 people over the course of your career. And so kind of going back to the beginning of a career, or at least getting a job, what have you found is most helpful in standing out as a candidate when you're interviewing, and essentially getting hired? What advice do you have for people that may be going through an interview process right now?\n\nEthan Evans (00:36:33):\nThere's a lot of evidence that suggests that the number one and two factors in any interview are appearance and enthusiasm. And it doesn't mean you have to be beautiful, but show up somewhere looking like you're interested in the job, not in your pajamas. And most importantly, be enthusiastic. People want to work with people that want to work with them. So if you seem very judgmental of the company and like you have to sell me on it, you're going to turn them off. I look at every interview of whether or not I really want this job, I might've decided I don't want the job. I still want the offer.\n\n(00:37:10):\nAnd so I come to any interview I do leaned in and talking about how excited I am to be a part of this opportunity and what I know about the company. Beyond those cosmetics, the biggest thing I see particularly at higher levels is people talk about what they have done but not why it mattered. They don't talk about the impact.\n\n(00:37:32):\nSee, a leader is not hiring someone to just do work. They're hiring someone because they have a problem or a need. And so if you can show them, \"Look, here's the things I've done that have made a difference. Here's the things I've done that have helped my past employers where I've had an impact.\" So I didn't just do work. That makes you a worker. Someone who has an impact is more of a leader.\n\n(00:37:57):\nAnd leader doesn't need to mean people manager, just a higher level, that I have done something that solve the big problem, and here's how it changed the company or customer outlook. That's what I'm looking for in an interview, is are you bringing me an understanding of the business that shows you contributed to the business, or are you just telling me how hard you worked?\n\nLenny (00:38:19):\nAwesome. On that first piece, now that most interviews I imagine over Zoom, in terms of enthusiasm and looking professional, is there anything you've found that people may not be thinking about in those two buckets?\n\nEthan Evans (00:38:33):\nYeah. Show the person full-time dedication. So unless you really don't have any choice, don't take an interview from a car, don't have your camera off. Eye contact is still a real thing. Body language is still a real thing. Gestures like I'm making now with my hands, they're part of your presentation.\n\n(00:38:53):\nSo be fully present and try to project through the camera a little bit of I'm excited to be a part of this and I appreciate the opportunity. I often tell people the best way to prep for an interview might be a good night's sleep and a pot of coffee, that being fully engaged and energetic is a huge lever.\n\nLenny (00:39:18):\nAwesome. And I think basically, the feedback there is don't over obsess with the content. There's a lot of value in just how you come across.\n\nEthan Evans (00:39:27):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny (00:39:29):\nLet me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard, and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why product four teams such as Atlassian, [inaudible 00:39:49], and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails, and documentation.\n\n(00:39:56):\nBut don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2x higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before.\n\n(00:40:14):\nCreating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording, Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale. Arcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools, and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.\n\n(00:40:44):\nNow let's take a little trip to failure corner. This is something that I do more and more on this podcast, talk about people's failures in their career and their learnings. And apparently you have a great story of failing the great Jeff Bezos and surviving to tell the tale. Could you share that story?\n\nEthan Evans (00:41:00):\nI do. It's both a highlight and a low light. So I had been at Amazon about six years. I had become a director, and I was responsible for launching Amazon's app store.\n\n(00:41:14):\nAnd so we were building an Android-based app store to go on Google phones and eventually on the Kindle tablets. And we got to launch day. And at that time, Jeff used to write a letter introducing new products. He would write a letter that said, \"Dear customers, today Amazon's proud to launch blah blah, blah, and it's got these great features and I hope you really enjoy it. Thanks Jeff.\" And we would take down all the sales stuff on www.amazon.com and that letter would fill the whole screen. \n\n(00:41:48):\nAnd so he had written a Jeff letter, and this Jeff letter emphasized a particular feature of our product that he really liked. So that something that made it a little different.\n\n(00:42:00):\nAnd that specific thing was we had a button called test drive that you could click on and it would open the app in a simulator in your web browser, so you could check out the app and interact with it before putting it on your phone. So he thought this was really cool and he was all about it. \n\n(00:42:19):\nWell, my team had built all this technology. We had test drive working. It was kind of a hard piece of technology if you think about simulating any of thousands of arbitrary apps. And we worked all night to launch it, and it wasn't quite working at 6:00 AM. We were still debugging.\n\n(00:42:38):\nNow you know engineers very well. And I'm sure most of your listeners know about engineers, even if that's not their discipline. We always think we're this close to finding the last bug. \n\n(00:42:49):\nSo about 6:15 AM, I get a message from Jeff that says, \"Hey, I woke up, where's the letter?\" Because it was supposed to go live at 6:00 AM, right after the markets in New York would've opened at 9:00 AM Eastern. And he says, \"Where's the letter?\" And I write him back and I say, \"Well, we're working on a few problems.\" And what I'm thinking in my head is, \"Get in the shower, get in the shower. I just need 20 minutes, get in the shower.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:18):\nFor Jeff to get in the shower.\n\nEthan Evans (00:43:20):\nYeah. And 30 seconds later, I have an email back that says, \"What problems?\" And at this point I have to start explaining, and I end up explaining that we're having a problem with a database, and we're debugging this database problem. And he's like, \"Wait, there's a database in your design? We're trying to eliminate all Oracle databases and move to AWS. Why do you even have this?\" And he is just getting more and more frustrated and angry.\n\n(00:43:49):\nAnd he starts copying in my boss, and my boss's boss who's with Jeff Wilke, the CEO of retail. And they start asking me questions. And it's just this snowballing, but 7:30 in the morning, Jeff is clearly angry. And there's this list of other people waking up and feeling like, \"Well Jeff is angry, so my job is to be even more angry,\" and it's just raining in on me.\n\nLenny (00:44:14):\nOh man. \n\nEthan Evans (00:44:15):\nSo what did I do? The interesting thing is what do you do when the future richest man in the world is mad at you? He wasn't quite richest man in the world yet, but he was headed there.\n\n(00:44:26):\nSo the first thing I did was I owned it. I said, \"Yes, it's not working. It's my fault. I will deal with it.\" I took ownership. And the second thing I did was start updating him very proactively and saying, \"Here's where we are.\" 8:00 AM, \"This is exactly where we are. This is what we're going to do and the next hour, and this is when you'll get your next update. I will update you again at 9:00 AM, so here's our plan.\"\n\n(00:44:55):\nAnd even though Jeff had sort of lost trust in me, like it's down, and it's not right, and I'm mad, given that he agreed with the plan, he was willing to give me 60 minutes. And then I would update him again and say, \"Okay, this is what we've done and this is what we're going to do, and we'll update you again at 10:00 AM.\" So I was buying life one hour at a time.\n\n(00:45:17):\nNow the other thing I did, and this is a good thing about Amazon, as more and more leaders got copied into this angry thread, they started reaching out in back channel and saying, \"We've all been under Jeff's Eye of Sauron, we know it's miserable. What can we do to help?\" And essentially Andy Jassy's organization, which was AWS at that time, and his CTO, a guy named Werner Vogels said, \"You're having a database problem, let's get you some principal engineers from the AWS database team.\" \n\n(00:45:54):\nAnd these principal engineers showed up at 9:00 AM roughly, and they looked at our design. We had made some fundamental mistakes in our database usage and they said, \"It's too complicated to fix this. We're just going to give you 500 AWS machines so that your crappy design will run anyway. That's the immediate fix.\" And I'm like, \"Okay, well I guess if you have 500 databases lying around because you're AWS, it's a great solution,\" and that's what they did.\n\n(00:46:27):\nSo the next step is we fixed the problem. A bunch of us worked together very hard to get the problem all fixed. Now it took all day, and Jeff was still frustrated because the opportunity to sort of control the messaging and the media by having his letter up had passed. People had noticed our launch and the articles had been written, and so Jeff was still very mad.\n\n(00:46:52):\nSo we fixed the problem, but Jeff now had no trust in us. The weekend went by. He was using the system looking for bugs because he is like, \"This team's not reliable now. Ethan's not reliable. I better check it myself.\" So you have the CEO checking on you.\n\n(00:47:11):\nAnd he found a problem and emailed me like Saturday night at 9:00 like, \"I was doing this and it broke.\" And luckily I was able to tell him exactly what happened by 9:30. Anyway, the next part of the story is that following week, I had a meeting with him on another topic.\n\n(00:47:32):\nSo I was part of this small group that was trying to figure out how to build a competing browser. You may not remember, but Amazon had a browser called Silk for a while. And I was invited to this meeting, but I wasn't a critical participant. So you may know this idea from Scrum where they say some people are pigs and some are chickens, and the chickens are sort of observers. I was a chicken in this meeting, and that turns out to be a great analogy because I was thinking, should I chicken out and not go? I could skip this meeting with the CEO who's angry at me. But when I had that thought, I realized if I can't face the CEO, I'd better pack my desk. That's the end. \n\n(00:48:13):\nSo I went to this meeting early, and Jeff always sat in the same chair, so I knew where he would sit when he came in. So I sat down right next to his chair and I thought, \"I don't know, let's find out.\"\n\n(00:48:24):\nAnd so the meeting goes by, and of course in my mind Jeff is totally ignoring me, not even looking at me. But I think that's just me projecting, because remember I wasn't central to the meeting.\n\n(00:48:35):\nSo at the end of the meeting, everybody gets up to leave. He turns and looks at me and says, \"So how are you doing? I bet it's been a hard week.\" And I thought, \"Oh, okay, we're going to talk.\" And I said, \"Yeah,\" I just sort of answered him with, \"Of course it's been hard, but here's what we're doing and here's what we're going to do in the future.\" And we had a very human conversation. And I didn't believe Jeff would've forgotten that I let him down, but it was clear he had forgiven it. \n\n(00:49:05):\nSo I was still going to have to, as it turns out, re-earn his trust. But the thing I did that's key for people to learn from is it's really easy to flame. He had been flaming me, writing angry emails. Angry emails are easy. Sitting three feet from someone and being angry with them face-to-face is hard. And when faced with, I can either start ranting at this person who reports to me, or I can say something nice, he chose to say something nice, and that rebuilt our relationship.\n\n(00:49:42):\nSo the end of the story is two years later, I was promoted to vice president. So even though I had failed the CEO on this very public launch where he was very definitely mad at me, I re-earned the trust, I showed I had learned the lessons of how to launch more reliably without outages, and I was promoted.\n\n(00:50:07):\nAnd so I share that story because I think what I want people to understand is if I can get away with publicly failing one of the richest and most famous inventors on earth, and then get promoted and finish my career at Amazon very successfully, you can dig out of any hole. You just have to manage it right.\n\nLenny (00:50:30):\nThat is an amazing story. So there's a lot of lessons that I want to pull on here. One is just if you get caught in a situation like this where something completely fails, what I took down as you were talking, one is admit, yes, this is a huge problem, own it. This is like, don't try to deflect.\n\n(00:50:47):\nTwo is the way I describe what you did here, is something I call prioritizing and communicating, where you prioritize, \"Here's what we need to do,\" and then communicate. \"Here's our priorities.\" And I love that you have this every hour, \"Here's the latest, here's the latest.\" So make people understand you are on it and you'll continue to keep them updated. I imagine one of the worst fears is I have no idea what's happening here. I'm going to go in and start micromanaging.\n\nEthan Evans (00:51:11):\nYou're exactly right. I'm trying to hold off micromanagement. I'm trying to give them, \"Okay, I believe with this and I can wait an hour,\" and then I can wait an another hour because that team seems to be on it. So I'm trying to rebuild trust one hour at a time, and avoid having three or four levels of management all come in and start helping.\n\nLenny (00:51:31):\nThen I love this other piece of advice of meet them in person, try to take it offline essentially, which I know you did later. But that's such a good point that it's hard to be as mad, and angry, and flamey in person. People are just going to be like, \"Okay, I get it. Let's try to figure this out.\" Amazing. Is there anything else? Those are the three that I took away. Just like if you're caught in that situation in the moment, is there anything else that you found to be really helpful?\n\nEthan Evans (00:51:55):\nI mean, work hard and fast, right? You do have to fix the problem. My team had been up all night. I had to start sending people home to sleep in shifts. We had to pull in all this help. And so it was a very hard weekend.\n\n(00:52:10):\nWhen you have a mistake, it's on you to pull out the stops, even if it's uncomfortable to recover from it. And again, this is not the time to be like, \"Well, it's the weekend now, and my team, we'll hit it Monday.\" I'd have been out the door so fast, I would've had the comic Wile E. Coyote skid marks as I bumped down the street. So I would say that's important. It's part of showing ownership.\n\nLenny (00:52:39):\nThe other part of this is something I went through for a while when I was starting to become a more senior leader is I had a lot of imposter syndrome, and this fear that if I messed up, everything would crumble. People would see that I don't actually know what I'm doing, and I'm not really ready for this level of seniority. And so there's this fear of one big mistake, it's over. Clearly this was an example of a huge mistake and it was not over for you. Is there any lessons there that you take away of you can mess up and still do well, even if it's this level of mistake?\n\nEthan Evans (00:53:11):\nI think a lot of people in my position would've quit. They would've let the shame... I was just a little bit bullheaded where I'm like, \"Yeah, I messed up. But I know I'm still a good person and a good worker. Yes, I made a mistake, but I'm going to move on.\" Part of the story I haven't told that you might enjoy is I mentioned that Jeff Wilke was Jeff's number two at that point. Jeff Bezos, number two person, and he was my skip level. \n\n(00:53:38):\nWell, during this process, he came physically into our offices and he wanted to talk to me, and my manager who was vice president said, \"Hey Jeff, this is my team. I own it. If you have any criticism, say it to me. You don't mean to talk to my team.\" And Jeff Wilke said to my boss, whose name was Paul, \"Paul, that's excellent leadership. I really appreciate what you're doing. Please step out of the way. I want to talk to Ethan. You're doing a great job, Paul. Now step aside.\" And then he kind of read me the riot act.\n\n(00:54:15):\nAnd the rest of that funny story is I was so happy with how well my meeting with Jeff Bezos went, I patted myself on the back and like, \"I'm going to go face Jeff Wilke now. I'm going to schedule a meeting with him and do the same thing. I've got this down.\"\n\n(00:54:31):\nSo I go to meet with Jeff Wilke, figuring I'm going to run the same playbook. I'm going to look him in the eye and all will be forgiven. And Jeff Wilke looks at me and says, \"Ethan, when you launched this, did you know you were gambling with the result? Did you know it might not work?\" And I said, \"Yes. We had a media commitment to launch on that day, and I thought shooting for the date was more important than perfect certainty.\"\n\n(00:54:55):\nAnd he said, \"Well, two things. First, you were wrong. You were wrong to prioritize date over our reputation. You let Amazon down in public and that was a mistake.\" He said, \"Second though, at least you knew you were gambling. If you hadn't known you were gambling, we'd be discussing your departure.\" And I'm like, \"Okay.\" Here I thought I was rolling in this meeting like I'm going to run my relationship playbook. And he's evaluating whether or not to keep me.\n\n(00:55:25):\nThe bullheadedness is even after he had told me he had been considering firing me, I'm like, \"Well he isn't. So I'm just going to go forward.\" And a lot of that stubbornness of sure I made a mistake, but I'm not going to live in shame about it, I think is what people can take away. I think a lot of people feel they're more dead in the water than they are. \n\n(00:55:53):\nBecause everybody makes mistakes, right? I mean Jeff and Fire Phone, that'll be an albatross around his neck. Jeff and Fire Phone will be a phrase of anybody who knows Amazon for the rest of his life.\n\nLenny (00:56:08):\nYeah, we talked about it on the Working Backwards podcast, and why didn't Working Backwards work for the Fire Phone, we talked about it. I love that these quotes and lines are so seared in your brain. You can remember it like word for word exactly what-\n\nEthan Evans (00:56:20):\nWell, I've relived that moment many times.\n\nLenny (00:56:26):\nAnd then just along the lines of working your way out of the hole, is essentially what you did just succeed for two years and do great, and that was the key there?\n\nEthan Evans (00:56:34):\nNo, I think I did have to learn. I've always been sort of an operational cowboy, meaning I like to go fast and loose. I prioritize speed, and I really had to step back and say, \"Okay, Amazon at this level and scale doesn't like that.\" So I've taught myself a new phrase which was fear the New York Times headline. Be aware that if Amazon is down, it goes up on every news website immediately. And so if Amazon has some kind of mistake, it's on Wall Street Journal and CNN.\n\n(00:57:07):\nAnd so as a leader, I had to think, is what I'm doing going to generate a New York Times headline? Because if it is, I'd better be really careful. And that's what I taught myself is you can't be paralyzed, but I taught my whole team, we don't want to be in the New York Times for the wrong thing. And that was the lesson\n\nLenny (00:57:32):\nAlong the lines of lessons, last question here, what's something that you took away from the way you approached it that you should have changed or should have done differently, that you've done differently since? Obviously don't... You mentioned this idea of don't promise a date that you're not that certain you're going to hit. I guess is there anything along those lines?\n\nEthan Evans (00:57:52):\nI have two things here. First, Amazon loved in the past, they loved surprise launches. They love the idea of we're going to be quiet, quiet, quiet. Because basically it was a reaction I think to Microsoft where they felt Microsoft always talked about what was coming and then pushed the dates back. And so there was this whole thing about vaporware. And Amazon wanted to be the other way, which is we won't say anything and then it will just be there. The problem I came to say is the biggest thing I learned with surprise launches is that you're surprised by what doesn't work. \n\n(00:58:23):\nAnd so I shifted the approach to let's do a lot of beta testing. We always, even if others don't agree quite and say, \"You're right, we're not going to have a surprise launch.\" Some of our beta testers, even if they sign NDAs are going to leak. And that's a better outcome than launching something that doesn't work. That's one lesson.\n\n(00:58:46):\nThe other lesson is this thing that broke in front of Jeff Bezos, ultimately it was a new college graduate engineer who wrote that code. And he had been left alone to write part of our user interface, but he had written it in such a way that it didn't scale. Now we didn't give him any help or oversight. We left him on his own, because we were busy focusing on other pieces of the problem.\n\n(00:59:20):\nAnd shortly after the disaster, he left the company. And the mistake I made was not reaching out to him and really reassuring him of, \"Yes, you wrote the bug, but that's not on you. The system failed you and we don't see you. Bugs happen.\"\n\n(00:59:38):\nSo the thing I regret in this whole thing is not realizing that even though no one in the team ever yelled at him or whatever, he knew it was his bug, and he obviously saw me and others sort of taking a beating. And so he left, and I wish he hadn't done that. And I wish more than that I had stepped in. I didn't realize what he was feeling.\n\nLenny (01:00:05):\nIt's interesting, the lesson there isn't catch that person sooner, and notice these links in the chain that may break. But it's more just be there for that human that have this challenge, that people may not be focusing on.\n\nEthan Evans (01:00:19):\nBecause we lost a good person, and he probably felt very bad about it. And we all feel bad when we make mistakes. That can't be prevented. But he felt undue responsibility I think, and that I really regret.\n\nLenny (01:00:35):\nThis is actually a really good example of ownership. You mentioned this term ownership and that connects to... Amazon has these leadership principles. I think there's 14 of them. One of them is around ownership. And apparently you helped craft the actual language for that principle, which I think is a huge deal with Amazon. I imagine very few people have a say over how to define, and describe, and say these principles. Could you just talk about this principle that you contributed to, how it came to be that you helped actually write it?\n\nEthan Evans (01:01:08):\nAmazon is now kind of on its fourth version in my mind, maybe there's more. But its fourth major revision of its leadership principles over its 25 plus year history.\n\n(01:01:18):\nAnd when it was going from version one to version two, Jeff and his leadership team sat down together. And actually in version one, there were three different lists. They were leadership principles and core values, and something else I don't remember. And they were like, \"Three lists is stupid. Let's make one list.\"\n\n(01:01:36):\nWell ownership, the term had been a part of one of those lists, but when they merged everything, they took it out. And this guy Jeff Wilke I mentioned, the number two and the leader of retail, he brought a bunch of us a bunch of his directors. He brought the proposed list to us in a meeting and said, \"Hey, this is the proposed new version, do you have any comment?\" And we all sat around and talked and said, \"Where's ownership? Ownership is missing.\" So we told him, he said, \"Look, ownership is missing. We think it should be there.\" And he said, \"Well, why don't you propose a draft?\"\n\n(01:02:15):\nAnd so about a half dozen of us sat around and roughed out a draft of how we felt ownership should be written. And I proposed these six words, which are, \"An owner never says that's not my job.\" Maybe that's seven words.\n\n(01:02:36):\nSo I propose this specific language as a part of it and we sent off this draft. And months go by, we hear nothing. And then one day the leadership principles are announced and ownership is back in. It's been modified, but that, \"An owner never says that's not my job,\" is a part of the leadership principle, and it's remained to this debt. \n\n(01:02:58):\nAnd what I love about that is because Amazon has one and a half million employees who live by these leadership principles, it's probably the most impactful thing I've ever written.\n\nLenny (01:03:11):\nWow. So those seven words are the most impactful thing you've ever written. I love that and I totally get that. I'm looking at the principles right now and it comes right at the end of that principle. We'll link to the 14 leadership principles. Is there another principle that you really love or one or two? I don't know. It's probably hard to pick your favorites.\n\nEthan Evans (01:03:28):\nI'm a huge proponent of bias for action. Bias for action says speed matters in business and many decisions are reversible. And so it's important to go faster. \n\n(01:03:41):\nAnd I think people don't understand that in a competitive environment, being right is good, but being quick is necessary. Because if there are 10 startups working on an idea, some of them will gamble, and they'll make bad gambles, and they'll go out of business. But some of them will gamble and make an early bet and be right. And if you are not moving quickly, you'll be beaten by the people who maybe got lucky. \n\n(01:04:05):\nAnd so you've got to have a process that values speed, values, what can we do today? What can we commit to today? So I really like bias for action. Now that is what got me in trouble with Jeff, right? I was willing to gamble. So it has to be in balance, but that's my other favorite.\n\nLenny (01:04:25):\nAgain, the Jeff Bezos interview with Lex Fridman, he was talking about how with Blue Origin, with the way Amazon, he thought about Amazon is customer obsession. That was the core goal and differentiator of Amazon. With Blue Origin, he wants it to be decisiveness. It's basically leaning into this bias for action fully, which is really interesting.\n\nEthan Evans (01:04:44):\nI saw that part of the interview and I thought, \"Wow, that's exactly right.\" Because again, rockets blow up and they have people on them. You've got to get it right, but you also have to keep moving, because there's always one more thing you can safety test. So how do you balance it?\n\nLenny (01:05:04):\nYeah, it's interesting. With rockets, that's the one that you pick. It's pretty bold to be all move forward kind of thing. So this principle, again, going back to ownership, so you basically suggested this phrase, \"You didn't hear anything,\" and all of a sudden it becomes part of the whole thing. Did that feel weird that they never told you, or I don't know if they gave you credit for that, or it's like, no, it's great?\n\nEthan Evans (01:05:24):\nYeah, I wouldn't even claim credit for it, except I kept a copy of the email that says, \"Ethan thinks it should say blah.\" I have the written proof. Because it's not about the credit. I'm very happy and proud that those words were kept. But in Amazon, I doubt if Jeff knows I wrote those words. It's not like I've ever told him, \"Hey, do you know you kept my words?\" That's not appropriate. It's just a fun anecdote.\n\n(01:05:55):\nAnd it does show, I guess something people can learn from that though, you can influence way up in a company if your ideas are good. And also, when we challenged, Jeff Wilke was a strong opinionated leader who didn't necessarily always love being challenged.\n\n(01:06:15):\nAnd so when we first told him, \"Well, we think you're missing ownership,\" he was like, \"You're staying that the whole S team can't get its leadership principles right?\" I mean it wasn't exactly that way, but he was very much like, \"Well, is this really necessary? Why do you think it's necessary?\" And his challenge to us to write it was kind of framed as, \"Well if you're so sure it's good, show us.\" But again, I'm stubborn and I'm like, \"All right, let's write it.\" And we did.\n\nLenny (01:06:47):\nThat's funny. That's not a great example of leadership where he is like, \"Hey guys, I need your feedback on this thing. But no, don't actually tell me anything's wrong.\"\n\nEthan Evans (01:06:57):\nWell, yeah. I mean for a bunch of directors to kind of critique the work of people two levels higher, he wanted it, but then he's sort of naturally resistant to it if we're kind of poking at his baby.\n\nLenny (01:07:14):\nIt's unlikely that there's something huge missing and it turns out there was.\n\nEthan Evans (01:07:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\nAnd I guess just on these principles, people may not know this, but this is where disagree and commit comes from. It's actually have backbone, disagree, and commit. We talked about this on the podcast about working backwards. I also love leaders are right a lot. That comes up a lot and I love that, to be successful, you need to be right. You can't just project confidence. You can't just be in a bunch of meetings and ship things. You need to be right to be successful.\n\nEthan Evans (01:07:42):\nAnd that one's been rewritten to carefully say, it's always interesting what is the history of the edits, which you wish you could see the edit history on these. That one got modified to say something about leaders actively work to disconfirm their beliefs.\n\n(01:07:58):\nAnd the key there is it was trying to get at the idea that you've got to be very open and always be questioning, \"Yes, I think I'm right, but what's the new evidence? What am I learning? What's changing?\" And in fact, it also says they seek diverse perspectives.\n\n(01:08:20):\nAnd that was a way of getting at what's called DEI, diversity, equity, and inclusion. That's a subtle nod towards if everyone in the room is a 50-year-old white man, you may not really be making the right overall decision for Amazon's customer base. You may be making the one for 50-year-old white suburban Seattleites. And so it's just some of these, every word in those has been studied as an individual word inside the company.\n\nLenny (01:08:52):\nAmazing. Okay. Let's move on to the final area I wanted to spend a little time on, and this is called contrarian corner. I'm curious if you have any contrarian opinions about things basically that other people believe that you don't believe, something you see that many people don't see. Is there anything that comes to mind?\n\nEthan Evans (01:09:11):\nYeah, I think a place where I'm currently very contrarian is the return to office movement. Many leaders at my level appear or publicly favor the need to get back into the office potentially full-time. \n\n(01:09:27):\nAnd I'm contrarian on this because of innovation. Specifically, I looked it up, you can check my facts on Wikipedia. The first purpose-built office, the first building ever built to be an office was built in 1726 in London. And so we're about 300 years into learning how to use offices well.\n\n(01:09:51):\nAnd what that means is offices aren't going to get much better. What's the last major thing you can think of that got better in offices? You might say well open offices, but a lot of people would say that's not even a good idea. These big rows of desks and loud pits.\n\n(01:10:06):\nWith working from home, we've only been doing that for a few years since the pandemic began and at all since the internet started 20 years ago. Which one is likely to have more opportunity for improvement? There's so many things we haven't explored with remote work. And I think the people who say, \"Back to the office, it's because we know it works,\" well we know what it is, but I have so much more faith in the opportunity to improve the remote experience. And so I think long-term, it's going to triumph.\n\n(01:10:40):\nThe one other place where I'm a huge contrarian is doing business on a handshake. I understand companies need lawyers, and I have an attorney for certain things. But I coach people. Most of the people I coach, there's no NDA in place. There's no contract in place. They pay me through PayPal and I do good coaching for them.\n\n(01:11:01):\nI think too much of the world is contract driven, and we've lost the idea of your word being your bond, and you can actually trust me to follow through on my commitments. And I'm a contrarian there.\n\n(01:11:14):\nI realize I will occasionally get burnt. Someone will behave in a way, they'll let me down. But I think when we're always suspicious of people, that's a high cost. And the other place I'm contrarian is just doing business on faith.\n\nLenny (01:11:32):\nThat reminds me, Sam Altman has a similar philosophy of just trust people and assume it'll all be okay. Sometimes you'll get burned, but on balance, it'll end up being much better for you and for everyone around you. \n\nEthan Evans (01:11:42):\nI didn't know that Sam had said that, but I strongly agree with it.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nYeah, although he had some challenges recently. I don't know if it's working great, but it ended upgrade for him. So anyway, okay. We've actually reached our very exciting lightning round. Before we get there, is there anything else you wanted to touch on, or share, or leave listeners with?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:01):\nNo, I've really enjoyed this conversation. I could talk about careers forever and I love doing that, but I think we've covered a ton today that will really help people. So I'm good. Let's hit the lightning round.\n\nLenny (01:12:14):\nAll right. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:19):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:12:20):\nEthan, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEthan Evans (01:12:25):\nTwo or three books. My number one recommendation is a book called Decisive. It's by Chip and Dan Heath, and it's about the science of making better decisions. The reason I recommend it so much is it will make your career better because leaders are decision makers, but also your personal life. So I apply it at least as much in my personal life as I do in my professional life. \n\n(01:12:47):\nMy second most recommended book is Leadership and Self Deception, much less known than Decisive, a little bit harder to approach. It's by a group, a research group called the Arbinger Institute, and it's about, the self-deception is we cause a lot of our interpersonal problems while blaming them on others. And it walks through how are you part of the problem you're having with somebody else and what can you do about it?\n\n(01:13:14):\nThe third and final book was recently brought to me by someone I work with that you know, Jason [inaudible 01:13:21]. That book is The Almanack Of Naval Ravikant. And Naval Ravikant is an angel investor responsible for AngelList. \n\n(01:13:30):\nBut what I love about that book is he has a recipe. He really boils down how to be successful while loving what you do. And he says, \"No one can be a better version of you.\" Don't try to copy me and be, \"I'm going to be like Ethan, or I'm going to be like Lenny.\" Instead, figure out what you uniquely do best that you love, because no one can copy you being you. And that's your defensible sort of career value. And I really like that mental model.\n\nLenny (01:14:03):\nYeah, Naval has so many insightful messages, and you can read all these on his Twitter. We'll link to his Twitter, and someone just made a book out of his tweets basically. He's such an interesting dude.\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:13):\nYes, that's right.\n\nLenny (01:14:14):\nAwesome. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:19):\nSo I grew up on a farm, and so all the Taylor Sheridan, 1923, and Yellowstone, and all of those series, we've watched everything he's put out. We do kind of laugh like, wow. Are you familiar with Yellowstone at all?\n\nLenny (01:14:37):\nAbsolutely. A lot of death.\n\nEthan Evans (01:14:39):\nYeah. At one point my wife and I were watching it, we would start betting. So the episode is starting, how many people will die in this episode? This ranch in Montana, but yet somehow they're always killing people. How does this work?\n\nLenny (01:14:55):\nThat's what your life was like, is what I'm hearing. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nEthan Evans (01:15:03):\nI think my favorite interview question is, \"Tell me about a time where you needed to disagree with your management, where you needed to stand up or fight for a position against higher leadership or people in power.\" Because I think that's really hard to do. I'm normally interviewing leaders, and I think having a bunch of people who just say yes isn't helpful. You need people to have, as you said, have backbone, disagree and commit. So that's what I'm normally looking for.\n\nLenny (01:15:33):\nAwesome. Is there favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEthan Evans (01:15:38):\nIt's silly, but my favorite product that I've discovered recently is the Chuckit!, which you use to whip a ball for your dog a quarter mile. It basically extends your arm. And it's just fun to send a ball soaring way further than you could ever throw it. And you feel like, \"Wow, look at me. I'm a major league pitcher.\" Because I have this three foot lever arm and I understand physics. If we look at tech products, there's so many I love. It's too easy to say ChatGPT and stuff, so I won't go there.\n\nLenny (01:16:16):\nAwesome. My dog does not love chasing balls, so I haven't had a reason to buy that, but I've never thought about just the joy of flicking a ball really far. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with folks, find useful in work or in life?\n\nEthan Evans (01:16:31):\nI happen to be a Christian, and the motto that I think about the most is, \"To whom much has been given, from him much will be required.\" And so I think a lot about what is my social responsibility. \n\n(01:16:44):\nI've been very lucky. I grew up on a farm in Ohio now. I wasn't a farm boy, my father was a chemist. But I grew up in upper middle class settings, and I've ended up being extremely successful, able to retire from my job at 50 to kind of coach and teach. What do I owe to pay forward? So those words are obviously ancient spiritual texts, but they're the ones I take away and think the most about. What's my responsibility?\n\nLenny (01:17:11):\nAs an example of someone that to whom much has been given, but because he's worked so hard, Jeff Bezos is starting a space business as you know. If you had the chance to go to space, would you go?\n\nEthan Evans (01:17:22):\nWell, I of course saw his interview where he talked about how he thought about the safety and the conversation he had to have with his mother. I would like to go to space. I'm not willing to pay what I think the current tickets are, but I would take the risk. So what's the risk of that ride? One in a hundred, one in 50, even more that you won't come back. I would probably take the gamble.\n\nLenny (01:17:46):\nSo you'd be an early adopter? Where along that curve would you be, an early adopter, laggard?\n\nEthan Evans (01:17:50):\nWell, I'm old enough that I remember when the Challenger space shuttle exploded, and I said I would get on the next one and I said, \"They're never going to be more careful than the next one, so I'll get on the next one.\"\n\n(01:18:04):\nSo I think I would get on any one I was offered because of the chance. Unlike Jeff who claims he wasn't scared, I would probably be really terrified, at least at liftoff. While you're up there, it's great. Everything either goes wrong going up or coming down. It's not the middle.\n\nLenny (01:18:25):\nEthan, I think we're going to help a lot of people with their career. I think we're going to help them work through failure, become better owners. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? Also, just share what you do now in case people could use that help. And then how can listeners useful to you?\n\nEthan Evans (01:18:42):\nSo the best place to find me online, I do all my writing on LinkedIn. It's where the professional community is. So Ethan Evans on LinkedIn. My actual handle there is Ethan Evans VP for my history as a vice president. That's the best place to find me. I do have a Substack newsletter. I do teach through the Maven platform, but all of those are linked off LinkedIn.\n\n(01:19:02):\nAnd really, how readers help me, they comment on what I write, because I miss things. I am one person's perspective. And so I actually have a process where I take in all the comments people write, all the different perspectives, all the different exceptions, or special cases, or examples, and that's how I improve my own thinking is I read every comment and think, \"Okay, what did I miss? What could I have said better? How can I incorporate this if I ever talk about this again?\"\n\nLenny (01:19:31):\nJust to give you another opportunity to plug the stuff you do now, what do you help people with in case people could value could you use the stuff that you offer? You said you coach, you have a course. What sort of stuff?\n\nEthan Evans (01:19:40):\nI focus on two topics, career development. So how do you row in your career, the whole Magic Loop, and how do you attain promotion or attain a new role raise if that's your goal? And then leadership specifically. I teach a course that's been very popular called Stuck at Senior Manager - Breaking Through To Executive, which is how to get out of that sort of stuck, \"I'm working really hard, I'm pretty good. I'm managing 25 or 50 people, but how do I get to the big chair? How do I get to the division level leadership and what do I need to change?\" It's that whole what got you here won't get you there. And I love to see people succeed at that. People write me back and say, \"I did get a job. I did get promoted, I did get a raise,\" and that's my fulfillment.\n\nLenny (01:20:25):\nAmazing. Ethan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEthan Evans (01:20:29):\nThank you, Lenny. And I got to say, you are very good at this. You're so smooth and you just do a great job interviewing. It's been really been a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:20:37):\nI really appreciate that, and so are you. Thank you. Bye everyone.\n\nEthan Evans (01:20:42):\nBye everyone.\n\nLenny (01:20:44):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The ultimate guide to AEO: How to get ChatGPT to recommend your product | Ethan Smith (Graphite)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nThere's this term everyone's hearing about, AEO.\n\nEthan Smith (00:00:02):\nAnswer Engine Optimization is how do I show up in LLMs as an answer?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:06):\nIt feels like such a big deal to win at AEO.\n\nEthan Smith (00:00:09):\nIn order to win something like what's the best website builder? At Google, they would win if their blue link showed up first.\n\n(00:00:15):\nBut that's not the case in the LLM, because the LLM is summarizing many citations, and so you need to get mentioned as many times as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nChatGPT is driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter.\n\nEthan Smith (00:00:25):\nYou can get mentioned by a citation tomorrow and start showing up immediately. You can have a Reddit thread, you can have a YouTube video.\n\n(00:00:31):\nYou can be mentioned on a blog. So early-stage companies can win, they can win quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nAre the leads that these answer engines are driving to companies actually valuable?\n\nEthan Smith (00:00:41):\nSignificantly more valuable. Webflow saw a 6X conversion rate difference between LLM traffic and Google Search traffic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nA lot of people are seeing this as everything is different. Nothing we've done before is going to work. We have to rethink everything.\n\nEthan Smith (00:00:53):\nThere's significant misinformation on AEO. There's news articles about how Google Search is going to die because there's a new thing.\n\n(00:01:00):\nGoogle's slice of the pie stays the same. The pie gets bigger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):\nToday my guest is Ethan Smith. Ethan is the CEO of Graphite and my go-to expert for all things SEO. SEO is going through a major transition right now. Everyone used to go to Google anytime they had a question, or were looking for a product or doing research. These days, a lot of people are moving to ChatGPT and Claude, and Gemini and Perplexity to get answers to their questions, and this will only be accelerating over time.\n\n(00:01:29):\nAnd even Google is changing the search experience in a pretty radical way with AI Overviews at the top, and their newly introduced AI Mode, which is basically their own version of ChatGPT. This means that the world of SEO is going through a big change, including the rise of AEO, which stands for Answer Engine Optimization. Basically, SEO for ChatGPT, getting your product to show up in the answers that people get.\n\n(00:01:51):\nEthan has been at the forefront of this new skill and channel. And in this conversation, he shares everything that he's learned about how to get your product to show up more often inside of the answers that people get. The advice that Ethan shares in this conversation is incredibly tactical and worth a lot of money. So please slurp it up and use it for your own products.\n\n(00:02:10):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube, it helps tremendously.

Welcome back to the podcast.\n\nEthan Smith (00:04:41):\nExcited to be back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:42):\nWe did a podcast episode just over two and a half years ago. I think of it as the definitive guide on how to win at SEO. People have been referencing it ever since. I'm really proud of what we did there, but things have changed.\n\n(00:04:54):\nThings are changing in the world of SEO. And so I'm excited to talk to you again about how to be successful in this new-emerging world where AI is changing how SEO works, the rise of AEO and GEO.\n\n(00:05:08):\nLet me start with just this question. How long have you been working on SEO at this point? And has anything come close to being this significant in changing the skill of SEO?\n\nEthan Smith (00:05:19):\nYes. So I got started in SEO in 2007, so it's been 18 years. Actually, the largest change when I got started in SEO, I got started in programmatic SEO and commerce SEO, like NexTag and Shopping.com and PriceGrabber. And that was when you could do mass, auto-generated landing pages.\n\n(00:05:41):\nAnd that was probably the biggest shift, which is Google introduced a bunch of algorithms, Panda and similar things, to prevent you from doing spam. So essentially, you went from the SEO being spam to not spam. That was probably the biggest change, and then this is probably the second-biggest change.\n\n(00:05:56):\nI think that the main thing here is it is related to search, but it's a summarization of search and there's new inputs. So it's probably the second-biggest change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:03):\nOkay, that is really interesting, because I think a lot of people are seeing this as everything is different. Nothing we've done before is going to work.\n\n(00:06:10):\nWe have to rethink everything. You're saying this is actually the second-biggest change, and just like Google's update back in the day was actually even more significant?\n\nEthan Smith (00:06:17):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:18):\nVery cool. Okay, let's set a little context for folks. Let's define some terms. There's this term everyone's hearing about.\n\n(00:06:25):\nThere's actually two, AEO and GEO. What do they stand for? Are they different? What are they referring to specifically?\n\nEthan Smith (00:06:33):\nThey, I think, are the same. Ultimately, the definition of a word is whatever a group of people agree is the definition of a word. So I think we'll see what people decide is the definition of the word. I'll put forward my definition. So AEO and GEO are essentially trying to describe the same thing, which is how do I show up in LLMs as an answer?\n\n(00:06:52):\nAnd I personally prefer Answer Engine Optimization versus Generative Engine Optimization, because generative, you can generate images and videos and things other than an answer. Whereas answer is more narrowly defined, so my personal preference is we're talking about optimizing LLMs.\n\n(00:07:09):\nSo an answer is more narrow of a definition than generative, but ultimately, it's whatever we decide is the name and the definition is what it will be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:19):\nOkay. Yeah, yeah. Answer Engine Optimization sounds a lot cleaner to me if you had to pick one. So it's good to know they're the same thing. Some people just prefer the latter one for some reason.\n\n(00:07:28):\nIt's interesting because recently, I don't know if I told you this, but I was looking at my referral traffic. And I found that ChatGPT is driving more traffic to my newsletter than Twitter, which I did not see coming.\n\n(00:07:40):\nSo somehow it's already happening. I'm excited to learn just how to lean into that potentially and optimize it further.\n\nEthan Smith (00:07:47):\nAnd when did you see the spike? Did you see when it started growing dramatically?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:50):\nUnfortunately, the dashboard I have doesn't give me great peripheral traffic optimization. When do you think I probably saw it?\n\nEthan Smith (00:07:57):\nCompanies that we work with started in January and it started, one, because of more adoption, but two is because the answers became a bit more clickable.\n\n(00:08:05):\nYou have maps, you have shopping carousels, you have clickable cards. So I think the clickability of the answer is increased, and then the adoption increased and that was around January.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:14):\nOkay. I want to come back to this question of, \"Is this good that ChatGPT is sucking all my content and giving people answers, and then sending me some percentage of that?\" But let's not get into that yet. I want to talk about just what kind of impact you can have on having your stuff show up in ChatGPT.\n\n(00:08:32):\nSo I had the head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, on the podcast recently. I asked him, \"What do you think of all this stuff, AEO, GEO?\" He's like, \"Don't worry about any of that. Just write awesome stuff, great quality content. It'll figure it out. It'll find the best stuff.\" I imagine you very much disagree.\n\n(00:08:47):\nI imagine you have seen real impact getting your stuff proactively into these answer engines. Talk about just the kind of impact you've seen and just your reaction to that?\n\nEthan Smith (00:08:56):\nYeah. I agree and disagree, but the way that I think about it is anything can be optimized. You just need to understand the underlying systems and the rules of the game, and if you do that, then you can optimize anything. You can optimize algorithms, you can optimize people, anything could be optimized.\n\n(00:09:11):\nWhat I think he probably meant by that, he probably meant two things. One is, \"Please don't spam my product.\" And two is, \"If you do, I will see it and I will stop you from doing that.\" So it's not a long-term, robust strategy to create spam, just like it wasn't a long-term, robust strategy to create spam on Google.\n\n(00:09:29):\nEventually, Google was going to say, \"Huge shopping comparison sites are making 100 million auto-generated search pages and I don't like it, and I'm going to get rid of the whole category.\" So same thing with ChatGPT, anything can be optimized, but if you're spamming it, they'll see that.\n\n(00:09:43):\nAnd they'll have a whole team looking at that and then they'll change your algorithm to prevent you from doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:48):\nWhat kind of impact have you seen? You've done work with a lot of companies, we'll talk through a few examples.\n\n(00:09:53):\nMaybe share one to give us context just like how much can you impact this sort of thing where you show up in, say, ChatGPT more often?\n\nEthan Smith (00:10:01):\nYou can affect it a lot. So a specific example with Webflow is we are working with Webflow on their SEO. We're working on their content, and we're seeing a lot of wins on the Answer Engine Optimization side.\n\n(00:10:16):\nSo the specific things that we've done there, one is just traditional SEO. So make landing pages for high-search volume keywords, like best no-code website designer.\n\n(00:10:28):\nAnd then for free, you'll get Answer Engine Optimization impact from that. So that's just traditional SEO, which works very well for AEO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:35):\nI was just going to say, that sounds exactly the same as regular SEO.\n\nEthan Smith (00:10:38):\nYeah. So I would say everything that works in SEO works in AEO, but there are additional things beyond SEO that also work in AEO. So second thing, and the way that I think about AEO versus SEO is that the head and the tail are different. So the head is different in that in order to win something like what's the best website builder?\n\n(00:10:59):\nEven if Webflow's URL shows up number one on the citations, they're not going to win the answer because their URL showed up number one, but at Google they would win. If their blue link showed up first they would win, but that's not the case in the LLM. Because the LLM is summarizing many citations and so you need to get mentioned as many times as possible.\n\n(00:11:18):\nSo usually when you ask something like, \"What's the best tool for X?\" The first answer will be mentioned the most in the citations, because that's very different from Google. And so for Webflow, we work with them on YouTube videos, Vimeo videos, getting mentioned in Reddit, getting mentioned in other blogs, affiliates, stuff like that.\n\n(00:11:39):\nSo tried a bunch of stuff. Stuff that worked especially well was just straight SEO, number one. Number two is YouTube videos, and then the third is Reddit optimization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:47):\nOkay, wow. So you're saying if you can get to number one, when you ask ChatGPT, \"What's the best website builder?\"\n\n(00:11:54):\nAnd Webflow's at the top, that doesn't actually drive them as much traffic as simply being mentioned most often across the summary?\n\nEthan Smith (00:12:01):\nYes. And part of why that's interesting is because when startups come to me and ask me for SEO help, my first response is, \"Don't do it at all. Spend your time on something else because you're not going to be able to grow SEO early on in search.\" Because you don't have enough domain authority and it takes a while to get domain authority, and only once you have domain authority can you rank.\n\n(00:12:23):\nAnd so for Google, it's usually something that you do Series A, Series B or later. You don't do it as soon as you start because can't win early on. That's not the case for Answer Engine Optimization, because you can get mentioned by a citation tomorrow and start showing up immediately. You can have a Reddit thread, you can have a YouTube video.\n\n(00:12:42):\nYou can be mentioned on a blog, like a brand-new YC company launches, everyone's talking about them. They could show up in an answer tomorrow as a result of that. So early-stage companies can win, they can win quickly. And they can win quickly and anyone can win quickly, by getting mentioned as many times as possible by the citations. So that's what's different about the head.\n\n(00:13:04):\nWhat's different about the tail is that the tail is larger in chat than in search. So the average number of words, I think, Perplexity said this to somebody else, said that it was around 25 words, where versus Google words it's around six words. So the tail is just much, much larger. People are asking lots of follow-up questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:19):\nThe tail, the prompt essentially, the question you're asking?\n\nEthan Smith (00:13:23):\nYes. Meaning that if you map out all of the questions that people ask, kind of like an SEO, long-tail keywords, if you do long-tail questions, the size of the tail is larger. Meaning the amount of questions that are very specific is larger, the share and the volume.\n\n(00:13:42):\nAnd there's probably questions that have never been asked before and questions that have never been searched before, because search can't support lots of really specific, super-specific stuff. Whereas chat is specifically made to ask a bunch of follow-up questions and have a conversation.\n\n(00:13:58):\nAnd so there's all these questions that have never been asked or searched for before that are now being asked, and then you can win that. And when I got started in SEO, it was long-tail SEO where you have a page for every single keyword, which doesn't work anymore, but now the long tail is back in chat.\n\n(00:14:13):\nAnd if you know all those really specific questions that people are asking, you can also win that, and you can probably also win that early. And I've seen examples of early-stage companies who just launched some really specific AI-enabled payment processing API thing, and they will show up. And they'll show up because they're answering questions that's never been answered before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:35):\nAre the leads that these answer engines are driving to companies actually valuable? Are these good-quality leads for B2B SaaS especially?\n\nEthan Smith (00:14:44):\nThey are significantly more valuable. So Webflow, we saw a 6X conversion rate difference between LLM traffic and Google Search traffic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):\nSix times?\n\nEthan Smith (00:14:56):\nSix times so significantly more qualified. I think that's probably for a couple of reasons. Probably it's because you're so primed because you're having a conversation with multiple follow-ups, and so there's so much intent that you've built.\n\n(00:15:08):\nAnd you've probably really narrowed in on what you want, so when you're going somewhere, it's probably highly qualified. And so we're seeing that it's just a much higher conversion rate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:18):\nWow, this is so interesting, and it makes sense. People trust ChatGPT to tell them the answer, and if you are the answer, you have so much advantage. Like that is what people want to know, and then, \"Okay. Cool, thank you. I'm going to go check this out.\"\n\n(00:15:35):\nThis all just makes sense. Going back to the three levers you shared, essentially it's the things that you see work in driving you showing up more in these answer engines, landing pages, YouTube videos and Reddit. Is that right?\n\nEthan Smith (00:15:49):\nThose are some of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:49):\nOkay.\n\nEthan Smith (00:15:51):\nThe other things, so I would break it up into stuff on your site, onsite and offsite. So onsite would be traditional SEO. The difference would be this long tail. I would also say that the difference is lots of follow-up questions about does your product do this thing? What are the use cases, features, integrations, languages?\n\n(00:16:07):\nTell me about your product and really specific details about that and that's on your site. And then the second group would be offsite, which is show up in all the citations. Citations are comprised of video, UGC like Reddit and Quora, affiliates.\n\n(00:16:23):\nDotdash Meredith is showing up all over the place, Glamour, Good Housekeeping, it's like getting mentioned there, blogs, so it's those two groups.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:33):\nAnd that all sounds very similar to SEO showing up on other people's pages. Showing links from, say, Reddit is always great.\n\n(00:16:41):\nIt's interesting that Reddit is such a big deal. What's going on there do you think?\n\nEthan Smith (00:16:45):\nOkay, Reddit is one of the most interesting things. It's hugely cited in LLMs. And it's probably the number one thing people are asking, customers are asking me is, \"How do we optimize for Reddit?\" And this goes back to the head of ChatGPT's question about, \"Please don't spam my product.\"\n\n(00:17:06):\nAnd so Reddit is a community where it's real opinions from people, authentic, and it's heavily managed by the community and the community is very good at managing it. And so the obvious strategy for a growth person is, \"Let's make a bunch of automated spam and spam Reddit all over the place and get my product to show up everywhere.\"\n\n(00:17:27):\nThat's the growth mindset, which makes sense, the hustle mindset. So what are people looking at? They're looking at creating hundreds of fake Reddit accounts pretending to be someone that you're not. I have a single person, I'm going to make 100 Reddit accounts. I'm going to autopost comments and then like my own comments.\n\n(00:17:46):\nAnd then build a trust score, and then shout, say everywhere that my product is the best product. Fortunately, that doesn't work very well, but that's the obvious strategy. And so we're seeing people trying to do that and then we're also seeing those accounts get banned, those comments get deleted. And so we're seeing people trying to spam and being unsuccessful, so that's one strategy.\n\n(00:18:05):\nThe other strategy is the whole purpose of Reddit is to post useful, high-quality, authentic comments from real people. So at Webflow, we have a couple of people at Webflow going to comments and saying, \"This is my name, this is where I work, and here's a useful piece of information.\" So the strategy is find a thread that is a part of a citation that you want to show up in.\n\n(00:18:30):\nSay who you are, say where you work, and then give a useful piece of information, and that works really well. And that sounds simple if you're not in the growth mindset of, \"I need to scale this to hundreds of comments.\" But you don't actually need 10,000 comments, even five could be great and that scales perfectly well.\n\n(00:18:47):\nSo the Reddit strategy is the obvious strategy, which is just to be an actual user of Reddit. Make an account, say who you are, say where you work, and give a useful answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:56):\nWe had the early-growth leader from Deel, D-E-E-L, on the podcast a while ago. And this is how they grew initially, before AI even came around, just going big on Reddit and answering people's questions.\n\n(00:19:07):\nAnd like, \"Hey, happens to be Deel. Can I help you with this problem?\" So that's interesting. It's so interesting that Reddit is what is keeping ChatGPT from being spammed with stuff. It's not that ChatGPT is stopping the spam, its Reddit is just really good at that.\n\nEthan Smith (00:19:23):\nI think that in a sense, ChatGPT is policing because ChatGPT is running a search, it's finding citations. There's a search algorithm that's trying to select which citations are useful. There are people at ChatGPT who are tuning their search algorithm to select which sources they trust.\n\n(00:19:40):\nI'm sure that there's a search evaluation team saying, \"Do I like these citations, yes, no? Is Reddit showing up? I want it to show up.\" So I think that there are actual people at ChatGPT who are intentionally configuring their algorithm to use Reddit because it's trusted. And if it wasn't trusted, they wouldn't use it.\n\n(00:19:57):\nSame with Google. Google has specifically configured their search algorithm to rank Reddit and Twitter and Quora, because they want user-generated content. And if it wasn't good content, then they would change the algorithm and they wouldn't rank it. So I think that they are policing it in a sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:13):\nGot it. And all of this is post-training, search-oriented features of these models. It's not data they are trained on, is that right?\n\nEthan Smith (00:20:24):\nI would assume that so there's the core model and then there's RAG. So the core model is I'm looking at common crawl on billions of web pages, and then I'm retraining the model. And if you ask something like, \"What's the capital of California?\" It predicts the next word, which is Sacramento. And that's based on the core algorithm, which is next-word prediction.\n\n(00:20:44):\nThen there's RAG and RAG basically means search, retrieval-augmented generation. So I'm going to do a search and then I'm going to summarize the search. There are these two different things. And so most of what I'm describing is about the RAG piece, not the core model piece. To influence the core model is probably extremely hard and maybe you'll see the impact a year later.\n\n(00:21:03):\nAnd it's probably something, some sort of obscure thing that nobody would want to do, like make a million pages that say, \"Best product for X is brand.\" Which I don't think most people want to spend their time on. So I'm mostly focused on the RAG side, because that's the main thing that's controllable.\n\n(00:21:18):\nAnd I think also the LLM is probably not going to say your product if it didn't show up anywhere on the RAG. So I think that's where most of the interesting stuff is from an optimization perspective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:27):\nCool. Yeah. I didn't even think about this side of it when we started talking about this, but I think that's an important thing to note, is just this has nothing to do with the training data.\n\n(00:21:34):\nThis is post-training, once the model's live, what it can do to find recent information using RAG, web search, things like that. Okay. Before we get into how to actually do this step-by-step, how to win at AEO.\n\n(00:21:48):\nWhat are two or three things that you think are important for people to understand to be successful in this world just broadly?\n\nEthan Smith (00:21:54):\nFirst thing is just recognizing that this is related to search. So it's LLM plus RAG, it's summarizing a set of search results usually. So LLM plus RAG, number one. Number two is topics. So in search, a landing page is targeting hundreds of keywords, which we talked about on the last podcast.\n\n(00:22:12):\nSo I'm not targeting one keyword like I was in 2007, I'm targeting 1,000 keywords, and each landing page needs to target that set of 1,000 keywords, and that's a topic. Same thing is true for Answer Engine Optimization. Each page is targeting hundreds, thousands, maybe tens of thousands of questions.\n\n(00:22:28):\nAnd so I want to group all those questions, which then brings us into content, so how would I rank? How would I get my URL to rank? Or how are other URLs being decided whether or not they rank? Then answer all the questions. The more of the questions that I answer, the better.\n\n(00:22:42):\nSo in Google Search, if I have a landing page about website builders, the more that my page answers all of the subtopic, follow-up questions, the more likely I am to show up in Google Search. Same with chat, the more you answer all the questions, the better. If you don't answer a question, then you're probably not going to show up.\n\n(00:22:57):\nAnd if you answer a follow-up question and subtopic somebody else is not answering, you're going to be more likely to show up. So topics, number two. The third is question research, so how do I know which questions people are asking? And that's actually pretty hard, because in search, Google just tells you what their ads API.\n\n(00:23:15):\nThey say, \"This is the search volume for this keyword.\" There's a truth set from Google and ChatGPT is not giving us that, at least not yet. Maybe when they do ads, they'll give us more access to search volume, but there's no truth set. So how do we know the questions that people are asking?\n\n(00:23:31):\nOne way would just be to take all my search terms and change them into questions. So website builder, you can assume that what's the best website builder is probably a question that's probably asked proportional to the search volume for that keyword, so that's one.\n\n(00:23:44):\nBut then I mentioned that the tail is larger, and there's parts of the tail that don't exist in search. So how do we know what the tail looks like? And one strategy that you can use, is what are all the questions people are asking you on your sales calls, customer support on Reddit?\n\n(00:24:02):\nMine all those questions that exist somewhere else. Probably those same questions are being asked in chat, so that's another way to find questions. The last is citation optimization or offsite. So again, the LLM is summarizing RAG. So how do we show up with as many citations as possible?\n\n(00:24:21):\nAnd you can break up the citations into different groups, my site, video, YouTube, Vimeo, UGC, Quora, Reddit. Tier-one affiliates like Dotdash, tier-two affiliates, blogs. So it's breaking up all those different citations and having specific strategies for each group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nWhat is Dotdash exactly?\n\nEthan Smith (00:24:42):\nDotdash Meredith is a large media conglomerate with Good Housekeeping, Allrecipes, Investopedia. It's probably the most successful SEO company of all time.\n\n(00:24:53):\nAnd it's also one of the most cited, probably the most cited in LLMs as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:59):\nWow, did not know this. As you talk, I think about if you go to Google, no offense, Mr. SEO, but if you go to Google these days, it's just like a bunch of unuseful stuff, just like this hyper SEO'ed content.\n\n(00:25:12):\nDo you think ChatGPT will be able to avoid that fate where it's just a bunch of hyper SEO'ed content that is not what you actually want?\n\nEthan Smith (00:25:19):\nProbably. And what you're saying with SEO is that everyone's rewriting each other's content, nonexperts rewriting each other's content. So I get a content-scoring tool, which then looks at all the results in Google and it says, \"These are all the things that the other articles are saying. And then this is what you haven't said yet, so here are recommendations for how to be more typical.\"\n\n(00:25:40):\nAnd then everyone rewrites each other's article. And then one other interesting thing is that the majority of landing pages drive no impact. So we did an analysis where one out of 20 landing pages drive roughly 85% of all your traffic. So 19 out of 20 landing pages drive little to no traffic, which means if I want to get ROI, I need to spend a small amount of money on a large number of pages.\n\n(00:26:06):\nAnd so then you get a nonexpert to say, \"Rewrite this other person's article,\" because that's cheaper than hiring someone from The New York Times to write your article about what's the best payroll management software? But if you knew the few things that would work, the few landing pages that would work, and you wrote them really well, then you could push all that money to that one page, which is what we try to do.\n\n(00:26:28):\nBut right now it's people rewriting each other's content, so Google has not solved that yet. That's probably a very hard problem to solve. Will they ever solve that? Probably. Will ChatGPT ever solve that? Probably. How I would solve that would be, one concept would be information gain. So did you say something that somebody else didn't say? Two is how typical are you?\n\n(00:26:50):\nAre you so typical that I think that you're a rewritten version of somebody else's content? Potentially, Google has EEAT, expertise, authority, trustworthiness, which actually I don't see having an effect unfortunately, but it could. And I could say, \"Well, this person's an expert, this person's a certified financial advisor, rank them higher.\"\n\n(00:27:08):\nAnd I'm actually not seeing that, but they could increase the weight of that. So these are all potential solutions, but I'm sure that the reason why it has not been solved yet and why everyone's rewriting each other's articles. It's probably just hard to build an algorithm to solve that, but will they ever solve that? Probably.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:23):\nThis algorithm or heuristic you just shared is so interesting, because it's helpful for just what is good content, say, with a newsletter or a podcast? Info gain, and is it typical?\n\n(00:27:34):\nAre you adding something new to the conversation and is this unique? I think it's a really good strategy for just producing great newsletters and podcasts and all the content in the world.\n\nEthan Smith (00:27:45):\nYes. And ideally, did you do original research and do you have some domain expertise? And did you mention that in the content?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:51):\nThis is a great heuristic for just content in general, which is exactly what you want these algorithms to be looking for, so the alignment is there.\n\n(00:27:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Great Question, the all-in-one UX research platform loved by teams at Brex, Canva, Intuit and more. One of the most common things I hear from PMs and founders that I talk to is, \"I know I should be speaking to customers more, but I just don't have the time or the tools.\" That's exactly the gap Great Question fills.\n\n(00:28:18):\nGreat Question makes it easy for anyone on your team, not just researchers, to recruit participants, run interviews, send surveys, test prototypes, and then share it all with powerful video clips. It's everything you need to put your customers at the center of your product decisions. With a prompt as simple as, \"Why did users choose us over competitors?\"\n\n(00:28:35):\nGreat Question not only reveals what your customers have already shared, but it also makes it incredibly easy to ask them in the moment for fresh insights from the right segment. Picture this, your roadmap's clear, your team's aligned, you're shipping with confidence, and you're building exactly what your customers need. Head to greatquestion.com/Lenny to get started.\n\n(00:28:56):\nLet's give people an actual, actionable plan to start executing on this and winning essentially at AEO. If it's helpful to use my newsletter as an example, how would I show up more often on ChatGPT or Gemini or whatever? Or if it's a B2B SaaS company, whatever's easiest, let's just talk about how to actually do this.\n\nEthan Smith (00:29:12):\nFirst, I would figure out which questions I want to rank for. How I would figure out which questions I want to rank for, I would take my search data. I would maybe take my paid search data, like, \"What are my money terms? What are my competitors' money terms?\" So if I'm rippling, what is deal.com bidding all their paid search on?\n\n(00:29:30):\nThen I would transform those into questions. And actually you can just give those keywords to ChatGPT and say, \"Make these into questions,\" and it does a pretty good job. So take your competitors' paid search data or mine or your own, put it in ChatGPT, get the questions. That's step one. Step two is then track them, so put them in an AEO tracker, in an answer tracker.\n\n(00:29:51):\nThird thing would be who is showing up as citations? And then have a strategy for each of those different groups of citations. The third would be make your own landing pages. So what are the kinds of landing pages that are appearing? Is it a listicle? Is it a category page? Is it an article, tool page? Figure out what page type that seem to be showing up the most, and then you make your own page for that.\n\n(00:30:14):\nHow do you have your page rank? Answer all the follow-up questions. So what are all the follow-up questions that someone might ask? You could go back to your search data and look for groups and themes of your keywords that are in your SEO topic. Same thing for AEO topic. Then on the offsite, so different strategies for each of those groups.\n\n(00:30:37):\nAnd I would say that depending on the company, paying an affiliate to mention you, that's pretty easy if you have the money. So if you want to be the best credit card, you pay Forbes and then you're the best credit card. So that's strategy one, expensive, easy, controllable. The YouTube, Vimeo strategy is also actually pretty easy because there's no community saying, \"I don't like your YouTube video.\"\n\n(00:30:59):\nYou make a YouTube video, you do whatever you want. Maybe people view it, maybe they don't, but you can make a YouTube video or a Vimeo video. And the interesting thing with this, especially for B2B, is that YouTube, Vimeo, other video sites, the kinds of things people make videos for are food, traveling, fun, beauty.\n\n(00:31:18):\nThere's not that many videos about AI-powered payment processing APIs, as interesting as that is, but it's a great money turn. So if you make a video for these really specific, high-LTV, maybe nonglamorous keywords, questions, topics, that's actually a big opportunity. Then Reddit, so I mentioned with Webflow what we did, which is just make a Reddit account, say who you are, say where you work and give a useful answer.\n\n(00:31:48):\nThat one is a little bit trickier because the community might say, \"I don't like your answer.\" So you can't guarantee that your comment is there, but it is easy, so I would do that group. Oh, and then experiment design, experiment design and seeing what works. So SEO and AEO are both interesting in that the majority of the information and best practices are not correct.\n\n(00:32:13):\nAnd the reason why is because people don't do analysis. Somebody will say something and then it will get repeated, and then it becomes best practice and no one ever did an analysis. So you did all the stuff that I just mentioned. Do an experiment and see if it worked. Maybe half the stuff I said works, maybe half it doesn't. Do your own experiment.\n\n(00:32:32):\nMost best practices, most blog posts are not correct. So how do you set up an experiment? You get your questions, you turn tracking on, give it a couple of weeks. Make your changes, have a test group, have a control group. Intervene on the test group, make your changes, see if the chart went up, see if the control group did not, and now you know your particular strategy worked.\n\n(00:32:55):\nSo I would definitely do experiments and I would not assume that stuff you read online is correct. And then you need a team, so who's your team? Probably your team is your SEO team, or your SEO agency or your SEO consultant. Probably, hopefully they can do this stuff, and then however, what I think is hard to hire for is the offsite stuff.\n\n(00:33:16):\nSo most SEO people are not going to be amazing at creating YouTube videos and Reddit strategy, so you might need a different person for that. That might be a community generalist marketing person. So it would basically be your SEO team, \"Please now do Answer Engine Optimization.\" And then marketing community team, \"Please help me show up in more citations.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:35):\nWow, okay. That is incredibly valuable. Thank you for sharing all that. I imagine some of this is you're just giving away a lot of amazing advice for free here. Thank you. First of all, I imagine there's a layer, there's only so far you can go on your own.\n\n(00:33:49):\nAnd so eventually it's like, \"Okay, we really need help.\" And that's where a team like yours comes in. Let me ask a few questions here to follow up. One is this tracker concept. So what is this tracker, it can track how often you show up? Say Lenny's Newsletter shows up and answers for the questions that I'm targeting?\n\nEthan Smith (00:34:03):\nYeah, so there's answer tracking, which is like keyword tracking. So keyword tracking would be best growth podcast, and you put that in a keyword tracking tool. There's 100 of them, they're all the same, and you see whether or not what you rank. Maybe you rank, hopefully you rank number one. Now in answers it's very different, but it's related.\n\n(00:34:25):\nSo if you ask the same question, you will have different answers each time. If you ask a question, there's different answers per run. And so ChatGPT is basically calculating a distribution of all the potential answers it would give. And depending on when you ask it, it's basically like a weighted, random sample, and so you're going to get different answers.\n\n(00:34:46):\nYou also have question variants, so you can ask different versions of the same question, and you might show up in one and you might not show up in another. Then there's different surfaces, there's Perplexity, there's Gemini, there's ChatGPT, there's Meta AI, and so these surfaces have different answers.\n\n(00:35:00):\nAnd so you essentially need to create a share of voice across all these different things like a distribution. So how often am I showing up? What's my average rank? And that's answer tracking. So then where do you get answer tracking? And answer tracking is essentially an evolution of keyword tracking. So we have a page with 60 different answer tracking tools.\n\n(00:35:22):\nBut it's ultimately just like keyword tracking, it's all the same thing roughly. And so pick one of the 60, we have answer tracking, we're building answer tracking. There's 59 other options, probably all pretty good, probably all pretty similar, but pick one. My general suggestion is pick the cheapest one that does what you need.\n\n(00:35:41):\nJust like keyword tracking, you can only, there's not a premium version of keyword tracking. You rank number three or you don't. So pick the keyword tracker that is the cheapest that does what you want. Same with the answer tracking. And so then when I'm doing the experiment, put your answers in, track them, see a chart over time, see your average rank.\n\n(00:35:58):\nHow often are you showing up and what's your average rank? And then you make a change, and then hopefully you go up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:03):\nAmazing. I love this term voice share. I never heard that before, it makes sense. Like percentage of time you're showing up in LLMs, is there an LLM, is it just like ChatGPT?\n\n(00:36:13):\nIs Google equivalent now to ChatGPT? How do you recommend people think about, say, Gemini or Claude, or Perplexity and others?\n\nEthan Smith (00:36:21):\nSo interestingly, there are similar, foundational algorithms across all of these. They're all using search, they're all using search, and they're all using LLMs, which foundational algorithms are all the same. The results are actually pretty different. So we're doing a study, we're seeing that Google and Bing are not that similar search engines.\n\n(00:36:41):\nWe're seeing that ChatGPT citations and Google Search results are actually not that similar. Perplexity is interestingly more similar to Google than ChatGPT. We did a study looking at thousands of questions and saw the citation overlap with Google Search results was around 35% for ChatGPT and Google, so not that much.\n\n(00:37:02):\nPerplexity was around 70%, but essentially they're all similar algorithms, but with very different citations and results. So then look at which surfaces have the most traffic and then track those. You probably don't need to track all of them, but look across all those.\n\n(00:37:17):\nBut you do need to look at your share of voice or the percent of time you show up across all these surfaces. You need to ask the question multiple times, and you need to ask the variance of the question to truly know how frequently you're showing up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:28):\nConsidering that ChatGPT, they're going to hit something like a billion weekly active users in the near future, do you need to worry about Claude and Gemini and Perplexity?\n\n(00:37:39):\nIs the traffic there meaningful? I know it is a lot of people, but how important is it to focus on those other LLMs?\n\nEthan Smith (00:37:45):\nWell, the way that I would answer that is I believe AOL was one of the largest search engines early on and Google was not. And so we could ask in 1999 or whatever, \"Should we just focus on AOL search and Yahoo search? Do we really need to worry about Google?\" And the answer is we don't actually know.\n\n(00:38:04):\nIt's very early, we don't know who's going to win. I do think that ChatGPT for sure is going to be large. Will Perplexity or Claude or these others compete with them? Probably. Just like search, I think that there will probably be multiple winners and probably you'll need to optimize for several.\n\n(00:38:18):\nI don't think that you'll need to optimize for 10, but there'll probably be around three or so that will win that you want to optimize for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:26):\nOkay. By the way, I want to make it clear, I love Claude. I use Claude and ChatGPT equally, roughly. I didn't want to make it sound like ChatGPT is the only product people use.\n\n(00:38:34):\nOkay. How does this strategy change depending on the kind of company you are? Say you're a B2B SaaS company or a consumer product, does anything in these seven steps change significantly?\n\nEthan Smith (00:38:44):\nLet's take B2B, for example. The first thing is that the citations that are being mentioned are going to be quite different. So citation optimization will vary quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nJust to clarify what you just said, what do you mean when you say citation strategy is different?\n\nEthan Smith (00:38:57):\nMeaning the citations that show up for B2B versus marketplaces are different kinds of citations. So for B2B, it might be like TechRadar shows up a ton when I ask questions. I've never read TechRadar, but for some reason it shows up all the time. I'm sure it's great. But TechRadar is showing up a ton for B2B for whatever reason.\n\n(00:39:19):\nIn commerce, it's not going to be that, it's going to be Glamour and Cosmopolitan. For marketplaces, it'll be Eater and Yelp, TripAdvisor, places like that, so the kinds of citations that show up are different. Most of the stuff that I've been talking about is specific to B2B stuff that's different for commerce.\n\n(00:39:38):\nSo for most B2B questions, the answers are not clickable. There's nothing to click on. And so if you actually want to measure the impact, you cannot just look at last-touch referral traffic. You have to see whether or not you showed up in the answer with tracking. And then you also need to ask the user, \"How did you hear about us post-conversion to actually know the impact?\"\n\n(00:40:00):\nSo it's harder to track for B2B. Also for B2B, you're probably deciding which payroll management software to use after 50 touchpoints. With a brand, it's not going to be you just search for something, you suddenly spent $100,000 on payroll management software. So that's B2B. Commerce is different, so Commerce actually now has more clickable cards like you would in a Google.\n\n(00:40:21):\nSo if you ask, \"What's the best TV for apartments?\" There are actual shoppable cards. Those shoppable cards are showing multiple sellers. Those sellers have rich snippets. Schema is important, the number of reviews are important, so it's actually quite different. You can look at last-touch referral traffic to get a good sense about the number of conversions that you're getting.\n\n(00:40:44):\nFor commerce, similar with restaurants and hotels and local marketplaces, similar there. And then I would say early stage is also different. So I mentioned earlier, early stage my recommendation is don't do SEO at all. For Answer Engine Optimization, definitely do AEO, and only do citation optimization and long tail. Don't do any of the mid-SEO stuff, just get cited and answer really specific questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:12):\nIt's so interesting that so much of this is just showing up as the little tag/pill in the answer, because it's obvious now that I think about it.\n\n(00:41:21):\nThat's the only way someone will get to your site from an LLM is just clicking that, \"Okay, let me go read this article.\"\n\nEthan Smith (00:41:27):\nYes. But what they will do is they will open a new tab, and they will type in the brand name and they'll go to Google.\n\n(00:41:33):\nAnd then they'll click on your domain, and you will think that it was a branded Google Search when it wasn't.\n\n(00:41:38):\nOr they'll open up a new tab and they will type in your domain, and they'll go directly to your domain and you'll falsely think that it was direct traffic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:46):\nComing back to a question you raised at the beginning. So for my newsletter, the fact that they're sucking up all this content, I don't even know how much, and sending me some percent of traffic.\n\n(00:41:55):\nDo you have any, I don't know, just sense of is this good? If you were running my newsletter, would you encourage all these outlets to suck up my stuff? And then be like, \"Oh yeah, you could check it out in Lenny's Newsletter if you want\"?\n\nEthan Smith (00:42:08):\nYes. And I would give the same answer that Brian Balfour gave on your previous episode on this, which is that it's not your choice whether to play the game. You are playing the game whether you want to or not, so you might as well try to show up. If you just say, \"Don't look at any of my data,\" then you cannot show up and your competitors will.\n\n(00:42:27):\nNow, what you can do is you can say, \"I don't want you to train on my data, so you can index my site, but please don't train on my data.\" And they have different user agents for that and different bots, so you can just say, \"And we're building a Webflow app to block training but not indexation.\"\n\n(00:42:43):\nOr you can just put it in your robots.txt, \"This training bot not allowed. Index bot, you are allowed.\" So if you're concerned about that, I would suggest that, and I think probably a lot of people will do that. But saying, \"You can't index my site at all,\" that doesn't make sense to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:57):\nSuch a good point, because I don't know if I have competitors in this exact space, but basically they would show up instead and then I lose all that traffic.\n\nEthan Smith (00:43:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):\nSuch a good point. Okay. Let me come back to the steps you shared just to see if there's something here that's worth diving into a little further. So this is essentially how to be more successful showing up in LLM responses. One is figure out what questions you want to rank for.\n\n(00:43:19):\nAnd you could do this by looking at what your competitors are advertising and their paid ads and things like that. Just look at the terms, ask almost ChatGPT or Claude, \"Turn these into questions people would ask to find these terms.\" Then set up a tracker to see just how you're doing today. How often are you showing up?\n\n(00:43:36):\nThere's a million trackers, you have a link willing to check these out. Then you look at who is showing up today? Where are they being taken today? Use that to inform landing pages that you create to answer those questions better. And you make it very clear that it's very important not to just answer that main question, but also follow-up questions. Then there's offsite stuff.\n\n(00:43:57):\nSo get into affiliates like Dotdash, YouTube, Reddit, Quora sounds like are the core, and then run an experiment. So you look at this tracker, and let me actually ask this, and the next step is just set up a team. But just to come back to this step, how do you set up an experiment that isn't just like a before, after? How do you do a control group situation?\n\nEthan Smith (00:44:19):\nYeah. So what I would do is I would take 100 different questions, half of them I will intervene, half of them I won't. Or let's say, let's take 200 questions. So 100 of the questions, I'm not going to do anything, so that's my control group. And we are seeing a fair amount of variance and answers just without doing anything at all, so you definitely want a control group.\n\n(00:44:40):\nAnd also we're seeing people are using LLMs more and LLM traffic is going up. So you definitely need a control group, especially in Answer Engine Optimization. So control group is, \"Don't touch it at all, leave it as it is.\" That's the control group. Test group would be, \"I'm going to now comment on Reddit threads, so let's test that.\"\n\n(00:44:57):\nOr I'm now going to make a YouTube, Vimeo video, or I'm now going to pay Forbes advisor to say that I'm the best credit card. Maybe break those up into a few different buckets, track them. Have a couple of weeks before, a couple of weeks after, compare against the control group.\n\n(00:45:11):\nAnd then the stuff that went up when the control group did not worked, and the stuff that didn't did not, and then reproduce it. So reproducibility is very important. And my background's in academic research, and it's common to do a study that cannot be reproduced. And so for something to truly be accepted with an academian, it needs to be reproducible.\n\n(00:45:34):\nMeaning multiple people have done this study and reproduced that thing over and over again. And especially in SEO, it's common for something to change. And you think that it was this thing that caused it and it's actually not, and you just assume forever that that works. So reproducibility is very important.\n\n(00:45:49):\nTry to do that study multiple times, try to get studies from other people, and if it works 10 times, then it probably works. And this comes back to the waste problem, most work is wasted in SEO. Most work is wasted in AEO, so how do you know what's not wasted? You do an experiment, you don't assume that what you read online is true.\n\n(00:46:07):\nYou do your own experiment, and then you reproduce it multiple times, and keep doing the stuff that works and don't do the stuff that doesn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):\nIt feels like such a big deal to win at AEO. Just coming back to this idea that people are coming to ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini looking for an answer.\n\n(00:46:25):\nIf you're that answer, I feel like that could just make or break your company. It feels like even more important than SEO, just getting this right.\n\nEthan Smith (00:46:33):\nI would say that where I want to get the most conversions possible, how big is the channel? The channel is not as big as search. The search is definitely larger, but it is a substantial channel now. And Webflow, they get 8% of those signups from LLMs.\n\n(00:46:50):\nIt's now one of your top channels so it's large. It's not the largest channel, it's not the number one channel. Paid is probably the number one channel, but it's definitely a substantially large channel and one worth optimizing for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:02):\nAnd as you said, probably growing over time.\n\nEthan Smith (00:47:04):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:05):\nOkay. Let me zoom out a little bit, and let me just ask you this.\n\n(00:47:08):\nWhat do you think are maybe the most surprising or underdiscussed topics when it comes to AI and SEO and AEO that we haven't already talked about?\n\nEthan Smith (00:47:18):\nThe first thing is that there's significant misinformation on AI and on AEO, and it's pretty extreme. It's unusually the percent of misinformation to correct information is pretty substantial. So one example is every two years there's news articles about how Google Search is going to die or it is dying because there's a new thing.\n\n(00:47:42):\nSo that's happening right now with AI Overviews and with AEO, Google's going down, which is not true. Before that it was TikTok search, so everyone is using TikTok now. Gen Z is using TikTok, they're never going to use SEO. SEO's going to be dead, and so you really need to focus on TikTok search, which is not false. It's not untrue, but it's not taking share away from Google, it's just a new surface.\n\n(00:48:05):\nAnd then before that it was Instagram, and then before that it was Facebook and it was YouTube. And people do search and discover on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, but it doesn't take away from Google Search. It adds on top of it. These are all new channels, so Google's slice of the pie stays the same, the pie gets bigger.\n\n(00:48:23):\nAnd so misinformation about Google going down, Google is not going down. Google published something recently, their VP of search explicitly said, \"I looked at the traffic that we're sending to publishers, and it is not down, it's up slightly.\" So it is not true that Google Search is going down.\n\n(00:48:37):\nAnd most of the news information about that is saying that it's going down, so that's the first surprising thing. The second surprising thing is tooling. And I've never seen a channel where these extremely expensive tools that essentially do commodity tasks. So imagine if I said, \"I'm going to charge you $50,000 for keyword tracking.\"\n\n(00:48:59):\nYou would say, \"Well, of course, that's absurd. It's keyword tracking, I could write this in a day.\" No one would do that. But for answer engines, it's mysterious and people don't really know how it's working. Also, the slope of the growth curve is so significant, that I'm seeing people spend huge amounts of money on what are essentially keyword tracking commodities.\n\n(00:49:19):\nSo that's the second thing. The third thing is the growth curve of the channel. And we did a Reforge AEO webinar a year ago, and there was excitement and then it died and there was very little excitement about it. This was in June, and then people didn't really care. They were intrigued intellectually by it, but they didn't care because they didn't see the impact from that.\n\n(00:49:40):\nSo there was essentially very little interest between July and January, and then suddenly in January it's just skyrocketing. So it's ChatGPT launches, people are very interested, and then it's not that interesting for growth people. And then there's this little spike in June, and then it's like this, which is usually not what you see with a new channel.\n\n(00:50:01):\nSo the slope of the curve is unusually steep, and the shape of the curve is also very unusual. The last is that a lot of people do think that SEO and AEO are different and they're not different. I think probably part of that is because it sounds great to say that there's this new channel, it's completely different.\n\n(00:50:23):\nAnd I'm an expert and I have a tool to sell you, and it's totally unique and all these other tools are not relevant. In reality, it's actually there's quite a bit of overlap. There is the difference of the citation optimization. The head is different and the tail is different, but the core technology is pretty similar. So those are probably the most surprising things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:43):\nThis piece about January being the inflection point, you mentioned that it was because references started showing it more prominently. Is that the big change?\n\nEthan Smith (00:50:51):\nI think it's increase of adoption of LLMs by people, so it's just actually growing more and then the clickability. And I am seeing, you are seeing now this large increase of actual clicks.\n\n(00:51:02):\nProbably before you got no clicks, even if you showed up an answer, so the clickability of the answer has increased.\n\n(00:51:08):\nEspecially for things like commerce and local and hotels, because they have these rich modules where you can click on stuff and go somewhere, which was not true before. That and I think people are just using LLMs more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nEthan, let me just say, I'm learning so much from this conversation, what a fun thing. I could see, it's just clear how much you love this stuff, and just how nerdy and deep you get into it. And it's just fun to talk to someone that's so deep and knowledgeable about all these things, so thank you for sharing all this with us.\n\n(00:51:36):\nI'm going to go in a slightly different direction. There's this whole world of AI content, people generating content with AI, generating landing pages. Just like, \"Oh my God, SEO is never going to just generate all this stuff. AI is going to make all this stuff easier.\"\n\n(00:51:48):\nYou guys did a really big study on how that works, whether it's a good idea to generate content with AI. Can you just talk about what you learned from that, and how people should think about AI in generating content?\n\nEthan Smith (00:51:59):\nYes. So I remember when ChatGPT launched and Brian Balfour posted on LinkedIn, \"What do you people think that is going to happen from ChatGPT and AI?\" And my immediate response is spam, so just lots and lots of spam, especially SEO spam. And then there was a whole industry around AI-generated content, and I knew immediately that it wouldn't work.\n\n(00:52:20):\nAnd the reason why I knew it wouldn't work, and when I say AI-generated content, I mean automated content with no human-in-the-loop. So I think that the future of content is clearly AI-assisted. Clearly, you and I will be using AI to help us write, so it's not no AI at all, but it's not 100% generated with AI. I immediately knew that it wouldn't work.\n\n(00:52:38):\nWhy did I know that? I knew that because I created spam in 2007, and I knew what Google did about it and how, and I knew the exact same thing was going to happen. So what I did in 2007 is I and all the other shopping comparison people scraped all each other's content, reviews, chopped it up, scraped content, 100 million search pages, snippets, and it worked really well.\n\n(00:53:02):\nAnd then it stopped working, and then all those companies disappeared. I knew that was exactly what's going to happen with AI-generated content. And so from the beginning, I've not focused on AI-generated content. Many people have, but I don't know, so maybe it does work. There's lots of case studies about it working.\n\n(00:53:20):\nSo let's do the study, let's do an analysis. So we took, we looked at both Google and at ChatGPT where we took thousands of searches and thousands of questions, and we put those searches into Google Search. We put those questions into chat and the ChatGPT, and then we looked at the citations or the Google Search results. Then we looked at an AI detector.\n\n(00:53:43):\nSo we used Surfer SEO's AI detector. Now, when I tell people this, they say, \"Well, you can't detect AI.\" So then we evaluated the efficacy and the accuracy of the AI detector. So we did that by generating thousands of AI-generated articles and it was very predictive. And then we looked at real articles, we did that two different ways.\n\n(00:54:05):\nOne way is we write real articles, and the other is we took a random sample of 100,000 URLs from Common Crawl over the last five years. And then we looked at the AI detector before ChatGPT was launched, so it necessarily was content not created by a human. And then the false positive rate was around 8%, so basically the AI detector is very accurate.\n\n(00:54:29):\nSo we took that, then we ran it on the content. So then what we saw was around 10% to 12% of content in Google Search, and then ChatGPT or AI-generated, 90% are not. And we ran a correlation analysis showing the exact same thing. So we essentially did a very rigorous study showing that AI content does not work. AI-assisted content edited is great.\n\n(00:54:52):\nWe do that sometimes, other people do that, that is clearly the future of content. So that does work and should work and that's good, but purely 100% AI-generated does not work. So then the second thing that we did was we found that, this was unexpected, but we found that there's more AI-generated content on the internet than human-generated content.\n\n(00:55:13):\nSo back to the Common Crawl study, we looked at 100,000 different URLs over the past five years. And then you can see this curve where AI-generated is now higher than human-created. So there's more AI-generated content on the internet than human-generated content, which is disturbing. So then let's say that AI-generated content did work.\n\n(00:55:32):\nIf AI-generated content worked, then everyone would do it. Just like in 2007, shopping comparison sites, if I can scrape my content, why would I pay anyone to write it? I'll just scrape it from you and I'll chop it up. So then everyone will do that, and then it will go from most content is AI-generated to almost all of the content is AI-generated.\n\n(00:55:51):\nThen what will happen if that works, is that Google now becomes a search engine for ChatGPT responses. So if Google's a search engine for ChatGPT responses, there's no reason for Google to exist. Just go to ChatGPT, which is the exact same thing that happened in 2007.\n\n(00:56:04):\nGoogle said, \"I see all these shopping comparison search engines showing up in my search results. So I'm essentially a search engine for search engines.\" I should be showing the TV in my results. I shouldn't be showing other vertical search engines, so I'm going to get rid of them and I'm just going to go straight to the product.\n\n(00:56:23):\nThe same thing will be true for ChatGPT. Now for ChatGPT, let's say that ChatGPT ranks its own derivatives in its citations, so then you have this infinite loop of derivatives. So I go to ChatGPT, I say, \"Generate 10 articles.\" I put those articles into the citations and then I say, \"Summarize these citations that were derivative.\"\n\n(00:56:41):\nAnd then I keep on doing derivatives of derivatives, and then you have an infinite loop of derivatives, and now AI is summarizing itself. There's a paper about this called Model Collapse. So again, there's the core algorithm and then there's the RAG piece. So the core algorithm, a group did a study showing model collapse, which was what if you feed in AI derivatives into the model and train the core model on the derivatives?\n\n(00:57:06):\nAnd then what happened was you had all these problems, hallucinations, things break very quickly. Okay. So then we did a study on what if you feed derivatives into the RAG piece? So generate 10 derivatives, put that into RAG, summarize that. And then generate 10 more, and then summarize my summarizations, infinite loop of derivatives. What happens?\n\n(00:57:25):\nAnd so what happens is there's a wisdom of the crowd. The LLM is summarizing the opinion of many people. So if you ask a question like, \"What's the best flavor of ice cream?\" There's not one answer, there's thousands of opinions. So the LLM is summarizing these many, many opinions in this wisdom of the crowd.\n\n(00:57:40):\nAnd the wisdom of the crowd basically says that, \"If you take the average of a large group of people, their average response will be better than the best single individual in the group.\" And so it's better to have more diversity of opinions, wisdom of the crowd. So what happens to the infinite loop of derivatives? You essentially converge on one opinion.\n\n(00:58:00):\nSo if you ask, \"What's the best flavor of ice cream?\" It will eventually say, \"It's vanilla and it's only vanilla, and there's no other flavor of ice cream.\" And so that's a simple example, but if you feed in derivatives of derivatives into the model, you'll basically take the wisdom of the crowd.\n\n(00:58:15):\nAnd that will shrink and you'll have a single opinion on everything, which is really bad. So that's what happens if AI content, 100% unassisted AI content works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:25):\nI'm afraid of this world where everything is trained on AI, and AI is trained on AI and generating AI, and just like nothing is trusted. And I love how it's interesting just how much of these incentives are driving this.\n\n(00:58:36):\nIf ChatGPT was finding this valuable, this is what people do and then just goes off the rails. So there's just some team there that is keeping this from happening. How do you think this evolves?\n\n(00:58:46):\nIf you were them, what would you do over the next few years to keep things high quality and not drive these perverse incentives?\n\nEthan Smith (00:58:55):\nSo I would identify what the perverse incentives might be, and AI-generated content is one of them. The second thing is I think that LLMs and search are going to converge. And so you're seeing that with Google Search where they're having LLM, AI Overviews. You're seeing that with LLMs where they're incorporating maps and shopping carousels, and it's converging on search.\n\n(00:59:14):\nI think it'll converge on a single experience, so that's the first thing. Figure out what 2007 Ethan would do not to create spam and make sure that he doesn't do that, like AI-generated content or it's great content. That'd the second thing. And the third thing is there's all these other interesting features, use cases that LLMs can be great for.\n\n(00:59:33):\nSo LLMs could be great for remembering everything that you've ever asked. It could be good for personalizing stuff specifically to Lenny. One interesting use case that I think will eventually come would be, I say, \"Plan a trip to San Francisco,\" and decisions are made for you without any intervention. I have this wonderful EA named Jen.\n\n(00:59:51):\nAnd I say, \"Jen, I'm going to Miami. Please, just do everything for me,\" and she does everything for me. She knows me, she knows my preferences, she knows that I want a ocean view and I want a restaurant with music. She does all of that and I don't have to intervene. AI can essentially do that eventually, and that would do that because it would deeply understand you.\n\n(01:00:09):\nIt would remember everything about you. It would have context, it would have a reasoning, and then it would be able to make all these decisions without your intervention, which would be autonomous agents. So I think that that's also another very interesting place for someone like me to optimize for as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:25):\nYeah. I was just going to say, just imagine not even being told this is what you're choosing. Like, \"Oh, and go check out, subscribe to the best newsletter out there.\" And if you're out there, the good things will happen.\n\n(01:00:36):\nWow, what a wild world. Is there anything else that we haven't covered that you think would be helpful to folks that are trying to get better at this stuff? Try to take the first steps down this road of AEO?\n\nEthan Smith (01:00:49):\nYes, the most exciting topic, which is help center optimization and support.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):\nSweet.\n\nEthan Smith (01:00:54):\nSo I mentioned that people in chat are asking follow-up questions. They're looking for tools. Do you have this feature, this use case, this integration? And that frequently can be answered in help centers. Usually, you would not have an SEO team and say, \"We really want you guys to focus on the help center.\"\n\n(01:01:14):\nBut in chat, since there's all these questions about can you do this thing, can you fulfill my use case? A help center is actually a great place to do that, and so I think how can you optimize the help center? So number one is it's frequently on a subdomain. For whatever reason, subdomains don't work as well as subdirectories, so move it to a subdirectory, number one.\n\n(01:01:33):\nNumber two is make sure that you're cross-linking well. So usually you do not have optimized internal links, so link from help center page to help center page, make sure there's lots of cross-linking. The third is you probably have help center content about the head, but the tail you probably don't have any help center content for.\n\n(01:01:51):\nSo an example of this is I was looking for, I wanted to track our sales calls and look to see who was in the meeting and what the sentiment was. And I wanted to put that into Looker, so I said, \"Which meeting transcription tool integrates with Looker?\" And the answer is none of them, but you could use Otter because Otter has a Zapier integration.\n\n(01:02:15):\nYou could send a Zap of the meeting, put it into BigQuery, and then do Looker on top of that. But there wasn't a help center article about that because it's a very obscure use case, but it's not a zero use case. And so the tail, there's going to be a bunch of questions in the tail that you may not have help center articles for.\n\n(01:02:31):\nSo again, what are the questions in sales calls? What are the questions that you're seeing in customer support? Having pages for that, I might even open up to the community. Anyone can ask anything because the community will then fill on the tail and then answer those.\n\n(01:02:46):\nAnd again, in many cases there might be nobody talking about this at all. So you could be the only citation for this, and then win that tail of questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:55):\nAre there any help desk, I don't know, system software that are just making this easier yet? Or do you think that's an opportunity for, say, Zendesk or Intercom?\n\nEthan Smith (01:03:02):\nI think probably all of them should work perfectly well. I think that the only thing you need to do is cross-linking and subdirectory rather than subdomain, which probably most of them do. So I think that they should all work for free.\n\n(01:03:12):\nThat the main thing you would want to do would be, again, open it up to the community and make sure that you fill in the tail. But probably all those tools should be good for this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:19):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, Ethan. Are you ready?\n\nEthan Smith (01:03:24):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:25):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nEthan Smith (01:03:30):\nNumber one is Emotional Intelligence, and people talk about the concept of emotional intelligence, but there's actual research and psychology around that. I believe it was published in the '80s, but there's a really good book that summarizes the foundational research around emotional intelligence. And it's very useful when building relationships and communicating with people to understand their emotions. So that's the first one. And doing growth because growth is getting people to use your stuff. And so if you have frameworks to inform how people will use your things, then you can be a more effective growth person. Which brings me to my second book, which is Cialdini's Persuasion book. Robert Cialdini does a bunch of books around persuasion, but again, there's frameworks for how to persuade somebody to sign up, buy something. And so he breaks down his framework for that, and again, it's based on psychology. And I think especially in growth, there's all kinds of psychology research and behavioral economics research to inform tests.\n\n(01:04:25):\nAnd if you just read Thinking, Fast and Slow, Persuasion, Emotional Intelligence, you can basically take those frameworks and apply it to growth in all kinds of different ways. And then the last is How to Measure Anything. So How to Measure Anything is about measuring things that are not immediately obvious to measure.\n\n(01:04:42):\nThey give this example of they wanted to measure how good an orchestra conductor was and they could survey or they could see the number of standing ovations for each orchestra conductor. And the more standing ovations probably means it's this better one and that you don't need to survey people.\n\n(01:04:58):\nBut much of growth and business is things that are not immediately obvious for how to measure, but anything could be measured, and so that's my third record.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nIs there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEthan Smith (01:05:09):\nI don't really watch TV, but I watch two different groups of things. I watch really aggressive sports, so I really like Michael Jordan documentary, Last Dance. I like Lance Armstrong documentaries about how aggressive and confrontational he is, and I love watching UFC. I like extreme aggression and intensity. The other group of stuff that I like to watch are climbing documentaries.\n\n(01:05:34):\nSo anything that Alex Honnold, Jimmy Chan do, I watch all that, which is the exact opposite of aggressive sports. So it's zen, being present, slow-and-steady craftsmanship. But this is how I approach my work, which is extreme intensity and aggressiveness, and then the zen craftsmanship, being present.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:57):\nI love how this explains why people love working with you and why you're good at this, is like this competitiveness and also just the super nerdiness to get really knowledgeable about how this stuff works.\n\n(01:06:09):\nAnd then I didn't think about the zen element of it, just lik staying calm throughout it all.\n\nEthan Smith (01:06:13):\nFlow, flow state.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:15):\nFlow, what a funny microcosm of why you're so good at this.\n\nEthan Smith (01:06:19):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:19):\nOkay, I'm going to keep going. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEthan Smith (01:06:24):\nThis camera and this microphone. So I got a Sony mirrorless SLR, I forget which one. But, sorry, getting a mirrorless SLR with a wide-angle lens really transforms your video calls. And then I have this Shure microphone and I think it's like $180.\n\n(01:06:46):\nThis dramatically improves the quality of my video call. And I like to design things and you can design your video calls and you can make them amazing. You can have flowers in the background, over here, some sunflowers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):\nBeautiful.\n\nEthan Smith (01:07:00):\nSo my favorite products are my SLR camera that I use for video calls and my microphone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:07):\nYour background is quite exquisite and I didn't mention that, but it looks beautiful. Okay, two more questions.\n\n(01:07:13):\nDo you have a life motto that you find really useful in work or in life?\n\nEthan Smith (01:07:19):\nThere's the Outliers book about 10,000 hours. And the themes there are you don't have to be the smartest, you have to be sufficiently smart, number one. Number two is focused practice, so it's not just trying hard, it's doing it in an intentional, focused way. And the third thing is lots of practice, so no one can master anything because they're a genius.\n\n(01:07:44):\nThey master it because they spent a significant amount of time practicing and they practice in an intentional way. And so my motto is essentially a combination of those things, which is that I'm not going to necessarily win because my brain is the largest brain or that I tried the hardest.\n\n(01:08:00):\nIt's because I'm going to be the most intentional about my practice, and I'm going to be as intense as I possibly can be about that practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):\nOkay, final question. I'm curious if there's just like an SEO or even an AEO win, you're just most proud of?\n\n(01:08:15):\nThat you always think about, \"Wow, I can't believe I pulled that off. I can't believe the impact we had there\"?\n\nEthan Smith (01:08:19):\nI always liked the example of butter lettuce with MasterClass. Because MasterClass, when I was first working with them, they did not have nearly as much authority as Allrecipes and Martha Stewart. And I actually didn't know if I should take the project because I thought it might be too hard.\n\n(01:08:37):\nBut I did the project and it was hard, but we were able to rank really competitively and way better than I expected. And I think it's probably because of all these specific, little execution details. But butter lettuce was my favorite one, and I like butter lettuce, so I can search for butter lettuce and I can get a recipe on MasterClass.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:55):\nThat's amazing. I don't know if butter lettuce has been mentioned on this podcast before. Ethan, this was incredible. This was everything I was hoping it'd be.\n\n(01:09:03):\nI feel like we've just leveled up everyone's knowledge on what the hell is happening with SEO and AEO? Forget about GEO.\n\n(01:09:09):\nTwo final questions, where can folks find you if they want to potentially work with you guys? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEthan Smith (01:09:15):\nSo where you can find me, number one, is on LinkedIn. I spend lots of time on LinkedIn and I publish original, so we do original research. We have a whole research team hypothesizing and evaluating those hypotheses. So we publish, all the studies that I mentioned, we publish on our site and I publish them on LinkedIn.\n\n(01:09:33):\nSo follow me on LinkedIn, add me on LinkedIn, send me a message. LinkedIn, number one, and then number two is we have a blog which we call The 5%. So /5%, which stands for 5% of work, 5% of landing pages drive almost all the impact, so that's the theme. This is only useful stuff. So our blog at 5%, you could subscribe to our email and to our studies. And then how can people be useful to me?\n\n(01:09:58):\nSo I spent time thinking about this and there's two ways people can help me. The first way is that there's not that much research around what works in AEO, and I would love to know what people are testing and what the results are and what works. So people doing studies and publishing that are sending it to me, I would love as much analysis and research as possible, number one.\n\n(01:10:20):\nThen the second one is to help me on LinkedIn by commenting on my posts and on my comments. So you posted most recently the Brian Balfour episode, for which I wrote a long, thoughtful comment, and then I got about 25 likes and then I got responses to that. And so I've been commenting on other people's LinkedIn posts and I've been writing these long LinkedIn posts.\n\n(01:10:43):\nAnd when people comment, it boosts the engagement within LinkedIn and then I get mass distribution. So the more people and thoughtful comments, so not this is great, but a long, thoughtful comment that stimulates conversation. So if people comment on my posts, then I'm just going to blow up on LinkedIn and I might be as big as you someday.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:01):\nI love how tactical his ask is. It's something Bryan Johnson I noticed is really good at on Twitter, the longevity guy.\n\n(01:11:08):\nHe just replies to tweets in a really funny way and feels like that's a big growth channel for him. So I love that you have this in common with Bryan Johnson.\n\nEthan Smith (01:11:16):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:17):\nAlso, just to point people to your domain, graphite.io, is that the right domain?\n\nEthan Smith (01:11:21):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:21):\nAmazing. Ethan, thank you so much for sharing so much with us and for being here.\n\nEthan Smith (01:11:27):\nAbsolutely. It's good to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:29):\nBye, everyone.
