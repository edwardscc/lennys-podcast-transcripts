Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nWhat skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams, in particular?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:00:26):\nCreative thinking and you kind of want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. I think it's actually really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):\nWhat do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:00:46):\nWhen you taught the model, some of the self-knowledge of you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world, the model would get extremely confused.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nToday my guest is Karina Nguyen. Karina is an AI researcher at OpenAI where she helped build Canvas, tasks, the o1 chain-of-thought model and more. Prior to OpenAI, she was at Anthropic where she led work on post-training and evaluation for the Claude 3 models, built a document upload feature with 100K context windows and so much more. She was also an engineer at New York Times, was a designer at Dropbox and at Square. It's very rare to get a glimpse into how someone working on the bleeding edge of AI and LLMs operates and how they think about where things are heading. Canvas\n\n(00:01:31):\nIn our conversation, we talk about how teams that OpenAI operate and build products, what skills she thinks you should be building as AI gets smarter, how models are created, why synthetic data will allow models to keep getting smarter and why she moved from engineering to research after realizing how good LLMs are going to be at coding.

This episode is brought to you by Vanta. And I am very excited to have Christina Cacioppo, CEO and co-founder Vanta, joining me for this very short conversation.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:03:22):\nGreat to be here. Big fan of the podcast and the newsletter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:25):\nVanta is a longtime sponsor of the show, but for some of our newer listeners, what does Vanta do and who is it for?\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:03:32):\nSure. So we started Vanta in 2018. Focused on founders, helping them start to build out their security programs and get credit for all of that hard security work with compliance certifications like SOC 2 or ISO 27001 today, we currently help over 9,000 companies, including some startup household names like Atlassian, Ramp and LangChain start and scale their security programs and ultimately build trust by automating compliance, centralizing GRC, and accelerating security reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:04):\nThat is awesome. I know from experience that these things take a lot of time and a lot of resources and nobody wants to spend time doing this.\n\nChristina Cacioppo (00:04:10):\nThat is very much our experience, but before the company and to some extent during it. But the idea is with automation, with AI, with software, we are helping customers build trust with prospects and customers in an efficient way. And our joke, we started this compliance company so you don't have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:26):\nWe appreciate you for doing that.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:04:48):\nThank you so much, Lenny, for inviting me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:50):\nI'm very excited to have you here because not only are you working at the cutting edge of AI and LLMs, you're actually building the cutting edge of AI and LLMs. You recently launched this feature, which basically... the first agent feature of OpenAI. I also just did this survey, I don't know if you know about this. I did a survey of my readers and asked them what tools do you use every day in your work and most use? And ChatGPT was number one, above Gmail, above Slack, above anything else. 90% of people said they use ChatGPT regularly. \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:05:23):\nThat's quite good. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:23):\nIt's absurd. It wasn't around two years ago.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:05:25):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):\nAlso, we're recording this the week that OpenAI announced Stargate, which is this half trillion dollar investment in AI infrastructure. So there's just a lot happening constantly in AI and you have a really unique glimpse into how things are working, where things are going, how work gets done. So I have a lot of questions for you. I want to talk about how you operate and how you work at OpenAI, where you think things are going, what skills are going to matter more and less in the future, and also just where things are going broadly. So how does that sound?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:05:55):\nSounds great. Thank you so much. Yeah, I was extremely lucky to join early days Anthropic and learned a lot of things there. And I joined OpenAI around eight months ago. So, yeah, I'm excited to dive more in into-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:11):\nOkay, I'm going to definitely ask you about the differences between those, but I want to start more technical and just dive right in. I want to talk about model training. People always hear about models being trained, these big models, how much data takes, how long it takes, how much money toss it takes, how we're running out of data, which I want to talk about. Let me just ask you this question. What do you think people most misunderstand about how models are created?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:06:36):\nModel training is more an art than a science. And in a lot of ways we, as model trainers, think a lot about data quality. It's one of the most important things in model training is like how do you ensure the highest quality data for certain interaction model behavior that you want to create? But the way you debug models is actually very similar the way you debug software. So one of the things that I've learned early days at Anthropic was we've discovered especially this Claude 3 training, when you taught the model some of the soft-knowledge of, \"Hey, you actually don't have a physical body to operate in the physical world.\" But then at the same time you had data that taught the model some of the function calls, which is like, \"This is how you set the alarm.\"\n\n(00:07:30):\nAnd so the model would get extremely confused about whether it can set an alarm, but it doesn't have a body in the physical world. So it's like the model gets confused and sometimes it'll over accuse. So sometimes it says, \"Look, I don't know. Sorry, I cannot help you.\" And so there is always a balance trade off between how do you make the model to be more helpful for users, but also not being harmful in other scenarios. And so it's always about how do you make the model more robust and operate across a variety of diverse scenarios.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):\nThat is so funny. I never thought about that. Most of the data that it's trained on is kind of assuming it's like a human describing the world and how they operate. It assumes there's a body and you could do things, and the model is told you don't have a body.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:08:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:21):\nOkay. I want to talk a little bit about data while we're on this topic. I know you have strong opinions here. There's this meme that models are going to stop getting smarter because they're running out of data. They're trained in a large part on the internet and there's only one internet and they've already been trained on it, what more can you show them about the world? And there's this trend of synthetic data, this term synthetic data. What is synthetic data? Why do you think it's important? Do you think it's going to work?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:08:47):\nI think there are two questions here. We can unpack one at a time. But people say we are hitting the data wall. I think people think more in the terms of pre-trained large models that are trained on the entire internet to predict the next token. But what actually the model is learning during that process is actually how do you compress the compression algorithm here? The model learns to compress a lot of knowledge and it learns how to model the world. So the next prediction of the word, like, \"Teach me how to drive,\" basically. And you only have a few words that will match that, a car. So the model actually learns about the world in itself. So it's like it's modeling human behavior, sometimes it's modeling... And when you talk to pre-trained models which are very, very large, they're actually extremely diverse and extremely creative because you can talk to almost any Reddit user through a pre-trained model.\n\n(00:09:56):\nBut I think what's happening right now with new paradigm of o1 series is that the scaling in post-training itself is not hitting the wall. And that's because basically we went from raw data sets from pre-trained models to infinite amount of tasks that you can teach the model in the post-training world via reinforcement learning. So any task, for example, how to search the web, how to use the computer, how to write, wow, all sorts of tasks that you trying to teach the model all the different skills. And that's why we're saying there's no data wall or whatever, because there will be infinite amount of tasks and that's how the model becomes extremely super intelligent. And we are actually getting saturated in all benchmarks. \n\n(00:10:52):\nSo I think the bottleneck is actually in evaluations that we don't have all the frontier, like evals like, I don't know, GPQA, which is a Google-proof question answering, PhD level intelligence. The benchmark is getting to, I don't know, more than 60, 70%, which is what PhD gets. So it's literally hitting the wall in like evals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):\nI want to follow both those threads. So the first is on this idea of synthetic data. Is a simple way to understand it, that the models are generating the data that future models are trained on and you ask it to generate all these ways of doing stuff, all these tasks as you described, and then the newer models trained on this data that the previous model generated?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:11:39):\nSome tasks are synthetically curated. So this is an active research area is how can you synthetically construct new tasks with models to learn. Sometimes when you develop products, you get a lot of data from the product and user feedback and you can use that data too in this cross-training world. Sometimes you still want to use human data because actually some of the tasks can be really, really hard to teach. Experts only know certain knowledge about some chemicals or biological knowledge, so you actually need to tap into the experts' knowledge a lot. So yeah, I think to me synthetic data training is more for product... It's a rapid model iteration for similar product outcomes. And we can dive more into it, but the way we made Canvas and tasks and new product features for ChatGPT was mostly done by synthetic training.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:52):\nLet's actually get into that. That's really interesting. I want to talk about evals, but let's follow that thread. So talk about how this helped you create Canvas.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:12:56):\nSo when I first came to OpenAI, I really had this idea of, \"Okay, it would be really cool for ChatGPT to actually change the visual interface but also change the way it is with people.\" So going from being a chatbot to more of a collaborative agent, and the collaborator is a step towards more genetic systems that become innovators ultimately. And so the entire team of applied engineers, designers, products, research got formed in the air almost out of nothing. It's just like a collection of people who just got together and we rapidly started iterating with each other. \n\n(00:13:46):\nActually Canvas is one of the... I would say the first project at OpenAI, where researchers and applying engineers started working together from the very beginning of the product development cycle. And I think there's a lot of things that we have learned on the way, but I definitely came with the mindset of, \"We need to do a really rapid model situation such that it would be much easier for engineers to work with the latest model possible, but also learn from user feedback or early internal dog food. How do we improve the model very rapidly?\"\n\n(00:14:28):\nAnd it's really hard to kind of like figure out how people... when you deploy a product, how people would be able to use it. And so the way you synthetically train the model is physically figuring out what are the most core behaviors that you wanted the product feature to do. And for Canvas, for example, it came down to three main behaviors. It was how do you trigger Canvas for prompts like, \"Write me a long essay,\" when the user intention is mostly iterating over long documents? Or, \"Write me a piece of code,\" or when to not trigger Canvas for prompts like, \"Can you tell me more about President...\" I don't know, some of the general questions. So you don't want to trigger Canvas because the user intention is mostly getting answer, not necessarily iterate over the long document. \n\n(00:15:28):\nThe second behavior is how do we teach the model to update the document when the user asks? So one of the behaviors that we taught the model is actually have some agency and autonomy to literally go to the document and select specific sections and either delete it or edit, so highlight it and rewrite certain sections. Sometimes the user would just say, \"Change the second paragraph to be something friendlier,\" and we would have to teach the model to literally find the second paragraph in the document and change it to a friendly tone. So basically you teach both how to trigger edit itself, but also how do you teach the model to get higher quality edit for the document?\n\n(00:16:21):\nIn case of coding, for example, there's also the question of how good the model is of completely rewriting the document, versus having a very specific target edits. So that's another layer of decision boundary within edit itself is, \"Let's select the entire document and rewrite completely, or do you want to have a very targeted custom behavior.\" And when we first launched the model, we would bias the model towards more rewrites because we saw the quality of the rewrites were much higher. But over time you are shifting based on user feedback and what you're learning from iterative deployment.\n\n(00:17:02):\nLastly, the third behavior that we taught synthetically the model is how to make comments on any document. So the way we used that is we would use o1 model to seem a way of user conversation, let's say like, \"Write me a document about XYZ.\" But then we used o1 to produce the document and then we injected user prompt to be like, \"Oh, make some comments, critique my piece of writing or critique this piece of writing that you just made.\" And then we taught the model to make comments on the document on very specific [inaudible 00:17:45] So it's also what kind of comments you want the model to make. Do they make sense or not? How do you teach the quality of that? And it all came down to measuring progress via very robust evals. But, yeah, this is how you used o1 and a synthetic data generation for the training.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):\nOkay, that's so interesting. So you talk about this idea of teaching the model and you mentioned how it's using synthetic data to teach the model different behaviors is a simple way to think about it. Basically that's where you do that by showing it what success looks like using basically evals. Is that the simple way to think about it? Like, \"Here's what you doing this successfully would look like,\" and that teaches it, \"Okay, I see this is what I should be doing [inaudible 00:18:31]\"\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:18:30):\nYeah, great. Yeah, amazing. Yeah, you got it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:33):\nOkay, got it. I want to start unpacking what your day-to-day looks like as you're building these sort of things. Is it like you sitting there talking to some version of ChatGPT, crafting these evals?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:18:44):\nSometimes I do that. Sometimes I do sit with ChatGPT. Actually, I think I learned this so much from Anthropic, is people spend so much time prompting models and where quality's a really bad batch all the time, and you actually get a lot of new ideas of how do you make the model better? It's like, \"This response is kind of weird. Why's it doing this?\" And you start debugging or something, or you start figuring out new methods of how do you teach the model to respond in the different way, have better personality, let's say. \n\n(00:19:19):\nSo it's the same thing of how personality is made in the models with those. It's very similar methods. But, yes, I think my time at OpenAI have changed. I think when I first came, I was mostly research IC work so I was like building a lot of... I was running code, training models, write evals, working with PMs and designers to learn, teach them how to even think about evaluation. I think that was really cool experience and I think it was just like an adoption of, \"How do we do this product management of AI feature for our AI models?\" Yeah, but now it's mostly management and mentorship. I'm still doing IC research code up to 4:00 PM, although. But I just kind of changed. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:21):\nAll right, don't talk too much about being a manager.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:20:23):\nOkay. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):\nBecause everyone's in firing their managers. \"Who needs managers anymore?\" That's what I hear now. Just kidding. It's interesting that so much of your time was spent on teaching product teams how evals integrate and how important it is. And I've heard this a few times and I haven't personally experienced it yet, so I think it's an important thread to follow is just how writing these evaluations is going to become increasingly an important part of the job of product teams, especially when they're building AI features and working with LLMs. So can you just talk a bit more about what that looks like? Is it sitting there with an Excel spreadsheet basically showing, \"Here's the input, here's the output, here's how good the result was\"? Talk about what that actually looks like very practically.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:21:02):\nIt certainly depends on what you're developing, but there are various types of evaluations. Sometimes I do ask product managers, or there's also new roles that we have, model designers, to go through some of the user feedback maybe or think of various user conversations that should have triggered... Under these circumstances, it should trigger Canvas. And then you have this ground truth label of, \"Okay with this conversation it should look trigger Canvas, under this conversation it should not trigger Canvas.\" And you have this very deterministic kind of eval that for decision-making behaviors is like this.\n\n(00:21:46):\nWhen we were launching tasks, for example, how do you make correct schedules is actually really hard for the model. But we built out some of the deterministic evaluations that is like, \"Okay, if the user says 7:00 PM, the model should say 7:00 PM.\" So if you can have deterministic evals whether it's pass or fail. And the way it works is all the... Sometimes I ask product managers to just go create a double sheet, have different tabs and what's the current behavior, what's the ideal behavior and why, and some notes. \n\n(00:22:27):\nAnd sometimes they usually use it with evals, sometimes we use it for training. Because if you give the spreadsheet to o1 model, it can probably figure out how to teach itself a good behavior. And I think there are second type of evals that is more prevalent is human evaluations. And you can have specific trainers or you can have internal people to when you have a conversation of the prompt and then you have various completion of models, you choose the win rate. Which model is the best? Which model produce the highest quality comment or edit? And then you can have continuous win rates. And as you develop new models it should always win over the previous models. So it depends on what you want to measure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:22):\nSo interesting. Basically what I'm hearing, and there's something I'm learning about as I talk to people, is product development might move from this, \"Here's a spec PRD, let's build it together and then cool, let's review it. Are we happy with this?\" From that to, \"Hey, AI, build this thing for me and here's what correct looks like,\" and I'm spending all my time on what does correct look like on evals essentially. \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:23:47):\nYou definitely want to measure progress of your model and this is where evals is, is because you can have prompted model as a baseline already. And the most robust evals is the one where prompted baselines get the lowest score or something. And then because then you know if you're trained a good model, then it should just hill climb on that eval all the time, while not also regressing on other intelligence evals. That's what I'm saying, it's more of an art than science. It's like, \"Okay, if you optimize the model for this behavior, you don't want to brain damage in other areas of intelligence or...\" This is happening all the time in every lab, in every research team. \n\n(00:24:35):\nI would say prompting is also a way to prototype new product ideas. Early days at Anthropic when I was working file uploads feature, I remember I was just prompting the model to just... I remember we were launching a hundred key contexts. I was just prototyping this in their local browser. I did the demo. People really, really loved it. And they just wanted API for file uploads or something. And then that's when it clicked to me, and also one of the blog posts a long time ago, it clicked on me prompting is a new way of product development or prototyping for designers and for product managers. \n\n(00:25:20):\nFor example, one of the features that I want to do is have a personalized starter prompts. So whenever you come to Claude, it should recommend you starter prompts based on what your interests are. And so you can literally do it prompting for that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):\nMm-hmm. To experiment with that. \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:25:44):\nAnother feature was generating titles for the conversations. It's a very small micro experience but I'm really proud of. The way we did that was we took five latest conversation from the model, asked the model, \"What's the style of the user?\" And then for the next new conversation, the generated title will be of the same style. It's just like really little micro experiences like this. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):\nThat's so cool. Did you do that at Anthropic or at OpenAI?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:14):\nAt Anthropic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:16):\nOkay, cool. I love the file upload feature that Claude has by the way. ChatGPT doesn't have that yet, is that right?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:16):\nI think has the way. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):\n[inaudible 00:26:23]\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:22):\nI think the way it's implement is very different though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:25):\nOkay. Maybe it's the PDF feature, because I use it all the time with Claude.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:28):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):\nOkay.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:28):\nThat's cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):\nSomebody needs to get on that. Main, it's wild how many features you built that I use every day and that many people use every day. This prototyping point you made is really important. It's something that comes up a ton on this podcast also of how that... is maybe the way that AI has most impacted the job of product builders recently is just prototyping instead of going from showing just like, \"Here's a PRD, here's a design.\" PMs are more and more just, \"Here's the prototype with the idea that I have,\" and it's working. You can play with it.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:26:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:55):\nYeah. Okay, I want to spend a little more time on how you operate. So you talked about you built this in launch of this tasks feature, is that the way to describe your tasks?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:27:04):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:06):\nSo talk about how that emerged and let's better understand just how you collaborate with product teams and how OpenAI works in that way, whatever you can share there.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:27:14):\nI think Canvas and tasks are going into the bucket of projects where it's more short or medium terms. And actually the way Canvas and tasks came about to be was it started with one person prototyping and creating a spec. It's kind of like PRD. It's like creating a spec of the behavior of the model. I don't think tasks is extremely groundbreaking feature necessarily. What makes it really cool is because the models are so general... Model can now search, they can write sci-fi stories, they can search for stocks, they can summarize the news every day. Because the models are so general giving something familiar to people that notifications is very familiar, having reminders is very familiar. So feeling like a form factor for the people who are very familiar, same as Canvas, Google Docs is very familiar, but then you add magical AI moment and it becomes very powerful.\n\n(00:28:26):\nBut the way it comes usually operationally... Yeah, size is like a prototype, literally prompted prototype of how you would want the model to behave. For tasks, for example, you need to design... Literally design thinking is like okay, well, if the user says, \"Remind me to go to lunch at 8:00 AM tomorrow,\" what information does the model need to extract from that prompt in order to create a reminder? And so this is how you design a spec for a new feature, like a tool. Canvas and tasks are all tools. So it's like how do you create the tool stack?\n\n(00:29:09):\nAnd then it's mostly like developing JSON schema. It was like, \"Okay, from this problem maybe the model should extract the time that the user requested.\" And then you think about which format do you want the time to be? And then how do you want the model to notify you is basically the user should give instruction to the model. And then this instruction would fire off every day or something at that particular time. So, for example, if you say, \"Every day I want to learn know about the latest AI news,\" the model should rewrite into, \"Okay search for the latest AI news and this task will get fired at that particular type that the user requested.\"\n\n(00:30:02):\nAnd then your design is like tool spec. Actually, I don't know. I feel like sometimes it's through conversations I... Either people ask me to join the [inaudible 00:30:15] team and they're like, \"Oh my god, we need researchers.\" Or like, \"We need some support. We need to train the models,\" or sometimes. Canvas was mostly like I just pitched the idea of... It got staffed quite immediately during the break, so it's dependent on the project. And then usually with staffing is mostly a product manager, model designer, actual product designer, a couple of researchers and a bunch of applied engineers. Depends on the complexity of a project. And then for tasks it took, I don't know, like two months or so to go from zero to one basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):\nOh wow.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:30:54):\nFor Canvas this was like four, five months, I guess, to go from zero to one. And then you teach product managers how to build evals and maybe how do we not only ship the better feature, but how do we think longer term? What kind of cool features did you want tasks to have? I think it would be nice for tasks to be a little bit more personalized. It'd be nice to have to create tasks via voice on a mobile, right? This is how you get research roadmap right here is thinking how the feature will be developed in the future. \n\n(00:31:39):\nAnd then from there it's like you start getting data sets. With evals, you want to make sure that goes well. And then you need to have a trade-off between what methods you want to use. And the reason why I really love relying purely on synthetic data instead of collecting data from humans is because it's much more scalable, it's cheap, less than half. You literally sample from the model and you teach the core behaviors of the models and that will generalize to all sorts of diverse coverage.\n\n(00:32:15):\nAnd when you launch the beta feature, you learn so much from the users that you can... All your synthetic sets can be shifted in the distribution and how the users behave on the product behavior. And this is how we improve. And this is what happened with Canvass too when we launched from beta to GA. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):\nOkay. \n\n(00:32:35):\nThis episode is brought to you by Loom.

What's the simplest way to understand what researchers do at OpenAI?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:33:48):\nSo the project that I described are mostly product-oriented. Research is mostly product research. Another component of my team is actually more longer term exploratory projects. And it's more about developing new methods, understanding those methods under a variety of circumstances. So basically developing methods, you need to follow very similar recipe of building evals but it's much more sophisticated evals. You want to have outer distribution or if you want to measure generalization, you need to capture that. \n\n(00:34:26):\nBut it is basically more sciencey in a way where... If we talk about synthetic data, one of the hardest things about synthetic data is how do you make it more diverse? Diversity in synthetic data is one of the most important questions right now. And so it's like exploring ways to inject diversity as a general method that will work for all is one of the research explorations. Other ones is more developing new capabilities. I feel like it's always about you work on this new method and you have signs of life that it's working, either you think of how do you make it more general or you think of how do you make it very useful? And this is how the longer-term projects become more medium, short-term project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:15):\nThat makes sense. Essentially working on developing ways to make the model smarter, o4, o5, o6. New ways to... o1 was a big breakthrough, right? \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:35:25):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:25):\nThe way it operates where it's not just, \"Here's your answer,\" it actually thinks and takes time to think through the process of coming up with an answer. Okay. \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:35:33):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:34):\nVery helpful. Speaking of that, of thinking about the future, where things are going, I want to spend some time on just this insight that basically you are building the cutting edge of AI, at the very bleeding edge of where AI is going and where it is. And so I'm very curious to hear just your take on how you think things are going to change in the world and how people work based on where you see things are going. And I know it's a broad question, but let's say in the next three years, how do you see the world changing? How do you see people's way of working changing?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:36:08):\nIt's a very humbling experience to be in both labs, I guess. To me when I first came to Anthropic and I was like, \"Oh no, I really love front-end engineering.\" And then the reason why I switched to research is because I realized at that time it's like, \"Oh my god, Claude is getting better at front-end. Claude is getting better at coding. I think Claude can develop new apps or something and so it can develop new features for the thing that I'm working.\" So it was kind of like this meta realization where it's like, \"Oh my god, the world is actually changing.\" And when we first launched 100K context at that time, obviously I'm thinking about form factors that's like file uploads were very natural, very familiar to people. But you can imagine we could just make infinite chats in the Claude.ai app, as if it's 100K context. \n\n(00:37:04):\nBut because file uploads... It's like form follows function. It's like the form factor, the file uploads can enable people to just literally upload anything, the books, any reports, financial and ask any task to the model. And then I remember it was either enterprise customers, financial customers were really interested in that. It's like, \"Oh wow.\" It's actually one of the very common tasks that people do in that setting. It's kind of crazy to see how some of the redundant tasks are getting automated basically by these smart models.\n\n(00:37:48):\nAnd they're entering the era where, I actually don't know for example sometimes if o1 gives me the correct answer or not because I'm not an expert in that field. And it's like, \"I don't even know how to verify the outputs of the models.\" It's because all my experts know they can verify this. So, yes, so basically there are trends that are going on. The first trend is the cost of reasoning and intelligence is drastically going down.\n\n(00:38:22):\nI had a blog post about this. Maybe I should update on latest benchmarks, because at that time everybody was doing one benchmark and they'd be... quickly saturated the benchmarks. So I'm like, \"Now we need to do the same plot but with another frontier eval.\" But the cost of intelligence is going down because it becomes that much cheaper. Small models are becoming even smarter than large models and that's because of the distillation research. \n\n(00:38:56):\nThis happened with Claude 3 Haiku. I was working with the training on the Claude 3 Haiku and I realized it was much smarter than Claude 2, which was way bigger, lots [inaudible 00:39:08]. But the power of small models become very intelligent and fast and cheap. We are moving towards that world. That has multiple implications, but the news is that people will have more access AI and that's really good. Builders and developers will have much better access to AI, but also it means all the work that has been bottlenecked by intelligence will be unblocked. \n\n(00:39:40):\nI'm thinking about healthcare, right? Instead of going to a doctor, I can ask ChatGPT or give ChatGPT a list of symptoms and ask me, \"Would I have a cold, flu, something else?\" I can literally get the access to doctor almost. And there's been some research studies around that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:05):\nThere was a New York Times story about that where they compared doctors to doctors using ChatGPT to just ChatGPT and just ChatGPT was the best of them. All doctors made it worse.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:40:18):\nYeah, that's crazy. Yeah. Yeah, that's crazy, right? Education I think I would have dreamt if I had the tool like ChatGPT when I was young and would learn so much. But it's like people can now learn almost anything from these models. So they can learn new language, they can learn how to build new look apps and write anything they do want. It's humbling to have... launch Canvas and bring that thing to the people, enable them to do something else that they couldn't have ever before. There's something magical around this experience. \n\n(00:40:57):\nEducation will have massive implications. I guess like scientific research, I think it's the dream of any AI research is to automate AI research. It's kind of scary, I'd say, which makes me think that people management will stay. It's one of the hardest thing to... Emotional intelligence with the models, creativity in itself is one of the hardest things. So writers, I don't think people should be worried as much. I think will alleviate a lot of redundant tasks for people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):\nThis is awesome. Okay, I want to follow this thread for sure. And it's funny that what you described as you were an engineer at Anthropic and you're like, \"Okay, Claude is going to be very good at engineering. This isn't going to be a potentially career long term, so I'm going to move into research and AI is going to need me for a long time to build it, to make it smarter.\"\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:41:53):\nI would say we still have... I think Canvas team has still have really cool front engineers that are really people who really care about interaction, design, interacting experience. I don't think models are there yet I think if... But we can get the models to this top 1% of front-ends and things for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):\nSo what I want to move on to next along these lines is just, and this is just speculation, but what skills do you think will be most valuable going forward for product teams in particular? So folks are listening and they're like, \"Okay, this is scary. What should I be building now to help me stay ahead and not be in trouble down the road?\" What skills do you think are going to be more and more important to build?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:42:42):\nYeah, I think creative thinking. You want to generate a bunch of ideas and filter through them and not just build the best product experience. Listening. You want to build something that the most general model will not replace you. And oftentimes you build something and you make it really, really good for specific set of users and actually the mode is now in your user feedback. The mode is more in whether you listen to them, whether you can rapidly iterate. The mode is in here. I don't think we are yet to... There are so many ideas, I think there's an abundance of ideas that you can work on. I wouldn't be worried. I feel like in fact I just think people in AI field are like... I wish they were a little bit more creative and connecting the dots across the print fields or something like that to develop really cool new generation and new paradigms of interactions with this AI.\n\n(00:43:53):\nI don't think we've cracked this problem at all. A couple of years ago I was telling some people, I was like, \"You want to build for the future.\" So it's like it doesn't necessarily matter whether the model is good or not, good right now, but you can build product ideas such that by the time the models will be really good, it'll work really well. I think it just happened naturally. For example, at Anthropic the Claude artifacts... And I feel early days of Canvas was, back in 2022 before ChatGPT, writing ideas was our knowledge [inaudible 00:44:36]. But I feel like Claude 1.3 model itself was not there to have made really extreme good high quality edits. For example, like coding. \n\n(00:44:47):\nAnd I feel like I see startups like Kaeser was doing super well. And that's because they iterate so fast. They invent new ways of training models. They move really fast. They listen to what users like, massive distributions. Yeah, it's kind of cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):\nThat's really helpful actually. So what I'm hearing is that soft skills essentially are going to be more and more important, powerful. You just talked about management, leading people, being creative and coming up with innovative insights, listening. There's a post I wrote that I'll link to where I try to analyze how AI will impact product management. And we're actually very aligned, and my sense was the same thing, that soft skills are going to become more and more important. And the things that are going to be replaced is the hard skills, which is interesting because usually people value the hard skills like coding, design, writing really well. And it's interesting that AI is actually really good at that because it's taking a bunch of data, synthesizing it and writing, creating a thing, versus all these fuzzy things around of what influences, convinces people to do things and aligning and listening, like you said, creativity, anything along those lines come up as I say that.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:46:01):\nI think it's actually a really, really hard to teach the model how to be aesthetic or do really good visual design or how to be extremely creative in the way they write. I still think ChatGPT kind of sucks at writing and that's because it's bottlenecked by this creative reasoning. I think characterization is one of the most important... I think for a manager, I feel like... \n\n(00:46:28):\nActually, AI research progress is bottlenecked by management, research management. It's because you have constrained set of compute and you need to allocate the compute to the research paths that you feel the most convinced about. It was like you need to have a really high conviction in the research paths to put the compute, and it's more return on investment kind of situation. It's like, \"Okay, I'm thinking a lot about across all my projects, which projects are higher priority?\" Prioritization and also on the lower level, \"Which experiments are really important to run right now and which are not?\" and cut through the line. So I was thinking prioritization, communication, management. People skills like empathy, understanding people, collaboration.\n\n(00:47:23):\nI think Canvas wouldn't be an amazing launch if it wasn't about people and I think it's a wonderful group of people. And I get a chance to work with people like Lee Byron who's a co-creator at GraphQL and some of the best Apple designers. It's so cool to see... and how do you create this collaboration between people. It's just something that's still humane, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):\nLet me just follow through a little bit. I imagine people listening are like, \"Okay, but once we have AGI or SGI it's like it'll do all this.\" There's a world where like, \"Why isn't all this done?\" I think it's easy to just assume all that. I'm curious this idea of creativity and listening, why you think AI isn't good at it, other than it's just very hard to train it to do this well. Is there anything there of just why this is especially difficult for AI and LLMs to get good at?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:48:20):\nI think currently it's difficult for many reasons. I think it's still an active research area and it's something that I think my team is working on. It's like, \"Okay, how do we teach the models to be more creative in the writing?\" And so I'm thinking this new paradigm of wise that the models think more should actually lead to better writing in itself. But when it comes down to idea generation or discriminating of what is a good visual design or not, I feel like it hasn't had learned examples from people to discriminate it very well. I do think it's because there are not that many people who are actually really... It's not accessible to models to learn from these people I guess. So I definitely think that's why it sucks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):\nYeah, that makes sense. Basically there's not enough of you yet, researchers teaching it to do these things, slash people that have incredible taste and creativity that can teach these things. You could argue this will come. \n\nKarina Nguyen (00:49:31):\nRight. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:31):\nBut we don't need to keep going down that thread. Let me ask you a specific question. In this post I wrote, I made this argument that a lot of people disagreed with that strategy is something that AI tooling will become increasingly great at and take over. There's the sense that that's the thing that people will continue to be much better at and you can't offload to AI basically developing your strategy, telling you what to do to win. My case is, \"Isn't strategy, just take all the inputs, all the data you have available, understand the world around you and come up with a plan to win?\" It feels like AI and LLM would be incredibly smart at this. What's your take?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:50:10):\nI think so too. I think again, you teach the model all sorts of tools and capabilities and reasoning and it's like when it comes down to... For Canvas right now, it would be very cool for the model just aggregate all the feedback from users, summarize me the top five most painful flows on user experiences. And then the model itself is very capable of thinking of knowing how it's been made, figure out how to create a dataset for itself to train on it. And I don't think that we are far away from that self-improvement, models becoming self-improved by...\n\n(00:50:54):\nThat, and the part of development, is basically self-improving. It's kind of like its own organism or something. Again, like strategies, it's more like data analysis and coming up with... I think what models are really good at is connecting the dots, I think. It's like if you have user feedback from this source, but you also have an internal dashboard with metrics and then you have other feedback or input and then it can create a plan for you, recommendations even.  And I think this is one of the most common use cases for ChatGPT too, is coming up with these sort of things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:47):\nThat makes sense essentially a human can only comprehend so much information at once and look at so much data at once to synthesize takeaways. And as you said, these context windows are huge now. Here's all the information, what's the most important thing I should do?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:51:59):\nYeah, same as scientific research. Ideally the model would be able to suggest ideas, new ideas, or iterate on the experimental given the empirical results of the previous experiments like how do you come up with new ideas or the methods?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:18):\nYeah. Oh, man. Okay, so just to close the loop on this conversation, this part of the thread is the skills you're suggesting people focus on building and leaning into is soft skills like creativity, managing influence, collaboration, looking for patterns. Is that generally where your mind is at?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:52:40):\nYeah, I'm thinking a lot about how do we make organizations more effectively and I think this is mostly management, I guess. It's like how do you organize research teams or generally teams combined... Compose teams such that they will be at their maximally succeed or at the maximal performance of what can possibly... We can literally create the next generation of computers. It's just the matter of conviction and the way you manage through that. It's scaling organizations or scaling product research, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:15):\nYeah, I think you're basically building this thing and not efficiently doing it is limiting the potential of the human species right now.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:53:16):\nRight. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:26):\nIt's mismanagement within the research team in OpenAI and Anthropic and some of these other models.\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:53:32):\nYeah, it's kind of crazy to think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:33):\nHoly moly. Okay, so speaking of Anthropic and OpenAI, you've worked at both. Very few people have worked at both companies and have seen how they operate. I'm curious just what you've noticed about the differences between these two, how they operate, how they think, how they approach stuff. What can you share along those lines?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:53:48):\nIt's more similar than different. Obviously there was a lot of... There are some differences always comes to nuances. I would say culture. I really love Anthropic and I have a lot of friends there. And I also love OpenAI and they still have a lot of friends though. So it's not about enemies. I feel like there's in AI, it's all like, \"Yeah, they're competitors. There's enemies.\" It's actually like one big community of people doing the same thing. I would say what I've learned from Anthropic is this real care and craft towards model behavior, model craft, model training. \n\n(00:54:32):\nAnd I've been thinking a lot about, \"Okay, what makes Claude Claude and what makes ChatGPT ChatGPT?\" And it's like I still have some sense of operational processes that leads to the outputs, to the model. It's the outputed model. And it's like the reason why Claude has so much more personality and is more like a librarian... I don't know. I don't know. I am visualizing Claude being like a librarian at some point, very nerdy or something. ... is because I feel like it's the reflection of the creators who are making this model. And a lot of details around the character and the personality and whether the model should follow up on this question or not. \n\n(00:55:19):\nWhat's the correct ethical behavior for the model in these scenarios? A lot of crafts and curated datasets. This is where I learned that part of art, I guess, at Anthropic. I would say Anthropic is much smaller. When I joined it was, what, like 70 people? When I left it was tons of people. And obviously the culture changed so much. I really enjoyed being early days startup lives, and people knew each other as a family. But the culture shifted. \n\n(00:55:53):\nI would say that I learned from Anthropic that they're much better at focusing and prioritization of... Very hardcore prioritization, I guess. And they need to do it. But I think OpenAI's much more innovative and much more risk-takers in terms of product or research. Actually, in way your full-time job can be just teaching the model how to be creative writers. And it's like there's some luxury in this research freedom that comes with scale, maybe. I don't know. I'd say I have much more creative product freedom to do almost anything, I guess, within OpenAI, evolve ChatGPT into the vision that we want. It's more probably bottoms-up, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nYeah, that's how I was thinking about it. It feels like OpenAI is more bottoms-up, distributed, people bubble up ideas, try stuff. And that leads to more products launching, I imagine more things just kind of being tried versus more of a, \"Let's just make sure everything we do is awesome and great and craft and thinking deeply about every investment.\"\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:57:08):\nRight. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):\nThat's really interesting. I've never heard it described this way. Karina, we've covered so much ground. This is going to help a lot of people with so many ways of thinking about where the future's going. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or get into?\n\nKarina Nguyen (00:57:23):\nOne of my regrets, I guess, when I was early days at Anthropic was that... I think there was some luxury of the time, because pre-ChatGPT, to actually come in with a bunch of ideas and prototype almost every day. And I think that we did a lot of cool ideas like Claude, and Slack was actually one of the first tool-usey products. It's like Claude could operate in your workplace now. It's kind of cool because you can add Claude to summarize the thread. So maybe you have an entire conversation with someone and then you want a summary of what happened you can ask Claude, \"Summarize this.\" \n\n(00:58:07):\nAlso, it was really fun to iterate on the model itself. It's like when you just talk to the model in Slack forever. It created some social element, it was kind like [inaudible 00:58:19] and this Discord, people learned so much about prompting and how to work with Claude. Actually, one of the features that was early tasks prototype is every Monday Claude would just summarize the entire channel. Or every Friday we'd just summarize a bunch of channels and give the news about the organization, or something. \n\n(00:58:48):\nAnd it's kind of like really cool form factor. I think thinking about form factor's a really important question in AI, especially we haven't even figured out how do we create an awesome product experience with o-series models. It's like the paradigm between synchronous real time give an answer paradigm into more asynchronous paradigm of agents working on the background. But then now the question is the agents should build trust with you, right? And trust builds over time, which is like with humans. And you start this collaboration which is why this collaboration model with you and the model is so important because you build trust and the model learns from your preferences so that it can become more personalized and it will start predicting the next action that you want to take on the computer or something. And it's more predictive, much more... We went from personal computers to personal model basically here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:54):\nWhy is it not a thing? That seems like such an obvious feature that every LLM should have as a Slack bot version of them. Is that a thing I can help you install? Or is that not a thing right now?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:00:03):\nI know that Claude and Slack was sunset in 2023 or something. I think it was after ChatGPT was mostly the focus on customer use cases or enterprise use cases.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:17):\nMm-hmm. Bummer. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:00:19):\nI think the form factor of Claude and Slack was kind of constrained a little bit when you want to talk about new features.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:28):\nBummer. I want that.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:00:30):\nI know that ChatGPT had Slackbar tools. I don't know, maybe it will come back sometime.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:35):\nAll right, I would pay for that. Any other memories from that time of early days? Because that's a really special place to have been is early days Anthropic. Any other memories or stories from that time that might be interesting to share?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:00:48):\nI think the very first launch when we felt... When click from use, again, was 100K context launch is when the models could input the entire book and give you a summary of the book or something. Or the financial... or catalog multi files financial reports and then give you an answer to the question, to very specific questions. I think there was something in there that was kind like, \"Oh my god, this is a really cool new capability.\" Not model capability, but more like the capabilities that came from the product form factor itself rather than the model capability as much. \n\n(01:01:34):\nI think other prototypes that we were thinking about... There's one part having a Claude workspaces and it's kind of the same idea of Claude and I would have this shared workspace and that share workspace is like a document and we can iterate on the document. And I feel like sometimes the ideas, [inaudible 01:01:55] and they're locked for two years, just like in this case. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):\nIt's interesting, there's these milestones that kind of open up our view of what is happening and where things are going. ChatGPT think was the first of just like, \"Wow, this is much better than I would've thought.\" You talked about 100K context windows where you could upload a book and ask it questions and have it summarize. I actually use that all the time. When I have interview guests and they wrote a book, I sometimes don't have time to read the whole book. So I use it to help me understand what the most interesting parts are. And then I actually dive into the book, just to be clear. And then, I don't know, maybe voice was another one where you could talk to say ChatGPT. Is there any other moments there that you're like, \"Wow, this is much better than I thought it was going to be?\"\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:02:39):\nYeah, I think the computer use agents, like the model operating the desktop. And you can essentially think of new kind of experience where the model can learn the way you browse. And from that preference it can just browse as just like you. It's kind of simulated persona. And it's actually very similar to the idea of like, \"Okay, maybe Sam Altman doesn't have a lot of time. Maybe I want to talk to his simulation and ask...\" Or, for example, I really appreciate some of the technical mentorship. Yeah, cool. But he doesn't have a lot of time so it's like I really want to ask him this questions. How do you respond with simulated environments like this would be really cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:37):\nThat's a great place to plug Lennybot, have one of those. It's trained on all of my podcasts and newsletters. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:03:42):\nOh, cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):\nIt sits on many models. I don't know which exactly they use, but it's exactly that. And it's not even me, it's all the guests that have been on the podcast and on newsletter as I wrote. And you could just ask it, \"How do I grow my product? How do I develop a strategy?\" And it's actually shockingly good.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:03:58):\nDo you feel like it reflects who you are?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:58):\nYeah. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:03:58):\nOr would it be... Okay. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):\nThe best part of it is you can talk to it. There's an ElevenLabs voice version that's trained on my voice from this podcast, and it's actually very good and people have told me they sit there for hours talking to it. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:04:15):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):\nAnd somebody told it, \"Interview me like I am on Lenny's podcast, ask me questions about my career.\" And he did a half hour podcast episode with Lennybot.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:04:24):\nOh my god, that's so fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:27):\nIt's incredible. Future is wild.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:04:29):\nYeah. I think content transformation is... I would imagine sometime when you generate a sci-fi story in Canvas, you can transform this into audiobook where you have very natural content transformation of one media to another media. I think one of my earliest inspiration is one of the last episodes of Westworld where, I don't want to spoil, but where Dolores comes to her work at that time and she comes to this new workspace and she starts writing a story. And then as she writes a story, a 3D, virtual reality, starts creating on the fly. So I kind of want to create that. Kind of cool. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:24):\nWow. Speaking of medium, I guess I was wondering if I should go in this direct or not, but real quick. Kevin Weill/Kevin Weill, I don't know exactly how to pronounce his last name, the CPO of OpenAI.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:05:35):\nKevin Weill, uh-huh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:37):\nIs it Weill or Weill? \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:05:37):\nI think Weill. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:39):\nWeill. Okay. Okay. Let's just say that. We'll go with that. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:05:40):\nI hope, yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):\nHe did a panel at the Lenny and Friends Summit last year and he made this really fascinating point that chat is a really interesting interface for these tools because they're just getting smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter and smarter. And chat continues to work as a paradigm to just interact with them, similar to a human. You could talk to Albert Einstein. You could talk to someone not very smart and it's all conversation still. And so it's a really flexible way to interact with increasingly good intelligence. At some point it'll not be so great, and you were talking about all these ways that you're adding additional ways to interact. But it's interesting chat proved to be a really powerful layer on top of all this stuff. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:06:22):\nYeah, that's real cool. I feel like chat also has social element which is very humane. It's like, yeah, you sometimes want to get into group chat. And having conversations with AI is kind of like a group chat in itself, as messaging. Actually, this idea of how do you build features like this? I see tasks as this general feature that will scale very nicely as the models would develop new capabilities themselves. The models will be able to do better searches and create new... come up with more creative writing on render, react apps and like HTML apps. And you can have everyday new puzzle for you, every day continue the story from the previous days. It scales very nicely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:14):\nYou mentioned something as we were getting into this extra section that we ended up going down is this idea of the agents using a computer. I know this is actually something you are going to launch today, the day we're recording it, which will be out by the time this comes out, called Operator, can you talk about this very cool feature that people will have access to?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:07:33):\nYeah, so I unfortunately did not work on that, but I'm really, really excited about this launch. It's basically an agent that can complete the task in its own virtual computer, in its own virtual environment. You can do any literally task like order me a book on Amazon. And then ideally the model will either follow up with you which book do you want, or know you so well that it start recommending, \"Oh, here is the five books that I might recommend you to buy.\" And then you hit, \"Yeah, help me buy.\" And then the model goes off into its own virtual little browser and complete the task and buy the book on the Amazon. And then if you give the model credentials, credit cards, obviously it comes with a lot of trust and safety, then it will just complete the thing for you. It's a virtual assistant.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:37):\nIt's interesting how this just sounds like obviously this should happen. Why is this not yet a thing? Which is also mind-blowing that we're just assuming this should exist. Just some AI doing things for you on a computer we just ask it to do. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:08:37):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nIt's absurd.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:08:51):\nIt's actually really hard. And I think you're still cracking this, but feel like... I don't know if you use Tuple like a pair programming product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):\nNo.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:09:04):\nBut at Anthropic we loved pair programming, so if you used-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:09):\nOh yeah, Shopify uses this. I remember it came up on a podcast episode.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:09:10):\nOh, nice. Yeah, so it is a very cool product where you can just call anyone at any time and then share screen and the other person can have access to the screen or start literally operating your computer. And it's very realtime... The allegiance is very... it's very high quality. And it's just like I kind of want the same. I want to pair program with my model and the model should even talk to me. Draw very specific section in my code and just go to tell me... Obviously teach me and we can have different modes. It's like right, this is a product right here for you. I don't know. Some people should build that. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:58):\nIt sounds like a startup just got birthed-\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:09:59):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):\n... from someone listening to this. You mentioned that it's very hard to do this agent controlling a computer as you and helping out. What makes it so hard for whatever, however much you can explain briefly?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:10:11):\nMuch of it is because right now the model's operating on pixels instead of language or whatnot. Pixels is actually really, really hard. The models [inaudible 01:10:25] perception, or visual perception. I think there's still a lot of multimodal research that's going on, but I think language scaled so much easier compared to multimodal because of that.\n\n(01:10:38):\nAnother thing that I guess my team is working that is how do you derive human intent very correctly? It's like sometimes does the model know enough information to ask a follow-up question or to complete the task? You don't want an agent to go off for 10 minutes and then come back with an answer that you didn't even want. That actually creates much more worse user experience. And this comes with teaching the model people skills. It's like, \"What do people like? Kind of like creating the mental model of the user and care about the user in order to ask certain questions. Actually, that part is hard to do for the models.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:28):\nThat relates to what we talked about earlier where this kind of the soft skill, people skills piece is not where these models are strong yet.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:11:34):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):\nOkay. I'm going to skip the lightning round. I want to ask just one question from the lightning round, something fun. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:11:41):\nYeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):\nOkay, so when AI replaces your job, Karina, I'm curious what you're... And it gives you a stipend, gives you a monthly stipend. Here's your salary for the month. What would you want to do? What do you want to spend your time on? What will you be doing in this future world?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:11:57):\nI've been thinking about this a lot times. I feel like I have a lot of jobs options. I would love to be a writer, I think. I think that would be super cool. You should write short stories, sci-fi stories, novels. I really like art history, so you know those conservationists in the museums who just try to preserve art paintings, but just painting through a long day? \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:28):\nMm-hmm. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:12:29):\nI think that would be really cool to do. Yeah. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:36):\nThat sounds beautiful.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:12:36):\nI don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):\nWhat I'm hearing is you need to Nerf these models to not get very good at writing so that you can continue... Although at that point you don't need to do it from... You don't need people to buy it, you're just doing it for fun, so it doesn't even matter if they're incredibly good at writing or art conservation. Oh man, what an episode of our conversation. What a wild time we're living in. Karina, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on anything? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:13:06):\nYou can find me, I'm on Twitter it's KarinaNguyen. You can also shoot me an email on my website. And my team is hiring and so I'm looking for research engineers, research scientists, as well as machine learning engineers, people who come from product engineers who want to learn model training. I'm actually hiring for my team. My team is called Frontier Product Research, and we train models, we develop new methods but for product oriented outcomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:38):\nWhat a place to work. Holy moly. What's the best way for people to apply for these very lucrative roles?\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:13:46):\nI think you can shoot me a DM on Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):\nOkay. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:13:51):\nOr I'm yet to create a job description for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:51):\nOkay. This is the job description.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:13:58):\nOr you can apply into post training team. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:58):\nOkay. You're going to get a flood of DMs. I hope you're prepared. Karina, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.\n\nKarina Nguyen (01:14:03):\nThank you so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:05):\nBye, everyone. \n\nKarina Nguyen (01:14:05):\nIt was fun. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Inside Linear: Building with taste, craft, and focus | Karri Saarinen (co-founder, designer, CEO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:00:00):\nMy belief is that, like any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. What happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, like the mobile or the web or something the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well designed necessarily because they are the first.\n\n(00:00:19):\nThen, as you build the 100,000 different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. It's like the bar is so high. I think today it's almost a very basic thing now. Pretty much from the very beginning, you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.\n\nLenny (00:00:46):\nToday my guest is Karri Saarinen. Karri was the founding designer at Coinbase, principal designer at Airbnb, co-founder of two previous startups, and most recently is the co-founder and CEO of Linear, which I'm fairly confident is the fastest growing and most beloved issue tracking tool in the world and something that a growing number of product teams are using to build their own product.\n\n(00:01:07):\nKarri and his team are building their company and their product in a really unique way with a huge focus on craft and quality, no AB tests, no metrics-based goals, instead a focus on taste and opinions. Also, no durable cross-functional teams, instead teams assemble around a project and then disperse once it's done. Also, they have just one product manager as the head of product and that's it. In our conversation, Karri shares how he built a culture around quality and craft, how he makes trade-offs, and how he operationalizes quality and thoughtfulness where design can be a differentiator in competing against incumbents.\n\n(00:01:42):\nWe talk about something called the linear method of building product, which is big on building opinionated software, working in consistent cycles amongst other principles. We also get into Linear's unique hiring approach, which involves a paid work trial where candidates work alongside the team for a number of days instead of just having an interview, also a glimpse into how Linear got their first 10 customers, found product market fit, and scaled their growth engine.\n\n(00:02:06):\nThere is so much gold in this episode. I'm very excited for you to hear it. With that, I bring you Karri Saarinen after a short word from our sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Mercury who I also happen to use for my business checking account. I've tried a lot of business banks and there's nothing even close to the experience you get with Mercury. I moved cash over from another bank and it literally took less than half an hour to set up the account and wire money over at no cost.\n\n(00:02:34):\nThey make you want to use the site more often, which I've never felt with another banking site.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:04:29):\nThanks, Lenny. It's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:31):\nMaybe to start, set a little context, can you just explain what is Linear? What does Linear do? Then, share maybe a few stats of just the scale of Linear at this point.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:04:41):\nLinear is the project and issue tracking system that software companies and technical teams love to use. We help software companies to build software. We started 2019. Today some of the top growth companies like Block, Vercel, Ramp, Retool, Mercury, and Softstack are building with Linear. We also additionally have lots of other companies, thousands of other companies using Linear. These companies can be a very early stage team like some companies just graduated from YC or a public company.\n\n(00:05:17):\nJust briefly, why we created Linear is that, like you said, I worked with you at Airbnb and before that I worked at Coinbase. Before that, I had my own startup. All of us founders, there's three of us, we had a similar path where we worked in multiple different companies in different stages. What we saw often is that the tools available for managing software projects weren't really cutting it. I think a lot of them felt very clunky or complex or just like they had this legacy way of thinking about software development. We just felt like we should do something about it. With Linear, we set out to build this most frictionless and streamlined system for modern software development. I'm also happy to share that we've been profitable the last two years. We also have this thing where we actually have this net negative lifetime burn rate, which means that we just have more cash in the bank today than we have raised. I think with a lot of startups usually the normal way is that you raise money and then you need to spend it to build it. I think since we were able to build a business pretty early on, we've been able to be in this position that actually we haven't spent any money on building the business.\n\nLenny (00:06:43):\nThat is insane. I didn't even know that. For all those reasons, a lot of founders and a lot of product leaders look up to the way Linear builds product and the way you think about product. To frame this conversation, there's three areas I want to dive into. One is just how you approach building product. Two is how you go about building the team and the business in general and then three is just how you grow Linear. To start, I want to talk about craft.\n\n(00:07:11):\nClearly, one of the biggest reasons that people look up to Linear and use Linear is the quality of the user experience and the product. I know your team puts a lot of emphasis on craft and user experience. I imagine that also comes at the cost of some trade-offs like it takes probably longer to get stuff out the door. You're probably losing sales because people are waiting for a feature and you're not ready to launch it yet. You want to make it better. What have you learned about creating space for craft and building product that is really, really great?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:07:40):\nI think it's interesting that those things you mentioned like hiring, building business, and building product and craft, I think that all of those are somewhat related to each other. What I can say about the product craft per se is it definitely starts with the people. On the hiring front, we always look for people that care about it. As a business, why we really care about it is that we see that cooperation only happens if people use the product and our product, which is supposed to help the cooperation, coordination.\n\n(00:08:14):\nIf there's friction or the experience isn't that great or there's little paper cuts, I think it gets really annoying for people to use. We think for the business to be successful the quality and the craft is very important. There's definitely trade-offs sometimes. There can be for example timelines like we are about to launch something and then for example I or someone else goes to look at it and sees, \"Oh, this doesn't feel right and we should fix it so I don't think we should launch this now.\"\n\n(00:08:43):\nSometimes it does definitely push the timelines, but this might be days. It's not like we need to redo everything. The other way we think about it is we are actually very okay pushing things out to ourselves and for a small group of customers if they opt into that. Whenever we build a new feature one of the things is we don't want to spend tons of time upfront just designing it, then polishing it perfectly.\n\n(00:09:13):\nWe actually believe that when you start building the thing you actually start realizing more how it should work and how it should be better. A lot of times with the teams we tell them, \"Just put it there in, I don't know, the first week almost. After you have some designs in place or some design ideas, just put it into the app and ship it to production.\" It's only visible to us so we internally can test it out.\n\n(00:09:40):\nThen, I think the next stage is we look for a customer that could be interested in this feature or we just ask people to opt in to some better program. In those stages, the experience can be a little janky or it's not that polished, but we're okay with it because we are saying, \"It's not finished. We just want to get your feedback early so we can make it better.\" Once we get to the full general release, then we pay more attention to the actual polish or the craft.\n\nLenny (00:10:11):\nThat is so interesting. I didn't know you do that. You actually go ahead and launch things really early to a select group of people that want the early stuff. Then, did you say that you find one customer to co-create and help evolve the feature and change it?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:10:26):\nUsually it can be one or it's three or five or 10. Often, especially with the larger company facing features, we usually do try to find a large company because sometimes it's hard to imagine these things, how they should work. It's better if someone is willing to work with us to explain, \"Okay, this is how we do something.\" For example, we work this way with Vercel in that there was some changes they wanted to see in the roadmap feature. We worked with them to improve it and then they could give us feedback along the way.\n\nLenny (00:11:02):\nThat is so interesting because I think people seeing Linear from the outside, it feels like you just take the time you need to build something awesome. Then, it launches and it's amazing and it's great, but it turns out that isn't exactly how you build. You actually do launch things really early and people don't necessarily see it until it's done, but there's this whole process behind the scenes.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:11:21):\nI think sometimes people think that craft is about perfecting things and perfecting them in a very organized way or very early on. The downside with this perfection mindset is that it can be sometimes hard to put anything out because nothing is ever fully perfect. We try to balance this thinking with the fact that we should be always pushing things out very quickly, but then also fixing them, improving them very quickly.\n\n(00:11:51):\nIt's almost like the opposite idea, but then we try to combine that and I think it's been working well. Generally, in the company there's not necessarily a lot of reviews or something that we always review everything that gets shipped this way because we do want people to feel that they can put something in the app and then we can try it out. It's more like let's just try it out, but then we do need to look at it again before we release it to everyone.\n\nLenny (00:12:25):\nA lot of founders, a lot of product leaders, a lot of designers definitely want to create space for craft and making products really great, something they're really proud of, but in practice it's really hard. Very few teams and companies do this. Is there anything else you've learned about creating space for this sort of thing and prioritizing it for founders that are listening that are trying to instill more and more of this or do you have to be a designer CO like Karri and really it's hard to do otherwise?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:12:53):\nI don't think actually. It's not purely coming from me. I think all of us founders like Jori and Tuomas additionally, their background is engineering, but I would say I think they spend even more time on the details than sometimes I do. I think very early on when it was the three of us I would be the one doing the broad strokes designs like this is how the UI works and this is how some of the things work. They were the ones that were like, \"Oh, there should be animation here and there should be this kind of thing here.\"\n\n(00:13:27):\nI think it's like that DNA I think comes from all of us. I think with the craft it always starts with people need to care about it. If it's not valued in the company, then it's very hard for anyone to do because people don't feel like it's valued. I gave this advice to some founder. He was asking me about it and in their case their founders were coming from different companies. Maybe this one founder came from Airbnb and then the other ones came from Facebook and Amazon. For example, I think Facebook and Amazon have a very different culture on quality or craft or shipping. I think it's what I said to them. You need to align on it. It's like you cannot run a company with multiple different kinds of cultures. I think I made some points like why the quality is important for certain products and you should all believe in that and then instill that with everyone you hire. The other thing I would say that we like to do is we actually don't have much PMs in the company.\n\n(00:14:32):\nWe only have one and we can talk about more about it. One of the things I think that happens is when you build a team and you start creating these very specific roles for everything I think that often the PM can be the ones figuring things out and making decisions and guiding the team, but they're not the ones building the feature. They're not there looking at it the whole day like where does this button go or how does it work? I think a lot of that, this craft for us happens when we give the project team this ownership and the project team is just engineering and design.\n\n(00:15:11):\nThen, when they start building that feature they start seeing these opportunities that this thing could be better. A good example of this is one of our engineers, Andreas. When we were building this right click menu in the app so you can click different things and under that you have sub-menus. Mac OS does this well where it's when you open that menu you hover on the menu and then you want to go to the sub-menu. You hover to the right. You don't have to go exactly horizontally to get into that menu.\n\n(00:15:44):\nYou can actually go diagonally or you don't actually have to hit the menu exactly. There's this safe zone, but a lot of software just implements like, \"Hey, let's do this menu. Let's make the sub-menu.\" It only works if you exactly hover over the menu. Then, what happens is the user often misses with few pixels what they were trying to do. What Andreas did, which we didn't tell him to do, is like, \"Yeah, this kind of sucks and we should make this better.\"\n\n(00:16:12):\nHe figured out a way to create those safe areas that are dynamic based on the sub-menu positioning and everything. It's much easier now. You can go diagonally to the actual thing you want to go to. I think these things happen when you give people more of the ownership of the project and also the space to do that and then you also have leadership or generally the company culture that values the quality or the craft.\n\nLenny (00:16:42):\nI got to follow this thread. There's a couple of questions I want to ask. You have one product manager. Would you call him the head of product?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:16:48):\nYeah, Nan Yu, he is the head of product.\n\nLenny (00:16:52):\nAwesome, what made you decide to hire him and even have any PMs?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:16:56):\nWe started to see that we have enough features and areas of the product and also the team speaker that it's hard to keep aligned on all of these things or even keep track of things. Initially, we actually hired Nan as a contractor to help us with this insights data tool. We have this data tool feature built in Linear so you can get data on what's happening in the workspace. For us founders, we realized none of us, we are not super experienced in data tools. We need someone to help out.\n\n(00:17:34):\nLuckily, Nan, we knew him and he actually worked at Mode, which is a data tool. We initially hired him like, \"Can you help us figure out what exactly should this data tool and how should it work?\" I think there's different ways of doing that. I think always the easiest way is let's just copy what some other company is doing, but we didn't want to do that. We wanted to figure out what is actually a useful way to use this data or get this data?\n\n(00:18:01):\nHe helped us with that and then we saw this could be useful in other larger areas or overall with the whole product it's like we might have these kind of questions. What should we exactly be thinking around here and why and how would we define this direction and then help the teams to also align on it? To us, it's more like he figures out the direction of the product and steers some of the efforts and not like he's there in every meeting and making every decision or writing every spec or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:18:38):\nAnother question along this line, because there's a lot of PMs listening that are going to be like, \"Oh, shit, these guys don't need PMs or PM is over, product management dead.\" Just another question along these lines, somebody needs to do the work that a PM does basically, right? There's all these things that is on the plate of a product manager when they're at a company and if they're not there, other people have to do those things. What I'm hearing is basically you give those responsibilities to the engineers, designer, and maybe other functions within the team. Is that right?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:19:06):\nYeah, I mean definitely I think what it means is, and there's definitely a trade-off. I think sometimes when companies specialize roles a lot it's because it's more efficient. If the engineer spends 100% of their time coding something, then it's like they're using their skillset to the max. Then, we just think that in order to build quality things or build things in a certain way it's actually better if people actually also spend some time thinking about things and not just executing.\n\n(00:19:35):\nYes, for every project there's a project lead. That lead can be engineer or designer. It's not a formal role or it's not based on your whatever level or it's just like you need to be certain title that you can be that. It's more like an assignment that now you are responsible getting the project started and working together with the team, figuring it out, and then communicating changes or communicating how that progress happens.\n\n(00:20:06):\nDefinitely it means that the engineers or designers also have to do these things and they do need to communicate and they do need to think about the scope or things. It's a different way of doing things. Also, not everyone wants to do that, which is fine, but we on the hiring front try to hire people that are interested in the broader scope than just the specific skillset that they have.\n\nLenny (00:20:36):\nI think those last two points are really essential. One, people often don't want to do this work and they are happy to offload it to a potential product manager. The fact that say engineers have to do all these boring PM things like communicate timelines and keep PR specs aligned and make sure timelines are hit and all that stuff and run meetings, a lot of people don't want to do that.\n\n(00:20:57):\nA lot of times they do and I think in this case people seem to really want to be doing that. The other is I think you need a really high caliber team that's very product-minded and the hiring bar needs to be very, very high for say engineers and designers to want to do all these things and be good at them. I think those are two necessary ingredients for this to work out.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:21:16):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:21:16):\nFor teams that want to try this approach, especially startups that are starting out and maybe not excited about hiring product managers, is there anything else that you think is essential or important to functioning well without any product managers? You're at around 50 people at this point?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:21:32):\nWe're around 50. Probably the only thing I would say is it's the hiring front that you really need to spend more time on it. Basically, you cannot really interview engineers only for the engineering skills. You also have to interview them for the product skills. Obviously, you cannot I think expect that people have some. If you do some PM interview for them, they're not going to have the same skillset or the same understanding of the concepts or something.\n\n(00:21:59):\nThe way we have done it in the past is basically I might interview them about the product. I'm not a technical person per se. I will just ask them questions about how did they do something or how do they think about something? It's similar to other roles too. We just look for does this person have opinions about products and how they work? Can they form opinions and can they use their own judgment at times? Then, can they communicate or articulate those things as well?\n\nLenny (00:22:30):\nAwesome, I was just thinking it's interesting that a tool that, I don't think it's designed specifically for product managers, but essentially for building products like the infrastructure for building product in a team is built by a company that has one PM and very few PMs.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:22:43):\nI mean I think in some ways I would say that with Linear we're trying to help the whole company and I think engineers is probably the largest user group of the product. I think in some ways we want to make the PM's job easier in that they have to spend less time managing everything or the day-to-day because the engineers are actually using the product and they're updating the things. For the PMs, it would be much more easier to get what is the state of things and maybe trust that much more because people actually use the product.\n\n(00:23:18):\nIn some ways, I think we are trying to make it easier for everyone, easier for the engineers. They can focus more on their work. Then, for PMs I think we're trying to make it so that they can also focus more on other things than just, I don't know, managing the tool that they use. I think that's not the most important job of a PM. I think they should be thinking more of the, I don't know, bigger picture or the other problems or figuring out the next features or something.\n\nLenny (00:23:47):\nJust one more question along these lines, there's other companies like Stripe I think waited until 200 employees to hire I think their first product manager. Snapchat I think is famous for something around that. Do you have any sense of if you think this might change, when you think you might hire more product managers? Is there a plan here or is it just see how it goes as you grow?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:24:05):\nI think we'll definitely hire more. It's I think like what I said before. I think we like to see the PM's smarts operating on a higher level. The whole company, I think the way we are trying to build it is we have less people, but people who are more high caliber and can think about larger scope than what their current role is.\n\n(00:24:29):\nI think we're just trying to build smaller units, but more effective units, which is I think where the PMs go. There would be also less of them and they're not there at every level. I think in the future as the company grows and the team grows and the product grows, we might have several PMs that are focusing on or looking at specific areas or specific types of things of the product or specific customers or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:24:57):\nAwesome, that was a tangent because I could not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft.\n\nLenny (00:25:00):\n... not go in that direction, but I want to come back to design again and craft. So it feels like Linear, one of the reasons you guys have been successful is design and experience is basically a huge differentiator from other products and there's always this question of can design be enough of a differentiator in specific markets? Is there always an opportunity to build a significantly better product experience and have a real shot at disrupting an incumbent? Do you have any sense of when design can be enough of a differentiator? And this is coming from a founder trend aside, should we go big on design and experience or should we invest in distribution or new technology or something along those lines? Any thoughts there?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:25:41):\nMy belief is that any domain or industry, the more it matters, the more the design matters. I think it's fairly easy to see in different, even in software or in other industries. It's like what happens is whenever there's a new paradigm, I don't know, it's the mobile or the web or something, the first iterations of those products existing there, they don't have to be super well-designed necessarily because they're the first. But then as you build the hundreds, thousand different email clients, any email client now has to be pretty good to be even considered an email client. The bar is so high.\n\n(00:26:23):\nI think today the startups, I don't know if you look at the webpage Google launched with or the webpage YouTube launched with or some of these older companies, they were very basic. If you launch that website today, no one would really pay attention. So I think the design is, it's almost like a very basic thing now, that from pretty much from the very beginning you need pretty high level design for people to even pay attention or consider you seriously.\n\n(00:26:56):\nAnd I think it's not necessarily fair because sometimes it's like maybe the product is really good but they didn't have a designer or they didn't have time to do it and then people just dismiss it because it doesn't seem like something that they interest them. So I think that's the first thing is I think it is, and it's going to be more and more important. But I would also say design is never going to be the reason why a company is successful. It's like the company still has to have some other things. The product still needs to be something, it needs to be better in some ways or it needs to be different in some ways.\n\n(00:27:36):\nAnd then a design is just enabling some of these things, enable and similar to technology, it's like if you have good technology, it's easier to do certain things and the product works better in some ways than you having a bad technology or bad infrastructure.\n\n(00:27:53):\nSo similar to design, I think if you have a good design or even a good brand, people are drawn into it and then it makes some user acquisition or user retention or just even people perception of the product better. I think an example is packaging and products, is like Apple or a lot of companies spend a lot of time effort into the packaging because it's kind of already sets the expectations for the user who is receiving the product. It's like even before you use the product, you start thinking that this is a high quality product and I'm going to love it. And then when you actually have it, then you actually might feel that way, unless the product is really bad and then you wouldn't feel that way.\n\n(00:28:40):\nSo I think similarly, with startups or SaaS, it's like your landing page or some of the other things. It's like they are already communicating something to the user and they're setting the expectations and then I think that that can be very useful thing, especially early on when no one really knows you or knows the product or cares about you. So I think especially, I feel like design can be very good leverage in the beginning.\n\nLenny (00:29:08):\nI think that's such an interesting insight, especially that first thing you said around how the more often and the more crowded the spaces, the more opportunity there is for design to be a differentiator. Is that roughly how you think about it?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:29:21):\nYeah. So I mean just think about, I don't know, any product category, basically people have then a lot of choices and then they how do they make choices? Maybe there's a specific thing they want, but a lot of people don't necessarily know what is the specific feature I want from this software. So it's more like, well what is the best one? What is the highest quality one? And if you put things side by side and people see things, people are visual. So then the design can be one of those things, it stands out, it's like, \"Well, that looks the best or that looks the most quality product to me, so I'm going to use that one.\" When people have a lot of choices, they probably will pick the one that looks most interesting.\n\n(00:30:04):\nThen I think there is, the second part is the brand, which is something that if you can build a brand, then I think it's even the product almost doesn't matter, it becomes this kind of default. I don't know again, like Apple or Nike, it's like yeah, there's all kinds of shoes you can buy, but there's a reason for someone to buy Nike shoes other than some random brand. Even if the random brand would be actually a better shoe, they still buy Nike because they, I don't know, like the brand. So then I think both the design of the product but also the design of the brand can be very strong things that pull people to your company or to the product.\n\nLenny (00:30:48):\nIs there anything you've learned about just building a brand over the course of building Linear, something you find to be really important in actually building that perception that Linear is really great and amazing\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:30:59):\nTo me, I think the brand should be always authentic and it should, I think even if people can't articulate it, if people start to feel like something is off, I think there can be companies or startups, they think about brands like, oh brand is the logo or the colors of the website or something. And then they do the same thing and some other company does and then they think, \"Okay, now we have a brand.\" But you actually didn't think about what's your brand, what is the message or voice you want to talk about? And it doesn't also, the brand doesn't happen overnight.\n\n(00:31:34):\nSo it's basically just you start in the beginning and when you start a company you don't have no brand and so you have to create it and you create it over time by the things you do, the things you say, how you say them and how do you approach things, how do you treat customers, how do you build the website or the product? All of these things starts to build this idea, what does this company mean to me in people's heads?\n\n(00:32:02):\nI know we both worked at Airbnb and I think Brian Chesky is, I think the brand was probably the most important thing for him. And I don't know how many hours or meetings or conversations there was about the brand and the brand was always, it's part of everything the company does. Because it's true. It's like, yeah, you could book things like places to stay in a lot of places on the web, but when people think about, \"Oh, I want to stay in some cool place,\" they're going to think about Airbnb. It's like they're not going to think about those other places. So that's the power of the brand, people stop thinking about the other things or they start understanding, okay, this is the thing for this.\n\nLenny (00:32:43):\nAnd it's part of the reason Airbnb's been able to build a direct destination where people aren't Googling, I want to stay in a home. They're like airbnb.com, which gives Airbnb such a massive advantage not having to run ads on Facebook and Google or SEO. It's just like people know Airbnb and they just go straight there. And there's very few sites where people go, \"I'm going to go straight there and look for some,\" knowing that they can also compare hotels on all these other sites.\n\n(00:33:08):\nComing back to design briefly, just very practically, how do you guys do design reviews? Just how do you actually go about reviewing what's going at, and then this may be too big a question, but just whatever you can share here, is just how do you know when it's done? How do you know when it's ready and approved? Karri sealed, checkbox, ready to go.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:33:26):\nWe've been exploring different ways of doing this. I think today, I still run the design team, so I do see some of the designs on a weekly basis and then, or one of the other co-founders or head of product, we are basically the sponsors for the projects. So then we are responsible reviewing the work. And so we might just have a meeting where we go through, okay, well let's go through the demo and people can explain what's going on and how they think about it and why. And then we might have feedback, okay, this seems strange or something, and then just after that I might just go into the product myself and try it out. And then what happens sometimes, it's in the initial stages, obviously we're not going to start fixing everything, it's just more like let's try to get the main concept there and figure out how it works.\n\n(00:34:27):\nBut then before we are launching it, I might just go in and try it out and try the different states and click it around. And sometimes I find things, like we were building this threading to comments and then when it looked all good in the demos and stuff, and then I went to try it and try different lengths of messages and stuff and then I start to see, oh, sometimes the animations are kind of janky or it's just off. They don't go the right way, the screen doesn't scroll exactly right. So then I just captured those things and send it to the team. And so we had to pull back the release a little bit until those things were fixed. That one was, it's very, I think a simple concept and it's very known concept like, okay, this is how threading comments works. So that was mostly about, okay, what's the execution of this?\n\n(00:35:22):\nBut then we have projects where we are not sure exactly how this should work and we can try it ourselves. We also have to see how companies use it. So something like we built this feature project updates and it's a common thing companies do. It's like you need to write an update on a project. Is it yellow, green, red? And companies have very different ways of doing this in different tools and we just thought, well, I think it would be really nice if it's inside Linear and the team, when they work on a project, they can write the update, Linear can also capture some of the stats, what actually happened. I think with that feature it's been working well, but then also now it'd be exploring. It's like after using it a while we think, oh actually, if there could be more robust way of following these updates. Maybe the leadership could just get these updates over email or maybe when you have a lot of updates you should have a search or a filtering system or something. So I think a lot of times we just think, okay, this is the scope of it for now and we are okay launching this and the execution is good. But we know that this is not the fully figured out version and we just need to see people trying it out and see the feedback.\n\nLenny (00:36:36):\nSo it sounds like on the decision of whether it goes out or not, it's kind of this intuitive feeling from your actual experience trying it out, feeling gut level, this is ready or this needs a little work?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:36:46):\nYeah, I would say a lot of things that we do is more like that but we don't do AP testing or we don't do specific, go follow certain metrics or something. Sometimes we do have telemetry or we can look at how people use certain things and we sometimes do that, but that's not usually the goal we have in mind, like, yeah, we should move this number this much. So it's more about based on the understanding of the problem we have and based on the [inaudible 00:37:16], what we think is right, is this the right solution and is this a good enough solution to be released to the customers?\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nOne more question along this thread is how do you actually structure these reviews? It sounds like you go straight to a prototype. Is there a design review phase? Is it all kind of informal and people just review, here's what we need your feedback on?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:37:38):\nSo projects don't necessarily have specific states to them, but I would say roughly, usually we do start with design. So there's some explorations on the design, there's different ways that we could approach this or sometimes there's just one way because pretty clear. But then what I said before, is that we do try to get into the building phase as quickly as possible because then we can also see is this direction actually reasonable and is there some problems it causes or how does it just generally feel here? So I think that there isn't specific review stages. It's more like, yeah, let's check on this project every week or every two weeks and then before releasing, let's also make a review of it and really test it out, is it the quality we want?\n\nLenny (00:38:34):\nAwesome. So that's a good segue to another area I wanted to spend some time, which is the Linear Method. You espouse this way of building product that you call the Linear Method, which you publish online and willing to in the show notes. And I just want to ask a few questions around this way of building product. One is, you are big on this idea of building opinionated software. Can you talk about just what does that mean and then maybe give an example or two of how you actually have done that at Linear?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:39:02):\nSo first with the Linear Method, why did we create it in the first place? Is we just believe that there is more of this modern ways of building software and thinking about it. And we wanted to share some of our thinking on it. And that's also, it relates to how we built Linear as well. So you might understand why we make some choices because this is the way we think about making these choices. So we are trying to share our thinking behind the product and also just like, here's the product and figure it out.\n\n(00:39:33):\nSo the opinionated piece, I personally have this belief that productivity software should be, and especially company software should be opinionated. I think that what the productivity software is trying to do is make people productive. And I think what productive means is you actually do something that matters for the company, which is, I don't know, build some new feature or fix something or design something.\n\n(00:40:02):\nAll of those things are eventually, they provide some kind of value for the customer. I think there is this ideas or notions in the world that flexible software is great. I'm like, I think it can be great sometimes. But what happens is people start spending a lot of time figuring things out. Like, how does this feature work? You can use it in 10 different ways and then every team or everyone figures out the different way of doing it.\n\n(00:40:27):\nSo our thinking is we like to provide this good default or good opinions. Like, this is how the feature works and this is how the workflow works. So you, as a user or as a team don't have to think about it and you can focus on the work you do. And the other thing is, my design mantra is always design something for someone. It is very hard to design everything for everyone because you just end up with a very generalized solution. So then what we are trying to do with the opinionated solution is that that's the best solution or at the most optimized solution we think of.\n\n(00:41:06):\nAnd then when you use it, hopefully you agree and you can feel that it's most optimized. So being opinionated, I think the value it provides people is you don't have to think too much or spend more time on the tool than you do on your actual work.\n\nLenny (00:41:23):\nAnd then another core element of the Linear Method is something you call cycles. I know Linear is all around this idea of creating cycles and working in cycles. Can you talk about what is a cycle and how it works at Linear?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:41:35):\nSo for example, the cycles, it's optional, not that the whole team has to use it or not that the whole company has to use it, but it's there as you can turn it on or off. But basically, I think why we created cycles is that I think any team that works on software or some other products, you always have almost infinite list of things to do and that list gets longer every day. And it can be sometimes very distracting for the individual or for the team to decide, there's a new thing coming in, should we work on that or should we work on this other thing we decided in the past? So the cycles is just a way to say that for the next week or the next two weeks or whatever timeframe, we are going to work on these things and these other things we think are the priority or the focus for this timeframe.\n\n(00:42:27):\nAnd then the team can try to focus on those things. Now if something happens, like I don't know, we really need to jump on this other thing. At least there was some kind of initial state that we decided before we want to do these things and then now something else happened and so now we have to go on this thing. So you have an answer when someone comes to you to ask, \"Why didn't you do this other thing before?\" Then you can say, \"Well, we did decide to do that, but then something happened and we had to do this other thing.\"\n\n(00:42:56):\nSo the cycles, it's very similar to sprints, but we like to call it cycles because we are not really sprinting anywhere. The cycles also run on automated schedule. So it's like you don't have to think about which day does it start? Or every time, set it up manually so it just runs automatically. And so it's just meant to help the team to focus on, let's just focus on this few things and forget about the infinite list of other things that are in the background.\n\nLenny (00:43:27):\nYou mentioned earlier that you don't set metrics goals and so let me dig into that a little bit. Is that true? You don't really have number goals for features for launches and things like that? And so let me start there and then I have a follow-up question.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:43:41):\nSo we might have a company level goal sometimes, for example, weekly active users, that's a metric we want to increase or something. But in terms of specific features, we don't have goals for those. And the reason is that I think a product like us or a system that is used by different kinds of companies, and it's like a system made of multiple different parts and it's not necessarily like you want to optimize any specific thing about it. Also, companies are a little bit different, so their usage of different features can differ because they just operate slightly differently or their team size is different or the setup of the team is different or the culture is different.\n\n(00:44:27):\nSo I think for example, I don't know, some Instagram or some of these apps, it's like, yeah, we need to drive engagement and that's the main feature. That's the main metric for every feature. We don't actually have that. We just think that there should be features that help companies and sometimes we can look at the metrics before we start working on it, like let's see what this state of things are, but we don't necessarily want to set, oh, we need to increase this specific metric by X. It's more like we want to solve this problem. And ideally, the success what it looks like customers agree that the problem is solved or they enjoy the solution and it's not like that the metrics went up.\n\nLenny (00:45:08):\nSo just to summarize so far, you have no metrics, you have no experiments, you have essentially no PMs, just one product leader. You spend a lot of time on design and craft and making things awesome. I'm curious just what you think it takes to make a company work in that way? Because this is pretty different from how a lot of other founders think and a lot of other product teams work.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:45:32):\nWe like to talk about this internally, I like this mixture of magic and science and how we described, there's always some level of science that we do. And I think some companies are very scientific on their product management that they like to measure everything and they do a lot of tests and things, but we just decided we don't think that's necessary or that's good for us. So the science for us, means that we do talk to users a lot and any project we start with, we do some level of user research and as founders, different people on the team, we might have weekly calls with customers or users. We also encourage everyone in the team, go to the customer Slack, they answer people questions. We have shared Slack channels with customers. Anyone, I sometimes go answer the questions there. I also see when they complain about something. I think the first part is the whole team has to be really understanding the product and the customers and the problems people are facing and have that empathy and as well as the understanding what is the state of things today.\n\n(00:46:47):\nAnd then we talk about that. And then sometimes we might pull up stats and see, oh, wonder, is there some kind of patterns we see, okay, these kind of companies are using this thing more and what do we think about it? But usually we have some kind of question we want to answer. It's like, I wonder what is going on. And then we look at it versus let's pull some metrics and then decide that we should increase this metric. And then the magic part is what happens when you build this understanding, everyone in the company builds. It's not like everyone has the same understanding, but everyone builds more of that customer and product understanding. Then we have discussions like what should we be doing or what decision we want to make here? Then everyone is much more informed of actual reality of the customers or the product.\n\n(00:47:40):\nAnd then we think you can much more use your intuition or thinking to do those decisions so you don't have to use data or metrics to back those things up. So I think the main thing is the whole company has to be with the customers or talk to them and then understand where the product might work well or where it might fall short.\n\nLenny (00:48:05):\nThat's what I imagined you were going to say, and I love hearing that. For someone that wants to create a similar culture, is there tactically anything you find, just understand if your employees and engineers, designers have enough of that context and really understand the problem?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:48:20):\nI think it's always, different people in a company will have different understandings. It's not like you can expect everyone will every day go to see everything and has this. But we do sometimes sessions with the team or we do record videos with the customers, we write notes and we share this with people. I feel like again, it's fairly apparent, if you know your customers or the product, it's a very different way you can talk about it versus if you don't have any idea. I think if you don't have any idea, you probably don't even know what to say.\n\n(00:48:59):\nSo I think it's apparent if people have that then, it's not like every project's like we need everyone to have this understanding. Probably, usually enough if one or two people have that understanding or have different understanding of different things. So I think again, I feel like it's a culture thing. I think the other thing is you just have to kind of believe in it.\n\n(00:49:26):\nI think sometimes people use data a lot or too much because they're worrying or they're afraid that, will I make the wrong choice? And I'm using data to make the choice for me. But then you might still feel like this is not the right choice, but the data is telling me is the right choice and then turns out maybe it was the right choice or not. But it's more like, again, like a practice thing. I think the company and you need to be okay that sometimes we make mistakes and we made the wrong choice and then we just can fix it. But at least we made that choice and the data didn't make that choice for us.\n\nLenny (00:50:03):\nWhat's interesting about-\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:50:00):\nThe data didn't make that choice for us.\n\nLenny (00:50:03):\nWhat's interesting about this is if you've heard the episode on RAMP and how Ramp builds product with Geoff Charles, there's such different ways of building product. Ramp is all about velocity, shipping all the time, metrics, measuring everything. And your approach is almost the opposite. And I think what's interesting there, as a takeaway, is just there's many ways to do it. You just have to do it almost fully and you have to have really specific people. It feels like the people want to work in a certain way. And a lot of it I think also is the founder has to be natural to the way the founder operates and thinks about building and building a company.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:50:39):\nYeah, and for sure. And then if you look at successful companies and Amazon is very different than Apple in how they operate. And I think both of them are successful, but not in the same way.\n\n(00:50:50):\nSo I think it's, again, it's like... Yeah, it's a decision you make as a company or as a founder, what kind company you want to build. I do think there is some aspects of the domain that you're in. What does that domain and the problem space require from that company? And for us, I think it's... I think we are in the retention business. And the trust business that ideally we have a company starting use Linear very early on and then they stay with us forever. And I think the only way we can do that is we need to continuously deliver them good quality product and maintain that trust that we are... That we don't fail them more or somehow otherwise mistreat them.\n\n(00:51:36):\nAnd I think some businesses are much more transactional where it's like, yeah, we just need to make this e-commerce sale. And then once it's done, we don't care what happens.\n\n(00:51:47):\nSo our case, it's more like we really need to build this relationship over time. And then that's why I think some of the choices we make are also more about respecting the customer versus we're just wanting to drive the revenue of the company.\n\nLenny (00:52:02):\nAwesome.

Hey, have you thought about this yet?\" And I know that a lot of VCs are just reaching out to you all the time, all these really fan CVCs that are just trying to talk to you and get close to you. And I just know you're really good at avoiding shiny objects and staying really focused and really heads down. And I've always wanted to just ask you, how do you do that? Do you have any tricks, systems, processes, approaches to staying focused other than just ignore the inbox mostly?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:53:39):\nYeah. I don't think there's any complicated processes. And so I think one of the things, I was in YC in 2012 and one of the main things they say there is what you should be focusing on when you build a startup is talk to customers, build the product, exercise. And if you find yourself doing something else, then those three things, it's probably the wrong thing to do.\n\nLenny (00:54:02):\nAnd the third one you said exercise or...\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:54:03):\nYeah, yeah. And the exercise is that it's important for you to be healthy or not just burn yourself out. So I think it was a balance [inaudible 00:54:17] to that.\n\nLenny (00:54:17):\nLove it.\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:54:19):\nSo I'm doing those three things.\n\n(00:54:23):\nI think the thinking there is, I think we often as a company also talk about this, and very early on. And I use this the same way and I think the company can use it the same way. I think there's always things that you're supposed to do or it sounds like a good idea to do. And it could be like, yeah, come to this podcast. And I actually think before it wasn't like...\n\n(00:54:47):\nOr I always have this question, is this important to do now or is it important to maybe do later? So I think, for example, the question on this podcast is I didn't feel like it was important to do it earlier because we weren't at the stage or a scale or something that I think it'd be as interesting or something. So I think it was a better timing to do it later.\n\n(00:55:09):\nSimilarly, when we built the product, initially we were just very focused on is this really important thing to do? There's always like, yeah, you could get SOC 2 security certificate. And we know that eventually we need to get it, but we don't need it today. So we just say no to that. And if customer asks for it, so we say we don't have it. And we'll have it one day but not now. And see, a lot of times people are like, \"Okay, that's fine.\"\n\n(00:55:38):\nAnd then internally, we also talk about this, you knowing RPG games, you have the main quest lines and then you have the side quest lines. And we often talk about the companies avoid the side quests. There's always ideas people have and it's a good thing and it's like people have ideas, but then it might be like, \"Yeah, let's make this T-shirt, so let's make this thing.\" And then we're like, \"Well, does it help the customers? Does it help the product?\" This sounds like a side quest to me, and basically means we shouldn't do it. This doesn't progress the main quest line, which is building this product and making it awesome for these customers.\n\n(00:56:17):\nSo it's similar to me. It's like I operate this way personally too, that I think about \"Is this important for the main quest line in building this company for me? Or is this something that I can ignore for now, or something that I can do later and it makes more sense then?\"\n\nLenny (00:56:35):\nThat is such incredibly good advice. Basically ask yourself, \"How important is this to do now? And is this the main quest or is this a side quest?\" Amazing.\n\n(00:56:47):\nOkay, so let's talk about hiring. As with most areas, you're very, very, very deliberate about hiring. The bar is so insanely high at Linear, and you also hire very few people. So just a few questions along these lines, just one is when you're hiring people, what do you look for that you think maybe other people are not looking for enough? And where do you spend a lot of time?\n\nKarri Saarinen (00:57:09):\nI think one of the things all of us founders saw in this high-growth company is that sometimes the high growth, especially on the employee side, is not that great. It can create a lot of chaos or just messiness. Or just generally in my past and working in companies, it's almost never... It was always easier to work with a smaller team, very high quality people than with a very large team of more average people. It's almost like it's always faster and better output when you have a much more smaller team.\n\n(00:57:43):\nThat was the thing with Linear too, is we just believe that you can actually build better with less people than you can with more people. So that's the basic belief we have. So then when it goes to hiring, we've been taking very slow steps on it that in almost the first year we didn't hire anyone. Then the second year we hired a couple people, and then the second year we hired a few more. We never more than doubled in a year. And that's been our guideline that we shouldn't more than double. And this might be something we change in the future that we actually might do less than that.\n\n(00:58:20):\nBut when we look into hiring, it is a couple things. One is also that it obviously depends on the role, but basically I would say with every role, we often talk about there needs to be some taste or some this kind of understanding of how things are done or what's the... People have more a broader perspective than whatever their role is.\n\n(00:58:46):\nSo we talked about the engineering before that they do need to do some of this BM type of stuff. And so what we look for in them is that if they have some of this skill set or product thinking, or they can articulate why some choices are better than some others, or in their past did they disagree with some of the company's choices or the team's choices, or... So we want to have this... Obviously they need to be good developers, but also do they have this a product sensibility, or do they have a judgment around that?\n\n(00:59:22):\nAnd this goes similar to, for example, a marketing hire is... We think about, yeah, we do need the marketing skill sets, but then we also want to see that this person also maybe is a good storyteller or they have this appreciation for writing or stories or they have a taste of what's interesting and what's not.\n\n(00:59:46):\nSo I think, or when we hire operations person, we also like to see that they maybe have understanding on HR and maybe it's not their role, but they understand it. And what happens is when you have these people that are a little bit more than their title, it's like the company is, I think, much more easier to manage because it's like people can pick up things more easily or they can work together more easily because everyone has more like a shared areas or you rarely get to the point people say it's not my job. It's more like people understand, okay, yeah, I'm kind of in operations, but today I need to help on this HR thing, which is okay. And so that's what we look for people is they are more than their... They can take more scope than their skill set would assume, or what normally is expected from them.\n\nLenny (01:00:45):\nSo essentially you're looking for these Venn diagram overlappings across different functions and teammates.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:00:51):\nYeah. I think the other thing is, like I said before, is we want to build much... I think a company that has less employees, which means that it's... Like I said before, we don't want that many specialized roles or too specific areas of ownership or something. We just think that we could build this... We could have less people and those people can take on more scope and they can own more scope.\n\n(01:01:19):\nI think traditionally, I feel like in companies, how do you get more scope is that you advance in the levels of the company because there's a lot of different teams and different levels. And then to get any kind of scope, you need to rise into this higher levels. And what we try to do is you don't actually have to have that many levels, but people can just already, when they start, they can start owning more areas.\n\n(01:01:45):\nAnd I think that can be much more also interesting, not to everyone, but I think interesting to many people. And it's kind of like how I also always felt about us being a designer is I didn't feel like my job is purely just looking at the designs. I also thought I actually need to be helping this business or helping this other area as well. So I think it's just also natural to me.\n\nLenny (01:02:10):\nAwesome. So one thing you didn't mention is you have a really unique way of interviewing, which is a paid work trial. Can you just talk about what that is? And also just while you're in that area, you talked about testing for product sensibility, so whatever you can share how you actually do that would be awesome.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:02:27):\nYeah. So we do with all of the employees, we've done a paid work trial and depends on the role, what it looks like, how long it is and depends on also sometimes on the person. But basically we do fairly standard interview loops where we test... We have some hiring manager interviews and then skill interviews or tests. And then the last step of the process is the work trial.\n\n(01:02:53):\nAnd basically, they basically come as a mini contractor to the company, and we give them a very usually fairly vague problem statements. If you're an engineer, it's like, hey, there's this feature that needs to be built. How would you build it? Then go build it. And so basically they need to first understand the problem. Then they need to scope it down to something that they can do in the timeframe that they have. And then they actually go... They get the access to a code base. They can actually go and go and build a version of it. And then at the end they can present the work they did.\n\n(01:03:29):\nAnd why we do this is that we just seeing that it's a very good way to see for both of us, both for the company and the candidates to see how we work together. And I think for the candidate, what they can see is, what kind of company are you joining, what is it like to work here, and what is [inaudible 01:03:53] ownership or how do I approach this?\n\n(01:03:55):\nI think a lot of engineers also like that they see the code base and they're like, oh wow, this is really clean and it's not some kind of spaghetti code type of thing situation. So I think it helps the candidates as well understand what are they signing off for, which I think can be very risky sometimes. Especially with startups, it's really hard to tell how the startup is operating just from the interviews. And in large companies, I think things are more standardized. So I think they're more similar and it's easier to make that choice. But with startups, it can be very different how companies operate.\n\nLenny (01:04:32):\nYeah. That is so unique and I rarely hear of a company being able to hire that way. I imagine one of the reasons you can get away with that where people don't have a full-time job for a while, while we're doing a paid trial is because Linear is such an enticing place to work. I imagine for a lot of companies they can't really do that. But I guess any thoughts on just maybe more companies can actually pull this off?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:04:51):\nYeah, I think it's always like if you don't ask, you don't know. I think in our case that's just been the standard and we try to work with the candidate. Let's figure out maybe we do it on the weekend or maybe we do it some other vacation holiday or something. So there can be ways we can schedule it so that it causes as little kind of problems to the candidate as possible.\n\n(01:05:16):\nAnd I think we only had only a few people probably have ever declined it. It's not like I think everyone else has been, at least after the fact, they've been happy that they did it because they felt like they had a much better sense of the company they're joining. And then also during that workshop, they can actually join our meetings, they get access to our Slack and Notion, and they also have one-on-one chats with some of the other people on the team.\n\n(01:05:43):\nSo they already get to know people. So it's a good way for them to evaluate us as well. And then for us, it's obviously we can see... What is important for us to see is how does this person operate in this kind of environment and how do they approach problems? How do they think and are they able to make progress in a very short timeframe, which I always think it's very important for startups. In large companies, you have maybe all the time in the world to do stuff. But I think any kind of startup, even with us when we take our time doing things sometimes, it's still important. We can do things quickly if we have to.\n\nLenny (01:06:21):\nSuper cool. Just to close the thread on product sensibility, is there anything you could share of just how you actually help understand someone's strength and ability there?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:06:30):\nYeah. I wouldn't say we have some kind of very scientific or some special way figure it out for this. So I think a lot of it, it's like a discussion of... And I often think ask people that... Ask about their projects and I try to go deeper. It's like why was this decision made? Why do you think the decision was made? And I might ask, \"Do you think it was the right decision or did you agree on it?\" Or ask about what you think you would have done differently or something.\n\n(01:07:04):\nSo I think it's more like I'm trying to... In this area and what their answers is. And people's answers can be very different levels. Some people might be, \"Yeah, I didn't like it. Which yeah, it's not opinion, but it's not based on anything. It's just like you didn't like it. You should be able to expand on it saying well, I don't like it because in this case it would not work well for this kind of users or in this kind of context or for this kind of purposes.\n\n(01:07:33):\nSo they have more of this reasoning or some kind of rational why they think this way and they can articulate that. So I think that's what we often testing for is can they do this and how well they can do it. Then there can be very wide ranges of how people do it. And when you see someone who really thinks about this stuff, it's very clear to see that they can just talk about it forever and they can go deeper and deeper. And then some people that maybe haven't had the experience or don't think this way, they're like, yeah, I don't really know. I just built it and then seemed fine.\n\nLenny (01:08:18):\nLet's transition to the third area I wanted to spend some time on, which is growth. And basically I'd love to just understand how Linear grows and what you figured out around growth, especially in B2B SaaS.\n\n(01:08:29):\nSo our first question here is just how long did it take from starting to work on Linear to launching, say, V1, something that a number of people can use?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:08:38):\nSo we started officially in 2019. Some, I think, months before that we were already exploring and prototyping the product. So I think we prototyped different kinds of designs a little bit.\n\n(01:08:52):\nAnd then we also, one of the things we really wanted to solve is we wanted to make the application really fast. And the way we figured out we do that is we have more of this local-based data structure where all the data lives in the client, and then it gets synced on the backends with this delta [inaudible 01:09:13].\n\n(01:09:13):\nAnd back then, we were just exploring different off-the-shelf solutions and systems, but there was nothing really there, so we ended up building our own. And so we spent some time prototyping that. And then once we officially, I think, started working on the company in April 2019, and then we announced the company roughly mid-April, and we had this little website up with the wait list. And then I think by May we could use it ourselves. And then we started inviting some friends to try it out.\n\n(01:09:49):\nBut then I think in June, I think we started more inviting people from the wait list. And around June, July, I think we had about, I don't know, 100, 200 users on it and maybe about 10 companies or something. And then we were in this private beta stage for almost a year. And the way we did it was just like we had this wait list of people on the wait list. There was few survey questions, like what kind of tools you use today and then why do you want to use Linear and what's the company size?\n\n(01:10:23):\nAnd we invited people based on... We invited more smaller companies using the tools we currently supported. And then also I was trying to see who is more interested versus just, I don't know, I just want to try it out type of people. And then a year later, in June, we launched it publicly. And back then maybe we already had, I don't know, several hundred of companies using it. And then we also launched the pricing and I think almost all of them... Maybe one company didn't subscribe, but everyone else subscribed to that paid plan.\n\nLenny (01:11:01):\nOkay. There's a number of really interesting things here. So one is you're in private beta for a year and then a year later, you launched. How long was that period between starting to incubate and starting to build to that private beta milestone?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:11:16):\nYeah, I think it's just a few months. I think just-\n\nLenny (01:11:19):\nJust a few months of building the V1?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:11:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:11:22):\nWow, okay. I thought it was a lot longer. That is so interesting. Okay. What a team you've got over there.\n\n(01:11:27):\nOkay. And then this survey piece is really interesting. I've heard a little bit about this story. So essentially you launched it on Twitter. You had kind of a following. Your founders had a bit of a following, so I think that helped build up the initial wait list.\n\n(01:11:39):\nBut what you did there wasn't just like, hey, go sign up for a wait list and you just add email addresses. It's a survey asking them what tools they use, whether it's GitHub or something else, and then also the size of the company and their interest. And that helped you basically prioritize who to go after and who to onboard. Is that right?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:11:56):\nYeah. And the reason we did it, because we know that we didn't support everything and what I said before and the focus is we want to also be focused on let's just build a version that can work for some people or some companies. We don't have to try to address everyone in the world in the first months of the business. And even before, after that. So it was very selective process. And I think we were fortunate that we were able to get people sign up on a wait list and I think after a month or so we had maybe 4,000 people on the wait list.\n\n(01:12:34):\nAnd then we had this internal... I think initially it was just a very manual process, but eventually we built this invite tool that we could just send invites. But in the beginning, I would go read the actual surveys in a spreadsheet, then I copied the email, and then I emailed them the invite link from my personal email. And then I would just email them after a few days or a week and it's like, \"Hey, what do you think?\"\n\n(01:13:01):\nAnd the reason we... And so we would invite only like... In the beginning, we maybe invited like 10 people a week. And eventually we increased those amounts. But the reason we did it that way was that we thought that if you just invite everyone at once or a lot of people at once, all of those people are going to probably hit the same problems in this kind of software that is very early stage. So I don't know. They hit the same bug or the same problem in the software. So then they will all send us feedback like, hey, there's this problem. And then we felt like it was a wasted effort.\n\n(01:13:36):\nSo we would just do these cohorts. Let's invite these people and then they say, hey, this is a problem. This doesn't work, or something. Then we go fix that. Then after we fix that, we invite the next cohort of people. Then they say, well, there's this thing that is needed or this doesn't work, then we fix that.\n\n(01:13:54):\nSo for that year, we did these cohorts and then always get the feedback from the cohort saying this is wrong or this doesn't work, and then we'll fix that. So eventually, I think it was much more... I think an effective way of doing the initial development than just inviting or letting everyone to use the product right at the beginning.\n\nLenny (01:14:16):\nThere's so many interesting lessons from this. I wanted to ask how you got your first 10 customers. And what I'm hearing essentially was from this wait list, you launched it on Twitter, people signed up, you picked people to let onboard, you worked with them over the course of a year to make it what they needed, and then eventually you started charging.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:14:33):\nYeah. I think the first 10 companies using it, I think maybe a little over half. Maybe there was three friends that have startups and they used it. And then I think the majority of them were just from this wait list. But they didn't pay us anything. We didn't have pricing in the beginning or during the private beta. At some point we started building the payments function, so we just added a page in the settings that you can optionally pay.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:15:00):\nThe page in the settings that you can optionally pay and then we just give you a slider that's, how much do you want to pay per seat? Then we just see if... I know some people paid $28 per seat and some people pay $1, but it doesn't matter, we just wanted to test the functionality and see what people think. After a year, when we launched, we already had... In the, I don't know, first week of launching, we had probably some hundreds of customers.\n\nLenny (01:15:34):\nI have never heard of the approach to pricing as just an actual sliding scale where people can slide the scale themselves on how much they want to pay. Did that help you figure out what to charge, or is it mostly just an experiment?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:15:46):\nI don't think it gave enough data to decide, but I think it was good to see that there was some people that went... I think that 20 was probably the maximum that people could pay, so I think there was some people that went to it and they felt like, \"Actually, yeah, I really love the products. I'm happy to pay $20.\" I think at least it gave us some confidence that, if we charge for this and it's something under $20, there's going to be market for it.\n\nLenny (01:16:16):\nI want to hear about the story of how you've started to feel product market fit, whatever that means to you. When did you start to feel like, \"Wow, this is actually going to work and maybe this is going to be a real business\"?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:16:31):\nYeah, I think we've always been, I don't know, some paranoid or... I guess maybe a paranoid is a good way about the product market fit. I think it's paranoid in a way, we are always wondering, \"Do we really have it?\" And, \"With who do we have it?\" I think it's true in our business, that... I think we started feeling it very early on, and when people first started using it and we could see, \"Now the whole company is using it and they seem happier using it and the feedback is good and they might have some additional asks for us,\" but we started feeling like there was definitely a product market fit with certain customer and these were more smaller, early-stage companies maybe where the founder is still running the product and they care about the speed of the shipping or they have certain values in a way, so it was a good fit with them.\n\n(01:17:27):\nThen I think we always know that we want to address the whole market and also just these early-stage customers, but we knew that if a Fortune 500 company came to us then, or even today, we might not be... I don't think we can provide them the solution today that works for them, so I don't think the fit is there. For us, the way we think about is, \"Do we have the fit in the specific segments?\" And how strong that fit is. In the company's journey, the first year, we just focused on, \"Can we get the fit...\" In the first two years, we focused on, \"Can we get the fit in the early stage startup segment?\" Basically, the goal was, \"We want to be the default for startups, the default tool that the startups pick, and I think we were able to accomplish that, but we just purely focused on that segment and getting the product market fit there.\n\n(01:18:28):\nAt the same time, we started getting some larger companies and we saw, \"Yeah, it's not really great for you right now, but let's work on it, making it better,\" so I think the last two years we've been focusing on that. It's like, \"How do we make the software work better? How do we get the product market fit stronger in this larger company segments that are hundreds of people or 1000 people?\"\n\nLenny (01:18:53):\nI think this is such a good way and smart way of thinking about product market fit. A lot of people see product market fit as this binary, \"I have it or I don't,\" and, \"When am I going to really feel product market fit?\" What you're describing is what I often hear, it's more of this spectrum of more and more confidence that there's product market fit and, even more specifically, it's product market fit with segments of the market. It's this map of the world and you're just slowly acquiring territory in the market with specific elements and then, over time, it grows and grows.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:19:23):\nYeah, I think a spectrum is a good way to think about it, too. I feel like there's this blog post written in the past where you know when you have product market fit and I think it probably... It's like that for some, I don't know, social consumer apps. If it's taking off or not, then you don't really have a lot of different segments, or you don't really think about it, you have millions of users and then you see it's taking off, so you have a product market fit. I think in more like a B2B world. I think there's always... You can have different sizes of customers, you can have different domains the customers are in, or there's different categories where you might be doing really well in one category and then not that well another.\n\n(01:20:14):\nI think maybe the countering to do things is that, actually, if you're doing really well in some category, just double down on that. This is something I talked to the Zoom founder, Eric, at some point in the company's lifecycle, and this is also what he said. When they were building Zoom in the early days, they would get this one type of customer. I don't know, maybe it's a university and then it worked really well for them. Then they're like, \"How do we get more of the universities?\" They would always focus on a certain customer rather than, \"Let's just try to get everyone, so let's focus on everything,\" which is not possible. Again, it's about the focus. If you see that something is working really well, then it's almost like you should focus on doing that more until you hit some point. It's like, \"Okay, now we do have that category captured or handled as much as we want,\" and we should expand to new area.\n\nLenny (01:21:12):\nEssentially, look for pull and just follow that and pay attention to that.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:21:17):\nYeah. I think, for us, there can be sometimes... For example, now we have... Most of the AI companies are using us, so I think it's always... Before that, it was a crypto company, so I think there's... When we see these kinds of things happening, then we start to think like, \"Could we do something differently or could we get more of these AI companies on board?\"\n\nLenny (01:21:42):\nSuch a great lesson. Just a few more questions, you mentioned that you launched on Twitter and that led to a large wait list and a growing wait list. Is there anything you did before that to build this following? That sounds really amazing, \"Cool, we just announced it on Twitter and we have this large wait list and then we grow and we get all these customers.\" Is there anything you did ahead of time in anticipation of this launch? Would you recommend people work on building some kind of following online before they work in a startup? Was it just like, \"Hey, we happen to have this following,\" and it worked out? Anything along those lines you would recommend to founders these days?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:22:16):\nYeah. I think definitely if you have a following and, obviously, depends on what kind of following, but I think my background as a designer, I would say at Airbnb and Coinbase and other places, and I did some talks in conferences and write some blog posts. I was definitely out there and had some of that following, which was helpful, but it wasn't like I have hundreds of thousands of followers or millions, or something. I had maybe 10,000 or something, which is a significant number, but then I think the other thing is... I think with the announcement, one of the things we did, I think, well is I think sometimes startups do try to emulate successful, large companies too much and you do this fancy announcements where it's like, \"Hey, now we are doing this fancy thing and it sounds very corporate or something.\"\n\n(01:23:17):\nWith our announcement, we wrote it more direct or authentic to us like, \"This is what we're going to do and this is why, and these are some of the things we're going to do.\" On a Twitter, we did the same thing. All of us founders, we wrote our own reasons why we're doing this, and I think it was just much more... I think people like us could resonate more with it, so we were writing to the right audience. I think that's probably the first thing when you're announcing your company, you think about, \"Who is my first audience? Who would be the best early users for this product and where are they?\" And then, \"How do they think about things and what kind of language do they use?\" For us, it came very naturally, because we are these people.\n\n(01:24:09):\nWe are in building software and these companies, and other people have seen similar things we have seen, so I think the way we announced it resonated with a lot of people. Then I think we did have some friends... I said we got some angel round where we got some friends involved. The main reason we did it was that we just felt like, in the early days, it's good to have... You feel like a real company in a way, that you have someone to answer for in a way. Even though the investors normally run your company or they don't have that much power, it's more like, \"I took someone's money so I now need to make it worth it,\" kind of. With the announcement, again, we could use some of those people to spread the message as well.\n\nLenny (01:24:57):\nTo close out our conversation, just a couple more broad questions. You have a pretty unique culture at Linear, and I know one fun thing that you do is you have this baking competition. Can you talk about that and what it is you do there?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:25:12):\nYeah. Since we are a fully remote and distributed company, so we have people in Europe and US, a lot of group gatherings are challenging. Remote group sessions are challenging, because the time zones are so different, so some of the basic things, like happy hours, don't really work that well. Also, Zoom happy hours is probably not that fun anyway. I think a lot of people in the company watch The Great British Baking Show, so we decided, \"Maybe we do something like that,\" where basically, we would just pick a recipe. Firstly, it was baking, now we expanded to cooking recipes, too. We just pick a recipe that is somewhat reasonable to do in a few hours, in a couple of hours, and it doesn't require tons of equipment or skill, or something. Then we just tell people, \"Go buy the ingredients, use the company card,\" everyone has a company card, \"And then hop on Zoom on this day.\"\n\n(01:26:18):\nFor me, since I'm in California, it's like 8:00 AM, so we started the baking or cooking then. We've made things like roll cake and lemon meringue pie, and we made some [Portuguese 01:26:35], which is Portuguese pastry. Then we just hop on the Zoom, everyone's doing their thing, following the recipe, and then sometimes people have questions like, \"Hey,\" I don't know, \"I'm stuck with this,\" or, \"My dough looks weird, does your dough look like this?\" People can help each other and then also chitchat about whatever random things at the same time. Then we do the thing and then everyone takes pictures and posts on the Slack channel, it's what they achieved. I think we have friendly competitions like who did it best, so people sometimes put a lot of effort into the decorations and visuals.\n\n(01:27:17):\nIn a way, it's, again, a craft thing that we do. I think baking and cooking and these kinds of things are also a craft, so we liked it that way. Yeah, we've been basically doing it quarterly since the beginning of the company. Yeah, the latest thing, we were a little bit... I think didn't have that much time, because we decided to do an easier thing, which is a summer drink recipe, so I think people made matcha drinks and some coconut drinks or white iced tea, or something. Yeah, that was interesting to do.\n\nLenny (01:27:55):\nHave you ever won one of these competitions yourself?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:27:59):\nI don't know if we declare winners that much, but I do think I do... Since I'm a designer, I do have some advantages on the visual presentation, so I think that I generally do well on that. Obviously, with this remote competition, that's the only thing you can really look for. It's not necessarily about the taste or the texture, because you can't really taste it through the Zoom.\n\nLenny (01:28:27):\nMaybe as a last question, just again broadly, you've gone from being an IC designer, manager of designers, to the CEO of very fast-growing company. What's something that you've learned about leadership over the journey of Linear that maybe you didn't expect?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:28:43):\nFor some reason, it was surprising to me, I think, that being a CEO or some of these leadership roles is that you end up doing so many different things. When I was a designer, even if I would be some high-level designer in some company, you're just mostly focusing on the design and that's your job, but then when you're a CEO, then every week or every day, there's some different thing going on. Sometimes there can be problems, but a lot of times, it's like, \"Hey, we need to figure out how we're going to do this. How are we going to do this compensation?\" Or, \"How are we going to do this marketing plan?\" Or, \"How are we going to do this offsite thing?\" What's definitely challenging for me is handling that different kinds of things that come to you and staying somewhat focused, still, on something.\n\n(01:29:42):\nI think I haven't necessarily fully figured it out, but I also figured it out, that hiring and delegation helps with this, that if you can find other leaders that can take on certain areas, that's helpful. That's the main thing, that it's a very wide range of things that you maybe didn't have experience before, but also, I think it's interesting for me to learn about these things. You learn about the financials and you learn about legal things, and then you start to feel like, \"Actually, I know something about this thing,\" over time.\n\nLenny (01:30:18):\nFor the actual final question, before we get to very exciting lightning round, what's just the future of Linear? What's coming? What's happening in the future? Anything you can share?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:30:27):\nYeah, I think there's always things we're working on and improving. One, a newer thing we're working on is this feature called Asks. Basically, what it is is that... We see that, in a company, there can be a lot of different people that need to interact with the product team or different people that need to interact with this team, but they're not necessarily in Linear or part of this team. We'd be building this an Ask feature, which is an integration to Slack where you can very easily go to a Slack channel and then ask your question. You need something from this team, maybe it's the IT team, that you need a laptop, or maybe it's the infrastructure team and you need something from them, then the team that is handling the request, they can very easily send it to Linear, into this triage that we have, and then they can start doing stuff with it.\n\n(01:31:26):\nIf they have questions or additional questions to the actual person who requested it, we can send those messages back to the person through Slack, so they don't actually have to go to Linear or they don't have to be a Linear user to use it. We think this is just a good way for the company, or the whole company, to be more potentially involved in the product operations without having to be a power user of Linear, because not every function really uses it or needs to use it.\n\nLenny (01:32:01):\nAwesome. What a cool peek at something coming out soon, or maybe out by the time this comes out. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a bunch of questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:32:13):\nYeah, I'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:32:14):\nAll right. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:32:20):\nTimeless Way of Building by Christopher Alexander. He wasn't really an architect, but he, I think, taught in Berkeley. He has these interesting thoughts about building things and he focuses on buildings and towns and these kinds of spaces, but I think there's a lot of things that are also interesting for building software. The other book that I like is the Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, because it also talks about the quality of things and I think that's one of the main themes of the book. The thing is also that quality is so hard to define. If you actually start thinking about it, it's like, how do you define it? It's really hard to pin down, but it's like when you try something or see it, then you know if it's quality or not.\n\nLenny (01:33:13):\nWhat are some recent movies or TV shows you've really enjoyed?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:33:17):\nI think that the movie is probably John Wick 4. Obviously, there's no story in that movie, but I think it's very true to its nature, so I like that fact. Also, recently, I started watching the Silo on Apple TV, and I think I like it. It's like a good mystery and then, also, it reminds me of the Fallout games, so I like it that way, too.\n\nLenny (01:33:46):\nI actually read the Silo books and I was really excited for the show to come out, but I mentioned this on a previous podcast, the show is so little to do with actual books. The core ideas are the same, but there's all these stories that they're just making up on the show, so I stopped watching, because that's not what I was hoping for, but-\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:34:02):\nOkay, interesting. Maybe I need to check the books later, once I watch the show.\n\nLenny (01:34:08):\nYeah. Definitely, read the books, but there's three of them and only the first one is actually good. The other ones are not actually very good and I should not have read them, because it just went off the rails a little bit. Anyway, next question. What is a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:34:22):\nI think, usually, I like to ask, what is the candidate most proud of and why? On their professional life or otherwise, what they're most proud of and why. Then I think we can go deeper on that, but I think it gives you a little bit of indication, what the person values and how they think about things. Also, I think it's always nice that people can share something they think they did really well and we can spend time on it versus just asking something more like negative things.\n\nLenny (01:34:52):\nWhat are some favorite products you've recently discovered that you really, really like?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:34:58):\nI'm not sure if I discovered them recently, but recently in this home office, I've been installing some of these hue lights and I really like them, because throughout the day, I can have more harsh lighting, because I'm in meetings or something, and then in the evening, I can change the temperature. I make it much more red or orange, or something. I think it's nice that you can transition the space. It's like, \"Okay, now I'm working and now I'm doing something else.\" You can use the lights to indicate that.\n\nLenny (01:35:31):\nThat is so cool. Do you automate the schedule or you manually change the color?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:35:35):\nYeah, I just manually change it. On my home app, I have scenes that... There's the night scene and then there's the day scene, or the morning scene, so I just click that button and then it changes the lights.\n\nLenny (01:35:50):\nThat is extremely cool, I'm going to try that myself. What is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with people? Something you come back to a lot.\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:36:02):\nGo slow to go fast. I think, for me, it's about that. Sometimes people have a tendency to rushing into things and especially, I think, in startups, but other places too, you have this like... I think urgency is important, but then sometimes you have too much urgency and you are rushing things, and what happens is that you rushed it and now you need to come back to fix it. I think sometimes I like to think that you should take some time to actually think about it and, \"What are you going to do?\" And then do it. In the end, it's going to be faster that way than going back and forth and fixing things.\n\nLenny (01:36:42):\nWhat is the most valuable lesson that your mom or your dad taught you?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:36:45):\nI think it's respecting people and things. I think the people respect is pretty obvious, but I think with the things you have, also, I think you should take good care of them when you use them. I don't know, clean them or put them away, and then they're ready for the next time. I think I like that, though. Rather than you treating things like they're trash or not that valuable, you should treat things that they are valuable.\n\nLenny (01:37:16):\nFinal question. You were born in Finland, I think you grew up in Finland. What is a Finnish food that people should definitely try to get as soon as they can?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:37:25):\nOne is this salmon soup, and it might sound weird, a fish soup, maybe it's not going to be that interesting. It's a creamy soup, it's on potatoes, carrots, and other things, and it's almost like a little bit of sweet flavor to it. You can make it yourself at home or you can... If you go to Finland, there's probably always a few restaurants that offer it.\n\nLenny (01:37:52):\nOkay, amazing. Is that something we could get here or you have to go to Finland to get it?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:37:56):\nI don't think I've ever seen it here in the US in any restaurant, but it's not very hard to make it yourself. You can probably Google a recipe. Basically, you just need some salmon, some basic spices and some cream and some fruit, vegetables.\n\nLenny (01:38:13):\nAll right. Next episode, we're going to do a cooking show with Karri. Karri, thank you so much for being here. You're building a very special company in a really unique way, and I think many founders and many product builders can learn a ton from watching you operate in the business that you're building. Again, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe ask you some more questions, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:38:38):\nYeah. I'm on Twitter, my name, Karri Saarinen. We also have the Linear account, which I think is interesting. That's just @Linear. I hope everyone can check out Linear and see if it could work for them in their company, and figure out if there's a pilot. I think we are always happy to assist on those things, if you just want to try it out and try it with the team, we can help you to set it up and help you to understand how to use the product.\n\nLenny (01:39:09):\nAwesome. It's just Linear, the app, right? Is that the URL?\n\nKarri Saarinen (01:39:13):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:39:14):\nAwesome. Okay, easy-peasy. Amazing. Karri, again, thank you so much for being here.

  "transcript": "# Building beautiful products with Stripe’s Head of Design | Katie Dill (Stripe, Airbnb, Lyft)\n\n## Transcript\n\nKatie Dill (00:00:00):\nThe use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased, like pretty dramatically. And it's aligned with this idea of, \"Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters.\" As if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. No, they're not two opposite things. Functionality is important. And actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use.\n\n(00:00:32):\nAnd the other piece of it that is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. Things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this, and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.\n\nLenny (00:00:55):\nToday my guest is Katie Dill. Katie is Head of Design at Stripe, where she oversees product design, brand and marketing creative, web presence, user research, content strategy, and design ops. Katie was previously Head of Design at Lyft, and Head of Experience Design at Airbnb. She's built and led design teams at three different hypergrowth companies, seen the teams scale at least 10x, and two of which, Airbnb and Stripe, are some of the biggest and fastest growing companies in the world and also the best designed products.\n\n(00:01:25):\nIn our conversation Katie shares stories of trials and tribulations of leading large design teams, processes she's put in place for operationalizing quality, how she thinks about quality and beauty very practically, how design can directly lead to growth, and examples of this that led to a big lift in conversion at Stripe, plus a math formula she uses to increase team performance, how she suggests organizing your design and product teams, what to look for in design hires, and so much more. I was really lucky to get to work with Katie while at Airbnb, and I am so excited to have her on this podcast. With that, I bring you Katie Dill after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career, and something that worked really well for me a few years ago, is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life.\n\n(00:02:29):\nThis has been a big trajectory changer for me. But it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly-vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact.\n\n(00:02:53):\nGuided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today?\n\n(00:03:14):\nJump the growing waitlist of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny. You fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.\n\n(00:03:42):\nA better way is possible. Introducing Jira Product Discovery, the new prioritization and road mapping tool built for product teams by Atlassian. With Jira Product Discovery you can gather all your product ideas and insights in one place and prioritize confidently, finally replacing those endless spreadsheets.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nKatie Dill (00:04:52):\nThanks for having me. Good to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. So as we were preparing for this podcast, you hinted at a story that you had from your time at Airbnb where the design team staged an intervention with you which I had no idea about. Because I was there during this time and I did not know this was happening. I am so curious to hear the story. Can you share what happened?\n\nKatie Dill (00:05:15):\nAh, starting with the easy questions I see. All right.\n\nLenny (00:05:18):\nRight into it.\n\nKatie Dill (00:05:20):\nYeah. No, I'm happy to talk about it because, frankly, it was the biggest learning experience of my leadership career, or at least that happened in one moment. It happened in my early days at Airbnb. I was hired to take on the Design Organization, or the Experience Design Organization. That's basically the Product Design team, which was 10 people at the time. They had been reporting directly to one of the founders and they were going to start reporting to me.\n\n(00:05:47):\nDuring my interview process I learned a lot about what was working, and what wasn't working, and some of the trials and tribulations with the Design Organization and its collaboration with others. So it seemed like there was room for improvement in how Engineering, and Product Management, and Design all worked together. There was also really low engagement scores in the Design team.\n\n(00:06:08):\nSo I kind of came in ready to go and excited to try to help make some change based on all the things that I had learned from various leaders and people across the company. I came in swinging, ready to go. And then about a month into my time there, I got a meeting on my calendar, Thursday 8:30 AM, it was an hour and a half with half of the Design team, so that was five people, and our HR partner.\n\nLenny (00:06:38):\nOh, no.\n\nKatie Dill (00:06:38):\nUsually not a good sign.\n\nLenny (00:06:38):\nThat's never a good sign.\n\nKatie Dill (00:06:40):\nYeah. And I remember this so vividly. I remember walking into the office, and all the rooms in Airbnb's office are very unique spaces that look like Airbnb's. But of course this was the one room with all white walls and just a gray flat rectangle table. I walked into the room and there were five of them seated around the table. They had a pack of papers in front of them and they went on taking turns quietly reading from the papers all the things that they saw that I was doing wrong and all the things that they didn't like about me.\n\n(00:07:22):\nIt was a really hard moment there. I went through all the usual kind of like stages of grief when one hears feedback, which is just like an immediate want to respond to be like, \"Yeah.\" Like, \"Well there was a good reason for that.\" And like, \"That's not how it actually was.\" And, \"This is why I did that.\" But luckily, thank goodness I had the sense to just listen and not respond in that way. I mean, clearly what they were telling me is that that was one of the things that was missing.\n\n(00:07:49):\nSo I heard them out and took it all in. And regardless of each individual saying, what was very clear was that the missing piece, the theme that was across all of that, is that I hadn't earned their trust. So whether how right or how wrong what I was doing was, is the key piece is that I wasn't bringing the team along with me. They had no idea that they could trust in what I was trying to build, and what I was trying to shape, and that I cared about them, and that I had their best interests and shared goals at heart. And that was absolutely my fault.\n\n(00:08:24):\nIn retrospect, as hard as that was, I'm very grateful and very amazed that they could come together and share that with me. It can be hard to bring feedback forward like that. So it was an extremely valuable learning experience. I took from that to then immediately shift how I was operating. And really a key part in building trust was to listen, to hear out what the individuals on the team were setting out to do, what they cared about, what motivated them.\n\n(00:08:57):\nSo I started to make pretty fast change and still moving in the direction that was necessary for the org to make the really large impact in how we were operating, but bringing folks along with me. You can inflict change on people, but if you want to do it with them trust is the key element there. And then a couple months later, we had the best engagement scores in the company.\n\n(00:09:20):\nSo it did objectively improve the situation, and since then taken that on into next steps in other companies that I've joined. And just think about instead of coming in swinging, come in listening, so that you can really set out to make change that actually has true, positive impact on the folks around you and that you bring along with you.\n\nLenny (00:09:42):\nWow, I was there during this. I did not know this was happening. Is this the time when all the designers were all always in one room together in Thayer? Is that that period?\n\nKatie Dill (00:09:52):\nBefore I got there I think there was a little of like, \"Design is just going to sit with Design and not necessarily work in close proximity with engineers and product managers, et cetera.\" And one of the things that I believe as a necessary part of building a high-functioning organization is that, one, building together is important. So having engineers, and product managers, and designers be together, have shared goals, and align on that and be able to just look over each other's shoulder and talk about things, is important. So sitting together is important.\n\n(00:10:21):\nHowever, that Thayer thing that you're talking about actually was like something that I was very devoted to, which is bringing Design together at key moments multiple times throughout the week to also build a community in Design. Like Joebot at Airbnb once said, \"It's like, well, what T-shirt do you wear? What team are you on?\" And I was like, \"You have two T-shirts. You have the Design T-shirt and you have the Marketplace T-shirt, or whatever cross-disciplinary team that you work on. Because both are really important communities to build for slightly different reasons.\" So yeah, Thayer was a good spot for that.\n\nLenny (00:10:56):\nZooming out a little bit, I think the elephant in the room a lot of times with design is this idea that I'd say most PMs, most founders, intellectually understand the value of design, understand the value of high quality. But day-to-day it's often not actually prioritized versus new features, new product launches, partly because the ROI is just really unclear.\n\n(00:11:16):\nIf we spend another month making this more awesome and making this even more amazing design-wise, experience-wise, what is that going to get us? Clearly, at Airbnb design was highly prioritized. At Stripe, from an outsider's perspective, it clearly is. I'm just curious what you've learned about how to make the case for the ROI of design and just how Stripe, and Airbnb, and Lyft have done that.\n\nKatie Dill (00:11:39):\nIt's a great question, and I think this is like an age-old question that I don't know if will ever go away, and probably because the quality bar keeps evolving, keeps rising. But I think first to kind of level set before we dive into that I would say that there are levels of quality. There is the, does the thing work? Does it provide some sort of value proposition? It like executes on its job. That's baseline quality.\n\n(00:12:06):\nNext is that, does it do it exceedingly well? Is it error-free? Actually, maybe that's not even exceedingly well but just error-free and it actually works in a well-rounded way. Then beyond that, like level three, level four, level five, does it exceed expectations and it does something that you weren't even seeking for as a user? And I do think the levels of quality should be based on user expectations. I don't believe that there are disciplines that just don't care about quality.\n\n(00:12:36):\nI think it's more about that prioritization and kind of like what you talked about is just like, is it really worth getting something to that exceedingly well state or is it, what about just like another feature and being seduced by the chase of another feature versus actually taking your features to a level of being great? That is hard. And I get it when you look at your user base and they're all shouting from the rooftops for this additional feature.\n\n(00:13:05):\nOf course you're going to want to prioritize that over something they never asked for. Then the other thing would be you end up with like you've got three things that you could possibly do to make perhaps the next stage in your product development. Two of them you know you can measure and they're going to line up to business goals, and one of them you can't.\n\n(00:13:21):\nOf course that's going to be enchanting to want to go after the things that you can actually measure, you know that they're going to have that impact. But the companies that know that quality is non-negotiable, it is a long-term necessary aspect of what they build, don't play that numbers game. Or what they do is they recognize that it is absolutely functionality, but the quality of those features that is actually going to get to great usability, desirability in their product.\n\n(00:13:53):\nActually, I think it's kind of like an analogy for going to the gym or working out. I don't know about you, but literally every time I think to do this, there's a fight in my head of like, \"Ah, do I really need to work out today? Is this one day going to give me six-pack abs?\" Like, \"Of course not.\" So like, \"Why go? Why not just skip it today?\" But of course then at some point, hopefully, I realize that it's like, \"Well, if I skip it today, what's to stop me from skipping it another day?\"\n\n(00:14:21):\nAnd really in the belief of that these things, it really does add up to a better outcome in the end, and so a longer, healthier life. So hopefully I can get myself together and go to the gym. I do think some of the best companies on the planet think that way. I recognize that customers don't always ask for it. I mean, you might see it in support cases for example. Like clearly they don't know how to use this next step and that is probably a quality issue and that they might be asking for in more improved features.\n\n(00:14:53):\nBut some of the levels of quality, the level two, and three, and four, you might not get direct asked for. But I guess I'll give you another analogy. If you don't have competition, that's fine. Right? If you think about the first car, I am sure that wheel was really hard to turn, and I'm sure that seat was not comfortable, and you could have any color you want as long as it's black. Right? But there was no competition. The competition was a horse, so no big deal. For cars today it's like the stitching, the choice of the leather, the sound of the door.\n\n(00:15:28):\nThese distinguish a, hmm, okay car to a high-end special car with higher value. This is very much by understanding how the details matter and how execution of quality will take it to the next level. Lastly, I'll just say that I know there's this saying of it's growth versus quality, but quality is growth. And if you think about how you can make your product easier to use and more understandable, that will of course drive people to use it, and use more of it, and have a better experience with it that they'll want to talk about with others.\n\n(00:16:08):\nIn fact, at Stripe our Growth team I would say is pretty much maniacally focused on building better experiences because we've seen it tied directly to our business metrics. We have things that we've improved on in our onboarding flow, for example, to make it easier to understand the products, understand how they work for your different use cases such that then we have seen activations increase because we've made these quality improvements that are just directly tied to growth.\n\n(00:16:38):\nOne of the biggest examples that I've seen of business impact through quality is actually in the checkout experience. We've done research on the checkout experience in some of the top e-commerce sites. We found that 99% of the top e-commerce sites have errors in their checkout flow that actually hinder more impactful, more seamless, quicker checkout, and therefore higher conversion with their customers. These small things, really they're quality issues.\n\n(00:17:14):\nThey're just that if you really understand what a consumer is trying to get out of the experience, then you can make it better. So we have been maniacally focused on that over many years, trying to make the checkout experience so much better for businesses and their consumers. So by improving the quality of the checkout experience through details small and large, we have seen a 10.5% increase in business' revenue from an older form of checkout to a newer form of checkout. And those little details matter to have such a material impact on one's revenue.\n\nLenny (00:17:51):\nYou mentioned this before we started recording, but you guys power the checkout flow for some very big sites. Can you mention a few of these because they'll give people a sense of like holy moly.\n\nKatie Dill (00:18:00):\nYeah. Stripe is used by millions of businesses globally, small and large, from early stage startups, to SMBs, larger organizations and enterprises like Amazon and Hertz, Shopify, Spotify, X, which I believe you use. The work that we do, it ranges.\n\n(00:18:20):\nWe have checkout flows, so when someone's paying online, or in person, or we also provide a suite of financial automation tools so that you can run your subscriptions business, and recognize your revenue, and receive tax, and essentially manage the complexity of the financial space through powerful tools that hope to make your job easier so you don't have to sweat the details of how these things work.\n\nLenny (00:18:46):\nI just want to follow this thread a little bit. You talked about these opportunities to improve the checkout flow through a design lens. You could also think of it from like as a product manager I'd be like, \"Oh wow. Let's just find all the things that people get stuck on and fix them.\" How is it that you see that from the quality design perspective versus like, \"Oh, let's just move this metric and here's all the things that are stopping people.\" What would you say is the designer's lens on that, if there's anything there?\n\nKatie Dill (00:19:13):\nHonestly, a pet peeve of mine is this way of talking about things as there's business goals and there's design goals. Because I think maybe the first conversation one should have is that, \"What are we trying to build towards?\" And I would think that folks that want to create really impactful products, they want to create quality products, and that they want to create things that actually serve their customers in a positive and beneficial way because they know that will build a stronger business in the long run.\n\n(00:19:47):\nSo yes, there may be slight prioritization details different through the process where a designer might be thinking more about the emotional experience and how somebody feels, because that's oftentimes how they're wired, and that is an important lens to bring on it. Whereas somebody else might just be like, \"Well, just make the button bigger and they'll click it more often, and that's the outcome that we seek.\"\n\n(00:20:10):\nSo this is, again, why I was talking about how important it is to have multidisciplinary teams that work closely together because sometimes we are the checks and balances in the conversation. But I do think if we can align on what are we trying to build? Are we trying to build something great, then we can recognize the fact that it isn't just that utility is an incredible important part of that, but so is usability and so is desirability because these things together make something truly great.\n\n(00:20:38):\nSo beauty is an important part of that because it does make things more useful, it does make things more accessible, and that with these things kind of coming together you can build towards something better. I think that beauty on its own or just craft on its own without utility, I mean that's like, I don't know, that's like Blu-ray or PATH. Right? That does not lead to a high-quality product. So it is the combination of these things, and so it's like stepping towards that.\n\n(00:21:10):\nBut if you really want your product, those features, to be utilized for all that they're worth and to actually gain such esteem, and respect, and reuse, taking it to that next level and thinking about, \"How do I make this actually an enjoyable use and that it really feels like it's meant for me and it maps my mental model,\" that craft and that quality of the execution of those details is going to be paramount.\n\nLenny (00:21:40):\nYou mentioned this word beauty, and I wanted to follow on this a little bit of just ... This is a big question, but just what is great design? What is beauty? Is there like a objective definition where if a designer is like, \"This is great design,\" is there just like, \"Yes, that is true.\" Or is it just an opinion? How do you think about what is great design? What is beauty, Katie Dill?\n\nKatie Dill (00:21:59):\nI love that we're talking about this because I feel like there's probably some people listening that are squirming in their seats. Of like, \"Beauty? We're talking about business here.\" Which is great. Actually, there's a fun fact. Stefan Sagmeister and Jessica Walsh have a book called Beauty. I would highly recommend it. Very, very worth the read. But one of the first things they talk about in the book is that from the 1800s to the 2000s the use of the word beauty in books that have been digitized by Google has decreased pretty dramatically.\n\n(00:22:34):\nIt's aligned with this idea of like, \"Well, functionality is king. Functionality is what matters,\" as if people think about functionality and beauty as like two opposite things. But what the whole book talks about is that like, \"No, they're not two opposite things.\" Functionality is important, and actually beauty enhances functionality because it does make things easier to use, more approachable, more compelling to use. And there is actually some objectivity to whether or not beauty enhances things.\n\n(00:23:05):\nBut if you ask a wide audience what color do they like more or what version of things do they like more, they tend to say the same thing because there is this shared understanding. The other piece of it that yes I can imagine is not talked about in business as often is just the importance of how people feel. A good example of how something looks, and how something is structured, and how that can translate to that, also from the book Beauty, they mentioned that they studied the tweets that came from people that were traveling through Penn Station versus Grand Central.\n\n(00:23:43):\nIf you've been to those places I'm sure where I'm going with this, which is just like the people tweeting from Penn Station, it was just like more negative than the people that were tweeting from Grand Central Station that tended to be much more positive and optimistic. So the things that you create have this impact. And if you're thinking about like, \"I want people to enjoy using my-\n\nKatie Dill (00:24:00):\n... have this impact. If you're thinking about, \"I want people to enjoy using my product, I want them to feel at home in our product.\" Of course, beauty is a part of it, and this matters deeply to us, and I know, as a financial infrastructure company in the B2B space, some may assume that that doesn't matter as much, but it's actually a key priority for us. Because, number one, things that are more beautiful, increase trust. You see that we've put painstaking detail into this and we care about the details of how something works, and that gives you assurance that we care about other details that you can't see too.\n\n(00:24:37):\nThen, secondly, it is easier to use, as I've mentioned, it gives better user outcomes. What we're trying to do is we're trying to equip businesses to make the right decisions to be more successful at what they do. By bringing a interface or our invoices, or whatever it might be, to be more beautiful, and more easy to use, and more trustworthy, that will lead them to better outcomes. Thirdly, I strongly believe beauty begets beauty. When our business users or the consumers see the beauty and the care and the creativity that we put into things we deliver, then that again reassures them of just the care that we put into them. Actually, a perfect example of this, have you seen the show The Bear?\n\nLenny (00:25:23):\nI have, yes. Great example. Yeah.\n\nKatie Dill (00:25:25):\nAll right. Okay. All right. No spoilers, but all I have to say is peeling mushrooms. Do you know what I mean?\n\nLenny (00:25:30):\nYeah.\n\nKatie Dill (00:25:30):\nYeah. Such a good example. Such a good example.\n\nLenny (00:25:33):\nSomeone just mentioned that same episode on a recent podcast episode.\n\nKatie Dill (00:25:36):\nOkay. All right. Well, it's that good. It's that good. I wish I could remember which episode that was, but it was seven? I forget. But anyway.\n\nLenny (00:25:44):\nYeah, that's exactly right. That's exactly right.\n\nKatie Dill (00:25:45):\nOh, nice. Okay. All right. Well, and then lastly, quality is a matter of pride, beauty is a matter of pride. If we put that care into our work, more people will want to work with us, because they want to see their time spent and the care for their craft recognized and utilized and see that that can be put together into something really impactful. We really put that on the pedestal, because we know how much it matters to our users and then how much it matters to the people that work with us. Beauty is an important part of it all.\n\nLenny (00:26:20):\nAmazing. Speaking of beauty, when I think of Stripe and beautiful, I think of your website, and some of the specific landing pages you have, which are just incredibly nice. I'm just curious how you decide it's time to redesign your website and how much time and thought you put into a new website. Because that feels like a common question founders have, \"Should we redo our website?\" And it feels like you guys really think deeply about that. So, I guess is there anything there that you can share?\n\nKatie Dill (00:26:45):\nYeah, there's definitely a couple of things we could talk about in terms of operationalizing quality. Because the gravitational pull is to mediocrity. It is very easy to fall into a path of a baseline, where what is required to go to that next level where something feels truly great is certainly a lot of effort, and it's a concerted effort. I will definitely say we are a work in progress and we have not nailed all the things and it is an ongoing pursuit of excellence.\n\n(00:27:21):\nThe way that we build the website is that we certainly do put a lot of care into what we're putting out into the world, and we view it as a articulation of how we care about our users in all that we provide for them. So, we take that very seriously. We try to meld art and science. So, it's the creativity of the work, but it's also just the technical power of the way that we show it.\n\n(00:27:49):\nHow we've actually operationalized the way we do that is that we have design and engineering and our product partners and product marketing work really, really closely on this. Actually, it's one of the few teams where all of these things report, well, not all of them, but most of those functions report into one place. So, engineering and design actually all report up into the design organization when they work on the website. Together, quite literally, as we were talking about earlier, if we were physically together, they would be sitting side by side and they're batting ideas back and forth, because the engineer on the team has a great idea for how we could go about executing on it. And the designer on the team has another idea how to push that a little further. So, that rapid cycle of iteration is really, really powerful, especially when we're trying to move quickly, but at an extremely high standard.\n\nLenny (00:28:44):\nThat's super interesting. Is there anything else that you've found to be really helpful in just operationalizing great design, craft, beauty, any processes, systems, frameworks?\n\nKatie Dill (00:28:54):\nYeah, I would love to tell you about something that we've actually rolled out pretty recently that I'm extremely excited about the positive impact on.\n\nLenny (00:29:02):\nAwesome.\n\nKatie Dill (00:29:02):\nBut before I get into that, one of the things that has been driving a little bit of this process and the way that I've been thinking about how we can build better things at Stripe is actually I've been just talking to people, talking to different design leaders, product leaders, engineer leaders at different organizations and trying to understand how they go about it. There are a couple of themes that are clearly coming through.\n\n(00:29:28):\nNumber one is that quality is definitely a group effort. You're sunk if you think that you can just hire some incredibly talented person and they'll do it, that'll be fine. The rest of us will do what we're doing and they'll do it, or that it's just one organization that's going to look out for quality or QA is going to solve it all for you. It really does need to be an organizational and a group effort. If you think about the way that you run the internal functions is going to show up in the outside and how clear you all are and how you're talking about it and the standards that you set inside and you're constantly reminding people of in the way that you communicate inside will then eventually show up outside. So, of course, keeping your talent bar high and then thinking about how those things really need to be cared for, that shared care across the organization is number one.\n\n(00:30:20):\nNumber two is that there needs to be some amount of vision and alignment. So, if you hire all the best people in the world and you just set them out to go and do their thing, what are the chances that they're all going to end up with something that actually aligns pretty well? Even if they all have incredible taste and they're very good at what they do, there is subjectivity to every decision in some part. So, that they might end up with some things that are really great but don't fit together as a really nice whole.\n\n(00:30:49):\nThe perfect example would be building a house. You have the person that works on the roof and the person that works on the deck and the person that does the siding, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. A house is arguably far less complex than most of the technical products that we all know. Yet, there is painstaking effort put into having the plans and having a drawing of what the final thing is going to look like. There's a GC, there's an architect. And these people are helping to make sure that all those pieces fit together, and we should have that same care when we're trying to build products together.\n\n(00:31:19):\nI think a big pair on that is then the next piece, which is editing. And you might call that your GC or your architect or somebody that sees how all these things fit together, and then has an ability to help narrow and reduce and remove the things that don't fit. At Airbnb, Brian Chesky is the editor of all the things that come together. At the Economist, there's a chief editor. But other organizations, they might decentralize that approach, which is certainly possible, but challenging, because you do need somebody to help see these things come together.\n\n(00:31:53):\nThat pairs with the next piece, which is about courage, the ability to actually say, \"No, this isn't good enough.\" To have the resolve to just be like, \"Almost, but no.\" Which is one of the hardest decisions I think leaders can make and certainly I've had to ever make in my career, too, is just a team puts all this care and effort into something and then you're going to say, \"Actually, unfortunately we're just not there yet. Let's try again.\" That is, I think, incredibly important part of getting there and building the fitness of what you do.\n\n(00:32:28):\nThen, lastly, the thing that I've learned that will lead me to the example that you were asking about is that, in order to build quality, you really do need to understand it also from the user perspective, which gets me into my fixation with journeys, because that is how a user sees it. The user very, very, very rarely just deals with any aspect of what you build in isolation. There has to be a moment where they learn about it. There has to be a moment where they get to know it, and then there's a moment where they actually decide to use it, and then something just changed and now they need to use that product in some other way. You have to understand it from that point of view to really understand whether or not the quality is there. I think that's a critical piece of building teams that have empathy for their users.\n\n(00:33:16):\nSo, we have been operationalizing that. All the things that I just mentioned, but one of the key pieces is to bring that approach to understanding the quality of the product. So, our goal was to set out to try to solve the fact that products can be shipped and they could be at their highest game when you ship them, they go through all the processes internally to be a high quality thing, and then it gets out into the world and then, over time, the quality regresses. Some of the reasons for that is that other things are being shipped. It's kind of like, again, back to an analogy of a house, imagine you have one room where you redo the molding and you paint the little aspects and you've put new plates on the lights, now all of a sudden that room is great, but it makes everything else look worse and the whole composite is worse.\n\n(00:34:10):\nThat is something that can happen to products is actually they get worse over time. Then you organize a company oftentimes and parts to be able to focus on their key business areas. That's a very good thing because they get focused and they know what they're building towards and they get expertise and they're laser focused on that. So, ideally, they move faster. But what also happens is that they get so focused on that they forget about that piece of the journey, and how it all fits together, and not recognizing that part of their product experience is intimately tied to another.\n\n(00:34:44):\nSo, what we did was we set out to, number one, increase the kind of awareness and accountability of leaders to own their journeys. What we have established are we started with 15 of our most important user journeys. 15 is somewhat of an arbitrary number. It's a number that we can kind of keep track of, but also has pretty good breadth, but is certainly not comprehensive of all the most important things. But 15 of our critical user journeys, the things that we know matter so deeply to our users, and we must get right at the highest level of quality possible.\n\n(00:35:20):\nThose 15 things then each have engineering, product and design leaders that are responsible for the quality of those products. They review these journeys, what we call walk the store, where they review them as if they're walking the floor of their store on a regular cadence, and they friction log what they experience, which I know David Singleton talked about on your podcast. They will write what they have seen, what's working, what's not working. They're viewing this from, they're trying to put themselves in the shoes of their user. This of course doesn't replace user research, but it substitutes it and it adds to that.\n\n(00:35:58):\nSo, they go through the experience and noting what's working and what's not working. And very critically, it's a journey, so a lot of times it starts from internet search, it starts on Google trying to understand something, goes to the website, they end up on Docs, they end up in the dashboard, and they're seeing it as a user might. With that, they're able to find the entailments of the experience that may or may not be working. They jot that down, they file bugs, they reach out to the teams that may own the different parts of this experience, and then they score it. Then on, again, a regular cadence, we come together in almost like a calibration, where we meet and we talk about the score of their work.\n\n(00:36:40):\nIt relates to performance reviews. Performance reviews, managers are assessing an individual's performance, which is hard. There's some subjectivity to it, just like understanding quality can be. But what we do as managers is we calibrate. We come together and we talk about, \"Okay, how well is our interpretation of our ladders document? And how well does that performance align? And are we doing it consistently across the rest of the organization?\" So, we do something very similar. We calibrate these scores because what we're really trying to do is not just the 15 essential journeys and the owners of those, we want to actually uplevel and bring more shared understanding of our quality bar across the company. These moments of calibration start that. Then having leaders do this creates this, number one, it cascades this idea of the importance of owning your journey and then also has upstream impact.\n\n(00:37:43):\nBecause when people see the state of products in the wild as a user would, they learn a lot about what are some of the bigger opportunities that we can make to make the product better? What are some of the things that maybe we want to change in our process to make sure that we have even better things coming into the wild? One of the best parts of this is, since then we've learned that folks have seen that like, \"Oh my goodness, our SEO for this particular product or the way we're articulating it doesn't align to actually how we want people to understand it later on in the journey. So if we improve this over here, we're going to improve outcomes later on.\" They're seeing that and they're now able to make that happen even faster to make some of the changes there.\n\n(00:38:27):\nThen my real favorite part is that we're hearing from folks that maybe at first didn't see this as necessary, that maybe in different functions that are just like, \"Oh, I was so very focused on executing the technical ability of what I do on this thing, but I hadn't seen it from this lens before.\" Now there're actually converts of like, \"Yes, this is a really important part of it.\" That goes back to the point of it's a group effort. You don't want just one function looking out for the quality of the product. So, having engineers and product managers and people of different disciplines walking the store, seeing the experience, feeling it firsthand, I think will lead to better care in all of the details that will aligned to better craft in the end.\n\nLenny (00:39:12):\nOh man, what an awesome process. I have a million questions I want to ask to better understand how you operationalize this. I'll try to ask just a few. But one thing that stood out about this process is I think people kind of don't trust their own judgment when they're looking at their own product. They kind of, especially product managers, almost have to feel like they have to rely on user research or data to know a thing versus like, \"I just see this and it feels bad to me.\" I think I've learned over time more and more that you should really trust that, because you're spending your energy trying to use this thing, you're not that different from a potential user. So, I love that this actually relies on your personal judgment trying to use a thing, which I think people undervalue.\n\nKatie Dill (00:39:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:39:54):\nA couple of just very tactical questions, how often roughly does this happen? Is it once a quarter?\n\nKatie Dill (00:40:00):\nTo your first point, 100%, they're all just forms of input. I'm definitely not saying do this instead of user research, do this instead of data. It's like these things in additional sense. I do think what's so powerful about doing it firsthand is that, although I am the biggest supporter of user research, even hearing somebody talk about an experience, while that is really, really powerful, feeling the pain firsthand is just this next level of visceral understanding of like, \"Oh, this could be better.\" Your users, they might not always say what's missing or what's wrong, or maybe they don't know that certain aspects of it could be better. Yeah, having your point of view on that in addition to the user research and what you've heard from them directly is really, really important.\n\n(00:40:49):\nBut you asked about how often. We have, as I've mentioned, we are constantly looking at our processes and trying to figure out how we can make them better and better as an organization, as we've grown, things need to adjust. We today are doing it quarterly. The quarterly aspect of walking the stores by no means meant to be like that's the only time people do it. But that is the time where we're looking for update your scorecard and share the information in a dashboard where everybody can see. That is feeling right now to be the right cadence because that's enough time that there can be material differences made. You can see the scores evolve over time. But also frequently enough that you're not missing that perhaps there's been a setback since. But, of course, my real hope is that they're happening weekly, just perhaps in different parts of the organization.\n\nLenny (00:41:46):\nI want to ask a couple more questions so that folks can try this at home. I was just thinking this podcast is the opposite of don't try this at home. It's like, \"Here, try this at home?\"\n\nKatie Dill (00:41:54):\nTry it at home.\n\nLenny (00:41:55):\nYeah. So, I want to try to give people a few more answers to questions when they're probably going to try to do this themselves. Who's in these meetings? Do you join these walkthroughs? Does David join? What do you suggest there?\n\nKatie Dill (00:42:07):\nYeah. For what we're doing for each team is they do them themselves together. At bare minimum, it should be the engineer, product manager and designer doing it together. The reason why we like to see it happen together is, again, as we've talked about before, is that people bring a different perspective to something. Let's say somebody in the room might be like, \"Oh my goodness, the load time didn't feel really good there.\" And like, \"Oh, whoa, the way we're stating this is not consistent per page. And that's not on our design system.\"\n\n(00:42:41):\nSo, it is really powerful to have folks come together and do it. In fact, David Singleton, who you mentioned, he and I do these things very regularly, too. This is outside the essential journeys program, but he and I walk the store and we'll just pick random flows and go through it together. I can't code, but he can. So, he'll do the code part and I'll be sitting there being, \"What? Do they really do that? How can we make that better for them?\"\n\n(00:43:08):\nI really love the multidisciplinary approach, but then when we do the calibration after the team has done these walkthroughs and they've gotten their own perspective and they fill out the scorecard based on our rubric for quality, we will come together in what we call PQR, product quality review. And they will take us through what they have experienced, and then they'll talk about, \"So, this is why we've scored this, a yellow or a yellow green.\" Then we might have a conversation about that.\n\n(00:43:39):\nIt's like, \"Well, actually, that felt a little worse than you've described it. Actually, I think that we probably need to put more urgency on solving that.\" Or in some cases it's like, \"Actually, that was pretty great. If you think about what we're trying to help somebody achieve at this moment that actually is really hitting the mark.\"\n\n(00:43:59):\nWe will debate that there. In those meetings you'll have, yes, myself, David Singleton, Will Gaybrick, who leads product and business, and then various leaders from the organization that might be relevant to that area. We are trying to give people insight to what's happening across. Again, it's a multidisciplinary room. I'm trying to keep it not too large, because obviously it can be hard to have discussion, but it is very valuable to make sure, again, that we have the perspective of product marketing and the perspective of engineering, the expected product in the room as we discuss what our quality bar is.\n\nLenny (00:44:36):\nAwesome. Okay. That makes a lot of sense. In terms of scoring, are you scoring individual steps of these journeys or is it yellow for segments? What are you scoring?\n\nKatie Dill (00:44:44):\nThe way the rubric works is so that, and we have a template for the friction log. So, people fill out a friction log and it'll be screenshots and then what they experienced. Then there is a tool to tag for each moment. It's like, \"Oh, that was a nice touch.\" Or, \"Ooh, that is not great. We should consider a fix.\" Or different levels of severity of like, \"Oh my gosh, P0 bug, we need to fix this right now.\" So, they'll tag for different moments in the journey.\n\n(00:45:11):\nThen there is a summary score at the end, which is based on a rubric that we have that talks about the importance of quality from the point of view of usability, utility, desirability, and actually going to that next level of surprisingly great. Then we'll ask them to score on a whole what they felt of these things. Then that adds up to a summary score. Which we have also talked about the different ways of scoring. Is it a number-based system? Is it a letter-based system? Like A-minus and B?\n\nLenny (00:45:42):\n[inaudible 00:45:42].\n\nKatie Dill (00:45:42):\nYeah. So far we have landed on a color system because, honestly, I think people can get a little tied around the axle on how you're measuring it, and to your point, especially in subjective things, and it's just like, \"Oh, it's like, well, is it really a six or is it a seven?\" We didn't want people to get a little too worried about how does... It's not meant to be an objective quantitative score. It is qualitative, it is judgment. We hire people for judgment, so we want them to bring that to the conversation. That's how we chose the score, because we felt that would actually lead to quicker but straightforward opinions and decisions.\n\nLenny (00:46:25):\nAt a lot of companies, you have these reviews and the founders share all this like, \"Oh, this is broken, this is busted.\" And as a product team, you're like, \"Goddammit, we have these goals we got to hit. We have this roadmap. And now we're going to get a hundred things that the founder's like, 'Got to fix this.'\" I'm curious just how you tell teams to take this stuff and prioritize it amongst all the other things they're going to do. Is it just up to them, is they're like, \"Need to fix this\"? Anything you can share there, but just how to actually operationalize taking this feedback and doing something with it?\n\nKatie Dill (00:46:54):\nYes. Yeah. I've seen some organizations talk about when they're doing planning, you do your OKRs quarterly or half year or year, whatever, recommendations of like, 10% of your time should be spent on fixing things, and 20% on growing things, and the rest on keeping the lights on, whatever it might be. Yes, I've seen different companies build a recommendation based on certain percentages of how they think teams should be spending their time.\n\n(00:47:28):\nWe at Stripe think that, first and foremost, is that we have to make sure that folks are, number one, hired with the fact that they have great judgment and care for what they build, and they take pride in it. That's number one. Then, you can give a lot of trust to people based on that commitment to building great things that they will use that in their decision-making. Then, of course, it needs to be very clearly advocated for at the highest levels of the...\n\nKatie Dill (00:48:01):\n... Advocated for at the highest levels of the company. And with that, I think that fuels people's thinking as they're building their plans, but there is iteration in the plans and we do have multidisciplinary people making the plans together. So it's like, \"Oh, okay, are we advancing these features? Are we going to be building growth? And is that improving the quality as well?\" And so I think that's how we together get to it, but there's no formula that we ask people to.\n\nLenny (00:48:30):\nSo basically what I'm hearing is it's the cultural just people are hired with this expectation we are going to focus on quality and we'll prioritize things even though they may not move metrics because we know that this will generally improve and grow the business.\n\nKatie Dill (00:48:43):\nPart of it though is showing how it moves metrics, because I think that is a dangerous belief that is absolutely out there, as we talked about earlier, but that actual quality improvements do increase growth, they do improve the bottom line. For example, we saw that folks were reaching out to support because they didn't know the state of how one of their invoices was performing. And when we dig in, we realized it's, well, we had a button that looked nice, but it wasn't super clear, and so they didn't know how to access the thing that they were trying to do. And so by improving that, we decrease the need for them to have to reach out, which is clearly not their want to have to call somebody to find the answer to their problem. And so with that, we've made an improvement and we, of course, improve the bottom line because of that.\n\n(00:49:38):\nSo I actually think that maybe one of the steps that somebody should consider in their organization is just you have those examples, every company does, where quality leads to better business outcomes and to talk about those and make them known, because I think it's actually a false belief that it's one or the other, it's like, \"Are we going to work on quality and it doesn't move the metrics? And where we do.\" Some of them are longer term and so you have to look out for a while to see that change and the beliefs of your customers or how often they're sharing your product or how often they're succeeding in what they're trying to do, but some of them are short-term impacts and that is an important thing for people to be aware of because it will give them ideas of, oh, we could do this in our team too, we could have a higher quality product and actually move the business metrics.\n\nLenny (00:50:28):\nIs there anything you do in how you evaluate performance of teams that helps prioritize this sort of thing? So generally it's just, cool, this team moved this metric by a ton, they're doing great. Is there anything that you bake into performance evaluations at Stripe, especially for product teams that help them understand and prioritize some of these things that may not obviously move metrics other than just broadly we believe great experiences are going to improve growth?\n\nKatie Dill (00:50:54):\nWell, I think one part is being clear on what impact means, because I do think that in some companies impact is just, okay, what business metric did I move and how much? And there are certainly really important impact projects that folks can have that maybe they're multi-quarter, multi-year, and so maybe you didn't move this incredibly important business metric in one quarter, but actually the work that you are doing is instrumental to the success of the business. So there's that. And then, like you said, there are perhaps quality efforts that are harder to measure or they're longer term, but they're still impactful. So I think number one is that when you're thinking about how to come up with the rubric for how you're going to judge performance, it's just really honing in on what does impact mean, and then a lot comes from that and being able to and celebrate and recognize great work happening even when it's not necessarily materially moving that number.\n\n(00:51:59):\nThe other part of it is we have a ladder system. So it's a document that's not meant to lay out here's the checklist of all the things you need to do, but it's a guide for this is what is expected in your role and at this level, and in these documents we talk about the importance of things like quality in that what we pursue is building these things that are great. And another part of that is also the operating principles, which is the thing that we align on underneath all of these levels and ladders systems that we have. And our operating principles include meticulous craft. It is one of the things that is really important to us as an organization is just having that meticulous care for all that you do, whether it's you're designing the space that we work within or that you're creating the API or that you're building the interface or that you're talking to people on support calls, the meticulous craft is something that is actually expected of everybody.\n\nLenny (00:53:04):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, but customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products, customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product.\n\n(00:53:53):\nOneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product. For listeners of this podcast, OneSchema is offering a $1,000 discount. Learn more at oneschema.co/leti.\n\n(00:54:09):\nI'm going to shift to a different topic and this is just the last area I want to spend some time on, which is team building leadership, that sort of thing. So you've led design at three hypergrowth companies, two of them, Airbnb and Stripe, are two of the biggest companies in the world, and also just known for great design. And I'm just going to ask a broad question, what have you learned about building, leading, managing, scaling large teams, are there lessons that stick with you? Anything come to mind when I ask that broad question?\n\nKatie Dill (00:54:40):\nOne of the things that has stuck with me through all the trials and tribulations of leading, and as I've already laid out for you in the very beginning of this call, haven't always got it right, but one of the things that has been a clarifying force as I think about growing and leading teams, it's actually something I learned at Airbnb when we were there together, it's a formula sort of. So performance equals potential minus interference.\n\nLenny (00:55:10):\nI love that.\n\nKatie Dill (00:55:10):\nAnd I really like this, it's pretty simple, but it's a good reminder that, as a leader, one of the things that you are of course driving towards is trying to get better performance so that your team feels more purpose and motivation and is excited about their work and that you're building greater things for your customers and you're having more business effect, and, of course, performance. But the key pieces of that, of course, is potential, so thinking about how you increase potential, which would be, of course, hiring really well, developing the talent and helping them grow and increase their own potential to do better and greater things. And then paired to that though of course is decreasing the interferences, which could be that lead weight on top of great talent, because you can hire the best people in the world, but like a muscle atrophying underneath a cast, if there are interferences that are holding them back from doing great work, they're going to burn out, they're not going to enjoy the work, they're not going to be as successful, and you will not get as strong of performance from it.\n\n(00:56:14):\nAnd so I really do think of this constantly as to how can I increase potential, how can I decrease interferences? And over time, especially as your company grows, you're going to have to keep doing that. The design work is never done in designing a team, because the more people you bring in, the more it puts your processes in a faulty state. I have intentionally run teams where you get to a point where it's like running hot, it's just like, \"Okay, we've outgrown our processes.\" And that's okay because then you can learn as to, okay, this is how people are actually trying to work and this is how we actually can improve it. So making those changes as needed helps to make them more sought after and more informed in terms of as you improve the processes.\n\n(00:57:05):\nOne of the things that I've been working on since I worked back at Airbnb was this idea of improving awareness of the things that are happening. What happens at a lot of companies, especially as they grow, is people lose touch with what's happening in different parts of the organization, and everybody's got a doc, their PRD, where they've written down what they've done and it's got tons of words that nobody really understands and keywords for the different projects, and that isn't the best way to lead to clarity. And I'm a strong believer that a picture tells a thousand words and a prototype saves a thousand meetings. What we do, and I've been doing it for the last decade or more, is having people within the design team share as a screenshot or a prototype of what they're working on in a shared deck.\n\n(00:57:54):\nAnd so they add this to a slide, in Google Slides decks every couple of weeks, and we get to see what's happening across the design team. And this is really important for all the designers because they could see, whether or not they're a team of 10 or 170 or whatever it might be, what is happening, and they can say, \"Oh my gosh, you're working on that surface, so am I. And let's talk about it. Or Oh, that's an interesting pattern, maybe we could use this in more places.\" And we send it to the product managers and the engineer leaders and the leaders in the company because it is also a really great way for them to understand what's happening and what are we building together. Because going earlier, as I talked about, the importance of thinking about things as a journey, so what's happening in the marketing side, what's happening in this aspect of the product and seeing how all these pieces really fit together, that has been absolutely one of the things I will take wherever I go, whatever I do, because it has just been a very, very useful tool.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nI remember that at Airbnb, and there's nothing more fun than just looking through a bunch of awesome designs and products that are in motion and in a deck form is so handy, just flip through what's going on around the company, I'm like, \"Oh wow, look at this thing. That's amazing.\" And it's interesting that ends up in a deck, it feels like Figma would be really good for that too, but somehow decks are still really handy for simple things like that.\n\nKatie Dill (00:59:11):\nOne of the key pieces is just keeping it really low maintenance. Yes, the design team would definitely prefer that it would be in Figma, but critically I want all functions to be able to look at it. And if not everybody is on Figma, if they were, that would be great too, but if they're not, it's just flipping through really easy, touch of a button, you can just send it off, it's behaviors that people are really used to and commenting. But maybe one day Figma.\n\nLenny (00:59:42):\nAnd the way you do that is it's just like a scheduled call for all designers, add your stuff to this deck and then you email it out every two weeks I think you said?\n\nKatie Dill (00:59:48):\nYeah, and we experiment with how often we ask folks to share and also the granularity of what they're doing. It is not meant to be a status check. We're not asking everyone, \"Show us what you're doing.\" It's more of what are the projects that are happening? And we might ask, \"Show us the medium and large projects,\" if there's such, it's too much going on and all of a sudden it's a 200-page deck and no one's going to flip through it. So we have experimented and evolved that depending on the team size, and I think right now we're at monthly sharing of it, and that seems to be working pretty well. It used to be biweekly, which I loved because I really love looking through, but if it's feels like it's a arduous task then it's not succeeding.\n\nLenny (01:00:31):\nAnd especially knowing designers, they'd want to make sure it's the best version of what they've done, and it takes all this extra time to, okay, we got to make this beautiful mock to show [inaudible 01:00:39] working on.\n\nKatie Dill (01:00:39):\nAnd actually another part of it that is another benefit of opening up the curtain a little bit of certainly we have to take things seriously in terms of confidential work, it's work in progress, it's not ready to go live, we're not ready to critique all the details about this. We do need to make it very clear to folks that this is work in progress, but also that it is really beneficial to bring the work out because what isn't great is that you get to the end of the project and people have worked tirelessly on it for some long stretch of time and then find out that, oh my gosh, this is the same project that we're doing over here and this can be completely redundant, or these two things are on a path to collide.\n\n(01:01:25):\nSo we want to know that sooner because it, absolutely, in the end of the day, will make the work better, save time. And so opening up that curtain and showing the work in progress, it can feel hard at first, but I think people have started to see the benefits in doing that and then usually that will lead to better outcomes in the long run in the culture too.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\nGoing back to this formula you shared, which I love, performance equals potential minus interference, is there an example that comes to mind of helping with the interference where you found that, oh, wow, this is really slowing things down and you change something?\n\nKatie Dill (01:01:59):\nIt actually goes back to org design that we talked about earlier and where people sit. So when I joined Lyft, as I mentioned to you earlier, I was like, oh, I had learned from the experience that I had at Airbnb and I came in needing to transform the organization, and was hopefully much better at it because I had learned so much. What actually was going on there is that the way that the team was organized before I got there was that actually physically the design team sat separately. They sat in a room that was just beautifully designed, separated from engineering and product and all the other functions by a locked door. And that was really interesting to see because of course there were a lot of benefits to it, which is that design had this very safe space for creative discovery and exploration and communication, there was work all over the walls, it was wall to wall whiteboards, and it was just absolutely a place where creativity could thrive.\n\nLenny (01:02:58):\nIt sounds exactly like the Airbnb situation, by the way.\n\nKatie Dill (01:03:02):\nThe current Airbnb situation or the past?\n\nLenny (01:03:05):\nThe original, the [inaudible 01:03:05] times.\n\nKatie Dill (01:03:07):\nYeah. And absolutely there are a lot of tie-ins to what I had seen. And the interesting part about how actually teams were working is that you would see that there was a lot of wasted work and there was a lot of misalignment in what we were trying to do because there was product managers and engineers that were sitting alongside each other making decisions and talking about the work and deciding things, and then designers were sitting over here in this other room and they were working on something, and then they'd meet up and it's like, \"That's not aligned. No, that doesn't fit the goal. And you went that way, we were supposed to go over this way.\" And so interference in the sense that it was wasted work, it wasn't actually aligned to the goals, it was slower. And there were definitely benefits, there was real reasons for doing this, and I know there are companies including Apple that have separation of these things.\n\n(01:03:58):\nBut I think if you're going into that way of working, there's probably a lot of other decisions you need to make too in terms of the way the teams work. And so what I was seeing there was just the composite of all these aspects coming together that was not leading to more efficient and less interference. And so what we did was to evolve the way we were working and bring better alignment to the different functions.\n\n(01:04:22):\nAnd, again, had done it with an approach about listening and came into that with a better understanding of getting to know the team and getting to know engineering and product and see what our goals were together so that when we were making changes we were making the changes together and we actually were aligned so that on the day that we opened the doors and brought design and product together and had spaces for folks to work together and they actually sat with each other, we still kept the creative space for this is where we'll do grits, this is where we'll do working sessions, this is where the folks that don't work in an embedded fashion we'll sit, but we had the best of both worlds in that way. And so with that alignment of the way that the teams were working together, there was much faster iteration cycles, better clarity on how the work was working, and we still kept and protected that room for creative space, literally the room in terms of figuratively speaking for allowing for creative exploration, but more aligned.\n\nLenny (01:05:23):\nAnd just so I understand, essentially you reorged the teams and not just physically moved people, but you changed the way the product and design and eng team was even organized?\n\nKatie Dill (01:05:35):\nYes, literally and figuratively we broke down the wall and brought the teams physically together so that they would work together, and then we had an org chart where it's like, okay, these designers are working on driver, these designers are working on rider, these designers are working on the safety team, and then they would sit with their respective engineers and product managers. And then as I talked about earlier, we would come together at key moments to make sure that we as a design function, we're still aligning on shared goals about the overall experience, but also making sure that we could work well with our partners.\n\nLenny (01:06:11):\nSo interesting that that was a recurring pattern at the places you went. I imagine Stripe was not like that, there was not all designers sitting in that locked room.\n\nKatie Dill (01:06:18):\nNot in a locked room. When I joined Stripe, it was a Zoom universe, so it's a little bit different, but even today we have a studio space where we have all the great tools of craft, and when you do go into the offices, we do have places where designers sit together, especially in the functions that aren't embedded. For example, we have brand and marketing creative, we have the website team, and we have folks that work across all of the things that we do. And so for sure there usually is some sort of creative space, which I actually think having a physical space for creative discovery and exploration and having that up on the wall, I love that so much. And I go into the office about halftime now, and I think over time we'll probably build that out more and more, because it is really powerful in addition to having teams sit by the disciplines that they work with every day.\n\nLenny (01:07:17):\nIt reminds me of a quote I have on my wall that I think I found in the Rick Rubin book, but it's by someone else, so I don't know exactly where I found it, but it's the object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.\n\nKatie Dill (01:07:32):\nOoh, that's good. I like that very much.\n\nLenny (01:07:34):\nBy Robert Henry. That's what I try to do in this little podcast studio that we got here.\n\nKatie Dill (01:07:39):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:07:41):\nIs there anything else that you think would be useful to share either from scaling design teams or broadly?\n\nKatie Dill (01:07:50):\nI think one of the other tendencies I see of companies in different stages of their growth is a fear of bold ideas. What happens is that... It can happen at small sizes and then it can happen at large sizes actually, it's just that a fear of shaking things up too much or big ideas with lots of things changing at once are really hard to measure. And so actually if we just make an incremental approach, it's very measured and we know what the outcome is going to be, it feels safer, I can get it done in the quarter, and depending on how your performance is managed, that might be more attractive. And so that is a dangerous tendency, because I think if we go back to what quality means, and you think about it as, well, quality is really your users are the judge of that, and the way that they experience things oftentimes across products, across surface, across time, if you just think about these incremental approaches to the scope of whatever that is that you own, you are very likely not to make the whole thing better.\n\n(01:08:57):\nSo I think we have to fight against that. And the way I look at it is, the way I talk about it is reach for the stars and land on the moon. And what I mean by that is that vision work is really important, and I think sometimes you can get a bad name because you can end up with some folks that are doing vision work that goes nowhere, and they make a beautiful deck and then it gets seated on a shelf and nobody ever builds it. That is not what I'm talking about here, that is not what I recommend, but actually vision work that absolutely does look at the entirety of the experience, a comprehensive approach, a journey approach, and thinks about how these various things may come together to be better, and sketch out the ideal version. And I think Brian Chesky talks about it, I think it was the 11-star experience I think he once said.\n\nLenny (01:09:45):\n[inaudible 01:09:45] stuff. That's what we talked about a couple of times in this podcast.\n\nKatie Dill (01:09:47):\nExactly. Looking at it as a journey. It's not the five-star approach, it's not the six-star approach, but the 11-star approach, but show what that ideal version is, because if you don't know what that is, what are the chances that you're going to increment yourself to the right outcome in the end? And as I talked about before, building the house, you want to see what that picture looks like and how all these pieces come together, and I strongly recommend you want to see what it looks like in an ideal form, because you can always work back from that.\n\n(01:10:17):\nAnd so it's like, \"Okay, if this is what we want to get to, this is what our product is going to look like in two years, how do we get there?\" And what very likely is it's a team effort and various parts of your organization are going to have to own various parts, and maybe we ship this piece first so that we can study it and learn and make sure that the data is good before we move to the next piece, I'm not suggesting you have to ship the whole thing at once, but that North Star lays out the process in a way that I think allows for big risk taking in a way that is measured and thoughtful and actually also feels like progress as you step towards that versus trying to get their day one and likely end up giving up.\n\nLenny (01:11:02):\nI love that, reach for the stars, land on the moon. That could be a metaphor for so many things. Let me try to squeeze in one more tactical tip for people listening. If someone's hiring a designer, so someone that's not a designer, just a founder of product team, what should you look for that may be a red flag or something that you want to look for to feel good that they're going to be a good fit?\n\nKatie Dill (01:11:23):\nThe key, I think, to keep in mind is it's easier to teach tools and process than it is taste and character, so I would certainly pay a lot of attention to that. Their hit rate for great judgment and great taste, and how they've honed that, even if they're not very experienced, just to see do they have that natural inclination for great things. The other piece of it is that certainly you want to find somebody with great talent, for sure, and high craft, but you...\n\nKatie Dill (01:12:00):\nTalent, for sure, and high craft, but you also want to find somebody that's humble. Folks that are really good at what they do aren't always, but humility is a really important part. I think it's a really important part for anybody on a team because if you're working on a team, you need to work together. And it is important that they have that respect and empathy and understanding and enthusiasm for the folks around them, but also the users. Humility means that they're going to pay more attention to what the users are saying and hopefully be curious about what's working and what's not, and strive to navigate these things to make it better. The last piece would just be hustle or chutzpah. I'm not sure exactly what's the right way to put it, but the design and the creative functions is the act of creation.\n\n(01:12:53):\nAnd it's scary. To take a blank piece of paper and propose something that you think is better, is scary. To have the courage to say, \"This is not good enough and we should do it again,\" is scary. Having somebody that has that courage inside them to fight for great is pretty important. And that hustle to try to execute on that rapidly is, of course, essential as you're hiring at any stage company.\n\n(01:13:23):\nLastly, I think you were asking in particular, especially with younger companies or with startups, I think one thing that can be hard, it's like do you hire a more junior doer or a more senior thinker/operator? It's like if you had all the money in the world, all of it. But I do think in your early stages you probably do need a doer, but it is important to also have that lens of how do you build an organization that's user-focused and the way that they operate and the way that they work together, and bringing a strategy that will help to be user-focused from the start. Maybe a great way of doing that is having a more senior leader, design advisor, and then a kind of executor or doer full-time on the team.\n\nLenny (01:14:10):\nThat's a really cool tip. On the craft and taste piece, a lot of times people don't have that themselves necessarily. Any tip for how to measure that? Is there a book you'd recommend or trick? Or is it just trust your judgment and does this feel great to you?\n\nKatie Dill (01:14:28):\nIt's contingent on what is the thing, what is the user need? Something that is really great, we do a lot of tools that we strive to make them power tools for our users. And a lot of times that means dense information that is still easily accessible, but will definitely feel different than perhaps a consumer product that is meant to be extremely light and sparse and directive to one individual thing at a time. So it really depends on the context of the product sometimes. That's why it's hard to kind of quote an individual book. But yeah, I can think on it and we can put it in the show notes. There are definitely books that talk about the principles of great design and we can look at that.\n\nLenny (01:15:12):\nAmazing. We'll link to extra books that come to mind after. One other question I wanted to ask is, what's a favorite project that y'all have worked on at Stripe?\n\nKatie Dill (01:15:21):\nOh yeah, we got a good one that I'm so excited about. First off, I don't know if everybody knows this, but Stripe prints books. Stripe Press, we print books that are, we consider, ideas of progress. It's our intention of bringing great ideas out there. Most of them don't have anything to do with financial infrastructure. It might be any number of interesting problems and opportunities of things and ideas that people have talked about.\n\nLenny (01:15:50):\nI have many of them in my background here. I'm a huge fan of Stripe Press.\n\nKatie Dill (01:15:55):\nNice. And we take great care to deliver these ideas of progress and books that hopefully feel beautiful. We have a new book coming up that you can pre-order now, and it is Poor Charlie's Almanac. It's actually-\n\nLenny (01:15:55):\nAlready pre-ordered.\n\nKatie Dill (01:15:55):\nYou did? I actually excited to hear that.\n\nLenny (01:15:55):\nI'm really excited for it.\n\nKatie Dill (01:16:12):\nIt's a fascinating book. It's 20 years old. It's actually Charlie Munger's words, but Peter Kaufman, a friend and a colleague of his, assembled all of these documents over the years of things that Charlie had written and said and put it into this kind of anthology. And so this book is really fascinating and it's not really a linear story so much. We have reprinted this book. We created a teaser site that I strongly recommend you all check out. It's really, really fun.\n\nLenny (01:16:41):\nOh, man, it's unreal. I remember when you launched that. I was like, \"It just keeps going and gets crazier and wilder and amazing.\" I don't even know how that's possible on a website.\n\nKatie Dill (01:16:49):\nIt's pretty awesome. Our website team is... We talked about the importance of design and engineering working super closely together. It's just like that. That art and science coming together into something that hopefully is fun and engaging and people want to pursue it. So the book will be coming out soon and we're working on an update to the site that we're really, really thrilled about, so you can read the book online in a special way. So yeah, very big fan of this.\n\nLenny (01:17:17):\nWhat's the website for folks? Do you happen to have the URL? Otherwise, we'll link to it in the show notes for\n\nKatie Dill (01:17:21):\nThe book. Yeah, yeah. It is press.stripe.com will be where you can see all the books that we have at Stripe Press. And I believe the first one in the line... And actually what you'll see in the website is that we originally had a typical buying model of the squares outlined. One of the things that we sought to do with the website is to consider what would be a great experience for understanding different books. And when you go into a bookstore and you see the spines of the books and you pick them up and you turn them around and you look at them. And so that's actually what you will... I should stop describing it. Just go and check it out and you'll see we sought to deliver this work in a way that would be aligned with what a reader would want to pursue.\n\nLenny (01:18:07):\nI can't help but ask, but how did that even come together? Was it just like this passion project of like, \"This book's coming out, I just want to invest a bunch of time resources into this?\" Or how does that happen at Stripe?\n\nKatie Dill (01:18:19):\nStripe's mission is to increase the GDP of the internet. We strive to build global economic prosperity because that's greater access across the globe. But there's more ways to do that than financial infrastructure. Financial infrastructure is absolutely a major part of that. It is like the lifeblood of businesses, and it enables them to accomplish more. But this notion of ideas of progress is another angle into that. While it might not be our core business, it is very much aligned with our mission. And so yes, it takes time, but we feel that it's important for what we're setting out to do. And it also relates to the pursuit of creativity and excellence. It is a part of our identity. It is a part of who we feel we are or we strive to be, and we're excited to share that with people. It's in some ways how they get to know us and they get to see the care that we put into any number of things.\n\nLenny (01:19:19):\nKatie, is there anything else you want to share or touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKatie Dill (01:19:24):\nWe talked a little bit about the importance of different disciplines and the importance of quality being a group effort. I hope this doesn't insult my function, as I say, but at the core, design is simply intention. You're bringing intentionality to the decisions that you make in thinking about who is this thing for. If you're designing a doorknob, let's say, and it's like, \"Does the doorknob speak to whether or not I'm going to push or pull or turn? Is it comfortable in the hand? Is it easy to manufacture? Is it easy to put on and remove?\" These are some of the intentional decisions one could make, whether or not they're a designer, an engineer, the product person, any old function can put that intentionality.\n\n(01:20:17):\nIf you think about who is impacted by this, who is using this? And that literally could be anything from designing a doorknob to designing your org structure to designing your strategy. Obviously, great design is also creative, and it also is demonstrated with great taste for what is beauty. Of course, that's where I would say that design expertise with people that have these creative skills and this great taste is an incredible important thing to bring into the organization. Day one, everybody can bring more care and intentionality, and I think that will result in better outcomes, internally and externally, in the long run.\n\n(01:20:56):\nI think your podcast is a great example of great craft and great quality. I was just saying this to my husband the other day, as I was talking about doing this. It's just like, your podcasts... There's more usable learning per minute than most. I don't know if that's a metric that you're measuring, but I love how you don't have your guests tell about their background. Because when someone tells about their background, that is interesting, but it's not really usable information. It's like, \"I can take this information and run with it and then bring it to my own team and make my work better.\" You have clearly thought about that. Well, I don't know if that's why you made that decision.\n\nLenny (01:21:38):\nAbsolutely. That is exactly [inaudible 01:21:40]\n\nKatie Dill (01:21:41):\nOkay, great. I also love the way that you set these things up. You had said to me, in the thing that you set me, it's just like, \"If it's not good, we're not going to ship it.\" And you set it in very nice ways, by the way. But at first I had this like, \"Oh gosh, what if it's not good?\" But I also had this moment of like, \"Well, that's pretty great because if it's not good, he's not going to embarrass me to the rest of the world, hopefully.\" And I love that because that was that courage that I was talking about earlier, too, of that you're not going to let bad go out, because you know that each one of these little things will end up leading to a belief of the level of quality of what somebody can rely on getting when they listen to your podcast. Again, one workout isn't going to be a six-pack, but every one of those things will end up leading to better quality overall. I don't know, kudos to you. You're nailing it. So great.\n\nLenny (01:22:36):\nKatie, what a nice way to end it. I really appreciate that. That's exactly how I think about it, actually. You cracked my whole strategy of just making it as concretely useful as possible. I was actually on David Perell's podcast recently and he had this really good way of describing this, which is exactly what I've tried to do, but I haven't put my words into it of make it as useful as possible per minute without removing the humanity. And I realized that's what I do, is I could cut all the stories of everyone's backgrounds, but that sucks. It's optimize for value and concrete, tactical advice, but also make it fun and human and interesting.\n\n(01:23:15):\nSo thank you for the kind words. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got a number of questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nKatie Dill (01:23:24):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:23:25):\nOkay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKatie Dill (01:23:30):\nOne, How to Win Friends and Influence People. It's an oldie but a goodie. I forget how many years old it is, but many, many decades. I think it was in the 1930s? The cover is funny. You might be embarrassed to read it on a bus, I don't know. But the learnings from it are timeless, and I've actually read it four times and I can always do for another because it is a great reminder of just how important the way you articulate things are. And not in a negative or gross kind of way, but people care first and foremost about themselves. That's the body that they're within, that is the context that they're within. Recognizing that can be really powerful as you think about leading teams, as you think about working with other people, as you think about being a good spouse, whatever it might be. I'm a big fan of that one.\n\n(01:24:19):\nThe other one is a newer book, I think actually still a couple of years old. It's about the Wright Brothers by David McCullough, I think. I've been learning how to fly, and so I'm very obsessed with this, but I think it's a book that's relevant to everybody. Especially even entrepreneurs, because it just talks about the impossible challenge of nobody thought it could be done. Even the American Institute of Science didn't think it could be done. And these individuals that had the resolve and the commitment to make it happen. I think also the power of this beautiful partnership. Of course, they're brothers. That doesn't always mean you get along, but they're brothers and they did, and it's a beautiful story. Big, big, big fan of that.\n\n(01:25:05):\nAnd then third book, I would just say is... Actually, I brought it over because I knew you were going to ask me this question. I don't know if you could read that, but The Boy, the Mole, the Fox, and the Horse. This book was given to me by Jenny Yarden, which I think you may know. It's wonderful. It's a beautiful story. It makes you laugh, it teaches you a thing or two, and one of the best quotes in it is, \"One of our greatest freedoms is how we react to things.\"\n\nLenny (01:25:32):\nVery Buddhist.\n\nKatie Dill (01:25:33):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:25:35):\nWhat is a recent favorite movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nKatie Dill (01:25:39):\nOppenheimer was amazing. And TV show? Shrinking. And that one was really good, and it actually really surprised me how funny and positive it was, because the trailer for it does not give that impression. But it was really good.\n\nLenny (01:25:55):\nI've not seen that. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nKatie Dill (01:26:01):\nTell me what work you are most proud of. And the reason I ask that is because it helps me understand their taste and their judgment, what motivates them, what work they view as good and as a good outcome. It also helps me understand a little bit about what they like to do and where their gravity pulls them.\n\nLenny (01:26:28):\nIs there a favorite product you recently discovered, be it an app or physical thing? Anything?\n\nKatie Dill (01:26:32):\nYeah. As a parent, you should definitely know the Toniebox.\n\nLenny (01:26:37):\nOoh, I don't don't know this. The Toniebox?\n\nKatie Dill (01:26:40):\nIt's so good. The Toniebox. I should have brought it over, too. So it's like a squishy box, but it's a speaker. And your kids can control it. And the way they control it is these little figurines. This is also a brilliant product because you want to buy all these figurines. But the little figurines, it could be like Belle from Beauty and the Beast or Elsa from Frozen, and they place the figurine on top and that activates the stories that the thing reads to you or the songs that it plays for you. You can record your own voice so that you're telling stories to your child. And they control it all by themselves and they can drop it on the floor and it's all good. But the Toniebox, pretty awesome.\n\nLenny (01:27:20):\nI just texted my wife to check this out so I don't forget. Amazing. Great. Very handy and timely. Do you have a favorite life motto that you'd like to share, come back to, find meaningful?\n\nKatie Dill (01:27:31):\nI don't say this out loud, but I've had it as a Post-It in my jewelry box and that I see regularly. Tomorrow is today. And what I mean by that is that so often I will in my head be like, \"I'll do that tomorrow. I'll eat better tomorrow. I'll think about that vision tomorrow. I'll communicate better expectations tomorrow.\" And it's like those joke signs that \"Free beer tomorrow.\" Because very easily, tomorrow just always moves on. And I needed to remind myself that it's actually, it is now today. Tomorrow is now today.\n\nLenny (01:28:14):\nI love that one. I feel like I need to take all these mottoes, which are amazing. I love this question that I just invented. And just put them all on my wall here in this office.\n\nKatie Dill (01:28:22):\nYes, that's a great idea. You should make a book. Book of Lenny Mottoes.\n\nLenny (01:28:26):\nOh, man. The Tribe of Mentors version of Lenny's podcast.\n\nKatie Dill (01:28:29):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:28:30):\nIs there a lesson that your mom or dad taught you that has really stuck with you, especially as a newish parent?\n\nKatie Dill (01:28:39):\nI think about this a lot. I am a mom of twin girls, and I feel so lucky that my parents raised me to see that accomplishment is based on merit and hard work. They never made me feel like because I was small and that I was not as strong as somebody, whatever it might be, that I wasn't able. My dad had me chopping wood and mixing cement as a young kid, and that certainly led me in one part to be a designer, but also to be able to pursue leadership. Even though sometimes I'm comfortable willing to be in the room where I am vastly outnumbered by people that don't look like me or just not letting that hold me back.\n\n(01:29:31):\nAnd actually, I thought about that the other day because I was riding in a Lyft to the airport. This was also at 4:00 AM, so it was a really hard time to be in a Lyft to gone to the airport. The driver was telling me about his kids, and actually he had twins. It was one boy and one girl, and so we were talking about twins. He's like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, my girl, she's my princess. My son doesn't understand why I don't let her take out the garbage and why her job is to sweep and that's his job.\" He's like, \"I'm not going to let her take out the garbage.\" I was sitting in the back of the car wondering, \"Should I tell him, you're screwing it up?\"\n\n(01:30:07):\nJust because she's a female doesn't mean that she's not able to do the jobs, even the hard ones and even the bad ones taking off the trash. I really do think that I'm so fortunate that that was never the way that my parents were looking at it. Now, today, I feel like that is very much a part of a little bit of my chutzpah and willingness to step out there because I hadn't been held back from those hard jobs earlier.\n\nLenny (01:30:39):\nFinal question. You mentioned that you fly planes, and this is actually related to my last question. I guess one that I was going to ask if that's true, you mentioned it is true. Is there a lesson that you've taken from learning to fly and flying that you've brought into product, leadership, design? Anything come to mind?\n\nKatie Dill (01:30:57):\nFirst of all, learning to fly has been such an amazing experience because there haven't been many things in my adult life where you feel like yourself going from knowing nothing about something and being able to do something, and what an incredible journey that is. Whether it's learning a language or whatever, that is awesome and highly recommended. But one of the key things that has definitely sat with me from the experience of learning how to fly that I definitely thought about how to bring it into my work is that when I was getting to the stage of being able to do things myself... My instructor is sitting there next to me and usually is right there at the controls with me, so if something goes wrong when I'm flying, he's right there.\n\n(01:31:46):\nI remember one of the first times when I was learning how to land where he moved his seat back. A lot. And so he was now out of touch with the controls. He could jump there if he needed to, but he really pulled back. And it was such an incredible visceral experience. I was like, \"He trusts me. Right now, he is showing his faith in me to take this and take this challenge on.\" And I think about that all the time. It's just like, \"How can I show my team, people I work with, my support and trust in them to take that challenge on?\" I can't always move my seat back, but what might be the way? And so that's been a pretty great example of something I want to pull forward.\n\nLenny (01:32:35):\nThat is an awesome metaphor. I feel like this whole episode is just full of beautiful metaphors. Also, just full of beauty. Katie, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKatie Dill (01:32:50):\nFirst off, please do find me online because, as I talked about, we are in the pursuit of trying to build excellent things and it's always a work in progress, and so I'm always interested to learn how others do it and see how we can improve our own methods. I am Lil_Dill on Twitter, and then I think that name was taken on Threads, so I'm Lil_Dilly, with a Y, on Threads, and then I'm on LinkedIn and find me there. We're hiring, so definitely reach out at our job board, too. Stripe.com/jobs. Definitely check us out. We definitely would love to hear from you.\n\nLenny (01:33:30):\nKatie. Again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKatie Dill (01:33:33):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:33:34):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:33:37):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Twitter’s ex-Head of Product on Elon, consumer products, culture, more | Kayvon Beykpour\n\n## Transcript\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:00):\nThe first time I ever met Elon was over FaceTime. He was just like, \"Do you want to just come hang out? You can swipe left or swipe right.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:05):\nYou're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:15):\nWe wanted to change the lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product had changed at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nHere's a list of stuff that your team shipped while you were there, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, Fleets, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, Twitter Blue, Spaces, and obviously, live video.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:31):\nThe sacred cows are like their own roadmap. What are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nThis was all relatively quickly.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:00:39):\nI was like, \"I might flame out completely, but Hell if I don't try.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:46):\nToday, my guest is Kayvon Beykpour. Kayvon was the beloved and longest-tenured head of product at Twitter and also GM of the consumer business at Twitter up until the day that it was sold to Elon Musk. He landed at Twitter through an acquisition of his company, Periscope, which was the world's largest live-streaming platform, which ended up inspiring Instagram Live, TikTok Live, Facebook Live, and basically every other social network getting into live video. He sold the company to Twitter in 2015, continued leading Periscope for a number of years, and then moved into leading product and then the entire consumer business.\n\n(00:01:19):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, Kayvon shares what it was like getting Elon up to speed at Twitter, what it was like to be fired from Twitter, which actually happened during his pat leave. He also shares all kinds of lessons and stories from transforming Twitter's internal culture from a risk-averse, stagnant, product org to one that was shipping major features regularly. We talk about how they used acquihires and up-and-coming hungry product leaders to lead new initiatives and break through many of their sacred cows.\n\n(00:01:47):\nWe also get into jobs-to-be-done, Elon's layoffs of most of Twitter's staff after the acquisition, his lessons from building and shutting down Periscope, and also building consumer products in general, and so much more. This episode is full of stories and lessons and a bunch of stuff that you haven't heard anywhere else. With that, I bring you Kayvon Beykpour after a short word from our sponsors.

Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file, and building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer, the customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug.\n\n(00:03:45):\nMost tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Pave are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like error on line 53 and never end up getting started with your product. OneSchema intelligently corrects messy data so that your customers don't have to spend hours in Excel just to get started with your product.

Great to meet you finally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):\nIt's amazing to meet you. I think this is going to be quite a unique and interesting podcast. A big thank you to Scott Belsky, illustrious former podcast guest for introducing us. When he introduced us, the one thing that he told me is that \"Hopefully, Kayvon will share the story about our time getting Elon up to speed at Twitter.\" I would love to hear that story. I bet other people would too. Are you able to share that story?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:05:03):\nWhen all the drama went down with Twitter and Elon ended up buying the company and after the eight months saga of legal back and forth ended up actually taking control of the company, there was that first two-day period where it was complete chaos at Twitter with the sink and Elon spreading his tentacles trying to find out who are the people that he wants to keep and what are the projects that are interesting. In the midst of all that, Scott ended up getting contacted and being asked, \"Who should Elon talk to?\" Scott recommended that Elon chat with me.\n\n(00:05:42):\nSo, the first time I ever met Elon was over at FaceTime where Elon was just very curious to ask, \"Hey, you were at Twitter for a while. You seem to have done some things. What should I be digging into, and who I be talking to?\" At the end of that conversation, we ended up arranging an in-person meeting where Scott and I went to Twitter HQ to actually meet Elon. I think this was day two of Elon having brought the sink in. So, we had this really bizarre, wild, but really fun experience of walking into Twitter HQ, and in my case, walking back to Twitter HQ for the first time after having been fired, which was a very strange experience for me, and we walked into the building.\n\n(00:06:29):\nI was scurried through the back door because I didn't want to make a scene and make it ... There was a lot of rumors around is Kayvon coming back, and I just wanted to avoid all of that. So, it was just a very weird experience of being scurried through the elevator and through the back door and go to this massive conference room, which we had on the second floor of the 110th building.\n\n(00:06:53):\nIn that massive conference room, it was me, Scott, Elon, and then at the very, very end of the room, Walter Isaacson, who by the way, I had a hard time. I knew I recognized. I'd never met Walter in person, but I was like, \"Is that Walter Isaacson?\" But he said nothing the entire time, and we had probably a two-hour conversation talking about the past, the future of Twitter, the good, the bad, the ugly. At the very end of the conversation, Walter came up and introduced himself and was like, \"Hi, I'm Walter. Can I get your information just in case I need to ask any follow-up questions?\" And I was like, \"Oh, shit. I guess that whole conversation was on the record. I don't know.\"\n\n(00:07:31):\nSo, it was a very surreal experience for a bunch of reasons, including just being weird for me since I was very conflicted about coming back to Twitter, even physically in the office. But I must say it was really fun. It was fun talking to someone. Obviously Elon, I'd never met him before, and he's one of the most successful entrepreneurs of our time. So, that was exciting to go into that meeting. Also, I had been spending so much time dreaming about Twitter and trying to mold Twitter in a direction that I thought was compelling and working with a team of people to do that, and to meet someone who also had a similar ambition, but obviously, in different ways ... He had his own dream for Twitter ... but it was really bizarre and unique and surreal seeing that glimmer in someone else who was like, \"Yeah, I also just bought this thing, so I can actually do whatever the Hell I want. And by the way, here's some crazy dreams I have for doing it.\"\n\n(00:08:35):\nIt was just a really ... As someone who had had their own dreams for the product, witnessing that it was really unusual and cool. I think that's probably what Scott meant when he said, \"You should ask Kayvon about that,\" was that I think we both kind of recognized that something's about to happen here. Obviously, you have this very public spectacle of someone essentially having a takeover of a public company, but all of that stuff aside, also, you could tell Elon was scheming and cooking up, \"What am I going to do with this?\" It was cool to see that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):\nThat's an amazing story. I love the Walter Isaacson component of it. Do you feel like you made a dent on his approach and way of thinking? Obviously, he made a lot of big radical changes. Do you feel like you made a dent in his view of where Twitter should go?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:09:26):\nI don't know. I certainly don't think I've made any impression on how he should run the company. I think that's Elon's going to Elon in his way, and I think he certainly has had some radical moves in terms of how he's running the company, the decisions he made, how many people he let go, how the company is structured, the culture, and all that stuff is like ... We didn't even talk about that stuff.\n\n(00:09:49):\nI think what we spent time talking about is I shared my perspective with him of people I thought who were exceptional, who were at the company, and if I was in his shoes, who I would spend time with and embrace. Most of the people that I mentioned are still there, which is awesome, and they seem to be A, empowered, which is great, and B, having fun, which is awesome. So, hopefully, that stuff is useful.\n\n(00:10:16):\nWe spent a bunch of time brainstorming products, and I had my set of projects that I was very passionate about because we'd given birth to them. I think a bunch of those projects, it seems like Twitter's still investing in and putting a lot of energy behind like Community Notes, which at the time was called Birdwatch. But I always felt really bullish on that being the future of essentially how content is moderated on Twitter, just because it was very clear that the way we were handling content moderation among many other flaws just wasn't scalable.\n\n(00:10:55):\nSpaces and Communities and the Creator Program of helping people make money on the platform, those are projects that we started over the year-ish prior to Elon taking over. My hope, having left the company and having had a new leader come in, was that those things would be given more oxygen. It's been awesome to see that those have been continuing to grow and be molded in different directions. Yeah, I think in that sense, I hope that our brainstorm was useful, but for all I know he doesn't even remember the conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:31):\nI freaking love Community Notes. It's such an amazing product. Let me ask two more dramatic-oriented Elon Twitter questions just to get these out of the way. The first is you said you were fired. I don't know if you've shared that publicly. People always wondered, I think, what happened. I know you tweeted during your pat leave, \"I'm leaving Twitter,\" and no one really knows the story as far as I know. What actually went on there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:11:53):\nIt was weird, to say the least. Honestly, it took me some time to come to peace with it because it was frustrating and surprising. I guess the story of what happened starts with Jack resigning. Jack resigned in ... It was like November of 2021 at the end of the year. The board chose Parag to be the CEO of the company, and I've had a long relationship with Parag. I respect him, but I had mixed feelings about that.\n\n(00:12:23):\nTo his credit, Parag very quickly addressed one of the biggest things that I was really frustrated about in the last three years essentially of my time at Twitter. One of my biggest points of feedback and points of consternation was the structure of the company in that we had a functional organizational model, meaning we had a head of consumer product, me, we had a head of revenue product, Bruce, we had a head of engineering, we had a head of design, we had head research. It was a functionally run organization.\n\n(00:12:52):\nAnd the combination of that model and the type of leader that Jack was wasn't working in my view. I think if you're going to have a functional organization, you need to have a GM or a CEO who's extremely leaned-in to tiebreak and resolve conflict and make sure the team is moving quickly. And Jack, for all of his amazing qualities, just wasn't operating that way, and so you had a group of highly opinionated people that often disagreed and would create either the need for consensus or deadlock. That just was driving a lot of people crazy, including me, and I think it really held us back from living up to Twitter's potential.\n\n(00:13:29):\nAnyway, all of that was super frustrating for me, and the combination of that and a dramatic change in leadership with Jack leaving and Parag coming in, I wasn't feeling too stoked. Parag to his credit, when he became CEO, quickly changed that and shifted the company to be a GM structure. And he promoted me to being the GM of consumers. So, for the prior three-ish years, having been responsible for growing Twitter's consumer product, I was only responsible for the product management team. I didn't have engineering or design, and that honestly was difficult. It's very difficult to change culture with one hand tied behind your back.\n\n(00:14:10):\nStill no regrets. Had a lot of fun. I think we had some impact, but it was frustrating. So, Parag changed that. The irony of this, by the way, is he was one of the biggest proponents of the functional structure. When he became a CEO, he changed the structure, promoted me to be the GM of consumer, and I was, at that point, one month ... This is one month before I went on pat leave because my daughter was due.\n\n(00:14:35):\nSo, I went into my paternity leave being like, \"All right, I'm going to give this a shot. We'll see. We'll see how this goes,\" as Parag addressed the biggest frustration that I had with the company and how it was being run. So, I had some trepidations but went into my pat leave feeling optimistic. Mind you, this was all before Elon was even part of the picture. He had not become a board member. There was no news about him having beef with the executive team or for that matter, trying to buy the company.\n\n(00:15:06):\nSo, I went on pat leave maybe a week and a half before our daughter's due date. Three weeks goes by. In that three weeks, Elon joins the board, leaves the board, makes an offer, has a short dramatic feud about whether that goes through. And also during that time, my daughter was born. Some drama at the hospital for us, but a week afterwards, we come home. Mom's healthy. Daughter's healthy.\n\n(00:15:35):\nThe day after we get home from the hospital, Parag called me and said that he was letting me go and that he was taking the team in a different direction. That night, Twitter signed a term sheet with Elon to sell the company. So, a lot happened in a very short period of time, and the reason that Parag gave is exactly what I shared publicly, which was that he wanted to take the team in a different direction. The only other thing he said is that given that new direction, he thinks that the things that I'm good at, Twitter doesn't need anymore. And the things that Twitter needs are not particularly in my skill set or in my interest.\n\n(00:16:14):\nHe wasn't particularly expressive about what that direction was, but that was the reason he gave me. That was a huge bummer for me for a bunch of reasons. One, I love the company. I love the product, and also it just sucks to leave not on your own terms. And two, I was just confused. The timing was very frustrating and confusing for me, not least of which because I had just come home from the hospital while on paternity leave. But also because at that time, especially the fact that Elon was buying the company was ...\n\n(00:16:48):\nWell, I was conflicted, honestly. I was very excited because Elon is someone that I looked up to immensely, and you just look at the things that he's achieved in the world and you can't help but be inspired by that. And two, Twitter for all of, I think, the impact and progress that we had made, had a lot of challenges associated with its governance and the fact that it was constantly vulnerable as a public company. So, there's just always this drama associated with Twitter as a public company, even a private company before that, that made it extremely hard as a builder to get shit done and have the product live up to its potential.\n\n(00:17:27):\nOne of the benefits of this particular takeover was that Elon offered a path towards solving all of that. It was like, \"Oh, cool, now you've got one owner who happens to be, by the way, extremely opinionated about the product and a voracious consumer and creator of the product.\" I think there was an incredible opportunity in that that now you have this organization and this product and this incredible ecosystem that can be devoid of all the political bullshit associated with being a public company. Now, it has this conduit to just living up to its potential.\n\n(00:17:59):\nSo, it was a bummer to be removed from that, I suppose, without having any agency myself. That was very a long-winded answer to your question, but that's what happened towards the end there. Like I said at the beginning, it took me a while to come to terms with it and to be at peace with it. I did eventually. Listen, there's a huge silver lining of I spent the first year of my daughter's life with her and my family. My wife Sarah had left Twitter eight months prior to me leaving, and so when's the next time we could all be together and have time and space to just enjoy each other and our new family, and frankly, to avoid a lot of the drama that ended up ensuing that not a lot of people could have predicted? The deal was on. The deal was off. It is just a whole lot of drama that I got to miss, which is the silver lining.\n\n(00:18:53):\nThen it was confusing there for a bit because when Elon did end up buying the company, in that conversation that I had with him, it was definitely ... I was conflicted about do I want to maybe spend some time working on this still? Elon was very cool about ... He actually used this phrase at the end of our conversation, which I still find hilarious. He was just like, \"Do you want to just come? You seem like you care about the product, and you don't have dumb ideas. Do you want to come hang out?\" And I was like, \"What would my job be?\" And he was like, \"Don't know, just hang out, and you can swipe left or swipe right.\" He used the swipe right, swipe left Tinder metaphor, and I thought that was hilarious coming from him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):\nFor ideas that come up just like, \"Here, I have this idea [inaudible 00:19:41]?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:19:40):\nNo, like swipe right on whether you want to be here or swipe ... He's like, \"We don't have to make this a thing. Just do you want to hang out and work on the product with us?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:40):\nThat's so funny.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:19:51):\nSo, I ended up deciding that actually, I'm just ready. I'm ready to move on. I spent enough time at this company, at this product trying to shape it into something that I was passionate about. I think it's someone else's turn, and especially Elon. If you buy it's your turn. You can do whatever you want with it.\n\n(00:20:13):\nSo, that was conflicting for a bit, but I would say towards the end of the year, it was pretty clear in my mind that I was ready to move on and start thinking about other problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:23):\nWhat I think about is there's always this tension being a PM at a company with a very strong-minded, product-oriented founder, and I feel like you would've been in the epitome worst possible situation there, where you're a product leader between Elon and the rest of org. So, I think it probably would not have worked out.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:20:40):\nI'm not sure I would've been able to articulate it as succinctly as you did just now, but I think that is the feeling that I had that it's not my place anymore. I don't have a canvas to try and exert my dreams on this place. I think Elon took that mantle, and I'm excited to see what he going to do with it is the feeling I had.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):\nYeah. You've touched on this. You're known for at Twitter someone that turned the culture of the product team and Twitter in general from a very stagnant, nothing-is-changing product to shipping all the time, all kinds of stuff. So, here's a list of stuff that I've gathered your team shipped while you were there. Twitter Blue, which is I think called Premium now, Spaces, Super Follows, Communities, newsletters, topics, fleets, being able to see Instagram photos in line, testing reactions, edge-to-edge photos, tons of UX improvements, and obviously, live video. What did you learn about how to change a product culture from a company that's very risk-averse and essentially just not shipping a lot to taking big, bold bets and becoming a lot more open to new stuff?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:21:53):\nTrying to drive culture change is both one of the most challenging things and rewarding things. For the first year of my role ... There was a chapter of my time at Twitter, maybe just to backup, that was just leading Periscope. In that first chapter of maybe two years, I was not really involved with Twitter stuff all that much. That started to change when we really tried integrating Periscope with Twitter, but chapter two of my time at Twitter was when I became the head of product. That first year of being the head of product was one of the most difficult of my career not because the work was difficult, but because it was so politically and bureaucratically exhausting to try and change culture in a way that just there wasn't alignment around.\n\n(00:22:40):\nIt comes back to the point I was making earlier around the organization of the company was functional, and so it is one thing for me to have some ideas and a plan and a strategy that I felt compelling. But when you have to essentially drive consensus amongst your peers across the other functions, that's a different game. That's not execution. That's politics and consensus building. I both can't stand that stuff, but I think ... This is going to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but good enough at it and I have enough patience at it that I invested the time and the energy. I think a less patient person wouldn't have bothered and would've thrown their hands up.\n\n(00:23:25):\nI think honestly, a lot of it just comes down to I had practice. At my first company that I started in college with one of my best friends, Joe, who I ended up co-founding Periscope with, we got acquired by a big, public, ad tech company called Blackboard, and we were 19 at the time. We got thrown into a public ... I was a senior executive at a public company that was not your quintessential tech company. It was even more difficult to get things done. So, through the four years I spent there, I learned a lot about how to navigate that type of environment.\n\n(00:23:56):\nIt all came coming back when I was given the product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like-\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:24:00):\n... product role at Twitter. That first year of changing culture was like walking through mud, and it was really difficult. But I think when we started building that alignment and building excitement that like, oh, actually maybe we should be taking some bigger swings, and when we started seeing through the execution against some of those plans, I think it ended up, it got easier and easier. It becomes addicting. I think people end up feeling like, oh wow, maybe these sacred cows we had didn't need to be so sacred.\n\n(00:24:37):\nAnd so I think after that first year, it became a lot more fun. It was still difficult, but it felt like we were all swimming in the same direction a lot more. But I think my takeaway there is you can't change culture without having alignment from the top. It's difficult to change culture when you have a pocket of a company trying to advocate for change.\n\n(00:25:01):\nSo I think we got there in the end. We didn't move as much urgency as I think we drove. We were not fast enough, we were not bold enough. I was consistently dissatisfied with what I was achieving and what our team was achieving. But I think we did make a change. Twitter was an organization that had a lot of sacred cows and became very [inaudible 00:25:24] in its ways. Literally the first two years I was at the company, the stated product strategy for Twitter was refine the core. It was like, we're not making any big bets here, team. Our goal is to keep turning the knobs that are working.\n\n(00:25:42):\nAnd listen, as much as I was kind of throwing stones from the sidelines through that period when I was in Periscope land in our separate office a few blocks away from the mothership, that focus actually did help the company for some period. The reason why Twitter went from stagnant to declining DAU growth to growing DAU again is because they refined the core. This is when they went from the reverse chronological timeline to the ranked timeline, and the year after that was a lot of knob turning. It was like, how do we make these recommendations better? How do we make our push notifications more relevant?\n\n(00:26:16):\nNow, that is not an inspiring product strategy. That does not result in the product feeling materially different or adding new capabilities, but it did return the company to user growth. And I think that the fact that it did actually calcified the organization's reticence to take any risky bets even more. So it was a very interesting predicament because when I got into the role, the goal wasn't to change that progress. We wanted to continue reaping the benefits of refining the things about the product that were working really well. What we wanted to change was a lack of ambition, the lack of creativity, the lack of customers feeling that the product was changed at all.\n\n(00:26:58):\nBecause you would hear people, I mean, one of the beautiful things about working on Twitter as a product is that you have literally customers being injected into your veins. Every single day, whatever you change about a product or whatever you don't change, they're telling you what they love and what they hate. And it is both exhausting and exhilarating. It is one of the most ridiculous luxuries of product development, is working on a product that many people use and therefore you get that much feedback around.\n\n(00:27:25):\nAnd it was a very common thing for us to hear people say, \"What are you all doing over there? The product hasn't changed in eight years.\" And that was horrible to hear, and I felt it too, as a critic on the sidelines, as a user who wasn't an employee who eventually became an employee, I had the same feedback. And so that was my mission. I was like, I am somehow ridiculously in this fortunate position that I've been entrusted some responsibility here. I might flame out completely, but hell if I don't try. And so that was both fun and exhausting, like I said.\n\n(00:28:00):\nBut it was as simple as starting with we are voracious users of the product ourselves, and if we aren't, by the way, that's its own problem. I think that in order to build something wonderful, you have to be a customer of the product. And sure, I'm sure you could point to businesses and products where that's not the case, and I'm sure there's a flaw in that philosophy somewhere, but I've always believed that one of the best ways to build products is to be a customer yourself and to find your own pain points and to build a product that you want to use. And so that's actually not that hard to do if you're a user of Twitter and you can think critically. It was ripe with opportunity. And so it was actually really fun and amazing to be able to craft a plan that started to take a swing at some of these things.\n\n(00:28:50):\nAnd the other thing I'll add to this is that there were so many sacred cows at Twitter that the sacred cows are their own roadmap. It's like a built-in free roadmap of like, all right, what are all the things that you think we're not allowed to change? Let's start there. Everything from moving from reverse chron to a ranked feed, that was a sacred cow. Text and 140 characters, that's a sacred cow. Not letting anyone control any tweets that they see on the platform. The notion of Lenny owning his reply space was anathema at Twitter.\n\n(00:29:21):\nIt's just like if a tweet gets, if you get an at mention and you don't like it or it's abusive, we're not touching that. We can't annotate tweets with [inaudible 00:29:30], all that stuff, those are all sacred cows. And the process of starting to address those one by one reveals a lot of the cultural hesitations that existed.\n\n(00:29:43):\nSo yeah, I'll never forget one of the first features, and this is such a tiny feature that we worked on after I started the role, we were building this feature called hide replies. It still exists in the product today. If someone replies to one of your tweets, in the tweet details area as a reply to one of your conversations, before you had no ability, the only way you could address unwanted content was reporting it. So that was like Twitter acting as policemen and policewoman, completely unscalable and challenging, especially in the context of someone replying to one of your tweets.\n\n(00:30:18):\nAnd so we wanted to add a feature that let you hide a reply to one of your tweets, and it's not impacting what people say. It's not impacting free speech in the sense of you can still broadcast whatever you want, but if you're going to come into my reply space and say some shit that I don't want to see in my feed, I should be able to hide that. Tweet what you want, but don't at mention. You can't scream in my face basically.\n\n(00:30:40):\nAnd I remember we had a PM on our team who was leading this feature who a few weeks into this project mentioned to me that she had had a conversation with someone on the engineering team that told them, \"Don't work on this feature. This is bad for your career. This is not going to launch, and you don't want to work on this. You don't want to be seen as having worked on this.\" Because it was so kind of anathema to we can't let people hide replies to their tweets. And I just remember hearing that and my blood was boiling. That is the most, it was such an interesting representation of the culture, not just hesitation to try new things, which by the way, that product might've failed. And that's fine, but it doesn't mean you shouldn't try.\n\n(00:31:27):\nBut to go so far as to dissuade someone else who was excited about experimenting with a hypothesis to see if it could help customers on the platform and telling them, \"Don't work on this. It's bad for your career.\" As a microcosm for some of the cultural challenge we had around trying big, bold bets, which by the way, this wasn't even a big, bold bet. It was such an innocuous thing to try. But there was a lot of that and it made it very difficult without some sheer force of will and also just a lot of effort. So there was a lot of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):\nKayvon, there's fractals of stories that I could infinitely follow. There's so much interesting stuff here. One that just stands out is this idea of the sacred cows become your future roadmap. It's like flipping it from here's the thing that we're all afraid of. No, this is not what we should be doing. I think that's really interesting and could be a lesson to people.\n\n(00:32:20):\nThe other is just, I love this point you made about the growth was most accelerant when you're just focusing on the core, that's what actually ... Like optimize, people bash on optimizing the existing experience and just micro-optimizing, improving, versus trying to take all these big, bold bets and experiments. Obviously, that's also valuable. But I think it's really interesting that that's what reignited growth and was responsible for growth for a while.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:32:44):\nAnd continue to be, by the way. One of the lines that we had to maneuver was creating a portfolio of bets where some of them were not speculative at all. We knew that if we continue to invest in ML and getting better with recommendations in the main feed and through notifications and things like improving the onboarding flow, it was rife with opportunity.\n\n(00:33:12):\nYou'd have really dumb things happen. We would learn. There was one just bizarre and incredible meeting we had where we finally had got more rigorous around instrumenting our onboarding flow. And we found that in a couple countries, like we had a bug with our SMS verification flow where we wanted to verify users who were signing up with a phone number and our telco integration to send SMS verification cards just wasn't working. And so a huge percentage of people signing up in the UAE and other countries just couldn't use Twitter.\n\n(00:33:46):\nAnd so of course at the scale that we were operating in with hundreds of millions of users, you need to be able to refine the basic building blocks of the product, and that's going to lead to reliable growth. But we wanted to balance that with a portfolio of other bets and product improvements that would materially add new capabilities. And that was a balance that I don't think existed. And by the way, I don't think we nailed it either under my tenure, but it was the driving force of what I wanted to achieve, was to create a better balance that would result in evolving the product and introducing new capabilities. And so that's what we tried to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:28):\nIn terms of what actually helped turn things around, things that I kind of gathered from what you shared so far, one is just building a little momentum, having some quick wins of new products that people start to get excited about. So creating more excitement down the, oh wow, we can actually try new things. There's also, it felt like there's a sense of trust that you built with Jack and execs of just like, okay, we can actually trust this team.\n\n(00:34:47):\nAlso, it feels like because growth started up, there's probably a sense of like, okay, we can try some new crazy ideas. It feels like another part of your strategy was [inaudible 00:34:56] hires and bringing in these entrepreneurial folks to take the lead on some of these big ideas. Can you talk about that? Was that something you actively thought about and was that a big part of the impact there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:35:07):\nTotally. Yeah. So I think a couple things. One, the only thing I'd add to what you said in terms of the ingredients, it was also just storytelling and just repetitive storytelling around this is the vision, these are the bets we're making. Here's why. And you can't just tell that story once. I'm talking internally, by the way. There's a whole other component of this, which is externally how do you tell, especially for a product like Twitter where it's a consumer product that hundreds of millions of people are using, and you have many constituents, you have users, you have advertisers. And so it was very important for us to tell the story of here's what we're doing and why. Here's why you should believe in us. And by the way, give us all your constructive criticism too, because we're listening and we're going to build that into ... So that storytelling was really, really important.\n\n(00:35:51):\nAnd this is oversimplifying the world, but there's two types of internal team members. There are people who hear that story, who have been a part of the organization who's been slow, or maybe they've been outside the company as a user of Twitter, and they're like, I'd never really want to work there because it doesn't seem like a particularly ambitious product company. And one of two things happens when you hear that story. Either you're inspired and you're like, yeah, we can finally take a swing at making this product better. And maybe I wasn't interested in working in this company before, but I mean, this is an iconic product, and to have an opportunity to reshape it is really exciting. Or again, oversimplified world, but there are people who are very pessimistic and maybe aren't excited by that vision. Let's just stick to what we know works. We're not going to take any big swings. That's a waste of time.\n\n(00:36:35):\nI think one of the really important things about driving cultural change at the leadership level is you've got to identify whether someone's on the wagon or off the wagon and either quickly convince them to get on the wagon or if they're not on the wagon, they shouldn't be there. And that's something that we were terrible at, and we didn't have the organizational structure to be able to enact that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:59):\nThe wagon is they're excited and bought into this vision and want this to happen?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:37:03):\nCorrect, and contribute towards it. And off the wagon is like you're not at the company. And we didn't have an organizational structure that could allow for that, nor frankly, the fortitude. I include myself in this. I feel like I've learned a lot about how to make that determination. So I think we were terrible at that. And Elon is the whatever, if that's a spectrum, Elon is the opposite spectrum of that. His tolerance for people who are not aligned and his tolerance for low performance is famously extremely low. And I think it's one of the things that when I say A/B test, it's very interesting to see the extreme to which he has operated.\n\n(00:37:37):\nAnd I think I've learned a ton around, we didn't have the organizational structure nor the fortitude to be swifter, and that made cultural change way slower. We still were able to change the culture, not as much as we should have, and certainly not as quickly as we should have or efficiently as we should have. Because by the way, a lot of high performers who are aligned with that desire to change and build, they don't have the, there's not like an equal distribution of patients. If you're extremely talented and you're dealing with organizational shit, you're going to go find someplace else that lets you do your craft and have impact. So it's very difficult.\n\n(00:38:16):\nBut anyway, going to your question, one of the things we found that was a really effective way of accelerating cultural change and also helping drive some of these product initiatives that were particularly speculative was doing small acquires. And really the benefit of that was, A, you bring in a founder type who is an entrepreneur, who drives urgency, who has ambition, who's ideally savvy enough to also work in the context of a large organization, which sometimes is a totally different skillset. I mean, it is a totally different skillset. And a lot of our most ambitious bets that were the riskiest and most misaligned with how the product worked or there was no easy staff to build on top of, a lot of those bets were driven by founders who we basically acquired and said, \"Here, you are going to run this.\"\n\n(00:39:13):\nAnd they believed in it. They were able to rally a team around them, and it's all the attributes of a startup, but with the canvas of a product that hundreds of millions of people use and more resources. So Spaces, Communities, Community Notes, called Birdwatch back then, these were all projects driven by ... Fleets, as well. These were all projects that were run by small teams led by entrepreneurs who we acquired, like Keith Coleman runs Community Notes, last Birdwatch. He actually was my predecessor. We acquired his company so that he could be the head of product. And then when he moved on from that role, he was extremely passionate about this idea of crowdsource moderation and letting people annotate misleading content on the platform without Twitter acting as a policeman.\n\n(00:40:03):\nAnd that was a very speculative bet that by the way, a lot of people thought, most people thought was a terrible idea. We gave Keith a little silo to go build this vision, and then it was our job to make sure that bet didn't get suffocated in the context of a big organization that would otherwise have not had patience for it.\n\n(00:40:26):\nAll of the community effort or the creator efforts started with Super Follows and tipping, and all these things were led by Esther Crawford, whose company we acquired and who had her own couple of viral moments with the Elon acquisition. But she's a phenomenal leader who, again, is a perfect example of balancing that entrepreneurial startup muscle with the savviness to be able to get things done at a large organization. Fleets was run by Mo Oladam, who's an entrepreneur, and Communities has gone through a few iterations obviously and still is in the product, but John Barnett and a team of people who we acquired from Chroma Labs.\n\n(00:41:02):\nSo I think that that story of acquiring hungry, ambitious founders and giving them responsibility and latitude is a success story of Twitter's. I mean, I'm a beneficiary of such a bet as well. My company Periscope was acquired, and I was given the responsibility to eventually lead the product team. So I feel like that we ended up realizing, both through the company's history and through learning, that this is actually a very effective way to drive cultural change and to deliver impact because you need a special type of person to be able to both operate within the existing structure and change the structure, to know when to use the system and to know when to fuck the system.\n\n(00:41:52):\nAnd I feel like my whole life has benefited from other people taking bets on me like that, to the point that even I was like, \"Really? You sure you want to?\" And so I think I've enjoyed trying to pass the buck and do that for other people, and I've never regretted it. You always, taking a bet on people and especially throwing them in a deep end, which on paper they may be unqualified for, I think is one of the best ways of driving change. And by the way, supporting growth, you've learned so much more when you're thrown into the deep end than in other contexts. And so I think it's fantastic, it's an expensive strategy if you're going to go buy a bunch of companies, but it's a great strategy for the situation that we found ourselves in at Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):\nIt feels like every big bet was one of these companies from the list that you just shared, and I'm glad you shared Periscope, obviously. That's a great example, too. I guess maybe just a follow-up question here, is there anything you learned about how to do this well? I know you talked about maybe creating a little silo for the team, because so many companies acquire and acquihire and they just go nowhere.\n\n(00:42:59):\nSo I guess just a two-part question, just like what are some tips for how to do this well at a company? And then, two, you also, we were talking offline about this previously and I think it's a really interesting point, that a lot of companies staff based on who's available versus who is right for the role, and let's wait until that person is there for us to bet on this. Can you just talk about lessons there?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:43:19):\nThat last one is a huge pet peeve of mine that I feel like we learned the hard way, and particularly it's a common pattern I think in highly functional organizations where you have different people making decisions on how to staff projects, and there's nothing inherently wrong with that. But I think in the situations, in the situation we found ourselves in where we had this sort of cultural evolution that we were going through where some people just didn't agree with the things that we were prioritizing, they were begrudgingly going along with it, but you would end up in a situation where the combination of that sort of cultural shift and strategy and the fact that the way teams were being staffed was not, there's ultimately no single decision maker other than the CEO and Jack is not going to get in the weeds and debate a staffing decision on the team, resulted in a situation where oftentimes we'd have projects, like the one I mentioned about hiding replies, where there wasn't even an agreement on the team about whether this was a good idea and whether this is worth trying or how to do it.\n\n(00:44:22):\nAnd imagine, it's hard enough to build something from nothing. It's even harder if the team doesn't believe in it. This is to the point of just being toxic. The startup would never succeed if all the people who are working on that startup aren't to the point of being perhaps irrational obsessed with that idea. And still willing to see truth, you need to be able to see whether the thing is working or not, but if you don't believe it in the first place, I'm not betting on that succeeding.\n\n(00:44:50):\nAnd so this was common, and sometimes not as extreme as the examples that I mentioned, but I think one of the lessons I learned, and it's quite intuitive actually, is you need to staff projects with the team of people that are well equipped from a skillset standpoint, but more importantly have an obsession with the idea they want to pursue. It's going to make them work harder, it's going to make them be more creative. It's going to make them have the sufficient level of ambition and desire to will this thing into existence. Because every project, whether big or small, there is an element of you need to will this thing into existence because it's hard. The only way you're going to get through that pain is by having that desire, and I think a very easy cheat code for an organization to employ is to say, if you're going to work on something, especially if it's speculative or risky, staff it with a set of people who believe in it and really want to learn whether this solves a customer problem or not. Because if you don't have that ingredient, it's going to drag everyone down and it's just not going to be as successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Heap, the product analytics solution that shows you everything users do on your digital product, website, mobile product, or other digital services.

This kind of touches on something I wanted to touch on, which is jobs-to-be-done. This is maybe one of the most recurring controversies of the podcast, is jobs-to-be-done amazing or is it really bad and not something you should do? We've had many guests share their opinions. I feel like at Twitter, jobs-to-be-done was implemented so strictly that it burned a lot of people out on it. It's like, oh my, this is not anything anyone should ever do. I'm curious, just your lessons and experience of just with frameworks in general, the jobs-to-be- done specifically, maybe even OKRs.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:47:31):\nI've only seen one interview on your show that covers this. Sriram was particularly spicy when he talked about jobs-to-be-done, which is unsurprising because. I spent a lot of time talking to Sriram about jobs-to-be-done. I mean, I guess I'll just start by saying I was not a fan of how we leveraged jobs-to-be-done at Twitter. I thought it was exhausting and not particularly helpful, and so it's a particularly sore subject for me because I was sort of charged with defending it and rolling it out. It's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something. But...\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:48:00):\nIt's hard to do that when you don't really believe in something, but to me the critique is less about Jobs-to-be-Done though there are many critiques of it and more about every framework at its limit is followed to such a religious extent it's just unhelpful. You need to have nuance in how you leverage these frameworks. Otherwise, you lose the forest through the trees and you end up following a process for the sake of following a process. And that's what happened with Jobs-to-be-Done. So I think that's my real critique of it. It's not the... I mean listen, the premise of Jobs-to-be-Done and my most charitable take on Jobs-to-be-Done, which is actually useful is that it forces you to look at things through the lens of customers and understanding what their needs are and understanding what their true alternatives are outside of the narrow lens of your product.\n\n(00:48:47):\nAnd I think that's just healthy product thinking. You don't need a framework called Jobs-to-be-Done. You don't need to think about milkshakes in order to be able to do that. It's like you could employ common sense or you could leverage something like Jobs-to-be-Done, to be able to force your mind to think of things through that lens. So I think that's my charitable view on what Jobs-to-be-Done can help you do, but as a framework into and of itself as a sole governing principle of what to build, it's just not useful.\n\n(00:49:14):\nBy the way, in the same way as, and I think Twitter had this problem as well prior to our detour around Jobs-to-be-Done, if the only way the organization is trained to think about what to build and what not to build is OKRs, it's equally unhelpful at the limit because sure, you can have a good sense of what you should build to drive metrics, but by the way, you might be focusing on the wrong metrics or that might not help you have the right balance of things to build. That might not help you see when the things that you're building are actually hostile to customers.\n\n(00:49:47):\nSo just as an interesting example, the thing that I remember about your interview with Shriram, if I'm not mistaken, I think he mentioned, and I love Shriram, I'd be happy to debate him about this on his podcast, but he mentioned one of the examples I think was the Amazon. When you get order confirmation from Amazon, they intentionally bury the order details. You have to click the link and authenticate to go see what you ordered. I don't give two shits what metrics that drive for Amazon. That is one of the most customer hostile things I experience in my daily life. I order a lot of things from Amazon. I hate the fact that I can't search my email to see what I ordered. And so I think the problem with these frameworks is that you lose nuance and ultimately, and this is where I agree with Shriram, he actually mentioned this on your podcast as well, you need to be able to make trade-off decisions that balance what's right for the organization and what's right for the customer.\n\n(00:50:43):\nAnd sometimes based on how you devise your frameworks, your metrics aren't actually aligned with the customer's benefit. Like the Amazon example, and we had many famous examples in Twitter's history, which were the same. One of our key metrics that we always optimized Shriram growing was DAU and we had obviously the rank timeline did wonders for growing DAU and it was a great experience for many customers, but we often had features that would not lead to a good customer experience and the team would just be blind towards leaving hostile customer experiences in place because it was good for metrics and aggregate. And the famous example of this is we had this toggle, which we called Swish very affectionately, but it was like a sparkle icon.\n\n(00:51:26):\nBefore you could switch between the rank timeline and the following, that reverse chronological timeline, which is still in the product right now, it was just the toggle. You would press a button and it would turn your feed reverse chron, which very few people use as a percentage of our users. But you had power users who really cared about having a reverse chronological timeline and we took so many baby steps on the evolution of this product. The very first baby step was you press the toggle, it turns you to reverse chron and then we would pull the rug out from underneath you and make the experience go back to the rank timeline after, I don't know, 24 hours or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:02):\nOh, wow.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:52:03):\nAnd the reason that the team felt strongly about keeping it this way is it was better for metrics. Why? Even if Lenny wants a reverse chron feed, we knew that he would spend more time in the app if we put them in the rank timeline and this was the number of debates that we had about this because the team understandably was like, \"This is good for metrics\", but at the same time you'd have customers being like, \"I fucking hate this experience. I'm telling you I want reverse chron. Stop randomly changing it for me.\"\n\n(00:52:34):\nInstagram has I think gone through their own struggles with this as well. They tiptoed their way towards ultimately giving people control and the difficulty in making product decisions comes down ultimately to making these trade-off decisions and you have to look at things through the lens of the customer. You have to balance that with what's driving the right business outcomes. And sometimes those things are aligned and sometimes they're not, and the answer isn't any one framework. Sometimes it's just good old-fashioned judgment and product taste. And so that's where my take is different. I don't think the issue is Jobs-to-be-Done, although I'm not the biggest fan of Jobs-to-be-Done. The issue is just having the right nuance and ultimately the right leadership to be able to weigh these things and see when your frameworks are not actually helping you make the right decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:20):\nI think that's really important advice and I love hearing the details if I actually think about this stuff. Actually finding this balance is very hard in practice. I'm curious if there's something you could recommend or have learned about how to know when you've gone too far with a framework like signs like you have implemented this to religiously and maybe you should be thinking a little more broadly.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:53:41):\nThere's two, I think, simple and obvious ones. One is if the result of your framework is that subjectively bad decisions are being made, then something's got to change. Assuming the person who's making this assessment has good product taste, which is in of itself subjective obviously, but my personal view on this would be in the role that I had, if I saw that our organization was being incentivized to make decisions that to some non-trivial degree of the time were just bad decisions that I don't like as a user, I can't stand by as a user or builder, then something's got to change. Either bad judgment was made in following the process or the process was wrong, or if that framework, it didn't even lead to the right debates, then that's how you know. Either you have an incentive problem but the team did what they were incentivized to do or that there was bad judgment and that's a different problem obviously.\n\n(00:54:38):\nBut I think in the situation we found ourselves in where the team was again understandably hyper focused on driving DAU because that was the strategy for so long. It left so little room for even taking ambitious bets that in the short term wouldn't drive DAU, like some of our bets that I still to this day believe in hurt DAU in the short term, but you had to squint and believe over time would improve some metric DAU or otherwise, like a product like Spaces. In order for Spaces to be actually used, you needed to make sure that when Lenny starts a Space that people would join. And how do you get people to join Lenny space when they're used to having an asynchronous feed of tweets? Well, you can send push notifications, you can occupy really trying real estate at the top of the app that lets people know, \"Hey, Lenny's live right now. He's in a space, there's people here, come join.\"\n\n(00:55:31):\nGuess what happens when you put a bar at the top of the app that tells people when they're live? You move tweets down, you move ads down, DAU goes down, revenue goes down. And so if you have an organization that's just hyper focused on the thing that matters is driving DAU quarter over quarter, then that doesn't leave enough room for nuance to accommodate new speculative bets that might hurt one metric, but over time have other consequences that are positive and beneficial, like enabling an entire new vector of content creation and conversation on the platform. I guess the other answer to your question in terms of how do you know when the framework's not serving you right? When you start imagining and planning for a bunch of bets that the organization then sees is disincentivized to make successful, then something's got to change.\n\n(00:56:17):\nEither your strategy is just not the right strategy because it doesn't abide by the frameworks or the framework needs to accommodate the fact that actually we're going to try some things that in the short term either might not show up as blips on our DAU radar or are going to help some other metric that's important. And so that took us some time to get, and we tried a variety of schemes to make that work. Community Notes, the project that I was mentioning Keith started, we intentionally structured that like a startup. It was literally like we made a seed bet on Keith and his team and we were like, don't worry about the OKRs. We're not going to judge you on the basis of your OKRs.\n\n(00:56:57):\nAnd there's some pros and cons to that. A lot of our projects worked that way. Fleets started that way. Community Notes started that way and some other projects started more part of the core organization because they were so intertwined with how we were the nature of the product that it just made sense to... Separating it was going to do more harm than good. So you just have to figure out based on how execution is going, whether you've got the right framework and you've got to be willing to make adjustments when it's not working.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):\nThat's actually really helpful. The two that I'm taking away here is how often are you feeling bad about the features you're shipping? Like they're bad for users and you think they're bad for you as a user potentially. And the other is it keeping you from taking big bold bets that don't necessarily drive the metrics you're focusing on. Okay, so before I let you go, I want to spend some time on Periscope. I don't know if everybody knows the history and story of Periscope. Basically it was the biggest live video streaming platform in the world and I imagine inspired basically every other social network to build a live-streaming platform, Instagram live, Facebook, TikTok, obviously Twitter. So I want to spend a little time here and see what you learned and also just broadly consumer products, but first of all, I hear there's a story with Kobe Bryant and Periscope about him using it in some form. Can you share that story?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (00:58:18):\nBefore Periscope launched publicly, which it was in March of 2015, I want to say, we had a small beta that grew to maybe 500 people in total before we actually released the app publicly. And in that time while we were still in beta, I was trying to personally onboard every single user and I had a shtick that I did, which was we'd get them in the app and I would start a broadcast. We had a feature called Private Broadcasting that we basically built for this use case, which is someone joins, I'm going to go live and they're going to join and I'm going to show them how the app works. And we were spending a lot of time in our office, so Kobe, Chris Saka actually invited Kobe to the beta.\n\n(00:58:59):\nAnd so Chris connected us and I did a private broadcast and Kobe joins and I was like, it was like 10:00 PM in the office and my routine was like, let me just walk around the office talking through the mechanics of Periscope through the lens of this demo of like, \"Hey, let me show you around the office and here's how the chat works and you can tap the screen to send hearts and if you want me to do something, go to the room over there, just type it in the chat and it'll come up.\"\n\n(00:59:22):\nAnd sort of showed one of the things that was unique about Periscope was it was a one to many broadcasts, but still low latency enough that it felt like a FaceTime so you could have the bidirectional communication between multiple viewers and a broadcaster. And so I was teaching him how to use the chat and showing him the office and he was playing with it and at one point through the end of the demo he posts a comment that was like, \"Why the fuck would anyone want to watch someone else stream live?\" And I remember my heart sank and I started fumbling through like, \"Well, we think it's cool.\"\n\n(01:00:03):\nAnd before I could even get the words out, he posted like, \"I'm just fucking with you, bro. This is incredible.\" And I just remember it was just such a surreal moment that has, I'll never forget, I mean Kobe's a legend obviously, but to have him essentially troll me while also putting a point on what was cool about the experience and that was bidirectional and something he commented on to cause the broadcaster to change their behavior or change the experience, it was a really ironic full circle of showing off how the product works. But yeah, it's one of my favorite early Periscope stories.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nOh man, if I kept doing that, the manual onboarding, I'd be like, \"Who's coming?\" Just always worried that someone else fancy is going to join. You never know who Chris Saka is getting, who he's talking to. That's amazing. Okay, so it's been about 10 years, I believe, since you sold Periscope and about six years ish since you stopped running at as CEO, something like that. Now as I shared, every single platform basically is doing this. They added live video streaming. I'm curious if there's anything you learned about just competing with these major platforms.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:01:14):\nWell, there's a few reasons why Periscope failed ultimately and why we shut down the app. Obviously Periscope, the technology and the mechanics still lives on because you can go live on Twitter, you can watch live broadcasts on Twitter, you can do audio conversations on Twitter and all of that is the Periscope stack. Still there, which is awesome that the legacy lives on in a different form factor. The reason that the Periscope app failed, it really comes down to a few things. One, we did not address the core problem that retention wasn't good. Our poor retention was mapped by just an incredible surge in top-line user growth. And for Periscope, it was interesting because every month or two we would blow up in a new market that would just bring along an incredible surge in usage.\n\n(01:02:02):\nWe blew up in the US, we then blew up in France. We then blew up in Turkey. We then blew up in the Middle East and you had these incredible surges, but underneath that surge, the core product had retention issues and we ultimately just did not, we didn't spend enough time prioritizing, addressing those. And in fact, we shipped product changes that made those retention issues worse. Compounding that was the fact that one of the theses behind our acquisition, the Twitter acquisition, was that we would leverage the scale and the community and the product mechanics of Twitter to make the product grow faster and also become more durable. And I think that's connects to one of the reasons why I feel like one of my learnings and one of the things that we knew but just failed to execute on was that I still am very skeptical that there can be a consumer product that is just focused on live video, like a generalized synchronous live video application for short form video I don't think can be durable on its own. I think you have to surround that product with enough features and capabilities to allow a community and an ecosystem of users to be able to stay in touch with one another asynchronously and synchronously. This is why a lot of the other products that you mentioned that incorporate live capabilities and we're shameless about copying. What was working about Periscope, they're surrounded by a scaffolding that lets people also stay in touch with each other. Asynchronously Instagram, it's an asynchronous product that has synchronous features like live. Same with TikTok obviously. And I think we were in this position where it was a live only product.\n\n(01:03:39):\nYou are connecting with your audience and having a great time when you're broadcasting live, but you're not using the product to keep in touch with that community when you're not broadcasting. How often throughout the day would you broadcast live from your phone? And mind you, this is different for products that are live. There are live consumer products that focus on a specific vertical like whatnot for selling or Twitch for gaming that have very different properties that make it more durable as a standalone live product. But Periscope was really in this consumer generalized live-streaming from a phone land, and I think it was just not durable to have the product be live only. And the time it took us to integrate with Twitter was way too long. And there was reasons for that that come down to just how distracted Twitter was with its own roadmap and refining the core and they just had other fish to fry basically.\n\n(01:04:32):\nAnd all of that leads us to competition because at some point Facebook woke up and decided this is cool and we need to go build this. And I obviously wasn't there on the inside, but legend has it, Mark says, \"Hey, you 300 people, stop what you're doing. Go basically make live exist in our product as a first [inaudible 01:04:56] experience.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:56):\nOh, wow. I didn't know that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:04:57):\nAnd if you have that level of organizational effort put on building something that by the way, you don't have to spend any time wondering what the product looks like, just go copy these features basically and make them work. And they did a lot of other savvy things too from a partnership standpoint. We had a lot of prominent streamers that ranged from influencer or just creative people that became known on Periscopes, all the way up to celebrities like Kevin Hart and others who were prolific Periscopers that Facebook just went and bought out.\n\n(01:05:30):\nThey were just like, \"Cool, we're going to pay you a bunch of money to stream exclusively with us.\" So they hit us from all sides. They had the entire company put their effort towards building live in a way that was cohesive in the core product first with Facebook and then Instagram and then also attacked it from the creator as well. And we were too slow and it was very painful to think about because it was like many other insights that Twitter had early. Twitter had the right insight, but botched the follow through. I'm not pointing fingers, I blame myself for that just as much, but there's a pattern where Twitter is really great at spotting meaningful consumer behavior changes. They spotted Vine and acquired Vine, botched it, spotted Periscope, botched it, spotted Instagram by the way, before Facebook tried to buy Instagram, Twitter was trying to buy Instagram, and there are other reasons why that didn't fall through, but it's interesting to me, it's one of the interesting aspects of Twitter's history.\n\n(01:06:35):\nThey were phenomenal at spotting meaningful changes in consumer social behavior, and actually putting their money where their mouth is in terms of trying to follow through on bringing those bets in-house, but then botching the execution. And so that was one of the things that was really motivating for me when I was in my role leading product of Twitter was I didn't want to make that mistake and we didn't end as up buying anything like Vine or Periscope and keeping the product. We obviously bought lots of small acquirers, but we did obviously have a bit of a story with Clubhouse that ended up with us building Spaces and competing with them. But anyway, that was a long, rambly story. Hopefully that answered your question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:25):\nYeah, there's so many. Again, it's all these fractals of thought threads I want to follow and ask you about. Real quick on the Vine and Periscope point, I was going to ask this. Twitter, as you said, had the opportunity to win in video in so many ways. Vine was amazing, killing everyone, loved it, and then it's fades away. I guess, you already shared a lot of challenges Twitter had with executing, shipping, Secret Cows, things like that. Is there anything specific with video? Was it just like, oh, this is not actually a huge priority and we're just going to ride it for now and that's why it didn't work out? Or is there anything more that?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:07:53):\nNo, it's even more like pathetic than that 'cause I think Twitter did believe in video, but it made this classical mistake that we also unfortunately recreated with Periscope, which was they had the insight around short-run video, they bought Vine. They then competed with Vine internally. So Vine was a separate organization within Twitter, separate office obviously in New York and then Twitter rather than integrated holistically into the product and pour gasoline on it, they built a native Twitter video feature that was a different stack, different team. It became what you think of as Twitter video now. It's like the most simple active uploading video and all the professional video tools called Media Studio that let publishers like ESPN put content. All of that was basically built as a separate team, separate organization, separate product that was competing with Vine. You had two visions for short form video that were manifesting, and that's the quickest way for things to get messy.\n\n(01:08:58):\nAnd of course the separate startup team is going to get, you're not going to be able to make good on the vision of buying the company and integrating it in all the right ways if you compete with it internally. And we had a similar thing happen with Periscope. We were very focused on Periscope with separate organizations, separate structures, separate app. Periscope at the time primarily was focused on UGC live video. So user-generated content being streamed from a phone. Twitter then decided to get in the premium live video business very famously with acquiring rights to Thursday night football, the NFL. Guess what happened? We competed internally rather than have a cohesive technical and product vision for how to embrace live video across the spectrum of UGC and premium live video, Twitter put a separate team in charge of premium with a separate product, separate technology stack. And so you had two ways to manifest live video on the product. It was like UGC live video, which was awkwardly not even really implemented well with Twitter at the time. And then premium live video, which had totally different UX, total different team, totally different architecture. And by the way, the company put a tremendous amount of energy and investment in talking about Twitter being a place to watch the NFL. And meanwhile you had this burgeoning UGC ecosystem, so this was like we're making the same mistake all over again. Now, luckily in the Periscope case with a lot of persistence and impatience and table pounding, we eventually fixed that mistake, but we wasted a tremendous amount of time. It was just a lot of headbutting in politics and eventually it took us a lot of time to technically reintegrate things together and now it's clean and awesome, right?\n\n(01:10:48):\nESPN can go live with behind the scenes content at Wimbledon and it's the same technology stack and the same user experience, the powers, Lenny going live from his iPhone. But I think that was one of the reasons why it was an example of failed execution that ended up wasting time, resources and just leading to a subpar product experience that other companies I think have avoided making such mistakes. Facebook being a prime example, as frustrated, I am with them as a competitor for having really taken over the use case for live video. Got to hand it to them, brilliant execution, have a lot of respect for them. So we made sure to not make that mistake moving forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):\nI imagine there was reason for that. Partly I imagine this calcification of just like, we can't get you done, we just need to start a new team and do this thing. I imagine it always comes from like, oh, this makes sense. And then you realize, okay, this was a terrible idea down the road.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:11:47):\nYeah, it's that and also leadership. When you don't have unified leadership around these things, you end up making decisions that are in conflict with one another. They're just need a highly opinionated person at the top that avoids that kind of messiness from a.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:12:01):\nThat kind of messiness from a product and engineering standpoint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nYou mentioned Clubhouse, so I think what's interesting is one, many people copy Periscope as a product. I don't know if you'll describe it as copying, but it feels like spaces very inspired by Clubhouse. Do you have just a current philosophy on when it makes sense to be super inspired by another product and build it into your existing product versus like, no, you should not do this?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:12:30):\nI think it's always about doing the right thing for the customer. Everyone has always been shameless to be shamelessly inspired by other people's ideas. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. I think copying ideas can be done in poor taste and can be done with taste. I think some of the people who copied Periscope did so in poor taste, can't blame them. I wouldn't have done it the same way, but it worked. So you can't say it's the wrong thing. I think that it's possible to take ideas in good taste and take ideas in poor taste.\n\n(01:13:07):\nAnd I think with Clubhouse, we actually had been working on audio. Audio was one of those bets I mentioned that we structured very separately with a team of people, many of which were the former Periscope team, that when we wound down Periscope, I felt very strongly that there was still something to the idea of synchronous conversations. Because one of the famous things that I think we botched with Periscope is that we always... Our dream and our vision for Periscope and how we talked about it was was a mechanism for teleportation. You could see through someone else's eyes and be teleported somewhere else. It was like that was the story we told ourselves. That was the thing that inspired Periscope. And to a certain extent, a lot of people did use the product for that way. You could go see what it was like someplace in the world where it was something amazing happening or civil unrest happening or some important moment happening with breaking news or otherwise.\n\n(01:13:58):\nBut it turns out the vast majority of our users were not using Periscope that way. It wasn't a rear-facing camera experience where you were showing someone the world, the vast majority of people were using it to just talk to other people. They were bored or they were lonely and they wanted to just have a conversation with other people. And it turns out video and audio is a very interesting way of doing that that allows for more nuance, more long-form conversation, more in-depth conversation, especially in contracts to Twitter, which has mechanics to really incentivize quick, snappy broadcasts that don't lead to much depth. And so when we shut down Periscope, we were like, man, we really need to enable a new form of conversation on Twitter that has some of those properties. And so we had a team that was working on a project that we sort of code named Hydra. Hydra because there were multiple heads on this monster and those heads are participants in a conversation.\n\n(01:14:54):\nAnd so well before Clubhouse was on the map, we had many different iterations of both video and audio only experiences that just didn't feel right, weren't working right, but we felt like we were onto something. And when Clubhouse came on the map, it really re-centered, it put into focus a user experience that felt a lot more right and now give them complete credit for that. Paul and Rohan and that team did an exceptional job crafting an experience that really enabled that mechanic and that premise of enabling these longer form conversations to shine. And so we did shamelessly seek inspiration from what they had done and what had worked and we put our own spin on it. The execution of Spaces within Twitter I think has some similarities, but also really took advantage of the mechanics that you had available to you in Twitter. It's a different product. And so we took the ideas that we felt were shortcuts to making the experience work and then we put our own spin on it. And so I have no problems with what we did there.\n\n(01:15:55):\nAnd having had experienced the pain of not moving quickly enough with Vine from the outside and Periscope having lived that experience, we were not willing to not be the winner with this use case. It is one of the projects I'm most proud of that we worked on at Twitter because we were very radical in our execution. Hydra went from this tiny project that six people were working on that no one knew or care about to, we made Spaces as the number one priority of the company literally above any other project period. And we put a bunch of people on accelerating that product and making it come to life within Twitter. And a lot of that was having felt the pain and burn of fucking this up with Vine and Periscope. And so I'm really proud of our execution. And it was also really energizing. I hope for the company to see that, wow, we pulled that off. So yeah, it was good. It was nice to have that full circle experience and also nice that, personally, I love that aspects of Periscope continue living on within Twitter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):\nI did not know that. That is extremely interesting. Speaking full circle, when I joined Clubhouse the first time, Paul was there introducing me to Clubhouse and exactly the way you described Periscope, so I feel like he drew some inspiration from you one step back.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:17:30):\nPaul's amazing. I feel like we're kindred spirits and I could see... It was one of the things I love about that team is just you could just feel how palpable their excitement was and their passion was for what they were building. Another universe we could have worked together more closely, but I think what they built was incredible and we took inspiration from it for sure. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:58):\nSo you've built some of the most successful, most beloved, most used consumer products. You continue to help other founders with their product. I'm curious just if you have any advice for how to get better at building consumer products in terms of maybe craft a product, product sense. What have you learned about what it takes to build a successful consumer product?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:18:19):\nThe best cheat codes for getting better at building products is just being a voracious user of products. And just trying new things, feeling out what works well, what doesn't, what you like, what you don't like. There's just no replacement for that. It's such an effective way of honing your own taste and seeing what's superficial but not useful, what's ugly but useful, what's beautiful and useful. And you hone that by having practice and building muscle memory. And so I think there's not a lot of science to it, I think. I mean obviously science can help you become more effective at lots of things. But I feel like I've just always been very curious about trying new things. I'm a very hungry consumer of new things that people are building and I'm not quick to judge. I'll try it even if it seems dumb because sometimes things that seem dumb at the beginning become very meaningful.\n\n(01:19:20):\nAnd so it's always been a very helpful cheat code for me. And it's also just personally interesting. Every tool, even the silly ones, people put their heart and soul into it and it's like an expression of themselves and it's always interesting to see that, to see people's creations and to learn from them and see what you like, what you don't like and how you might create something of your own that borrows from that. So if I could give people any advice through the lens of what's worked for me, it's that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:51):\nSpeaking of trying new things, what are you up to these days?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:19:55):\nI'm building something in the consumer space. I started the company with a couple of co-founders late last year. We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but hopefully you'll be hearing from us pretty soon. But it's really nice to be back building something again, particularly building something with a small team again after seeing the opposite extreme with a really large company. We've just talked about lots of large company things. But yeah, hopefully you'll be hearing about it soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nOh man, I think this is breaking news. So mysterious and exciting. Kayvon, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:38):\nNo, no, I think we've covered quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:42):\nWe have. We have indeed. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:46):\nI'm going to take a sip of water and then I'll be ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:49):\nOkay, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:20:54):\nI love reading sci-fi. I just feel like sci-fi and mystery books are so healthy for jogging the imagination. And so some of my favorite books are by Neal Stephenson, I love Cryptonomicon. I love Reamde. I love a book called Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss, which is more like a fantasy book, but I just love escaping reality and thinking about sci-fi, thinking about fantasy is just, it's helpful for the soul and helpful for the imagination. So those are some of my favorite reads because it helps me. I feel like in some weird circular or wandering way, it helps me be more creative and imaginative. And by the way, that's true outside of reading as well. Some of the content that has shaped me, I feel like and help motivate my curiosity and a lot of things I built is sci-fi TV, right? Star Trek is incredible. We used to use as a metaphor for what Periscope was, we would think about Star Trek. It'd be really cool to be able to teleport or get beamed somewhere else in the world and we're not smart enough to go build that device, but what's the closest approximation to that that we can realize through software? Live streaming. So I think that kind of literature or content has always been inspirational for me and I think getting that through books is really healthy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:30):\nOn that note, is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that's inspired you in addition to Star Trek back in the day?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:22:37):\nI mean the most recent movie I saw in theaters was Dune Two, and it was incredible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:41):\nI just saw that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:22:41):\nIt's insane. I also thought Oppenheimer was... I'm a huge Nolan fan. Oppenheimer was captivating. To have that level of high octane in a biopic consistently for two and a half hours is so hard to pull off. And I thought it was exceptional. TV shows we're watching Tokyo Vice right now, which I really like. I think one of the best TV shows I've watched recently, I mean Succession was amazing, but maybe I'll pull a less popular one, which is Devs also in the sci-fi realm. I think it was a Hulu show. But if you're interested in tech and AI and you want great acting in Nick Offerman, Devs is a pretty amazing show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):\nI haven't heard of that. Have you seen 3 Body Problem yet, by the way? It feels like it's squarely in your wheelhouse.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:33):\nI haven't seen it yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nOkay.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:35):\nAnd it's funny, some content people are talking about it so much that I kind of want to not watch it now because I feel like it's really hard for shows to live up to the hype when you're mid-hype cycle. So I haven't gone around to it yet, but it's definitely on my list. I know it's the type of show that I would love, but I just haven't gone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:54):\nOkay, great. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates you're hiring?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:23:58):\nThe thing that I find is both very illustrative and helpful is just asking people to talk about something they worked on that failed and talk about something they built that succeeded as well. But I think you just learn a lot about self-reflection and their passions. But particularly their self-reflection. If they talk through something that they really cared deeply about that didn't work and why didn't it work? What were the takeaways? What did you learn from it? I think it teaches you about how willing people are to take risks. It tells you have they experienced failure, what they learned from failure. And so I think it's always, you just get to know someone really well. It ends up in a well-rounded understanding of a person, if you can dig into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nIs there a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:24:51):\nI love Proplexity. It's really interesting to me how Proplexity is a product that fits in your life and replaces a product that is so ingrained in people's behavior, which is using Google search for some set of use cases. And it's just really incredible to me how quickly Proplexity took that over. It is very hard actually to rewire your muscle memory if you're used to using Google for searching for 15, 20 years or whatever. It was just amazing to me how quickly my go-to became Proplexity. And frankly, it's one of the only non-development tool AI products that actually has retained. A lot of people try and consumer AI products that just aren't really, haven't retained. But Proplexity is one that it's a daily driver for me. It's on my home screen and I love it. I'm very impressed by it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):\nAlso a huge fan.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:25:46):\nYeah. Here's a bias one, my wife is actually working on a startup called Particle, and they're the news experience with AI. And what I love about what they're doing is that for the first time they're like they've rethought what the form factor and the unit of content for news stories should be. Articles are a failed format, is my belief, and certainly their belief. And so they've really come up with an elegant and engaging experience for understanding what's happening in the world in a way that's purely powered by AI. And it's awesome. Again, hashtag biased husband, but it's amazing. It's in beta right now. You can sign up on the wait list. The URL is particlenews.ai. They're letting people in on beta. If you sign up, use coupon code hashtag #KayvonLenny. That's not a real code. But yeah, so that's amazing. So that would be my second pick.\n\n(01:26:48):\nI'll give you a non-software one, which is actually a board game that I ran into, that I was gifted actually for my birthday. And it's called Crokinole. Have you heard of this game called Crokinole?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:00):\nI have not.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:01):\nSo Crokinole is Canadian. I think it's a Canadian board game and it's amazing to me because I've never seen a game be captivating to all age ranges. I love it. I play with my friends. My parents over Christmas were obsessed with this game. My daughter loves. It's a physical game. You flick a puck, like shuffleboard style, but miniaturized with a totally different set of mechanics. And it was just like seeing this game captivate, people of all age ranges was mind-blowing to me and it's really fun. So maybe a curveball answer for you there, but I think those are some of the products that I've been really enjoying and appreciating lately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):\nThese are awesome answers. What's the name of that game again? I'm going to-\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:48):\nCrokinole.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:53):\nOkay. I don't don't know how to spell it, but I'm sure Google will help me figure it out. We'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:27:56):\nC-R-O-K-I-N-O-L-E.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:59):\nGreat. I love the K in there. That makes it really fun. And by the way, I think it's also Particle.news looking at it. It's so cool. It's basically bullet points of news items and then it links to all the articles that have written about it. So it just summarizes, here's the things you need to know and it's beautiful.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:28:13):\nYeah, basically they consume and aggregate everything that's happening in the world by among other things, ingesting articles and then crafting these story modules through them that are summarized by AI. And then they let you actually interrogate the news and ask questions. So leveraging LLMs and tool calls, it's able to actually help you understand what's happening in the world. And they also are building a social layer as well. So it was very cool. I'll definitely get you in the beta.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:39):\nThis is actually amazing timing, because I was a huge fan of Artifact, the news app, and they're going away, so this is the next news app, so thanks for sharing that. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with people that you find useful in work or in life?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:28:57):\nSomething that definitely shaped my work ethic and how I work that came from my first boss actually. When I was 14, I had a summer job basically replacing and doing maintenance on fire extinguishers. So I would drive into San Francisco, my boss would pick me up in his truck, we'd go to big commercial buildings, hospitals, high rises, and we would take all the fire extinguishers in the building, hundreds of them to the garage, empty them, fill them, tag them, inspect them. And that was my first job. And I don't even remember if I was getting paid. I was probably getting paid very small amount, but it was just first work experience. And I remember there was this moment that I had finished dealing with my extinguishers and I was just sitting in his truck twiddling my thumbs doing nothing. And my boss came up to me and was like, when you've got nothing to do, sweep never sit around.\n\n(01:29:57):\nAnd it was so funny, it was just very tiny moment, but I've never ever forgotten that. When you got nothing to do sweep. And it had such a profound impact on my work ethic of there's always something you can be doing to move the ball forward and being productive and being impactful. And I'm so grateful that Fred, my boss, had that moment with me. It was like, I don't even think he understands how impactful that was, but it felt so much a life motto, but it definitely stuck with me and shaped how I work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:35):\nI love that you shared that story. I found that quote and story in GQ Magazine turns out is where you talked about this and I was going to ask about it and I didn't and I'm glad you shared it because I love it.\n\n(01:30:47):\nFinal question, we're going to go full circle. Scott Belsky, you're friends with him. What's something people would be surprised about or don't know about Scott, that might be interesting?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:30:58):\nWell, I'll tell you one funny story and then I'll first tell you something I love about Scott. Scott is a great example of someone who I think has driven immense cultural change at a massive, legendary company in Adobe obviously. But the number of transformations that Scott oversaw and led and contributed to at Adobe are incredible. And I'm sure having a fraction of this experience at Twitter, I can appreciate how difficult and challenging and rewarding that was, right? Going from package software to cloud, going from non-AI to AI, going from discrete tools to an integrated suite that worked really elegantly together. I think Scott oversaw a lot of this stuff and it's pretty incredible to see that transformation have been so successful at Adobe. So I love that.\n\n(01:31:55):\nI guess a funny story about Scott that people might not know, I consider him to have been the first Periscoper. So Scott believed in Periscope before it was Periscope, before we had turned it into live video, we had a previous version of our beta that was static photo sharing, same vision, same concept, but the product was called Bounty. And it was like you put a pin somewhere in the world like the Tokyo fish market and someone would respond with a photo of what it looked like there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:25):\nI didn't know that.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:32:26):\nOur vision was still to help you see through someone else's eyes, but the first manifestation was really static and had this marketplace dynamic, and it took us a while to get to the point where we were like, press a button, go live and have it be live video because by definition it's real time rather than static.\n\n(01:32:42):\nAnyways, before we built any of that, when we were playing with the idea and Scott was encouraging us to go in this direction, I remember probably the second time I ever met Scott, we did it FaceTime and he was at the TED conference, I want to say it was in Vancouver, and just to illustrate how cool it would be when he accepted the FaceTime and he's like, \"Cool, and I'm going to take you on a Periscope.\" And he flipped this camera and started walking around the TED conference and basically pretending like he was prototyping the product, but using FaceTime. And it was such an amazing experience because having an investor essentially encourage you down a product direction by showing rather than telling, it was such a great encapsulation of how supportive Scott was and inspiring Scott was as one of our cheerleaders. And I respect him so much for everything he did to help Periscope make happen, and also for betting on us, because he was one of the first people who said yes to investing. He didn't know us, he just believed in us. And that helped everything else come together. And yeah, he's amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:48):\nWhat a mensch.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:33:48):\nWhat a mensch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:49):\nWe've got to get him back on the podcast. The story reminds me of your Elon's story, where he FaceTimed you, and it also makes me think about your lesson of building consumer products, just using it, being obsessed with it, Scott, just like, here's what it could look like. And actually using the product, not just talking about.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:04):\nYeah, he's a great example of that as well. He's definitely a gracious user of all tools and products, and that's why he has really great, really great product sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:15):\nKayvon, you're amazing. This was so freaking fascinating. There's so many nuggets here. Can't wait for folks to hear this.\n\n(01:34:20):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and learn more and maybe follow up on anything if there's things you want to follow up on potentially? And then, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:30):\nPeople can find me on Twitter/X/whatever we're calling it these days. My handle is @kayvz, K-A-Y-V-Z. And yeah, if you're of this podcast and you're working on something cool and you need some help or advice or you're looking for an angel investor, don't hesitate to reach out and would love to try what you're building.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:51):\nAmazing. And also check out Particle.news.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:53):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:54):\nSupport the wife.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:55):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:56):\nAmazing. All right, Kayvon, thank you so much for being here.\n\nKayvon Beykpour (01:34:59):\nThanks Lenny. Great to meet you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:00):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:35:03):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Leading with empathy | Keith Yandell (DoorDash, Uber)\n\n## Transcript\n\nKeith Yandell (00:00):\nEvery business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going if you believe in the business is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone. And it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.\n\nLenny (00:44):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Keith Yandell. Keith is a longtime leader at DoorDash, where he's been for about seven years. And in that time, get this, he's led the legal team, the HR team, the marketing team, the customer support team, and currently he leads the BD and corporate development teams. Before DoorDash, he led litigation at Uber. He's also managed folks like Gokul Rajaram, who was previously on this podcast and who suggested that I have Keith on. And damn, was he right. Before I had this chat with Keith, I didn't know that much about him, but now you can count me as a huge Keith fanboy. I suspect you'll feel the same way after you listen to this episode. I'm just going to jump right in and bring you Keith Yandell after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\nLenny (01:38):\nToday's episode is brought to you by OneSchema, the embeddable CSV importer for SaaS. Customers always seem to want to give you their data in the messiest possible CSV file. And building a spreadsheet importer becomes a never-ending sink for your engineering and support resources. You keep adding features to your spreadsheet importer. The customers keep running into issues. Six months later, you're fixing yet another date conversion edge case bug. Most tools aren't built for handling messy data, but OneSchema is. Companies like Scale AI and Paved are using OneSchema to make it fast and easy to launch delightful spreadsheet import experiences from embeddable CSV import to importing CSVs from an SFTP folder on a recurring basis. Spreadsheet import is such an awful experience in so many products. Customers get frustrated by useless messages like, \"Error on line 53\" and never end up getting started with your product.

Keith, welcome to the podcast.\n\nKeith Yandell (03:15):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (03:17):\nFirst off the bat, I just want to give a big thank you to Gokul Rajaram and Micah Moreau for suggesting you be on the podcast, helping make this happen, and also just suggesting a bunch of questions to ask you. So, I hope you're ready to be in the hot seat.\n\nKeith Yandell (03:29):\nDefinitely as ready as I'm going to be. And those are two good folks to talk to.\n\nLenny (03:34):\nAwesome. And Gokul's been on the podcast. Maybe we'll get Micah on the podcast at some point. I wanted to start off with a story. Apparently, there's a story of you interviewing what is now your VP of engineering. And I hear that in the interview, you called him an asshole. And more interestingly, he joined DoorDash because you did that. Can you just talk about that story and share that story?\n\nKeith Yandell (03:55):\nYeah, actually, it wasn't during the interview. We were debriefing. And for me, one of the top things I always hear about DoorDash from an executive standpoint when we do the internal survey is it's a \"no politics, no asshole\" culture. And I'm not one to swear a lot, but after interviewing Ryan Sokol, who's now our VP of eng, he was just kind of aloof. He came off as aloof to me, really curt answers. And I just didn't have a great feeling about him. And I pride myself on being able to discern when people are really engaged or not. And I went to Tony Xu, who's our founder and CEO. I said, \"Tony, I think this guy's a jerk. I don't think we want him at the company.\" And Tony was great. He said, \"Keith, I want you to just have dinner with him, please, because I got a completely different impression. And if you have dinner with him, and you still think he's a jerk, we won't hire.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (04:51):\nAnd so I ended up meeting Ryan down the street. We actually live in the same general area. We went out to dinner, and I started right away. I said, \"Ryan, during the interview you kind of seemed like an asshole. Are you an asshole?\" And he was so great. It completely changed my perspective in a good two minutes. He wanted to know what he had said. He said, \"I'm super embarrassed, and what could I do differently? Regardless of how this works out for me in this circumstance, that's just not how I want to be perceived.\" And we talked and joked about the things he had done, and he kind of told me the background for how he reacted or why he reacted the way he did. And by the end of the dinner, we ended up staying super late. We had a couple beers afterwards. Ryan and I have become really good friends.\n\nKeith Yandell (05:37):\nAnd six months later, he told me that one of the reasons why he joined DoorDash was that we were going to blackball him potentially from joining just because of his attitude, because his perspective is life's too short to work with people you don't really enjoy, and a lot of people pay lip service. And he knew he was going to be a tough hire for us at the time. And the fact we were willing to go all the way down the path and have someone super qualified but didn't meet the culture bar, for him was what pushed him over the edge to join the company.\n\nLenny (06:06):\nI love that. I love the directness of that meeting, of just like, \"Are you an asshole?\"\n\nKeith Yandell (06:11):\nThink about it, right? And if someone really was a jerk, they probably wouldn't have taken it very well. Right? It's just like when you're interviewing someone, giving them tough feedback after the interview if there's an area of concern, but you otherwise like them, can be a really great way to see how they would interact with you personally as well as how they take feedback. And so that was my learning from the situation, is if you really enjoy an interview, except for maybe something on the culture side, to give the direct feedback and see how people engage.\n\nLenny (06:39):\nThis touches on another question I wanted to ask you, which is just about DoorDash's culture, which feels really unique, just feels very driven, very pragmatic. There's a story I heard where when you guys celebrated one of your biggest milestones, you bought the cheapest champagne and plastic flutes, and I think the founders brought that to everyone. Could you just talk about what makes DoorDash's culture so interesting and unique? And maybe if there's a story of just a microcosm of what DoorDash culture is like, that'd be awesome to hear.\n\nKeith Yandell (07:07):\nFounder-led companies tend to take on the personality of their founders. And if you spend any time with our founder, Tony Xu, you realize that he's a humble leader. He's competitive. He really wants to win, and he'll do whatever it takes to win. And the example you're referring to, I think, is when we raised our Series D funding, which was a really tough fundraise for us... We had very little runway left. We almost went out of business, and it was a huge relief when we had finally gotten the funding secured.\n\nKeith Yandell (07:40):\nAnd I remember I was in a meeting. I was running policy and communications, among other things, at the time, and I was in the meeting with a couple other folks, and we were talking about the press release strategy. Tony was there. And someone ran down and got some, I think it was Korbel or something champagne and some plastic flutes. And one of the women who was in the meeting with me was going to leave to go put those together. This is a very smart woman, who I think Tony recognized could add more value. And he said, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. You stay here. I'm going to go put together the champagne flutes.\" And he called the other two co-founders, Andy Fang and Stanley Tang. They came, stayed up all night, put together... I don't know... 500 champagne flutes, plastic ones, for this cheap champagne and let the people who are closest to the problem try to work out the comms piece. And I do think that's one great example of the culture.\n\nKeith Yandell (08:31):\nThe other thing I think that really exemplifies DoorDash's culture is a level of customer obsession. And that manifests in a few different ways. We have a program called WeDash, where, four times, a year all employees are required to go do deliveries. And I love doing it. I do it more than four times a year, and I usually take my daughters with me. And one time, I was out with my daughter, who was eight at the time. We got a delivery, and it was not the best delivery. There's clearly something wrong with the system. We got a sandwich and a coffee, and we're supposed to drive 18 and a half miles to drop it off. And that didn't make sense for the customer. It didn't make sense for us as drivers.\n\nKeith Yandell (09:13):\nAnd she'd gotten to know Tony over the years, and she said, \"I really want to call Tony and tell him this thing's broken.\" \"Honey, I like my job. I'd like to keep my job. Can we not call Tony right now?\" But she was adamant, and I was so proud of her for feeling so strongly that she wanted to fix this thing that was broken. I figured, \"He's not going to answer anyway. We can just call.\" So call. Tony picks up on the first ring. And I'm like, \"Oh, this might go badly.\" And she just lays into him. She said, \"This is going to take us 36 minutes to drop off. The coffee's not going to be hot. How could you allow this experience if you really care about your customers?\"\n\nLenny (09:52):\nWhoa.\n\nKeith Yandell (09:52):\nAnd I kind of sucked in my breath and said, \"Well, that's how my time at DoorDash ended.\" But Tony was great. He was like, \"Hey, Alice, we have people who do deliveries for months. We have people who deliveries for years, and they're always providing me feedback. And this is one of the most insightful pieces of feedback I've gotten recently. And you've only been dashing for a few different times.\" And by the time we got home, he'd actually sent an email out to the product organization, calling out the problem, suggesting the fix. And they were already working on it. And that shows the bias to action that I think really is at the heart of DoorDash, alongside that customer obsession. And it's not unusual for Tony to do customer support. It wasn't like just because he heard this from my daughter that he actioned it. He does support every day. And again, this goes back to that level of humility and companies really taking on the ethos of their founder.\n\nLenny (10:47):\nWhat an awesome story. I want to chat a bit more about the, what is it called? WeDash? Is that the program?\n\nKeith Yandell (10:52):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny (10:52):\nSo you say that you're supposed to do it how many times a year, four times a year?\n\nKeith Yandell (10:55):\nYeah, at least four times a year.\n\nLenny (10:56):\nAnd then you said that you do it a lot more often. How often are you doing it? And then, is there any other fun stories of that experience, someone like you delivering someone's sandwich?\n\nKeith Yandell (11:05):\nI probably do it once a month.\n\nLenny (11:06):\nWow.\n\nKeith Yandell (11:07):\nAnd there, there's all kinds of great WeDash stories, but I don't know how interesting they're going to be to the broader public because, for me, it's just about getting out and experiencing the product. I almost always find something that's broken, and I send an email to... We have a Slack channel that's devoted to experiences via WeDash. It's everything from, I found a bug once where it wasn't routing you necessarily the fastest route. It was going using straight line as opposed to road. That was something that we fixed. And for me, the best parts about WeDash are the experiences, the interactions with the restaurants, the interactions with colleagues. So I'll go delivering with Ryan Sokol, the head of engineering. I'll give him a hard time about refining the product and things like that. But that's, by far, my favorite WeDash story, is the one with my daughter.\n\nLenny (11:57):\nThat's a good one. So at Airbnb, we actually had a similar program, where Brian wanted everyone to be a host on Airbnb. But as you can imagine, that's much harder. Not everyone is able to. Not everyone has a place to. So it's always kind of a challenge to make people do that. I imagine DoorDash is a lot easier because a lot of people can go around and deliver things. But yeah, such a killer idea, such a good way of dogfooding your product.\n\nKeith Yandell (12:19):\nYeah, it's a good point, but not everyone is able, for a host of reasons, at DoorDash to do it. And so there are alternatives. So you can do customer support, for example, in lieu of actually going and doing deliveries. It's just about making people have empathy and get closer to the product. It's also, going back to the culture point you raise, it's a great way to weed out people that maybe we wouldn't want to work with, right, because not every software engineer wants to hop in their Tesla and go out and deliver McDonald's to some kids. Right? It takes a certain level of humility, a certain amount of customer obsession, to even sign up for that. So we're really vocal during the interview process that this is something that's expected. And it serves as a governor to attract the people that we think are going to be most successful at the company.\n\nLenny (13:02):\nI love that. Imagine all your programs have the Dash in there somewhere. Something Dash.\n\nKeith Yandell (13:07):\nWe try. I think when I was head of a marketing, we did a much worse job. I think we're doing much better now.\n\nLenny (13:13):\nNice. And Airbnb, it was always Air Something. Okay. So, I think one of the most interesting things about you and your background, and maybe unusual things, is the number of teams that you've led over your time at DoorDash. I have a list here. So over your time at DoorDash, you've led the HR team. You've led the customer support team, led the sales team, the marketing team. Now you lead the BD and corp dev team. Initially, I think, you were chief legal officer. So here's my question. As someone that, I imagine, doesn't have a ton of expertise and experience in a lot of these areas, how are you able to credibly lead these teams? And I ask partly because as a founder, you have to learn how to lead teams and people that you don't actually know what they're doing as well as they do. And so I'm just curious what you've learned about being able to lead teams in such disparate skill sets and functions.\n\nKeith Yandell (14:03):\nYeah, the one thing I'll say is, I did not run sales. That's maybe one of the very few non-technical functions I did not lead. But the question is a good one. And I had massive imposter syndrome the first time Tony asked me to take on something that I wasn't a subject matter expert in. And I told him I didn't want to do it. And he had me read this book called Range by David Epstein. And the general thesis is that generalists are better than specialists. And it goes through all these examples of about how Nobel Prize winners are usually amazing in something other than the field that they actually win the Nobel Prize in.\n\nKeith Yandell (14:38):\nAnd Tony believes pretty deeply in this philosophy, and the way he explained it to me is as follows. If you want to achieve a 10x outcome, hiring someone that's an expert in the field, it's maybe unlikely you're going to achieve that 10x outcome, because they're likely to do things the way things have always been done. So you might achieve incremental benefits, but the odds of completely reinventing the system and doing something that's vastly superior to others is much lower. And he said, \"I know you don't know how to do this stuff. That's why I'm putting you in the role.\" And I said, \"Okay.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (15:10):\nSo, first thing he helped me do was believe that I could add value here. And then, the second thing for me was to go out and find the best people that really were the subject matter experts, and add the value I could to help them be successful. And I found that they were actually really attracted to wanting to work with someone like me, who came into the interview process and said, \"Good news, bad news. I don't know your field anywhere near as well as you do. Here's the ways I intend to help you. Here's what I think you can provide. And at the end of the day, I'm going to get out of your way.\" And that's really proven true. So, I ran marketing. Hired initially a head of brand, Kofi, who now is our CMO. Hired ahead of legal, who's now our GC, Tia Sherringham. And these people have really just excelled at their function and, with the warmup that I was able to provide, have really proven that they're much better at the jobs than I was.\n\nLenny (16:08):\nYou don't strike me as someone that is trying to build empires and take over all these teams. I imagine this kind of came at you because you've been doing a great job at other things. Is that how it worked? And, I guess, is there anything, any lessons there that you can take away?\n\nKeith Yandell (16:21):\nYeah, hundred percent. I run a 12-person org today. So I've gone from running 1,500 people in the company to 12. And for me, people talk a lot about hiring people better than you are. People don't talk a lot about what you do when you hire those people. And if you really care about the company and your long-term brand as an individual, as a manager, you realize what you want to do when you find the person that's better than you is you want to slowly get out of the way. And it's really good for the company. It's my favorite part of my job, is seeing people that either I've hired or managed be successful on their own.\n\nKeith Yandell (17:02):\nAnd I think it's a big part of our success, is this desire to be successful, regardless of who's in charge. And that comes from the fact when I joined DoorDash, we were getting our tails kicked. We were in fourth place in the space. Uber had just launched food and rocket to market share leadership. And I think that was really good for us as a company because we realized unless we all worked together, and it wasn't about who was doing what or things like that, we weren't going to have a shot at being successful. And I think that ethos has really pervaded and persisted since then.\n\nLenny (17:40):\nYeah. I think most people don't realize DoorDash actually has the biggest market share in food delivery. Imagine that's still true. I've always seen these line charts of market share, and DoorDash is always the top. And I think people kind of think Uber Eats is winning, but it's not true.\n\nKeith Yandell (17:52):\nYeah, I mean, the category charts I've seen are consistent with what you said by a pretty wide margin. But we try not to focus on things like that. We try to focus on the customer experience. And it's humbling in our space because we're doing millions and millions and millions of deliveries a day, and those deliveries will go wrong, no matter how hard you try. And we read those experiences. We do customer support, and we understand that there's a long ways to go. So we're just getting started, and we know that.\n\nLenny (18:21):\nYou mentioned that you ran this 1,500-person org at one point, and something that I've heard you do, that helps you do that, is you have this document that you put together that kind of explains how to work with Keith, and also, just broadly, how things work at DoorDash. Can you talk about this document, and why you thought it was necessary, and kind of the impact something like this has had? And then we're going to share a link to a redacted version of this in the show notes.\n\nKeith Yandell (18:45):\nOne thing I've learned is it's super hard to scale culture, especially when you're growing as fast as DoorDash has since I joined. We were two or three X'ing the company, from a head count perspective, for the vast majority of my time every year. And so one thing I noticed is, it's hard to come into a place and be new and understand how things work and what it means to be successful there. And so the idea was to do our best to scale that. And one thing that Tony taught me is one thing that scales really well is written work [inaudible 00:19:16]. And so I put together this document. There's three basic subject matters. It's my expectations slash what I've seen as traits in successful people within the company.\n\nKeith Yandell (19:28):\nTwo are how I can improve, like basically, feedback I've gotten in things I'm working on. For example, I'm a litigator by training, and so I tend to argue about things, even if I agree with people to the test levels of conviction. And I got feedback from my team that was really confusing because I'd be arguing against something, and then we would execute that exact thing. And so I try to be transparent about that and explain how I work through problems, but also in saying, \"Hey, this is something I'm trying to improve on, is not being quite so argumentative for sport.\" And then it talks about what my commitments are to team. So, \"I'm committed to finding you your next job even if that's not at DoorDash. Life's too short to be in a job you don't like,\" things like that.\n\nLenny (20:16):\nI've heard from a few people how impactful this document ended up being. I guess, what impact have you seen this have on the org that you've run in the company and then, yeah, any other examples of just why this is powerful? Because I imagine some people listening are like, \"Oh, I should do something like this.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (20:32):\nYeah, I mean, for me, one of an executive's main jobs is to attract and retain top talent. And going back to why people have joined DoorDash, Kofi Amoo-Gottfried, who's now our CMO, joined me as head of brand when I was running marketing. And it's comical because this person is a legend in the marketing space, and I had no idea what was going on. And so convincing him to join, I was really nervous about. And the point where he decided to join, I had sent him this document. He wanted to know what it was like to work with me. I said, \"Well, I've actually written that down.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (21:01):\nAnd he later told me that that was a really important factor for him, that someone was so transparent about their areas for growth, how they thought they could be helpful, and he liked the fact that I knew that I didn't know. And so he knew he was going to have a lot of autonomy on the role, and that was really important to him. But more broadly within the organization, how it's been helpful is just being able to have people engage with me in a way, and with the company in a way that is so consistent with the culture from day one. I've had people come and tell me, that I'd never met before, that they'd read the doc, even if they're on a different team, and just how helpful it's been to try to acclimate to this fast-paced environment, where you're learning while drinking from the fire hose, effectively.\n\nLenny (21:44):\nYeah, that makes sense. Touching a little bit on it, you talked about all these amazing people you've led and how you've been able to do that. Something else I've heard that you do that's pretty unusual is you help people that you manage find their next job, which may not necessarily be within the company, maybe at another company. You kind of help them land it and find something else to do. I've never heard of that before, really. I'd love to hear why you decided to do that, how you do that, and just the kind of impact, second-order impact, maybe, that has, maybe that leads you to be doing this.\n\nKeith Yandell (22:15):\nIt wasn't a calculated decision why I started doing it. Then I gave it a lot of thought because I was afraid that I might get some blowback when people started taking jobs elsewhere. And as I thought about it, I realized it really is better for the company to have that type of open dialogue with people that work on your team. I think that's true for a few reasons. In this \"How to work with Keith\" document, I say, \"I will help you find your next job.\" And what that means is, number one, people are going to be transparent with you, or more transparent, if they're looking for something else or if they're not happy. That's going to allow you to lay the foundation for a backfill so you're much less likely to get surprised when someone leaves.\n\nKeith Yandell (22:59):\nNumber two, what's going to happen is if someone runs a blind reference on me at this point with someone that I've managed, which in the current environment is more and more common, people diligencing the managers, what they're going to hear is, \"Keith's going to put you first.\" And I think that's really motivating for a lot of people. So if you're thinking on a five-, 10-year horizon of your career as a manager, whether you're an entrepreneur hiring people into your company, whether you're a product manager who's trying to build a team, building that long-term reputation, I think people take much too shortsighted perspective on that.\n\nKeith Yandell (23:34):\nAnd so now if I get a blind reference, people are going to hear that, \"It's not all about the company. It's not all about Keith. It's about you and your career,\" and that's going to pay back 10x. Maybe you lose one really talented person, but they probably shouldn't be there anyway. They're probably going to leave anyway. And this way, you can participate in that and really drive value for them, as well as for the company in the future, by creating a much better reputation for the group of managers. So it's been really helpful for me. I keep in touch with a lot of people who have left, and we get a lot of boomerangs, too. There's a lot of people who leave DoorDash and come back. And that's something I love seeing because it shows that people have gone out and seen what else is out there and realized this is the right place for them.\n\nLenny (24:20):\nCan you talk a bit about how you operationalize this? Because this is just out there. \"Tell me if you're thinking about a new job, and I will talk to you through your options and help you find something.\" Or is there anything else there for folks that maybe want to offer this to their employees?\n\nKeith Yandell (24:33):\nSo, first of all, I put it in this document. And so I say how I run one-on-ones in my \"how to work with Keith\" document, and the last 10 minutes of my one-on-ones are career development conversations. That's a really fertile ground for having the discussion. But for particularly more senior folks, if I get pinged for a GC job, or when I would get pinged by a recruiter for a GC job, I would forward that to Tia Sherringham, who's now our general counsel but was basically head of legal for years before she got the general counsel title. And I'd say, \"Hey, Tia, I don't know when this job's going to be available here. I'm still liking what I'm doing. I think I'm still adding value. If you think it's time for you to leave, I think this is a really good opportunity.\"\n\nLenny (25:11):\nWow, that's [inaudible 00:25:12].\n\nKeith Yandell (25:11):\nAnd I say, in addition to that, \"You're going to learn the questions they asked during the interview process. You're going to learn what type of qualifications they're looking for. And if I'm not getting you that experience, you can tell me.\" And thankfully for me, Tia decided to stay and has now grown into the general counsel of DoorDash, and doing a much better job at the role than I ever did. But she had the opportunity to leave, and I think she learned from some of those in-bounds and the experiences she had.\n\nLenny (25:40):\nWow. That's amazing, that your bosses forward you recruiter pitches to go work somewhere else.\n\nKeith Yandell (25:48):\nThink it made her want to stay. Right? If I wasn't invested in her success, she could have left any time and gotten a job, super qualified. But I think she felt a sense of loyalty based on my sense of loyalty, and I think it worked out best for all involved.\n\nLenny (26:04):\nI love it. This episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates. And within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the road map, their OKR process, getting internal feedback. And essentially, their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\nLenny (26:44):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location, regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special, limited time offer just for start-ups.

Coda.io/lenny.\n\nLenny (27:23):\nSomething else I hear about you, which I'm sensing as we chat more and more, and I could see why this is true, is that on the DoorDash kind of C-suite and board meeting and board in general, you play this really strong unifying force that helps the group come to fast decisions on really complicated topics. And I'm curious. One, would you agree with that? And two, what is it that you do that helps a lot of strongly opinionated people come to decisions on really complicated decisions?\n\nKeith Yandell (27:51):\nI hope that's true. I think that, for me, it all comes down to empathy. And what I mean by that is, you have to understand what different people's motivations are in the room. Different people are goaled on different things. People come from different life experiences and different work experiences. And I think it's really important to make each person feel heard. We had a situation, for example, where we were deciding between a trade-off between two business lines. It was a profitability question for one business line, to make one business line much more profitable to do a certain partnership, but it would come at the expense of the growth of another business line that was more nascent.\n\nKeith Yandell (28:30):\nAnd so it's hard when you get the GMs for all these businesses together, and they have very strong perspectives and good reasons on both sides about why path A is better profitability, path B is better for growth. And they're arguing very strenuously, in part because they want to hit their numbers, in part because they believe it. One thing I found super effective in those contexts is I try to ask the other side. So, let's take the profitability side. I ask them to make the growth case. I say, \"Tell me the three best reasons why we should actually focus on growth here.\" That generates instant empathy for the other side. And sometimes, they'll even persuade themselves as they're talking and say, \"I think you're right that we should focus on growth here. We can achieve this profitability measure later\" or vice versa. And so generating empathy and having empathy for the other side, understanding how they're goaled and what they're bringing to the conversation, I think is the first step to having those really tough conversations.\n\nLenny (29:25):\nI love that. What other steps are there? I like that as a first step. Is there anything else you have that you end up finding is really helpful there?\n\nKeith Yandell (29:32):\nSometimes these conversations can go on forever. Right? People just want to keep going back to an argument they've already made, because they're not willing to settle, and there needs to be someone that says, \"All right. We got to be clear on who the decision maker is here. If we haven't reached a consensus, who's the tiebreaker?\" And a lot of time that's our CEO, Tony Xu, but a lot of times it's the GM for a certain business line or a head of product or a head of engineering, depending on the decision to be made. I think being really clear about, \"Hey, we're all going to come together. We're going to have a healthy debate. We're going to make sure everyone's perspectives are heard. We're going to try to reach consensus, but the end of the day, here's the person that's going to make the decision, and we're going to make it on this time horizon. And once the decision is made, we're going to [inaudible 00:30:16].\"\n\nKeith Yandell (30:17):\nAnd I think that having someone that's in the room that has run a lot of the functions that are trying to articulate the perspective is helpful, and someone who's been at the company as long as I have and given up as much as I have... Right? To your point earlier, everyone knows I'm not trying to build an empire. I'm trying to find a way to win. And I think it gives me some credibility to call the question, figure out who decision maker is, set a time line, and move on. The only way it works is if there's empathy on both sides.\n\nLenny (30:46):\nThis is great, so I just took a few notes. One is there's essentially the steel man component. Have them steel man the other side, argue why that's the better decision. Clarify a decision maker. Make it clear like, \"There's the tiebreaker. If we can't get there, this person's going to make the decision.\" And then create a time horizon of like, \"We need to make a decision by this time.\" Is there anything else, before we move on to a different question?\n\nKeith Yandell (31:08):\nI think that's the right framework. I can tell you're product guy. You're very good at distilling it down to the essence. I think that's a good summary.\n\nLenny (31:16):\nYeah, you got to do it. You mentioned the one-on-one meetings. And I took a note on this, actually, and I wanted to come back to it. You mentioned at the end of your one-on-one meetings you have this kind of coaching career conversation. Is there anything else you could share about just your approach to one-on-one meetings, your agenda or how you think about one-on-ones?\n\nKeith Yandell (31:32):\nThis is super tactical. It's something I think is really important, is I'm very clear, in the document we talked about earlier, about how I like to work, is I demand feedback for me. And so we set aside time during one-on-ones where I want the feedback. First, constructive feedback. And I expect it, and if you don't give it to me, I'm going to press you on constructive feedback. And then I give feedback. I tell this to managers all the time. If you create a space where you require constructive feedback, it's a lot easier to give feedback. One of the top things I hear from managers, especially new managers, they don't like giving constructive feedback. They want to be positive. They want to be liked and things like that. And so it's a nice way to create space to have that dialogue.\n\nKeith Yandell (32:15):\nAnd that's something I actually learned from Travis, when I was at Uber. We had a system called T3 B3, where during reviews or pulse check-ins, you'd have to say three positives about your manager and three constructive pieces of feedback for your manager. And the first time I did it, I just did the T, the tough things, for my manager, who was the general counsel at the time. And Travis came over, and, \"This is totally unacceptable. You have to provide constructive feedback,\" which made me super uncomfortable but created the right environment, where people could have these tough conversations because, \"My manager can't get mad at me, because she knows the CEO's going to come give me a hard time if I don't provide some constructive feedback.\" And I think having that as an expectation is super important to building open lines of communication.\n\nLenny (33:05):\nWow. I like this T3 B3. So T is top good things and B is three bad things.\n\nKeith Yandell (33:10):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (33:11):\nCool. I'm trying to imagine you in this meeting with the CMO you mentioned, and them having to give you constructive feedback. That's always hard, even though you expect it. Is there anything else you do to help people feel comfortable giving you hard feedback in meetings like that?\n\nKeith Yandell (33:26):\nYou have to thank them for it. Right? I mean, there's a saying, \"Feedback is a gift,\" but you have to say stuff, and you have to action. And that's one thing I've found that can be really demotivating for folks. A lot of these companies have these pulse surveys, or they talk about what the company can do better, and they put the results on the screen, and, \"We're going to work on it,\" and that's the end of it.\n\nKeith Yandell (33:50):\nAnd that was something I learned early on at DoorDash that people didn't like, unless you were going to come back and say, \"Hey, this was our lowest performing area in the pulse survey. Here are the three things we did to action it,\" because that's how you would treat the business. Right? If we got feedback from a customer or from another business line, you would say, \"Heard it. We're going to come back and report out on what we're going to do differently, and then we're going to track the progress.\" And so I think that's really important when you receive feedback. You have to show people that you're actioning it and say, \"I heard this from you. Checking in. Am I doing better? Here are the things that I've changed.\" And so making sure that there's that feedback loop, I think, is another important part of creating the right structure for a good, healthy culture.\n\nLenny (34:33):\nAnother guest on the podcast had the same exact advice for getting feedback, and the way he described it is you want to be enthusiastic about like, \"Thank you so much for that.\" And the way he described it is even though you're melting inside because you don't want to hear, \"Thank you so much. That was so helpful.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (34:48):\nIt's really good advice.\n\nLenny (34:49):\nI want to zoom out a little bit and talk about the DoorDash kind of journey. There's been a lot of high highs with DoorDash. There's been some low lows. I know that there was a funding round at one point, where it was very precarious and may not have worked out. Question I have for you around that is just, leading through hardships and through tough times, what have you learned, as a leader, about how to lead through challenging times? And ask partly because a lot of companies are going through that right now. It's pretty hard for a lot of folks out there, a lot of layoffs. And so yeah, I'm curious what you've learned about leading through challenging times.\n\nKeith Yandell (35:23):\nYeah. I'm going to regurgitate some advice I got from some folks on our board at the same time, when we were having really tough times, which I really didn't like hearing at the time, but I was kind of new to the space. And that is, \"Tough times make companies,\" for a host of reasons. I mean, this is super healthy for the start-ups out there right now. It's because, number one, you're going to find out who the mercenaries are on the team, that are people that are there for the mission, versus they're there because they think this is going to be a quick road to riches. We had a lot of people leave the company when Uber launched food, and we fell quickly behind. And that was good for us because the people that stayed were there because they wanted to work on this team, on this mission, and they really believed in it.\n\nKeith Yandell (36:11):\nThe second thing is it forces discipline. It's a good thing to focus on unit economics. And we didn't have the funding that a lot of our competitors did, which forced us to be super focused on our unit economics and efficient and serve the customer in unique ways from the start. And I think a lot of our success, even to this day, emanates from those tough times. The last thing I'll say is if you're a founder, and you're looking for talent, tough times are great because there's a lot more talent out there. I saw... I think it might have been Bill Gurley. Someone tweeted, \"This is the best time in recent memory, since 2008, to start a company.\" And that really resonated with me because there's a lot of talented folks out there who are looking for their next thing. And three years ago, it was tough to find talent. And so I think there's a lot to like about tough times.\n\nKeith Yandell (36:59):\nThe last thing I'll say is, one thing that I found surprising is, from our surveys internally, people actually like crises at DoorDash. And I dug into that recently, and I was trying to figure out [inaudible 00:37:10] like these crises, and it's because there's singularity of focus. You know what the job is. You know you're going to get whatever resources the company has, when you're focused on the main thing. And these tough economic times will create that work. It's crystal clear. You got to cut, burn, and everyone's going to be doing what they need to do to achieve that outcome. And I think talented folks really like that, one, resourcing, and two, singularity of focus about what the main thing is. And crises manifests those for folks.\n\nLenny (37:42):\nIt's interesting that there's all these benefits to tough times. It's hard to recreate artificially. Reminds me a little bit of Frank Slootman, I think his name... and his book Amp It Up, where he talks a lot about the importance of urgency, always creating urgency. And obviously, a downturn like we have today is an urgent situation. Have you found that to be true, the power of creating urgency? And then, is there something you've learned about how to create that urgency at a company [inaudible 00:38:07]?\n\nKeith Yandell (38:07):\nYeah, this is something Tony's talked about since the day I joined, and he's very good at, frustratingly good, at that, because just when you think you've achieved the goal, the goal might go up. It might get shorter if you're from the product side. And speaking specifically on the product, compound interest is a really hard concept to fully explain to people, to make them truly appreciate. But that's something Tony is fantastic at, which is, he understands that by pushing a road map up, even by a week, if you can continuously push up what you ship by a week, you're going to end up lapping competitors who are just one week behind because you're going to start the next thing a week sooner, and you're getting that 1.1, 1.01x return. And then it grows and grows and grows.\n\nKeith Yandell (38:51):\nAnd he's as good as I've ever seen, combined with our president, Christopher Payne, at creating that sense of urgency and just pushing people. \"Do we really need to test this thing again or can we ship it? How can we move that much faster?\" Even if it's by a small margin, understanding that you can compound those gains over time has been really impactful for our success.\n\nLenny (39:11):\nI saw the same thing at Airbnb. It feels like, \"Things are going well. Maybe we could take a little break,\" but it's constant just like, \"How do we go faster? How do we go bigger? Okay, what's next? We launched this thing. Let's move on.\" And it feels like such a pattern across companies that do really well, is the founders continuing to keep that pressure on.\n\nKeith Yandell (39:28):\nI remember our IPO day. We had this thing. I had to wake up super early. It was a virtual bell ringing, and the second it was over, we had our weekly business review, and there were tough questions being asked. There was not champagne being passed around. I mean, people were in a good mood, but it wasn't like, \"Wow, this is so great.\" It's just like, \"Hey, how are we going to serve our customers today?\" And I thought that was really emblematic of, \"Hey, if we take too deep of a breath and are patting ourselves on the back...\" It reminds me of the saying, \"Somewhere, someone out there is practicing, and when you meet them, they will beat you.\" It's the same kind of thing. It's if you take too long to be self-congratulatory, you're going to fall behind the people who are still hungry. So it's important to stay hungry.\n\nLenny (40:12):\nWow. Reminds me, I think it's Bill Gates talking about someone's in a garage building the next Microsoft, and he's always trying to stay ahead of them.\n\nKeith Yandell (40:18):\nSo true.\n\nLenny (40:20):\nThe other thing this makes me think about is just, it's wild that founders... like Airbnb founders have been at this 15 years. Tony, I'm not exactly sure. We're probably a similar amount of time. It's just like they have to keep that pressure on within the company and also keep themselves motivated and excited and continuing to push. Just such a hard path. There's benefits to being that founder, but it's such a challenging life, too.\n\nKeith Yandell (40:42):\nYeah, I think it can be lonely to be a founder, for sure. I know that Tony's tried to develop a community, for him, of people who are similarly situated from other companies, and that's been helpful. And the real founders that I've come across, that drive, though, is something they can't turn off. They don't have to try to keep it, because there's a handful of traits I've seen that are pretty common. One is a level of obsessiveness. Two is hypercompetitiveness. And I think they're good at manufacturing straw men, even if everyone's saying nice things. It's like Michael Jordan used to take things out of context and make bulletin board material. There's definitely an element of that in the great founders that I've come across. And there's just a raw curiosity. So it's the competitiveness, but the curiosity in learning how things are working, and those all come together to create a drive that just never stops.\n\nLenny (41:33):\nThat resonates. Coming back to the DoorDash journey a little bit, I imagine the pandemic was kind of this microcosm of high highs and low lows, where, as an external observer, felt like everyone needed DoorDash immediately, and it was just probably the best thing for your business. On the other hand, I imagine you had to scale like crazy and keep the wheels on the bus through this time. Can you just talk about that part of history for DoorDash?\n\nKeith Yandell (41:55):\nI mean, it was just a wild rollercoaster. We were trying to get ready to go public, first of all, and so there was that overlay. And then, what you saw was our volume dropped right away, like the first or second day of lockdown. And I was like, \"Well, this is going out of business because no one wants to order food from restaurants anymore.\" People didn't know how COVID was transmitted. And so just basically volume dropped out a cliff. And I was like, \"Oh, went from a super high. We're getting ready to IPO. Super low. Volume's going to zero.\" And then, all of a sudden, volume doubled. And that was really exciting for a second, till we realized that our customer support center... I was running support at the time. All the support centers around the world shut down. So you're doubling volume. You have no one to serve it, from a customer support perspective.\n\nKeith Yandell (42:39):\nAnd our infrastructure, we weren't planning to grow that fast. We didn't think there was a chance of two or three exiting in a very short window. And so every Friday night, the app would crash. And if you're running customer support, there's few things you like less than the app going down. Set aside what it means for the customers and for the business. Selfishly, it's just super painful. The irony of it was, is our NPS was going up and that people were just so grateful to have the product, to be able to safely get the things they needed, for people to be able to earn money at times when they really needed it because maybe their job had been shut down, or they weren't allowed to go in. It became a really essential service for folks. And that was really motivating for me, and I think for the team, is to really be able to fulfill the big part of our mission of empowering local economies in a very unique way in a very special time.\n\nKeith Yandell (43:30):\nAnd the last thing I'll say on the pandemic was, one of my most vivid DoorDash memories was being on a Zoom call, where we were trying to figure out what to do to help restaurants. And again, we were trying to go public. And Tony made a decision, and I admit, I'm on the wrong set of history. I was arguing that this seemed extreme, just to cut commissions by basically 100 million bucks for restaurants, to help them stay in business. And I'm like, \"Hold on. We're trying to go public. This is going to completely change the bottom line perspective. No one's asking us to do this.\"\n\nKeith Yandell (44:06):\nAnd Tony says, \"Keith, you think too short-term.\" He's like, \"This is the right thing to do.\" And reminded me of the Ted Lasso quote, which is, \"Doing the right thing is never the wrong thing.\" And talk about how sometimes there's healthy debate. He didn't want to hear any debate on this one. He said, \"Just shut it down.\" And he's like, \"Founder-led decision. This is the right thing to do. We're going to cut these commissions.\" And I woke up the next morning and never been happier to kind of been overruled in a debate before than there. It was just such a meaningful moment for the company, and I was so proud to be a part of the organization.\n\nLenny (44:40):\nIs there anything else you took away from that experience of just living through this up and down of pandemic times at DoorDash?\n\nKeith Yandell (44:48):\nIt actually reminds me of the best advice I got when we were having our first kid. And everyone thinks they're going to give you the insight that's really going to be transformative. But one that stuck with me is, \"For better and for worse, everything's temporary. So the highs, you can't get too high. The lows, you can't get too low.\" That really resonated with me during that period of time, as well as this general idea that you have to try to find opportunities to reach the potential for the business. And decisions sometimes have to be made in very short time horizons, and being able to seize those moments, I think, is really important.\n\nLenny (45:24):\nI have a few questions about product that I want to get to. But one bigger question about DoorDash is, you've been involved in a lot of the bigger fundraising moments, DoorDash. I think you've worked probably with every major firm out there, raised large dollar amounts for DoorDash. Are there any memories or lessons that you can share from that experience?\n\nKeith Yandell (45:44):\nWe've definitely tried to raise from everyone, been told no many, many times. I mean, raising the Series D was really difficult. Tony and I worked together very closely on that one. And there was a lull in the tech market publicly, and it translated pretty quickly to the private markets. And people didn't believe in either the TAM or the profitability of the business model. And it was difficult. I think one thing that process taught me is after we raised the D, almost every round, or I think every round ended up being led by someone who had passed in a previous round. And that was because we put up numbers we were highly confident we were going to hit.\n\nKeith Yandell (46:25):\nI'm an operating partner at a venture firm on the side, and I see that most people put up stretch plans, but they [inaudible 00:46:31]. But that was just not in our DNA. We wanted to make sure that we put forth numbers that we knew were going to hit, and that cost us some dilution upfront in the form of lower valuations, I think. And there's just a trust that builds from that, where when we tell people we're going to do something, that they have conviction that we're going to do it. And I would trade a couple of points of dilution for that level of trust with the right investor base over time.\n\nLenny (46:58):\nFor founders that are going through fundraising right now, maybe having a hard time, any just advice from that period for founders, yeah, that are having a hard time raising these days?\n\nKeith Yandell (47:08):\nIt's fortunate because you only need one yes. Right? And you see all the people post the how many rejections they got. Every business that you have heard of has gotten rejected by at least a handful of venture capitalists at one point or another. And so that drive to keep going, if you believe in the business, is critical, absolutely critical. I mean, we were weeks of runway situation and had been told no by everyone, and it was just Tony's drive, really, to keep going. And the way he explains it to me is it's just the difference between a founder and a non-founder. If you're really a founder, you just have to find a way. You have to keep going. There's no question. And I mean, that's the only advice I can give folks, is it only takes one yes. But you got to keep going.\n\nLenny (48:00):\nAwesome. Shifting a little bit to a few product questions. Most listeners to this podcast are product builders, growth people, founders, and so I have a couple questions here. Today you're currently leading the corp dev and BD team, and I imagine you work closely with the product team. And so I'm curious what you've found to be an effective relationship between BD and product and from the experience you've had at DoorDash doing that.\n\nKeith Yandell (48:26):\nYeah, I joke that our head of product, Rajat Shroff, is actually the head of BD, because he's both interested and good at it. And to do impactful BD, the two really have to go hand-in-glove. So when I think through how to make that relationship work, the first challenge I've confronted, and maybe mistake I made, is trying to figure out what the right cadence is. When do you bring in the product team? Because if you bring them in too early on a deal that really has no chance of getting done, you waste valuable cycles. And our tech talent is our most precious resource, probably, at DoorDash. And so you have to be really mindful about when you bring them in. But if you bring them in too late, it may be a situation where you've given on terms that you really shouldn't have, and that can be really detrimental to the partnership as well.\n\nKeith Yandell (49:17):\nSo I think one thing to do is just give visibility. So without actually bringing them and having a full discussion, like, \"Here's the pipeline. If you see things that are super impactful, let us know. If you think things you're not so sure that are going to make a difference, please let us know.\" That's been really helpful.\n\nKeith Yandell (49:32):\nAnother thing that Rajat's taught me is the importance of building platforms, and whenever you can. So what we used to do is, I'd go out and negotiate a deal. We had a lot of deals around DashPass, which is our subscription product, and I'd ask the product team to go build a bespoke thing for this particular partnership, Chase or whatever partnership we were negotiating at the time. And Rajat said, \"Why don't you figure out what the scalable solution is for this? We will build you a product. You won't need to come ask us every time to build something. And then you'll know the parameters in which you can negotiate. You can negotiate a better velocity. We might spend more time on the first version of this, but very little effort for the next. And we'll have a high return on the product hours and the engineering hours spent.\" And so that was a super valuable insight that I garnered from him, is to try to figure out how to create these type of platforms.\n\nLenny (50:27):\nAny other lessons of just building an effective BD team within a product company, especially at the scale you're at?\n\nKeith Yandell (50:35):\nA few other things. Number one... This is something else that Rajat taught me. One of our core values is, \"Dream big, start small.\" And he really brought that to the BD product org. And there were some painful times. We invested heavily in a partnership with a hotel chain. We thought we were going to build, \"Hey, we're going to make sure that this is the new dine-in experience when you're at a hotel. We can actually replace room service.\" And asked for a lot of product worked. And it was a total flop. And the realization I had is that we should have gone out and tested this at one hotel with just some hacky operations and seen what the uptick was. And what I would've realized is this particular hotel chain was franchised. So even though corporate thought this was an important thing they were going to prioritize, if the franchisee doesn't care about it, they're not going to give you the visibility, in room or otherwise, to make it work. So we built all this great integration [inaudible 00:51:32] that was totally wasted because the operations weren't right.\n\nKeith Yandell (51:35):\nAnd I have probably two or three other examples of situations where I learned I should have just gone out and stood out front with a promo code, and handed it out in certain forums, and seen if that changed customer behavior, before going and asking for the product resources. And Rajat correctly was like, \"Hey, this is how we have to think about these things going forward.\" So yeah, definitely building platforms, \"Dream big, starts small,\" use operations to test a thesis around a deal before you actually expend the product resources, I think has been super helpful. And then, the last thing would be to engage early, but not too early, on deal opportunities.\n\nLenny (52:12):\nIt's interesting how the advice of doing things that don't scale just continues to be useful, even at the scale of a DoorDash. Like you said, you could just stand out there and see if people want room service through DoorDash before building a whole solution.\n\nKeith Yandell (52:24):\nYeah, early DoorDash, that was a core value. Do things that don't scale. It's as relevant today as it was then.\n\nLenny (52:31):\nSame at Airbnb, is something the founders brought up all the time. And speaking of that, another area that you have a lot of expertise on is legal. So, you led legal for a while at DoorDash. And I was thinking, as thinking about this question, \"I wonder what's more difficult, to be head of legal at Airbnb or head of legal at DoorDash,\" both fraught businesses and ideas. But we'll avoid that question for now. So my question is just legal and product. It's always this interesting relationship, how much legal has say over what happens versus how much product has final decision-making powers. Any lessons there about just how to set up a product and legal relationship within a software business?\n\nKeith Yandell (53:12):\nYeah. And both for the product folks that are listening as well as the entrepreneurs who want to be founders, I've had the pleasure of working with two founders who are very product-driven, product-first folks, in Travis and Tony. And I've found that the way they engage on the legal side is with the curiosity I referenced earlier, which is they're both hyper curious, and they will ask questions until they understand the law in the particular area about as well as the lawyers. And then they will apply a first principles product mindset to their understanding of the law, and they will push the lawyers to make sure that they're not being overly conservative, which sometimes they can be.\n\nKeith Yandell (53:51):\nAnd so, when you're on the product team, especially if you're in a consumer-facing business, it may not be as pronounced for SaaS businesses, but if you're in a consumer-facing business, working on a consumer-facing product, you had better have at least a general understanding of what type of regulations are going to apply to your business, and what type of constraints there are, and how to push those constraints. Yeah, and so for me it's just about that level of curiosity and actually engaging in the profession. Right? There's nothing magic about the law. There's a finite number of things that you can learn. And just like all the other functions I've learned, I think you can engage them in a way, till you are proficient and actually really accretive to your business.\n\nLenny (54:31):\nKeith, this has been incredible. I can see why people want to work for you, why they keep giving you more teams to run. I learned a ton. I'm really excited for folks to listen to this and learn from you. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online, or if they want to reach out or learn more, where do you point them? And then, two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKeith Yandell (54:50):\nIf you want to find me, LinkedIn is the place you can locate me. You can locate me there. I don't do any other social media. It is maybe unusual in this day and age, but that's my preferred medium. And then, as far as being helpful, always looking for referrals for great people. That would be the number one thing. And everyone has an opportunity to use our product. So if you have product feedback, I always welcome that as well.\n\nLenny (55:16):\nFor folks that maybe want to join DoorDash after hearing this, is there specific roles you're hiring for? Anything you want to share there, folks that might be interested?\n\nKeith Yandell (55:24):\nYeah, I mean, select roles definitely on the product and engineering side is a place we're focused right now. But even if there's not a role open today, I like meeting great people. I've found that building relationships over time, even when you're not looking, is impactful.\n\nLenny (55:37):\nAwesome. Keith, thank you so much again for doing this.\n\nKeith Yandell (55:40):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (55:43):\nThanks for listening.
