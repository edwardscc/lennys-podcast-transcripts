The actual really small initial growth team. We really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach, and what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, so we approached the team who owned it and we were like, \"Are you all working on this?\" They were like, \"Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff.\" We were like, \"Can we take this?\" They were like, \"Sure, if you want it.\" And so, we took it and immediately blew it up, and so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it. When you do that, we look hungry, so let's keep feeding us, right?\n\nLenny (00:00:48):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard win experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Chris Miller. Chris is VP of product for growth and AI at HubSpot. Chris started as an ICPM at HubSpot where he helped create their early growth team and as you'll hear, shifted HubSpot towards one of the most successful product-led growth businesses in history. Seven years later, he leads both their growth and AI teams and advises founders on product-like growth and growth strategy in general.\n\n(00:01:20):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, we cover what it takes to become a successful product leader in tech, what skills the most successful PMs need to build, how to find mentors, why you need to scrape your knees as an early PM. Also, a lot of great stories and insights about what HubSpot figured out about growth across content, sales product, market segments, and growth loops. I so enjoyed this conversation and we could have gone for another hour if I didn't cut myself off, and so I'm really excited for you to listen to this conversation. With that, I bring you Chris Miller after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:54):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With Sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted private supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback.\n\n(00:03:31):\nEveryone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls, leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your journey.

Chris, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nChris Miller (00:04:19):\nI'm so excited to be on the podcast. Thank you, Lenny, for having me. This will be a lot of fun.\n\nLenny (00:04:24):\nA huge thank you to Kyle Poyer for introducing us. I've heard so many great things about you from so many great people, and so I'm really excited to be chatting and I wanted to start with your very unique role that you're in now at HubSpot and it feels like it might be a sign of things to come for product leaders. Your title as far as I can tell is VP of product of growth and AI. Can you just talk about what that is and how growth and AI relate in the context of HubSpot?\n\nChris Miller (00:04:54):\nI've been leading PLG at HubSpot for several years now, and I recently took on the AI leadership role. It's a special place to be in and that I get to help lead HubSpot in terms of how we should be thinking about building the foundational technology to create AI-powered experiences and then also lead the strategy of how we leverage those experiences to help that B2B business builder be way more successful using our platform than they might've been in years past. So, it's a really cool intersection point between those two things. There's a lot we can do there.\n\nLenny (00:05:33):\nOne thing I took away from what you just shared is that you are given these two teams to lead, which aren't necessarily connected, but I think it tells me that you're doing a great job at HubSpot and I'm going to try to pierce through your modesty and I'm curious, what is it that you think you've done really well or been successful at that got the leaders at HubSpot to decide to give you this other team that feels like an incredibly important initiative in this time of AI?\n\nChris Miller (00:05:58):\nSo when I joined HubSpot in 2016, it was definitely an element of timing that really worked in my favor. It was maybe like a year or so after HubSpot had launched their free CRM, which was a big strategic play for them and for us, excuse me, at the time, and it was meant to be disruptive, but I don't think that there was a fully formed perspective on what was going to happen after that. How are we actually going to get leverage and enterprise value out of this sort of big, enormous piece of free software we just put into the universe? And I think the pedigree of product manager at HubSpot at that time was also a bit different. There were folks who maybe started their time at HubSpot in support, and so intimately familiar with the product and with customers. Some of these people had closed thousands of support tickets and my background was a bit different.\n\n(00:06:57):\nI was actually less of a feature PM and I was sort of more of a growth PM in my DNA, and so I sort of looked at this through a completely different lens and I guess I understood that what we were trying to actually do was product-led growth, but we didn't really have the shared vocabulary to call it that. And so I think to answer your question, I think I was just willing to take some risks and really push for the things that I believed made sense even though maybe based on the titles that I had at the time, I wasn't sort of inherently given a seat at the table and really pushed my away into some of these conversations and then was eventually invited to them. And so, just always had an interest in driving a strategy that was a click or two higher than maybe what my immediate team was focused on and was always curious about how other parts of the business functioned.\n\n(00:07:51):\nI used to spend a lot of time sitting on the sales floor, just going into the other buildings and talking to other folks, working on different parts of the business, and that's part of maybe the serendipity that I miss about being in person, which is that you might just discover something from having a casual conversation with someone at the water cooler. You're like, \"Oh, that's an interesting problem. I think my team can help with that,\" so you absorb a bunch of context around how pieces of the business are connected and you can start to really widen your aperture in terms of the size of opportunities that might be in front of you that maybe you would've missed if you would've been so heads down on execution work. And so, if I had to guess how people might talk about that, if I wasn't in the room, maybe they would cite that, but it's tough to say.\n\nLenny (00:08:34):\nHard to do those serendipitous watercolor chats in these remote hybrid times, huh?\n\nChris Miller (00:08:39):\nYeah, everything's so scheduled and tightly scheduled and you're bouncing from Zoom to Zoom and obviously HubSpot has embraced hybrid and there's a ton of benefit to it. In fact, I was a new dad when I came back to work and my son wasn't in daycare, and so it was so cool to just be able to pop out in between meetings and play with him for a few minutes just to go back and you don't get that when you're in the office all day. So definitely a lot of upside, but certainly you got to be a little bit more creative in terms of that serendipitous knowledge sharing, the osmosis learning, and just context sharing that happens more organically when everybody's sharing the same physical space.\n\nLenny (00:09:17):\nYou talked about how some of your early success was taking risks and being in meetings maybe you shouldn't be in. Is there an example or a story that comes to mind of doing that where you kind of took a risk early kind of in being a PM at HubSpot and/ or something that worked out really well, surprisingly?\n\nChris Miller (00:09:33):\nThis is a funny story. For anybody at HubSpot listening, I apologize in retrospect for this, but-\n\nLenny (00:09:40):\nI'm excited for this.\n\nChris Miller (00:09:41):\nThere was a time where we were having a lot of debates around pricing and packaging, and we'll get into this, but our go-to-market model and sort of where we play in the addressable market created some complexity in the sense of we're serving different parts of the market simultaneously with the connected unified platform. And so, how do you think about packaging and go-to-market? And we were trying to just figure out how to simplify, simplify, simplify. And at the time I was an IC, individual contributing PM, so who am I to have a point of view on pricing and packaging? But the person I was working with, my designer, her name's Mariah Moscato, she's in product now, she's excellent, we were part of a triad and we both had a similar school of thought in terms of what the pricing packaging could be.\n\n(00:10:33):\nAnd we were over in Dublin where we have our European headquarters and there was a party happening at the Guinness sort of storehouse, and I don't know that we were exactly on the guest list, but we figured out a way to get into the party and we ran into the COO at the time and out of the blue I think he had asked us what we thought about pricing and packaging and it was sort of one of those funny you should ask moments. And so, we ended up kind of pitching in the midst of pints being sort of handed every which way you could turn this vision for a completely different way we might approach pricing and packaging, and he was pretty intrigued and he said, \"Why don't you come to the next executive meeting and pitch us on it?\"\n\n(00:11:22):\nI think that meeting was maybe a couple of weeks away and so we looked at each other and we were like, \"Uh-oh,\" not exactly what we expected in terms of, I think people welcoming maybe a contrarian point of view at that moment in time. And so, we sort of were invited into this meeting with folks that we generally don't get to spend a lot of time with to pitch this thing that swam a little bit upstream and we ultimately didn't go full steam ahead down that path. I think a lot of elements of what we pitched have made their way over time into HubSpot's pricing and packaging, but it certainly I think opened the door for us and for me, speaking for myself, certainly for me to be welcomed back into that room in the future and to be able to contribute ideas towards important decisions.\n\nLenny (00:12:09):\nI love that. It's another example of serendipity and just running into people. Also, I think it's a really good example of just how important it's for PMs to be proactive and think ahead and not just rely on people coming to you, asking you for your advice and getting invited to rooms. I feel like so much of success in the product leadership role is just suggesting great ideas, being ahead of where people are and having the answers. You have the answer right there in the moment because you did the work ahead of time. Is that something you find as well that ends up being really important?\n\nChris Miller (00:12:42):\nYeah, one of the traits that I look for in PMs that I hire onto my teams, and also when I think back to the people that I've learned a lot from working with over the years, one of the common behaviors or traits is relentless curiosity, this insatiable desire to understand things and a lack of fear in admitting when they don't understand things and being uncompromising and getting the answers so that they do understand. And I think if you can bring that to the table, it's much easier to have an outsized impact on whatever or you're a part of or whatever mission you're working on or whatever team you may be a member of.\n\nLenny (00:13:30):\nAre there any other traits on that list of traits you look for that you think are really important that maybe other people don't focus on?\n\nChris Miller (00:13:37):\nYeah, relentless curiosity is probably my number one. My number two would probably be resilience, specifically if you're working in growth. I think if you're doing growth, right, if you're doing product-led growth the right way, then you're trying to balance the science and sort of taking a somewhat hygienic approach to validating assumptions and hypotheses with being really ambitious and really pushing for the things that are going to have massive impact for your customers at the end of the day. And when you're doing that, you're going to fail more than you're going to be successful along the way. And if you're not resilient, that can be really demotivating. I think there's a stat that some growth person put out there years ago, which is that on average only 20 to 30% of experiments of growth team runs might be successful. So, that means 70 to 80% of the time you're, you're not putting numbers on the board and you're extracting learnings hopefully that you can apply to the future.\n\n(00:14:43):\nBut I think if you're not resilient, what I've seen happen is you end up sort of grasping for a win, which can sometimes look like making bets that are too small and too insignificant to matter. If your sort of primary modality of product-led growth work is experiment-driven product development and you're hitting more than like 30, 40% of the time, you're thinking too small. And so, that resiliency piece is certainly important in my mind. I think coachability is another one in the sense that I still think that the sort of subcategory of growth product management is still fledgling compared to PMs working on platform features. And so, even when I'm interviewing folks, I'm not necessarily looking for 10 years of experience doing PLG. I think that's mostly an unreasonable ask, but it can certainly be taught and even if you do have some experience doing PLG work, it's important to know that what that work is going to look like is going to potentially vary in a meaningful way from shop to shop.\n\n(00:15:49):\nAnd so, being coachable and adaptable to whatever the context is of the business or problem space that you're working on I think is an important trait that I look for in PMs, and then creativity is so important too. Valuing simple solutions to really hard problems, I think if building the next super sophisticated widget is the thing that gets you out of bed in the morning, growth might not be for you, I think the best growth product leaders and growth minds that I've worked with over the years or have had the privilege of learning from over the years, I think the thing that I noticed about them is they're almost ambivalent to the solution and certainly ambivalent to how complex a solution may or may not be. And taking little to no pleasure or pride in the complexity of a solution so long that it delivers the outcome that the business and your customers need, I think is a really cool trait, and I kind categorize that under creativity.\n\nLenny (00:16:53):\nYou mentioned this phrase, relentless curiosity, and it made me think about a story I read about you where the way you got into product management was you were at some startup and the founder was just like, \"I've read that the cure to all our problems is going to be hiring product manager,\" and you heard that and you googled, what is product management, and then you asked them, \"Can I do that?\" And that's how you got into the role. So first of all, is that true? And second of all, what's your advice to people trying to get into product management and any lessons from that experience?\n\nChris Miller (00:17:22):\nSo first, yes, that is 100% true. That is how I stumbled into product management. So, I appreciate all the folks who took a shot on me back then, but this was at a time where I would say product management even as a function was definitely not ubiquitous across tech. There was, at least in the world that I was in, a lot more of a standard waterfall approach to building product with a lot of middle layers and engineering managers and really no one who had the job of owning the problem from a customer's point of view. And so, there wasn't a ton of content out there. There weren't even a ton of people in the city at the time that I could really talk to sort of learn, and so a lot of what I did was scrape my knees through the first years and a lot of painful trial and error.\n\n(00:18:08):\nAnd then eventually I think there's a lot more energy and an interest around the trade craft and the function, and so I think it's much easier today for someone to learn the fundamentals of product management without necessarily needing to do it via trial by fire. My advice to folks who are interested in breaking into product management specifically is focus on a few things. One, focus on structure. I think there's usually a lower barrier to entry to do product management at a smaller shop, which they might not have as much access to the best talent out there, but I think what you may often give up in those instances is structure to your own sort of professional development and formal training and education and potentially even the opportunity to work for people who are truly battle tested and have seen the movie several times and can actually wisdom share because truthfully, it looks different in every company, and so it is one of those functions.\n\n(00:19:13):\nI do believe that taking a truly academic approach towards upskilling has fairly diminishing returns because it's tough to field curveballs in a classroom. And so, choosing where you want to break in is almost as important as choosing that you want to break in the first place. Thinking about who you're going to be reporting to, thinking about what's the track record of success for people at that company, breaking into product management, trying to think five years in advance and work backwards, I think are all sort of important thought exercises along the way. I would also say that if you're already at a shop where you are working at a different function and you're sort of product curious, go talk to the PMs, literally I say go reach out to a PM and ask how you can make their day easier.\n\n(00:20:01):\nFigure out what you can do in your spare time that they can offload to you and do a little bit of volunteer labor, even if that's just shadowing because I think just getting that context and understanding the sort of rhythm of how a team ideates and defines problems and prioritizes and ship software is the experience that's going to be the most important because a lot of product management is also managing personalities and figuring out how people want to work with you and figuring out how you work for them. And so, just getting that hands-on experience or at least direct sight-line into the day-to-day of a team is really important because the extent to which you can understand their problem space and understand the things that keep them up at night, you can be valuable, and then at the very least, what you get out of it is hopefully an advocate or a sponsor at the end of the day who is willing to gamble some professional and political capital on you to get your foot into the door even though you might not have any formal experience on your resume.\n\nLenny (00:21:04):\nThere's so much stuff that super resonates there. One is that I always think of the bare minimum job of a PM is just to be useful to people on the team and help them do better work. If you do that alone, people-\n\nChris Miller (00:21:15):\nBring the donuts, right?\n\nLenny (00:21:16):\nBring the donuts, exactly.\n\nChris Miller (00:21:19):\nI must be old, I don't know that anybody uses bringing the donuts now anymore.\n\nLenny (00:21:22):\nNo, we had Ken on the podcast, we talked about it. We asked, what is the digital version of that when everyone's working remote? I think that's something that even if you're a brand new PM you come across soon enough. And then the other piece there, I really love this metaphor of scraping your knees because I find that to be so important to becoming a PM is you think you could just read these things, take some courses and you got this, and you're not going to mess up, but I find that messing up is so important in helping to learn to do the job because like you said, there's relationships and people and changing plans and leaders, and it's just like you're not going to get it right and you learn how to deal with all these things by messing it up.\n\n(00:22:01):\nSo, I super agree with that, and even though you said it's easier not to learn to be a PM, it's still I think important to scrape your knees a number of times for you to actually learn to do the job. Along those lines, what did you find was most helpful to you to learn the craft of product management in the first few years? What do you think back to like, \"Oh, that was really helpful,\" other than just doing it messing up, sometimes getting it right?\"\n\nChris Miller (00:22:27):\nSo, my first product management job/mission was working on a B2B2C product, and there's a lot of unique challenges that came with that. Our customer was not the end user of our product. We sold into institutions who then white labeled our product and then resold it to the end customer. And so at the end of the day, our customers own the relationship with the end user and not us, and so-\n\nChris Miller (00:23:00):\n... own the relationship with the end user and not us. And so, the challenges that that created were that there was a lot of distance between us and the voice of the end user. And we ended up building a lot of things to satisfy the buyer and the customer, but not necessarily the end user. And that's challenging because you don't necessarily know whether you're building something to get a contract signed, or you're building something that's going to delight the person using it at the end of the day, or provide magical value. And so, I think I probably shipped a lot of bad product those years, if I'm being completely honest. I don't know that I would look back at what I shipped back then or what we shipped back then, and say they were the best possible solutions or best possible product.\n\n(00:23:47):\nIt wasn't until I got my second product management job where it really was an inflection point, where I was like, \"Oh, got it. This is what this is supposed to look and feel like.\"\n\nLenny (00:23:57):\nWhere was that? Was that with Keeper?\n\nChris Miller (00:23:59):\nI was working at a fitness technology company, and the person who really I would say changed my entire paradigm of what product management is supposed to be, someone I know you know, Fareed Mosavat, who I believe was on the pod-\n\nLenny (00:24:17):\nOoh. Absolutely.\n\nChris Miller (00:24:17):\n... last October. Shout out to Fareed if you're listening. Fareed is a good friend and mentor, and he really helped me level up. And what was interesting about those years is it was the first time I'd really gotten to work on a product where it was a freemium B2C run-tracking app. And so, we spent a lot of time talking to users directly, and a lot of guerrilla user research techniques. Literally, sometimes going outside and just talking to runners in passing to understand what were the challenges in finding motivation, and why do they choose running assistance, running applications in the first place? And so, just that having that deep connection to the customer and not feeling like you're being kept at arms' distance was eyeopening. I was like, \"Oh, I didn't know that it could be like this.\"\n\n(00:25:12):\nAnd then, the second thing that we had at our disposal that changed the game for me was access to a huge user data set. And so, having data at scale to drive decisions, being able to know that if we make a change, we can prove causation from a business impact standpoint or a customer delight or engagement standpoint. And so, it was almost like I didn't realize I was blind until... Or you didn't realize you weren't seeing in color. It's like that scene in The Wizard of Oz where they land on Oz, and all of a sudden, everything's in Technicolor. And you're like, \"Oh, my gosh, I can actually make informed decisions about what I'm shipping.\"\n\n(00:25:56):\nAnd having a level of rigor around that and really being forced to articulate a hypothesis and have a point of view on what the outcomes might be before you actually build something, were all sort of, I would say, behaviors and just philosophy around product discipline that I learned from Fareed and that group of folks that I worked with closely during those years. And that was, I think the... I consider that to be when I really became a product manager.\n\nLenny (00:26:30):\nThere's two things I want to highlight there that, again, super resonate. One is just whenever I talk to customers, I'm like, \"Why don't I do this more often?\" Because every time it's like, \"Wow, I had no idea how big of a problem that was. Why don't I do this all the time?\" And then, you don't again. And then, you do it months later and you're like, \"Oh, my god, I learned so much again.\" And so, I think if you're listening and you're just like... Maybe just go talk to a customer today.\n\nChris Miller (00:26:55):\nTalk to customers, and we also learned a lot from talking to people who we wanted to be customers but were not, right? And people who had either broken up with our product or evaluated it and never fell in love with it in the first place. And so, I think every PM struggles with time management and it feels like you need 60 hours in a day to get through your weekly checklist, or 60 hours in a week, excuse me. But finding time to just talk to people. Even today, I have a lot of friends who are entrepreneurs or small business owners, and some use HubSpot, some don't. But I usually tend to really enjoy my conversations with people who decided not to use HubSpot and to really try to unpack what drove that decision.\n\n(00:27:40):\nWas it as calculated, as I think sometimes we can all maybe assume that some of these decisions are? And then you often learn that they're sometimes kind of emotional, really instinctual and visceral and maybe connected to brands more than they even connected to product. And there's a lot of things that I think when you're in the proverbial digital conference room with your team, trying to understand what makes your users tick, you're just like, \"We're actually just...\" We're illogical humans at the end of the day at our core, and that all rides on decisions people make in the day-to-day. And it doesn't change, necessarily, when they're engaging with your product. As much as we love it to be perfect science, so that we can moneyball the system, if you will.\n\nLenny (00:28:23):\nIt reminds me of a story where we were doing some user research on a booking feature with an Airbnb. And we went to Paris to do these really in-depth user research studies. We were behind one-way mirrors and all that stuff. And we were trying to figure out why hosts weren't connecting Facebook to their account. This is like, I don't know, five, six years ago. Because it gave them so much access to where their friends are traveling and reviews and all these things. And especially, in France, they were just like, \"I don't trust Facebook.\" And this was before it became a big thing in the US. They're just like, \"I don't trust... I don't want them to have any of my data.\" \"But look at all this power you get.\" They're like, \"No, I don't care. I don't trust it.\" And-\n\nChris Miller (00:28:59):\nYeah, that's why talking to customers is so... You could have all the usage data in the world, that's going to tell you what's actually happening in your product, but it doesn't tell you why. It will never explain the why behind a behavior that you can track through events firing. And so, that's why that sort of proximity to the customer and directing that sort of relentless curiosity towards the qualitative stuff is so, so important because you just learn things that are just sometimes really unintuitive or are blind spots because we're often not the people we're building product for.\n\nLenny (00:29:35):\nAbsolutely. I want to shift talking about HubSpot the business, but one more last thing I wanted to highlight from what you just shared, which is a really good insight is you shared that your biggest inflection in your career was a manager, Fareed in this case, who helped you learn the craft and develop your skills, and that's the exact experience I had too. Just one specific manager changed everything for me. And that feels like a recurring theme to a lot of people, just having one person that really spends the time to help you learn and correct you when you're making mistakes and all that. So, if folks are wondering maybe why am I not learning enough or why is my care stagnating? See if you can just find... Easier said than done, but oftentimes it just takes one person to change everything.\n\nChris Miller (00:30:15):\nIt gets into sort of a conversation about the difference between a manager and a mentor, versus a sponsor and an advocate. Mentors are great, don't get me wrong. I have a ton of people that I would consider to be mentors, but when I think about the people in my life, who... The time that they donated to me, the time that they volunteered to me and for me, calling them mentors, I think sells what they were very short. And I would actually describe those folks as being sponsors and advocates, people who were willing to put up capital, whether that's professional, social capital to bet on you.\n\n(00:30:56):\nI mean, truth be told, when I interviewed with Fareed that first time, I think back to the interview and I think I bombed it. I actually don't think I would've hired me back then. And I remember the answers I gave to some of those questions, and I think they were good, but I don't think they were certainly great. And I imagine that there was something in there where the decision maker, who was Fareed said, \"I think I can make something out of this.\" And I think being willing to invest in someone and finding people who are willing to invest in you is what really matters. And finding people who are willing to, again, put something up for you, whether that be whatever kind of capital it is. When I think about true gasoline on the career fire, it's finding mentors, but it's also finding sponsors and advocates.\n\nLenny (00:31:48):\nIs there anything that you think you did right to help find mentors and sponsors and advocates for people that are thinking about, \"Hey, I need this. How do I help myself in the same way?\" Is there something you did that helped people get excited to help you?\n\nChris Miller (00:32:02):\nSomething I think I certainly continue to work on, but really, putting ego aside and embracing not knowing stuff and embracing not being good at stuff, and not feeling self-conscious about that and letting the desire to be the best at something or at least be great at something overpower the fear of being inadequate at something. And I played sports growing up, and so I like being coached. I can take hard feedback, and I like it because if I get better feedback than the people I'm competing against, I think I can beat them over time if I work hard enough.\n\n(00:32:42):\nAnd so, I think just taking that mentality with me into product management, I think has helped me build bridges with people who don't owe me anything, right? People who don't necessarily need to be invested in me at all, but who might get delight out of it somehow. And I don't know exactly how that works and the calculus that goes on in folks' brains, but at least what's within my control is how I can show up in the context of those relationships and really embrace even the hardest, ugliest feedback and hope that I can extract something from it that'll make me better at the end of the day.\n\nLenny (00:33:22):\nI love that advice. Makes me think about Jules Walter's advice, which I've referenced many times on this podcast now, where his tip is when people are giving you feedback, just be like, \"Thank you so much for that feedback,\" even though you're melting inside and just completely disagree with what they're telling you.\n\nChris Miller (00:33:40):\nYeah, shout out to Jules. Jules is also someone who has been generous with me in the past in terms of giving time when I've needed help with stuff. Also, a great episode you did with Jules.\n\nLenny (00:33:51):\nSo, many people have said what you just said about Jules, about how helpful he is been to them. So, clearly, a class act to that guy, maybe we'll have to bring him back.\n\nChris Miller (00:33:59):\nWould love that.\n\nLenny (00:34:00):\nYeah. V2 Jules. So, let's shift to HubSpot the business, which is a pretty incredible success story. From what my notes, it's worth something like $30 billion now as a business. It's been around for 17 years. Still growing, I think, something like 30% year over year. And most interestingly, Okta put out this really interesting report recently where they looked at their data of what tools people are using to authenticate with, and they showed that basically HubSpot is maybe the fifth fastest-growing software product in the world. I don't know if it's true, but feels true because all the other companies make sense there. So, you don't have to confirm or deny this, but clearly things are going great at HubSpot. I'm curious just what makes HubSpot so special and unique and successful that's specifically unique to HubSpot versus other companies?\n\nChris Miller (00:34:51):\nThere's a lot in there. I can speak to the things that have resonated most deeply with me in my time there. The first is legitimate customer obsession. It's not marketing, it's legitimate, right? I've witnessed fierce and passionate debates internally that the root of what the people in the debate were really trying to unpack was what was the best thing for the customer. And so, really having that be central to our dogma and how we think about the business and why the company exists in the first place, really walking the walk there is something that I don't know that that's true everywhere.\n\n(00:35:39):\nI mean, I've certainly worked at places where that hasn't been true, and there's a lot of factors that can lead to those trade-off decisions at times. Like is this the right thing for the business, the right thing for the customer? Being really challenging. I think just sort of having that customer centricity really baked into the DNA of the company makes those decisions, maybe not easier, but at least you can have more conviction around the why behind the decision at the end of the day. Another thing that I think makes HubSpot-\n\nLenny (00:36:07):\nBefore you actually move on to the next one, I want to spend a little time on this one because I think people hear this and they're like, \"Yes, okay, we're going to be customer obsessed.\" And then, you have to make these hard decisions. Look at this experiment, it's going to grow our revenue 1%, but it's not really going to make the customer's life easier. How do you actually make this real? And there may be an example where you have to trade off growth versus we need to make sure the customer is getting what they need or making the customer happy to make it a little more real even.\n\nChris Miller (00:36:34):\nOne, I think that's a really fantastic, maybe not counterpoint, but thing to call out. My point of view here is that oftentimes it's a function of what's the time horizon that the company uses as their sort of baseline for assessing decisions? And typically, when you're making decisions that could be described as hostile towards your customers, but a net positive for the business, you're probably not thinking long-term enough, right? Because there's no possible way, unless you have completely cornered a market and there is no competition whatsoever, that you could continually be hostile towards your customers and grow, right? At some point, that's going to catch up.\n\n(00:37:25):\nAnd so, oftentimes I think it's the tension of what do we need to do in the short term to survive? Versus long-term, where are we going? What's the path that we're actually charting? Is I think the true tension. But if you're making decisions that might have lasting impact that are customer hostile, I think that's a really dangerous path to kind of go down. And so, having, I think, the discipline or the bravery or the courage, whatever, to I think focus on not necessarily tomorrow or the day after, and really think about two, three, four years from now, what are the outcomes we're trying to drive and what are the decisions we need to make in the interim that are going to lead to that outcome? If you stick to that sort of framework, or first principle is a better way to describe it, then I think you'll often end up arriving at the conclusion that doing the thing that's right for customers at the end of the day is the right decision.\n\nLenny (00:38:24):\nIs there something in the way you operate that helps you systemize that in your experiment plan or product specs or experiment results? Or is there a story of something where you just shipped something that shows this customer obsession to make it even more concrete for listeners?\n\nChris Miller (00:38:42):\nThere's definitely structure you could put around customer centricity. And I think a lot of it for growth at HubSpot and the teams that I lead, it's around forcing specificity of language. So, for example, you look at a lot of standard documentation for features or experiments, whatever, and one of the first things, it's like outline the problem. I don't know that we even talk about problems without a qualifier. Are we talking about a business problem? Are we talking about a customer problem? Are we talking about an efficiency problem? Describe the nature of the problem and parse it out. Because generally speaking, if there's a business problem, you might do the thought exercise of asking, \"Well, why hasn't that problem solved itself? What's the actual customer problem that is leading to the downstream negative thing that's happening to the business?\"\n\n(00:39:34):\nAnd if we can actually create some daylight between those two things conceptually, we can avoid making the mistake of trying to solve a business problem in a way that leads to a bad outcome for the customer at the end of the day. And I think, also, creating a system that makes it easy for PMs to call out assumptions that they might be making. So, if we do this, what would you predict to be some of the sort of derivative downstream things? And if we can call those things out and just keep asking why, why, why, to sort of justify some of the direction you want to go in and then keep asking in what, what, what, in terms of what's the sort of true blast radius and domino effect of these decisions is the approach that we take at HubSpot, in my teams at least.\n\nLenny (00:40:23):\nAwesome. Okay. So, I cut you off in this one bullet point so far. So, let's keep going.\n\nChris Miller (00:40:29):\nYeah. So we're talking about the things that make HubSpot special. So, customer obsession is definitely one. I think where we play in the market, too. Being a company that has been comfortable staying in the mid-market, SMB mid-market space, and resisting the temptation to try to crawl up into enterprise software, I think makes us special. And one of the things that's actually really straightforward, which is that a lot of enterprise software companies, a lot of your revenue is tied up in a small subset of customers. And I think what can happen there is if those customers decide that they want you to build something and they're willing to threaten their business over it, then you'll end up building it. And is that necessarily the thing that is going to serve all your customers best? Probably not. Are you going to end up having to build and maintain bespoke software for one customer? Probably.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAnd don't get me wrong, I think there's a lot of product folks out there who enjoy that modality of work, I'm not one of them. And so, by playing in the mid-market, it means our revenue is distributed more evenly across our entire install base, which means that there's no single customer who can hold us hostage, really. But what that does is with great power comes great responsibility. I think what that does is the forcing function of ensuring that the decisions that we make are a net benefit for the largest swath of customers possible. And I think it really is the guiding light behind some of our decisions around connected experience and usability and user experience. And so, playing in the mid-market, I think affords us to be able to do that. So, I think that's another thing that makes us special for a company of our size.\n\n(00:42:10):\nCulture is another one. And I won't get into the culture code. I think a lot of folks have probably read it. If not, go check it out.\n\nLenny (00:42:18):\nI don't know if people have heard of that. What is that?\n\nChris Miller (00:42:20):\nYeah. Dharmesh, our co-founder, one of our fearless leaders, Dharmesh, one of the things he most famously did early on is he published the HubSpot culture code externally. You can Google it and find it anywhere. I think a lot of companies sort of replicated that over the years, but by being really open and transparent about the culture both internally and externally, I think one, it internally creates alignment and it gives everyone something to point to to enforce why did we choose to work with each other the way that we work with each other. I think it also helps in attracting the right type of candidates because we put it out there, we're sort of really open about it. If you don't like that culture, chances are you probably won't be super excited to work here. But if that's something that you're craving, and I think a lot of quality people crave a lot of the things that are sort of codified in our culture. Humility, empathy, adaptability, remarkability, transparency are sort of all things that I think people take quite seriously.\n\n(00:43:19):\nAnd so, being really open and honest about that. And being willing to sort of pressure test it on a regular basis, like is this still a company we want to be? We are growing really fast. What has changed? What conditions are still able to be supported with the culture we have codified today? What amendments might we need to make in terms of who we want to represent ourselves to be to our customers and how do we want to work with each other? And investing in that, hiring really good people that can help us scale that I think is something that makes HubSpot really special.\n\nLenny (00:43:52):\nAmazing. I'm reading the culture code on the side here, and there's these little quotes that are really sweet. I really like this one, \"Solve for the customer, not just their happiness, but also their success.\"\n\nChris Miller (00:44:04):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:44:05):\nWise.\n\n(00:44:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge.

I think a lot of the things that I might associate with HubSpot culture are very much rooted in a specific period of HubSpot, right? It was probably a pre-pandemic period. It was probably a period where we were all working in the same physical space. And so, there's a lot of inside jokes. And sometimes the things are rooted in very specific quirks of specific individuals who may not even be at the company anymore. And so, if you're someone who's joined the company in the past two or three years and that flies over your head-\n\nChris Miller (00:46:00):\nThe company in the past two or three years, and that flies over your head. I think we have to ask ourselves, \"What's the value of continuing to embrace these things?\" And so I think what we've been doing over the years is taking inventory of the things that might have been considered part of HubSpot legacy culture and really trying to again, pressure test it. Does this continue to serve us today? And if not, we should be really comfortable of letting it go.\n\n(00:46:24):\nBut one of the things that I think is super dope that we do is we do this thing called PEER Week, which was something that popped up during the pandemic and the TLDR is that it's like an event for product and engineering; where travel changed with the pandemic and people don't get to see each other in person as much, but there's a couple of weeks in the summer in June where we fly everybody in either if you're in North America, we fly you to Cambridge. If you were in Europe somewhere, then we fly you to Dublin and we spend a week together.\n\n(00:46:56):\nThere's not a ton of focus on just classic productivity. There's a ton of focus on building connections and safety and just getting to know people and who they are as human beings, but also, damn I forgot how much I missed whiteboarding. It's actually being able to get in a room with a physical whiteboard of people and work on some stuff. And so this is, I think the second year in a row, or second or third I don't remember, pandemic years have really fogged the brain... That we've done it. And it's one of the things I look most forward to every year is getting everybody in the same city to just hang out.\n\nLenny (00:47:27):\nI love it. I keep peeking at these highlights and they're really interesting. So we're going to link to this culture code also in the show notes if you want to check it out. But anyway, let's focus on how HubSpot grows. And there's kind of two parts, in my mind there's just like, how did it start and what worked really well. You're actually on the inaugural team, I believe, of HubSpot's growth team and things worked out. Well done. I'm curious maybe just to start what you think you did so right, early on in the history of HubSpot to help it grow into the behemoth it has become. What was kind of the early success elements that were key?\n\nChris Miller (00:48:03):\nI would say the early years of doing freemium. And for the record, there's definitely an iteration of the growth team before I joined that, you know really like Brian Balfour was the person who I would say injected that first dose of PLG DNA into HubSpot. So shout out to Brian. I want to make sure he gets the credit that he's owed.\n\nLenny (00:48:26):\nYeah, we're going to have him on the podcast at some point. It's in the works.\n\nChris Miller (00:48:29):\nYeah, he's a legend. Brian's great.\n\nLenny (00:48:30):\nAbsolute legend.\n\nChris Miller (00:48:31):\nAnd so after Brian had left HubSpot, it was a bit start and stop. And so when I joined and we sort of took another stab at it, I think there were a few things we did. One, in the beginning is we really had an aggressive mentality, an aggressive approach I think. And by we, I mean the team, the actual really small initial growth team. We tried not to be pedantic about where we were spending our time. And so we sort of tossed our mission and charter out of the window. We said, cool, maybe on paper we were, I think the sales tool, activation team. It was a very boutique mission and remit compared to I think a lot of the other teams at HubSpot's missions and remit at the time.\n\n(00:49:21):\nBut even though that's what we were supposed to be working on paper, we were sort of like, if we find something that looks like an opportunity and no one else in the business is thinking about it, we're just going to try to fix it. We're going to ask for forgiveness rather than permission and start to call some plays.\n\n(00:49:38):\nAnd what that looked like was at the time, a very small percentage of, I think HubSpot's subscription revenue would be described as self-service, like people putting in their credit card and buying something. It was predominantly product driven leads like PQLs. And so we were literally sending everything to the sales team, which it was running revenue, but certainly opportunities for efficiency because it was the first time we'd really had a product at a price point that could be transactional and not a highly considered purchase. And so we were thinking about this and we were like, \"Well, how does this work? Is there even a pricing page in the product that people could actually buy something?\"And we found it, but it had been neglected. It was sort of like, I think no one was sort of committing any code to that repository.\n\n(00:50:31):\nSo we approached a team who owned it and we were like, \"Are y'all working on this? Is this an active development?\" And they were like, \"Nah, we're working on a bunch of other stuff.\" We were like, \"Can we take this?\" And they were like, \"Sure, if you want it, take it. It's one less code base for us to maintain.\" And so we took it and immediately blew it up. We redesigned the whole thing focused on discoverability, how are people getting to this page, focusing on desirability, like how are we talking about the value props of the things that we're wanting to sell to customers to help them grow better. And then thinking about doability or usability, how do we actually just remove the friction that's standing in the way?\n\n(00:51:10):\nAnd so we did a mad dash towards this outcome we wanted to drive, and when we released it worked. It was actually a step function change in the way that the physics of the business and the funnel really looked. And I think that was probably a catalyst moment of everyone saying, \"Oh wow, there might actually be something here.\" And so that attitude of saying that every problem is our problem and being willing to really take a mentality of like, I think radical accountability and ownership mentality helped us find opportunities that maybe the business wasn't explicitly asking us to solve, but we were able to triangulate why it might be important for the business for us to solve it.\n\n(00:51:54):\nAnd when you do that, I think the business, a business may get more comfortable putting more on your plate. Right? And so it's like we look hungry, so let's keep feeding us. And so over time our remit expands and there's other things that we think are opportunities to gain leverage for the business or deliver a delight to our customers in a more efficient way, and honestly in a way that they probably expected to engage with us at that point in time. It was quite odd that there were so many humans involved in every stage of the customer journey and some of our customers just like, \"I just want to be able to try the thing and buy it if I want to be. I really don't want to be forced into a sales engagement.\" And so it was really kind of meeting the expectations of the modern software buyer in many ways.\n\nLenny (00:52:41):\nIt sounds incredibly important. Basically your team turned HubSpot into a very product led growth business, which feels very important in the history of HubSpot's growth. Would you consider what was there before where it was the beginnings of self-service, but they had to talk to a salesperson? Would you consider that product led?\n\nChris Miller (00:52:59):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:53:00):\nOkay.\n\nChris Miller (00:53:00):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:53:00):\nAnd so how would you describe what the shift was in terms of the way the sales motion and growth motion changed?\n\nChris Miller (00:53:07):\nThe go-to-market motions that we were working on definitely fit under, I think the broad umbrella of PLG, but I don't think the culture of the company was necessarily explicit about being a PLG company. I don't think that's the way we talked about who HubSpot was and trust me, there were a bunch of other factors in here. I definitely, I won't say that our team were the sole driving force behind that shift in our strategy and approach, but certainly the data that we were able to collect and the experiments we were able to run and the insights we were able to surface and the research we were able to synthesize... It gave us conviction to double down on it for sure. And that was definitely maybe the beginning of that inflection point for the company, but there was certainly a lot of other things that led to us wanting to become more product led.\n\n(00:54:01):\nAgain, I think about it, I think any company is probably searching for ways to operate more efficiently. And if your revenue is so tied to go-to-market headcount, it gets really hard to scale the bigger you get. And so I think there's an innate desire to want to be more non-linear in our growth. And I think us arriving at the right place at the right time created sort of alignment around what the path forward could look like. If we want to live in that world, how might we get there? And I think that's where we really fit into the equation. It's like, \"Oh, we invest in this team. If we invest in the type of work this team is doing, that's how we're going to build efficiencies over time.\" And it's also, we like that because it's in line with what our customers are already expecting from us.\n\nLenny (00:54:47):\nAnd it sounds like you weren't like, \"We need to be more product led.\" It was more just how do we get the sales process more efficient and the motion of growth more efficient and that emerged out of that.\n\nChris Miller (00:54:58):\nYeah, I mean, don't get me wrong. We were definitely like, we need to be more product led. And I think that's actually the nuance here. You asked would I consider what we were doing product led growth? And I think the answer is absolutely, but that's because a fallacy that people, a lot of, I think maybe early stage founders or folks who are unfamiliar with chronic growth or maybe only know about it from an academic point of view, maybe fall into the trap of is assuming that in order to be a PLG company you can use that interchangeably with being a fully self-service business or fully self-service go-to market.\n\n(00:55:34):\nI don't actually think that those things are one and the same. I think that most companies, at least the larger, more successful ones that have done amazing things and are cornering their market or category, that we would consider to be PLG companies have a bunch of humans working on really important things on their go to market, and it's more of a hybrid motion. And I think it's less about, again, being sort of myopic about your approach to PLG and having it being really rooted in principles that are, I think very kind of academic or conceptual in nature.\n\n(00:56:08):\nBut more sort of being pragmatic and saying, \"Okay, cool. Who is our customer? What is the product that we sell? How are our customers used to buying this thing? How would they prefer to buy it in the future that they would like to live in? What's the packaging of our products? How do our customers decide? Is it a top down decision or a bottoms up decision? How complex are our building and subscription terms is something that's going to be pretty transactional or something that's going to be fairly considered? How comfortable is our target market with the technology in our category? Are we competing against non-consumption? Are we competing against competitors in the same category?\"\n\n(00:56:48):\nAnd if you actually answer those questions, and I think it may be obvious where I'm going with this, but based on the answer to those questions, the conditions on the ground might lend themselves to be more favorable to product-led growth and be more favorable to self-service, right? It's why there are companies that the value prop is just so... Like you don't need a person to sell you Loom. I use Loom and it's so intuitive that I can just decide on my own whether I want to buy it. You don't need a person to teach you how to use even Slack to some example. Like Slack is extremely intuitive. Right? Like you could throw someone in Slack and use a product in a similar paradigm and it can probably figure out the basics on their own.\n\n(00:57:25):\nThere are certain products that don't necessarily check those boxes. And so I think what you can do is kind of take a more modular approach to PLG, and it's like based on how a customer in the best case scenario might go from zero to one when it comes to activation and onboarding, do we need to have a human involved in that process at all? Or as a backstop? If the answer is yes, then maybe figure out ways to have humans involved where your cost structure is durable or at least defensible. If that's not the case, then go take a PLG approach to it.\n\n(00:57:59):\nAnd so across our entire business, we've never taken a very pure, everything here for this line of business or this product line is going to be self-service without being able to defend and contextualize why across the entire customer journey this makes sense. And so yeah, we have customers who come in through the product led front door and kick the tires on the product on their own and activate on the product on their own. But then when it comes time to buy the product, they want to talk to somebody and there's legitimate reasons why, right? There are maybe IT and security concerns that they need to get somebody on the phone for. Maybe they're coming for a platform where data migration is a huge fear they have, and that's not something that's easy to do in a self-service environment yet. I think that's going to change over time. But today it's still kind of painful when you're doing rip and replaces.\n\n(00:58:48):\nAnd so to try to brute force that into a sort of self-service motion for every customer writ large would be solving for your business' desires, not necessarily solving for the customer at the end of the day. But we also sell into different segments of customers that are maybe digital natives but not familiar with products in our category. And maybe they're coming from not a competing product, but they're coming from a more rudimentary system like spreadsheets. I mean, I've seen customers using post-it notes to manage their.\n\nLenny (00:59:25):\n[inaudible 00:59:25].\n\nChris Miller (00:59:25):\nThe deal pipeline, the real old school way, and that was sort of their locus of control for their sales team. Right?\n\n(00:59:31):\nAnd so there are use cases like that if you're a smaller team, you kind of have an acute understanding of the pain points that are like today's buyers that you need to put out. You don't have to deal with the burden of a huge data migration. And the person who's going to be in the CRM day in and day out is also the person who gets to make the final call on what CRM they're going to use. There's a ton of those customers that we never talk to in person, right? And that's awesome too. And so being comfortable with things not necessarily fitting into clean boxes and having conviction that a modular approach or a more hybrid approach is actually the way to optimize for the customer and the business at the end of the day is something that I think we embraced really early on.\n\n(01:00:17):\nOne of the first metrics that I had was activation rate, but it was also how much demand am I sending to the sales team? And there was no turf war about that, right? It's like, oh, that's net positive for if people are able to get helped and a lot of the questions that they have cannot be answered with the product today, we should absolutely be proud to connect them with one of our awesome people in sales who can be like, help see if the solutions we offer are a good fit for them. And there are instances where people just don't want to talk to somebody, and our job is to make sure that there's a friction-free way for them to make that decision on their own.\n\nLenny (01:00:48):\nAmazing. I think on the one hand, this could be a whole podcast is just talking about your PLG learnings, knowing... It feels like HubSpot is one of the biggest success stories of transitioning more and more into PLG, at least at that point. Even though you're saying it was PLG early on, it feels like a huge shift to the business. So I really like this framework you just shared of if you're trying to become more product led, just think about the zero to one from visit to activation and when does someone really have to talk to someone and how do we help them not have to talk to people in that moment? So either in that direction or just broadly, if someone was trying to explore how do we become more product led, what are the first couple steps and dives you would recommend they do to help them down that road?\n\nChris Miller (01:01:34):\nFirst I would ask, why do you want to be product led? What assumptions are you making in terms of why being product led are going to be net positive for the business or for your customers? And I might even ask them to define what product-led means to them that we can get on the same page of what we're even talking about.\n\nLenny (01:01:52):\nHow would you define it? Do you have a rough, an answer to that? Just so people get a sense of what it probably means.\n\nChris Miller (01:01:58):\nYeah. At the highest level, it's like taking a go-to-market approach where your product job is to grow revenue and you use humans as a backstop and not the other way around.\n\nLenny (01:02:08):\nAwesome.\n\nChris Miller (01:02:09):\nAnd I think the key thing is that humans can be a backstop. There are moments where it's going to make sense for humans to be a backstop. One example that is I think is really normal, a hardship circumstance where a customer needs to end their relationship, right? Like every SaaS company deals with this. Some take a fully automated approach, but most usually have some sort of escalation path that will result in a human having to resolve this. It doesn't make them any less product led. I think every company at its core is having some humans behind the scenes interface with customers on things related to go-to-market. But I think once defining that and getting on the same page about that, I think you can learn a lot. And by the way, these are the normal conversations that I have with founders all the time. I'm actually an operator in residence at OpenView, and so I speak to a lot of their poor [inaudible 01:03:01], and this is usually the conversation that we end up having.\n\n(01:03:03):\nAnd I think what's always interesting is how different the sort of array of answers are when you ask that question. Some are like, oh, it's about top of the funnel demand. We want to be more product led because we want more leads, we want more signups. You're like, \"Oh, okay.\" And that's a very defensible reason. There's a lot of data that shows that freemium products attract a lot more top of the funnel demand than sales led go-to-market products do. Right? Some, it might be a matter of constrained resources. We absolutely need to be more product led in the stage of the company because we simply cannot hire an army of implementation specialists and folks on the customer success outside of the house to help every single customer at scale, which is generally a byproduct of having a really large top of the funnel. And then there are others that are, it's about revenue efficiency.\n\n(01:03:56):\nAnd so when you can kind of articulate the outcomes that you want to drive, it helps triangulate where to begin. So if you are really focused on top of the funnel demand, trying to do self-service checkout is a silly place to start. And so just really doing the fun exercise of articulating why do you care about this? Why are you actually interested in this in the first place? If you do this, what would change about your business? What assumptions are you making? And when you can actually list those things out, you can map them to parts of the customer journey where there may be opportunity to be more product led if the company isn't there yet.\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nAwesome. Maybe a couple more questions along these lines and then I just have a couple more questions I definitely want to ask. When someone is trying to go in the direction of product led growth, A.K.A. more self-service, and I guess maybe let me just ask, is that sort of how you think about the equivalency of those two?\n\nChris Miller (01:04:50):\nSure.\n\nLenny (01:04:50):\nOkay. What are maybe the most common mistakes they make that aren't as obvious?\n\nChris Miller (01:04:55):\nI mean, the number one mistake is hiring a head of growth, giving them no resources and expecting them to pull rabbit out of their hat.\n\n(01:05:04):\nI feel like every PLG veteran has some joke that they tell about the poor head of growth who has no tooling, no engineering cycles, no designer, no access to data, and then are handed a really scary big number and told to go move it. I think that's a common mistake that has stood the test of time.\n\n(01:05:28):\nAnother one is expecting really quick turnaround and thinking of it the same way you might think about hiring a sales, an incremental sales headcount, which is that you're expecting near term liquidity from that investment, but when you're doing PLG at its core, it's still R&D. You're still sort of planting seeds with the hope that over time this is going to play out in the form of durable pie efficient growth. But if you're expecting, you put a team on something and then you want that team to sort of have outsize impact, and sure there's going to be low hanging fruit, but I think just not having the patience to see the investment through and cutting bait too early is another, I think mistake some companies make.\n\n(01:06:20):\nAnd then I also think that bad data hygiene is the other one. So not having taken a beat to properly instrument their product, messy data, no real self-service way for people to access that data. Like having analyst bottlenecks can be a terrible position to be in. And so eating your veggies, getting your house in order from a data standpoint, I think is a crucial first step because if you can't actually measure what's happening, then like why?\n\n(01:06:54):\nAnd then maybe the last one is people giving up because they don't have enough data, right? They're like, we can't do PLG because we don't have this massive data set the way that HubSpot has or the way the Airbnb has. And it's like you can still do PLG, you just need to use different data. The way we think about data is that quant data is just another form of data. The same way experiment results are just another data point. You can learn a ton from just talking to customers. Like qual research is super-duper important, and so if you don't have data to tell you exactly what every single person is doing in your product in aggregate, you can still talk to 10 customers and probably get a clear sense of what's happening and why it's happening. That you wouldn't even get from the quant data.\n\n(01:07:33):\nSo people getting demotivated or companies getting demotivated because they think they're too early to do PLG, you can still do PLG. PLG at its core is just having your product sell the value prop of what your business does, and you can still deliver on that without being able to stand up a very robust and sophisticated experimentation practice.\n\nLenny (01:07:53):\nKind of along those lines, but going even broader. Without disclosing trade secrets of how HubSpot works, how would you describe the loop of growth of HubSpot? In the words of, you mentioned Brian Belfor and Fareed, what is the growth loop of HubSpot either now or recently? Just a simple way to think about how HubSpot grows.\n\nChris Miller (01:08:12):\nOur loops are less tactical. In fact, if I'm being brutally honest, I think loops are kind of hard to achieve in B2B SaaS. I think there's some examples of that, but I think some of the best loops come from UGC, user generated content. I think a lot of B2C community focused platforms can do loops really well. I think if it's B2B SaaS, it's hard to find things that get loopy. And it is me going, I think all my Reforge [inaudible 01:08:40] are going to be upset that I said that. But I think that's the truth.\n\n(01:08:42):\nWhen I think about the flywheel of HubSpot, I think it's more of a macro flywheel. And just to kind of lean into our own lingo, it's really attracting gage and delight. And so, one of the principles that guides our thinking and our strategy is give value before you extract value. And I think that was at the core...\n\nChris Miller (01:09:00):\nGive value before you extract value, and I think that was at the core of inbound marketing at its inception, that outbound marketing was asking for something from customers or prospects before giving anything. And so at its core it's like, okay, yeah, if you give a little for free, people who are interested in sort of hearing the rest of how that album sounds are going to come and stick around for more. And so in our pre PLG days, it was content marketing and white papers and listicles and eBooks and things that people had to download that were really filling the top of the funnel. And that is just taking another form with PLG.\n\n(01:09:39):\nAnd so we intentionally put out a lot of free software. And the idea is that this software is not sort of gimmicky. It's not designed to run out of value on day one. It's actually designed so that our smallest customers can get some value out of it in a sustainable way. But if they're engaging with it deeply enough, they're going to run into the limits of what that value is. And if we've done our jobs and delivered what we believe we were supposed to deliver, then the decision to purchase becomes a no-brainer.\n\n(01:10:10):\nAnd if they're delighted with the experience of being a customer, they're going to become advocates, and they're going to become promoters, and they're going to tell their peers. Because what we also know is that a lot of small business owners and even medium-sized business owners take a lot of guidance from their community of peers. And sometimes that's a digital community, sometimes that's not. And so anytime we win an advocate through delivering an excellent customer experience, they bring more people into the top of the funnel. And so it's a really honest, and I would say an honest macro loop in the sense, but that's the way we think about our flywheel.\n\nLenny (01:10:50):\nOh man, this could be a whole other hour of a podcast just diving into this stuff. This is so good. You shared this interesting story that I wasn't aware of. So HubSpot's kind of known for content and SEO. You search for anything and there's always a HubSpot article about it. And so is what you're sharing here, essentially that was a big part of the early days, SEO, free content that drove people to the site and the product wasn't free, is what I'm hearing. And then it shifted to now it's a free product that anyone can use and that's what drives the top of funnel.\n\nChris Miller (01:11:21):\nYes, correct.\n\nLenny (01:11:22):\nAmazing.\n\nChris Miller (01:11:23):\nI can't give a specific number, but a large percentage of our revenue flows through the product. And it's not necessarily maybe where people ultimately purchased, but that's their sort of first conversion event with us. They were in the product, they liked what they saw, they spoke to somebody, and then eventually became a customer. And that is now a pretty robust top of the funnel for the company.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nSo I think this is a really interesting story of just starting with one growth channel of SEO essentially, content marketing and then shifting to something else. Is there any lessons from that experience for people trying to kickstart their growth of SEO versus this freemium approach? Is there anything there that just like this worked really well for us and you should probably try this, or SEO kind of runs out in this specific type of business?\n\nChris Miller (01:12:10):\nI'll admit I'm definitely not an SEO expert. I've been fortunate to work with some of the best marketers in the world who I think are bonafide legends at this point in terms of what they've been able to achieve at HubSpot and building that lead and signup machine.\n\n(01:12:24):\nWhat I will say is being really aggressive about experimenting with new channels is so important, and diversifying your channel mix is so important because things can change overnight and that might disrupt your entire funnel. Like a Google algorithm change can have a massive impact. If you're reliant on app store optimization, a change in Apple's algorithm might have a massive impact. What we're seeing with generative AI, I think there's a lot of people losing sleep at night because it's unclear how this is going to impact SEO writ large. If that's what fuels your entire business is being on Google search result page, then what's going to happen in this new sort of world we're about to enter?\n\n(01:13:15):\nAnd so I think to the extent that you can not have your funnel be relying on a single or a couple of channels is really important. We're always testing new channels. One of the channels that we're spending some time experimenting with is this concept of microapps. And it's actually not a new concept for HubSpot. One of the first microapps you ever built was a... Maybe Dharmesh built this, the original one, but it was called Website Grader. And it was you put in your domain, and it crawled your site, and then gave you a set of recommendations for how you would optimize your site. And it was free. It was definitely a one trick pony. But what it did was it created an interesting conversation, which is like, okay, cool, now that you have this information, what are you going to do about it? And one of the things you could do is you could become a HubSpot customer and you can use our product to fix a lot of this stuff.\n\n(01:14:06):\nAnd that worked for us. It worked really, really well. And so we've done that play a few times and it's something that we'll probably continue to do. We have a bunch of these microapps. We have a brand kit generator, we have an email signature generator. We've experimented with a Build My Persona generator. There's a couple of ones that I can't talk about right now, but we'll learn a little bit about in a few weeks at Inbound. But yeah, microapps are an exciting new channel for us. And some will be successes, some will flop, and we'll probably sunset them. But being willing to fail in the pursuit of finding new distribution channels is also really important.\n\nLenny (01:14:44):\nThat's an awesome insight. Is there a place people can go to find these microapps that you all have built?\n\nChris Miller (01:14:49):\nThere will be soon.\n\nLenny (01:14:50):\nOh, mysterious. I also noticed Dharmesh tweeting about some AI projects he's working on. Is that related to these microapps? Or is that just him on his own time just doing fun stuff?\n\nChris Miller (01:15:00):\nVery related to microapps. I would say ChatSpot is actually, and for those who don't know what ChatSpot is, ChatSpot is a bit of an AI copilot that Dharmesh built that has sort of been very positively received by both HubSpot customers and non-HubSpot customers alike. And so that's something that we're, wearing my AI hat, spending a lot of time thinking about, sort of what direction do we want to go in the ChatSpot.\n\n(01:15:26):\nBut again, it was something that we put out in the universe to see what happens. And now it's like, oh, we're getting an interesting amount of signups every month. Who would've guessed that? I don't think that... That definitely wasn't on the roadmap a year ago. And I think being a 17-year-old SaaS company that can still operate with that sense of urgency and pace helps a lot to why wait to get consensus on a decision when we can put something out there and then see what happens and see what the data says.\n\nLenny (01:15:58):\nYeah, I was just going to say that it feels like it's such a win-win-win, including it's just a release for people on the team that have been there for a long time just to work on something totally different and new and just launch a new product.\n\nChris Miller (01:16:08):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny (01:16:10):\nI love that. Is there anything that just significantly accelerated growth in the last, I don't know, number of years that was like, wow, this really changed the game.\n\nChris Miller (01:16:18):\nCovid. Covid was obviously challenging and awful on so many levels, but it was scary. It was super scary. We were all terrified. We didn't know what it meant for our jobs. My own sister, who also works at HubSpot now, she at the time was transitioning into hospitality and was two months into her job when she got furloughed because of Covid. So who knew what the world was going to look like and how it was going to impact businesses?\n\n(01:16:45):\nI think we were prepared for the worst, and we actually caught a bit of the Covid tailwind and a lot of other businesses did, because companies who never had to think about digital marketing all of a sudden had to, and it was urgent. It was a burning need for them to figure out how they were going to weather the storm. And I think one of the things that HubSpot did, and this is one of the sort of phrases we use internally, is never waste a good crisis.\n\n(01:17:14):\nAnd so, one of the things we leaned into was sort of goodwill pricing, and we lowered the price on some of our tools and created some temporary leniency around certain things. And just the removal of that friction ended up being a really interesting tailwind for the business and specifically for the business that I run, which is our starter business, our free and starter business, we really accelerated growth during that period, which was not... I think if you would've looked at my Bingo card in March of 2020, I don't know that I had that on the Bingo card.\n\nLenny (01:17:50):\nI'm looking at the stock price in another window here and I could see what happened. That went great, and even it came down with the whole market, but it's coming right back up. With that, we reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nChris Miller (01:18:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:18:06):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nChris Miller (01:18:10):\nTruthfully, I don't read a ton of books. Got a one and a half year old. I also probably didn't read a ton of books before, but it's a nice excuse to have. That's why I don't have time to read today. But when I think of books that I think about a lot still, there's a book called Everybody Lies, and it's a book... I believe the guy who wrote it was a data scientist at Google. And part of the message is that everybody's a data scientist and really trying to democratize the idea of using data in your everyday lives to make decisions and demystifying the idea of data science. But the way he kind of does this is through comparing Google search data and what we know people to be actively looking for answers for, with sort of qualitative survey data. And people lie on surveys all the time for a variety of different reasons, but no one lies to Google because it's transactional. If I lie to Google, I'm not going to get what I want. And so it kind of really explores what it means to tell the truth and how honest we are with ourselves and with the internet. And so I really love that book.\n\n(01:19:15):\nThe other book I really love is Chop Wood Carry Water, which it's like a parable about a young boy who wants to become a samurai. But the sort of message of the book is about falling in love with the process, especially the most mundane parts of a process of becoming great at something. And that's something I... It's a good reminder about patience, humility, and sort of taking things one step at a time. And I often reference Chop Wood Carry Water a lot.\n\nLenny (01:19:47):\nReminds me of The Score Takes Care of Itself, I think is the name of the book.\n\nChris Miller (01:19:51):\nYeah, yeah, I've heard of it.\n\nLenny (01:19:53):\nBill Walsh. Amazing. Okay. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nChris Miller (01:19:57):\nOh, man. On Amazon Prime, I'm a Virgo, and it's a Boots Riley show. Boots Riley directed Sorry to Bother You. It just blew my mind. It's super surreal and funny and dark and it stars Jharrel Jerome, who I think he played one of the characters in the Netflix Central Park Five. I think he won a couple of awards for that too. And that was a show I watched recently where I had no expectations going into it other than I knew it was a Boots Riley show and was just enthralled. It touches on... It is a really cheeky way of touching on a lot of really important topics, but often hard to talk about topics and themes, and it's kind of delightful to get through it. So, I'm a Virgo. I just binged Barry from season one through four. Henry Winkler was spectacular. And then just came off of Succession, too. The theme here is I really dark comedies. Yeah, really, really dark comedies are kind of my thing.\n\nLenny (01:21:00):\nAnd that first one was called I Am a Virgo, because I thought you were just saying you're a Virgo.\n\nChris Miller (01:21:04):\nNo, no. The name of the show is called I'm a Virgo. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:21:07):\nAmazing. I will check that out. Okay. What's a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates?\n\nChris Miller (01:21:12):\nI think it depends on what level of role that they're interviewing for. I don't really interview as many frontline PMs anymore, but I used to really like doing case study questions and really random ones too. I'd be like, \"Tell me how many people crossed the Longfellow Bridge in a week.\" And I could not care less what the actual number they arrived at was, but it's more for me to observe what's the array of data points that they can kind of start to collect in their mind to inform their calculus, and how close can they get to ballpark, and what's their defense behind their thinking. And then just the process of watching people's brains move in those moments is... You learn a lot about how they might operate as a product manager I think in those scenarios. I try not to overdo them, because I do think there's a lot of inherent bias in some of those types of questions. And so trying to think of things that are really relatable to anybody who might be looking to work on a team that I'm leading is I think a requirement there.\n\n(01:22:23):\nBut I would say the other question I really like to ask is, if the people that you most recently worked with were in a room and you weren't there, how would they talk about you? One, it's because sometimes I will reach out and get references, and so the extent to which that might actually be part of the interview process is very legitimate, but also I think it is usually very clear whether the person is taking an honest and introspective and self-aware approach to answering that question. And I like to see people being really self-aware, because I don't think anybody ever comes in any situation perfect. I have a lot of rough edges to my personality that I think people have just learned to deal with over the years, but I try to be self-aware about them at the... If I can do nothing else, if I can't change them, at least recognize them and do what I can to mitigate the blast radius.\n\n(01:23:17):\nAnd so I think just getting a sense of the EQ of a candidate and their self-awareness is really important for me because at the end of the day, if you're in product, you can be the smartest person in the room, but if people don't want to work with you, you're probably not going to go very far.\n\nLenny (01:23:32):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you come back to or you share with other people?\n\nChris Miller (01:23:38):\nThe details matter.\n\nLenny (01:23:39):\nAnd that's both in work and life, I imagine?\n\nChris Miller (01:23:41):\nYeah, the details matter. The details matter. I read a cool interview with the product leadership team at Stripe, and one of the things they talk about is for their product managers, they want you to have taste. And it was a really kind of controversial thing to say because it was like, \"Oh, that is so subjective. Who gets to decide what taste is?\" Maybe that's even biased to some extent.\n\n(01:24:07):\nAnd I think they had a super defensible answer about how they define taste, and taste in their opinion was to be so interested in something, it doesn't matter what that thing is, where you can go deep enough in it to have a strong set of informed opinions. And that's how they defined it. And they were almost ambivalent to what that thing that was, what the subject was. But having taste, having something that you were passionate about, that you have spent enough time learning and understanding and appreciating and critiquing and being frustrated with that you have a point of view that is potentially even polarizing is taste. Riding the fence is usually not taste. And so when I think about the details matter, that's almost like a nod to taste. Obsess over the details of something, whether that be art, music, product, film, whatever. I care a lot about that.\n\nLenny (01:25:11):\nI love that. And that comes back to a lot of the things we've talked about of talking to customers, looking the data, actually having the firsthand information on what people need and what people want from your product.\n\nChris Miller (01:25:22):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny (01:25:24):\nOkay. I'm just going to ask two more, and I'll let you go. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nChris Miller (01:25:30):\nI fell in love with golf right before the pandemic, but the pandemic really is when I lost my mind and was obsessed with golf. It was one of the few safe things that you could do outside that was social and less dangerous than getting a drink with your buddy at the bar. That's the joke. It's like men invented golf so they could go on walks with each other, and that's essentially what kind of drove the interest in golf. And I also was horrible at it when I first started.\n\n(01:25:59):\nAnd so I think also as you get older and maybe you get more established in your career, or I've been in a product-led growth sort of lane for a while. You almost forget what it's like to be really bad at something until you have a kid and then everything's new and you're failing every day.\n\n(01:26:18):\nBut golf was a refreshing, consistent experience of frustration and inadequacy and just really embracing that and just waiting in it for a while knowing that it's just going to take cycles and time to get better and better. It was something I got really addicted to, and so I tried to play golf whenever I can, and most recently I bought a Garmin watch, and that thing is just magical. You roll up to the first tee box, you look at your watch, it knows exactly where you are, which golf course. Sometimes it'll even tell you which tees you're at, because in golf sometimes you're further back and sometimes you're further ahead, and it tracks your swings, it tells you distances.\n\nLenny (01:26:57):\nThat's insane.\n\nChris Miller (01:26:57):\nIt reads the greens for you.\n\nLenny (01:26:58):\nWow. I just want to play golf just to use that watch.\n\nChris Miller (01:27:01):\nOh my gosh, some of the guys that I golf with, a couple of them had one recently and I just was enthralled by it and I literally went home and ordered it that same day. And it's been the coolest product or gadget that I bought in a while.\n\nLenny (01:27:15):\nDamn. I love it. And I was also thinking as you were talking about getting into golf connects back to your relentless curiosity and resilience that you look for in people that you hire. So clearly you have it yourself.\n\n(01:27:27):\nFinal question, I believe you have a dog named Ferney, which is short for Fernet.\n\nChris Miller (01:27:31):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:27:31):\nOkay. So on that note, what is your favorite current cocktail, if it's not just a shot of Fernet?\n\nChris Miller (01:27:36):\nThe nightcap is always a shot of Fernet. Sometimes you might mix a little Coca-Cola with that. I think, where do they do that? Is that Spain?\n\nLenny (01:27:46):\nI have not heard of that.\n\nChris Miller (01:27:47):\nOr Argentina. I don't know. It's definitely a country that that's a thing. My wife has been really into really high quality margaritas, made at home, and we're big into Aperol Spritz in the summer, so I would say that that's usually what dominates the happy hour rotation these days.\n\nLenny (01:28:06):\nI just had an Aperol. Is it Aperol? Aperol Spritz, right?\n\nChris Miller (01:28:09):\nYeah. I'm not good at pronunciation. It's probably one of those two.\n\nLenny (01:28:12):\nI just had that for the first time. It's amazing. That's going to be my new go-to.\n\nChris Miller (01:28:16):\nYou had an Aperol Spritz for the first time recently?\n\nLenny (01:28:18):\nYes. I didn't know what that was.\n\nChris Miller (01:28:21):\nThat was like the zeitgeist a couple summers ago and then there, oh man. There's the other one too. The Negroni Sbagliatos are having a moment too. It's like a Negroni with Prosecco. I forget.\n\nLenny (01:28:36):\nOoh, that sounds amazing. There's so much knowledge to be gained in this podcast episode. Chris, this was incredible. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you a question or two. And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChris Miller (01:28:52):\nYou can connect with me on LinkedIn. Shoot me a message. Christopher Miller. There's a lot of Christopher Millers. I'm the one that looks like me, works for HubSpot. I have a Twitter. I don't spend ton of time... X. I have an X account, but I don't spend a lot of time on the app, formerly known as the bird app, but I'm on Instagram @millsyjoeyoung, which is a nod to one of my favorite old monster films, Mighty Joe Young. And so yeah, I'm on Instagram a bunch, too. That's where you can find me.\n\nLenny (01:29:20):\nThen I know two other things that you wanted to share. One is that you advise on PLG and things like that, so maybe talk about that real briefly. And then also you're hiring at HubSpot, or can people know about that?\n\nChris Miller (01:29:31):\nI definitely do a bit of angel investing and advising companies on the side, and I really enjoy it. I think there's something really cool and awesome about getting to see fresh problems all the time and not necessarily being so laser focused on the sort of categories or verticals or target customers that you're dealing with for 40 plus hours a week. And so it's kind of refreshing to spend time with founders who are working on products in different categories and having different challenges at different stages of growth and being able to figure out how I can be a resource to them. And so if you're looking for, if that sounds interesting to you, you're a founder or head of product out there, definitely reach out and maybe opportunities for us to collaborate and maybe that can be a resource.\n\nLenny (01:30:21):\nCool. And then on the hiring front, any specific roles you want people to know about that you might be hiring?\n\nChris Miller (01:30:25):\nThere'll definitely be more roles opening up in the fall, but I think most immediately I'll be looking for a group product manager to work on the AI platform team that I'm leading.\n\nLenny (01:30:35):\nWhat a role.\n\nChris Miller (01:30:37):\nYeah, it's a great role with a fantastic team and a space that might be a little important these days. And so if you go to the HubSpot job site, that role should be there by the time this podcast is live. That role should definitely be up there.\n\nLenny (01:30:50):\nAmazing. Chris, thank you again for being here.\n\nChris Miller (01:30:53):\nLenny, pleasure. Thank you for having me. This has been amazing.\n\nLenny (01:30:56):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:30:59):\nThank you so much for listening.

They were our first user, and they were based in Palo Alto. Dylan and I drove down and demoed the product to them, and they were the first ones. Their designer, Jeremy was like, \"Yes, we'll take this on full time.\" And I remember we were both like, \"What? Really? You will?\" That was the first person who said yes to us. And so, we were so excited. This was a huge milestone. We were just so stoked. And then we got back to the office, and I think Dylan gets a text from Jeremy being like, \"Oh yeah, I tried to share this with Philippe, my engineer, and he can't get the file to open, so I guess we can't use it.\" And we're like, \"What is it? What happened?\" Finally got someone. And I remember Dylan was like, \"Everybody drop everything. We have to fix this.\"\n(00:00:37):\nAnd after some looking at the servers and things, they were like, \"Nothing's wrong.\" And then they realized there's a problem with Philippe's MacBook. And Evan down only had a car, so Dylan had to drive Evan down to Palo Alto to fix the MacBook of Philippe just to get them to use the product.\nLenny (00:00:55):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products.

I'm excited to be here.\nLenny (00:03:56):\nYou've been on my wishlist of guests for a long time, and so I'm really excited to be finally chatting. You were the 10th employee at Figma, which is now worth tens of billions of dollars depending on which valuation you look at, and probably thousands of employees. I don't even know, but many, many. And you joined before the product even launched. And so, I have a million questions I want to ask about how Figma grew and all the things that went into it. I'm curious what it was like to be early days at Figma. Is there a memory that comes to mind that's zany, funny, fun, tangible of just what it was like to work at Figma in the early days?\nClaire Butler (00:04:33):\nYeah, totally. No, that's a good question. We were right downtown on New Montgomery and Minna, and I think the thing that sticks out to me is actually two competing stories that talk about just how much at that time you'd oscillate between these really high-level strategic decisions and then total current work.\n(00:04:50):\nSo my first day at Figma, I come into the office and we're going through some stuff. There's like 10 of us in the office, we're chatting, and I look at some of the plans, some of the things they're working on, and I see that they were actually had some branding and positioning and things that the products, Figma, was going to be named Summit, that was the name. So the company was going to be Figma, and then the product suite, the product design tool was going to be Summit with the idea that eventually we'll have other tools and that could be like mountaintop or I don't know what the rule, they had a whole thing around the different things that could be for the future product set.\n(00:05:27):\nAnd I remember my first day, I had an immediate reaction of like, \" We cannot make this thing Summit. That's not going to work. We can't have two brands. Summit's not ownable, we can't build equity and multiple things. That's just never going to work. We kind of have to just stick with one.\" And I think Figma is ownable and makes sense and we should just go with Figma. So we kind of should probably kill the Summit thing. And Dylan said to me, he was like, \"Oh, that's interesting. How about you make a presentation and present it to everyone tomorrow?\" And so I did that. I was like, \"Oh, okay, I guess this is what I'm doing the rest of the day.\" So I went and made a little presentation about how we couldn't build all this equity in two places and all of the things, and then the next day we decided to kill that name.\n(00:06:05):\nAnd so we went with Figma for the name of the product instead of Summit. And that's how fast things moved, right? And how much you just ran with it and how to ownership. I compare that to the first meetup we had, which was probably just 10 people in the office, honestly. But I remember I was in charge of that, so I had to get all the food and everything there, and I just Instacarted some things and ordered some pizza, but I'd forgotten ice. And so I had to go walk down to the nearest corner store, which was three blocks away or something, and get ice. And I got four bags. And I remember I was walking down the street down probably third street with three bags of ice and it was really heavy. And I remember thinking, \"This is so hard. This is so heavy. I can't carry all this ice.\" And it's just like that's... I did that too probably the next week.\n(00:06:50):\nAnd so, I think it was just this oscillation between like, \"Oh, we're making these high level strategic decisions and someone else has to go by the ice.\" So that's what it was like at Figma in the early days.\nLenny (00:06:59):\nThat's incredible. That's almost a metaphor. Someone's got to go carry the ice.\nClaire Butler (00:07:04):\nAlmost got to the ice for the meetup. Yep.\nLenny (00:07:06):\nThat's so interesting about Summit, I had no idea that was [inaudible 00:07:09]-\nClaire Butler (00:07:09):\nThat wasn't a good name. So if you liked that better, I'm sorry because I killed that.\nLenny (00:07:13):\nWho could like it better now that everyone loves Figma and that's just what it is? Do you think Figma would've been as successful with that name, looking back?\nClaire Butler (00:07:21):\nI think we probably would've changed it later. I think we just saved ourselves some time and without having to change it.\nLenny (00:07:27):\nAnd then how many days or weeks into your tenure was that happening?\nClaire Butler (00:07:32):\nThe name change or...\nLenny (00:07:32):\nYeah.\nClaire Butler (00:07:34):\nThe first day. No, that was literally my first day.\nLenny (00:07:36):\nThe first day.\nClaire Butler (00:07:36):\nNo, no, no. That was my first day and my second day. Not even kidding. My first day, I made the recommendation, the second day, give the presentation and the decision was made.\nLenny (00:07:45):\nWow. I was going to ask you what the most stressful memory of early days Figma was. I'm guessing it's the same story.\nClaire Butler (00:07:50):\nIt's not actually. So I think the most stressful thing, I was thinking about this, was when we launched out of stealth. So I come into Figma, I had lots of experience. I'd been in another startup before that, I launched stuff, but I was still kind of junior. I had done these things, but I didn't have a ton of cycles, and I never ran the whole thing from like, okay, messaging and positioning. This was a forcing function for us to do our messaging and positioning. And I remember there was more than one day where we locked ourselves in a conference room and I made Dylan and show at the time have this positioning up on the big screen and made them agree on it word for word. We'd just never done that before. But then I'd also never run PR press and all of a sudden, I had to run press and PR.\n(00:08:36):\nAnd I think the hardest part there and the most stressful part was I didn't have anyone to talk to. It was just me. And I didn't at the time have enough cycles to have the confidence that the decisions I was making were the right ones. And so it was hard not to second guess myself sometimes in that position. And I think that's some of the hardest times of being at a startup, especially when you're the only marketer, the only go-to-market person is, you don't have anyone to talk to, to like got check stuff with. And so it does take this immense confidence in yourself, but that's stressful when you don't have the cycles. And so that was very stressful for me for sure.\nLenny (00:09:12):\nHow did you overcome that? Did you find people to work with and run ideas by? Did you just do it and figure it out?\nClaire Butler (00:09:19):\nI mean, I had Dylan, but we just did it, right? Especially in those early days. I remember there were a couple of freak out moments where I would try to get our VCs to help us. I remember Greylock was helpful at least over there, but ultimately, they help a lot, but they don't know your business as intimately as you do. So at the end of the day, that's something Dylan's really good at is trusting his intuition and gut. And so, he was helpful on the decision making, but then also you just got to go for it. And I think that that's something that I learned at that time that's helped me throughout the rest of my career is building that confidence or that trust in yourself because it wasn't something that I necessarily immediately had.\nLenny (00:09:55):\nNext question I wanted to get into briefly is, you joined Figma really early, became one of the most successful, loved companies in history. What did you see early on that convinced you that Figma was the company to join and ask? Because a lot of people today are looking for places to join and trying to decide what to do. Clearly, you made a good choice. What did you see?\nClaire Butler (00:10:14):\nSo I had been another startup before Figma, a little bit bigger. I think I joined at Series B and then got through on acquisition. And I had a sense that I wanted to do something early. And I'd already made that decision that I wanted to go early stage. So I'll take that decision making part out. But then from there, I was talking to a couple different companies, and when I went to Figma, there were three areas that stood out the most to me.\n(00:10:36):\nThe first was, it logically made sense. And I know maybe that sounds basic, but I was talking to just a drone company or a SaaS tech, like ad tech company, and I just didn't get it, honestly, it didn't intuitively make sense to me or I didn't understand the technology or something. But at Figma, the basic premise immediately logically clicked for me like, \"Oh yeah, I use Google Docs, I use Asana, I use all these online tools. That's so weird. That design's not online. Why isn't it?\"\n(00:11:06):\nAnd as a marketer, I'd worked with designers and sent feedback and emails, and that's really inefficient. And it made a ton of sense to me that yes, that should be online and collaborative. So that was the first thing that I was like check the box. And the next one was, I knew people who believed in it. So I got introduced to Dylan via Index. They were an investor at the last company I was at, and Danny Rimer specifically. And my old boss, Greg Smearon, who was an EIR there. And I trusted them a lot and they invested in it. I also met John Lilly. I didn't know who he was. I had to Google him, but he seemed really smart. And when they Googled in, he was very impressive, and he believed in it. So that was great.\n(00:11:43):\nAnd then I think the third thing was, I remember when I was trying to decide, Dylan really didn't take no for answer. He's very persuasive. And I remember he'd calling me and text me and then I'd have all these concerns or things and he would just pick them apart one by one of reasons why they weren't real concerns or things to get over them. And so I think that that was the third thing is, that's just who he was and that's how he is with everything. And so, if that's how with me, that's how he is with any obstacle that he has. And so, when I looked at that, I was just like, \"All right, let's give this a go.\" And I didn't know. I didn't know. I had no idea it would be as big as it is today. So some of it was luck too, for sure. But those are the three things of how I made my decision.\nLenny (00:12:24):\nSo what I took away there is, one, you just believe in idea, obviously. Make sure you actually think this could be really big, two is some social proof people you trust really believe in it. In this case, it was really smart investors, they knew. And then the third is, it sounds like you were also just impressed with Dylan.\nClaire Butler (00:12:40):\nYeah, totally. I believed in him.\nLenny (00:12:42):\nSo you joined Figma before it even launched, it was still in stealth. You joined as the first go-to-market hire. You helped launch Figma, you continue to lead go-to market at Figma. And so this is a good segue to where I want to spend most of our conversation. I essentially want to try to unpack what worked to build Figma into the business that it is today from beginning to even now. You're also there for eight years. So you saw a lot of what worked and didn't work. And so let's start with the beginnings of Figma and the go-to-market motion that you developed and how you actually implemented it. So maybe to start, if you could just talk about just what is a bottom up go-to-market motion? And then you also shared somewhere that Figma has a very unique bottom-up go-to-market motion. So maybe just those two areas, just broadly, what is bottom-up go- to-market motion, and then two, what is unique about Figma's approach?\nClaire Butler (00:13:33):\nI've reflected back to get to some of these answers. I think in the moment, so much of what we were doing was influenced by gut, by trying to connect with people, listening to them. But when I look back is when I'm like, \"Oh, this is a repeatable motion.\" So when I look back at it, I would say that if I were to define and think about how I define our go-to-market motion, and we've said it, we've called it a lot of things over time. We called it product-led, we called it community-led. The way I think about it now is this bottoms-up motion, that really is focused on ICs. So it's all focused on like, \"Okay, so you have this core audience.\" For us it was designers and they're largely individual contributors, so they're people who are practitioners who are using your tool. For us, it's like eight hours a day.\n(00:14:17):\nIf you're a designer, you're in it all the time. And they love you, and you build this relationship with them within the product, but it's beyond the product, right? It's also believing what the product can be in the company and the brand. And they love you so much that they're willing to put their social capital and themselves in the line and spread the product throughout whatever their communities are. And the one that's connected the most to revenue is companies.\n(00:14:45):\nAnd so that's where the revenue model really clicks in is you have all these individual contributors who love you, but then they also work at these big companies and these big orgs, and they become these internal champions who spearhead adoption within their organizations and eventually turn into large amounts of revenue. And I think of that as our bottoms-up motion. And that's different from tops-down. And a lot of SaaS is tops-down where you go straight to a VP or an executive buyer, they then agree to buying a tool and then that goes down to their organization. I think with technical tools especially, this becomes really important. The practitioners have to love it. And also, sometimes I wondered as an executive care, you know what I mean, what tools people are using?\n(00:15:27):\nAnd so for Figma, what that looks like and why this is so efficient of a go-to-market motion for us is, we actually didn't have a sales team for the first three years. So all of our revenue, it was paid, but it was all self-serve. And so we'd work with these. We weren't worried about things. I mean, you cared about security, but all of the org features that people need and want when you're working with procurement, we were just focused on technical features for users mostly. And then the individual contributor or maybe the manager would just put them on their credit card. That was the way that things grew. And so there was no sales team for a long time. We did have one eventually, and I'll talk about what that looked like.\n(00:16:04):\nBut then the second thing was, once we did have a sales team, and even up until now, so much of our revenue and our sales and our MQLs, our marketing qualified leads come from our free tier. So it's people, they're using it, maybe they use it for free. We have a very robust free tier. Maybe they use it for pro, which is on your credit card. And then once it's widespread and they've gained the confidence, then they're ready to bring in sales work with procurement. And they actually come to us and they're like, \"Hey, I work at this company. I really want to get my whole company to use it, but security's not letting me. Can you help me unblock it with them?\"\n(00:16:39):\nWe didn't spend that much money, any money really programmatically on paid or programmatic marketing because all of our leads for sales would come in through a form on our website, which was current users either free or pro wanting to upgrade. And at that point, it's a very different sales conversation to unblock someone or to just help them implement Figma when they've already have an internal champion who's bought in, and they're really the one leading and driving the sale within their organization. So I think that that's made us really efficient as like this is a really efficient model and has really powered so much of our growth over time.\nLenny (00:17:14):\nSomebody listening to this that has a saying, B2B SaaS companies like, \"Oh, okay, I just need to get people to love my product and it's going to be great.\" And so I want to unpack that just like what you did because it wasn't obviously an accident that people loved Figma. But before we get there, you talked about that there's a unique approach to the way you did bottom up. What do you see as what the typical bottom-up go-to-market motion is that other companies try to play that you think Figma did differently? Is it this obsession with ICs on teams or is there some other element of it?\nClaire Butler (00:17:43):\nI think there are other people who do bottoms-up and who do it well. I think for us it's unique because the individual contributor spends so much time in the tool, and it's so important to them. I think about things that we focus on where it might take one click off of someone's workflow, and that seems like a really small update. You have to click one time instead of twice to do something.\n(00:18:06):\nWhen you're a designer and you're in a tool eight hours a day, saving that one click is huge. And so I think the obsession with quality and with craft within the editor for us, for Figma, is maybe the difference. And I think about other go-to-market tools that maybe focus so much on the collaboration side or the product-led of the expansion. And that is a huge part segue, don't get me wrong, but the tool itself, the editor, that's where it all starts and that's what these people love. And then the collaboration is like, yes, it's the thing that's like our differentiator, but it's actually like you stay for the collaboration. You don't want to talk about it or learn about it. Nobody wants talk about collaboration. You just want it to work, right? You care about the tool and that the tool's working well. And so I think that maybe that's the difference is the obsession with the tool itself.\nLenny (00:18:52):\nAwesome. Yeah, something I learned recently is that multiplayer wasn't even a part of Figma at launch, [inaudible 00:18:56] a year later.\nClaire Butler (00:18:58):\nI know. We can talk about that, and we want to know making a decision of when to go to self because we almost didn't because it didn't have multiplayer.\nLenny (00:19:04):\nOh yeah, let's talk about that.\nClaire Butler (00:19:05):\nYeah, that was a poor differentiator and we can't not have it, but then we did anyway.\nLenny (00:19:10):\nYeah, let's take a tangent there actually. Just that decision to go from stealth. So Figma was in stealth three years or four years before [inaudible 00:19:17] idea.\nClaire Butler (00:19:17):\nGosh, three, I guess. I think is 2012 that they started, and then we launched in at the end of 2015. So between around there, yeah, around three or four.\nLenny (00:19:27):\nCool. And then you joined right before they launched. We're going to come back to what we were talking about, but just what did you see about that decision of now's the time to launch?\nClaire Butler (00:19:34):\nYeah, I think it was a couple things. So I think the first thing is that the team had been building quietly by themselves in isolation for three years. And that's hard. I think that that was a very real part of the decision to get out of stealth was that people had been building for such a long time. We needed momentum. We needed to have a milestone that we were working towards. We could have just kept building it quiet for a long time more, but it was very demotivating. So that was a very big part of this. So there was a desire holistically to get out of stealth. But we didn't want to do it until we knew it'd at least be successful. But that was a key thing for me. I was working on that messaging, positioning that I was telling you, like we would have this.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]I still have the doc actually where I was like, projected on the screen and Dylan and Sean and I picked apart every word of it and sharing with a link and multiplayer is the biggest thing. That's the core differentiator. It's really funny. I remember Ivan from Notion's early days, he stopped by and was chatting, and he's like, \"Wait, you can't launch with that multiplayer.\" And I was like, \"I know.\" So I was like, everybody was like, that was the core thing.\n(00:20:36):\nBut the idea was that we wanted to get out of stealth. We talked to Evan, our CTO, and knew it would take about another year for him to build it. And for me it was like, \"Well, is there enough here to get people excited to start and to get users, get more feedback?\" Because Evan was kind of building multiplayer. I don't know enough about the engineering if he was doing it on his own or not, but he was the key person doing it. But there are a lot of other things too that were being built or could be built through that year. And we wanted to get more feedback from people and to start really get started.\n(00:21:05):\nAnd so to me, the things that I wanted to see before just deciding like, \"Okay, so we don't have our key feature. Can we still launch, or is there enough fear for people to get excited?\" At least my first three months, especially before we get going for the launch with the product, and probably even after that, I would just go around with Dylan and pilot or demo Figma to companies. That was a lot of what we did. So we'd go to these companies and we'd show them Figma and we'd get their feedback, and I would be driving around in Palo Alto, around the city doing that with Dylan. And sometimes people didn't care. They were just like, \"What is this? I don't want to design online,\" things like that.\n(00:21:47):\nBut what we wanted to see, what I wanted to see was that designers were excited when they saw the tool. And once we got enough features, and I saw this pretty quickly actually when I joined Figma, is that the people that we showed it to were really interested in it and cared about it. And I remember after Vector Networks came out, after some of our other core features, there were enough things where people, I remember, they would take the laptop out of Dylan's hands when he would start showing it because they wanted to play with it. And to me, when I started seeing designers do that, even if I wasn't sure if they'd use it as a team, even if I wasn't sure if they'd buy it, we weren't selling it yet. They wanted to try it and they were excited about it.\n(00:22:28):\nAnd that kind of emotion, no reaction of wanting to play with it in these demos was really what gave me confidence that we were ready to launch. And we had a couple teams, small numbers, and happened to talk about metrics and how hard it is to deal with metrics of this size, but very small numbers. But we had teams who were using it full-time. So we knew that some people were using it full-time and people who weren't were really excited to try and were very impressed with the technical feat of it all and interested. And to me that was enough confidence that like, \"Okay, it's worth it. Let's get out of stealth.\"\nLenny (00:23:02):\nThat story of the-\nPART 1 OF 4 ENDS [00:23:04]\nClaire Butler (00:23:00):\n... let's get out of stealth.\nLenny (00:23:02):\nThat story of the potential customer pulling the laptop from Dylan is such a good metaphor for product market fit, which people describe as you feel pull. Someone's literally pulling it from your hands. You talked about metrics that you maybe could share. What could you share there?\nClaire Butler (00:23:19):\nAt these early days, especially with bottoms-up and with all these things... And people ask me all the time, \"How do you measure things in an early stage situation?\" And I maybe have a controversial point of view here. I don't think you can, from a metrics side. Your numbers are so small. One of the quotes I always like to say, and I say this now too, when we're doing stuff, because we're launching new products [inaudible 00:23:40] and it comes up a lot, is you can't optimize your way to product market fit. I don't care at the early stages if something's optimized by 5% from an email.\n(00:23:50):\nThat doesn't fundamentally tell me if something's working or not, so I think metrics are really hard and signal is actually way more important. Can you get a couple people who love it, not a slight improvement of a conversion of a landing page. And so I think that metrics are really hard in that way. They can help you, but when the numbers are so small, you have to, again, trust yourself a lot more and have more intuition, but then also find more signal of the things that are working, whether it's anecdotal, talking to people, examples, and that becomes much more useful than hard metrics are sometimes.\nLenny (00:24:26):\nI'm working on a post around product market fit and a step-by-step somewhat of our guide to help people down this path. The way you described it is the way I'm thinking about it, is step one, get one company to use your product.\nClaire Butler (00:24:37):\nYes.\nLenny (00:24:38):\nStep two-\nClaire Butler (00:24:38):\nWhat do they want? That was step one, and then that's not easy. That's not easy.\nLenny (00:24:42):\nRight. And then it's like, get them to continue using your product.\nClaire Butler (00:24:42):\nYes.\nLenny (00:24:46):\nAnd then it's get two companies to use your product.\nClaire Butler (00:24:46):\nYes, exactly.\nLenny (00:24:49):\nAnd then get someone to pay for your product. Yeah, so there's all these major milestones. Along those same lines, I saw an interview with Dylan talking about product market fit, and he had this interesting quote about how he realized first that they had product market fit a year later, which is when Microsoft, I think, was like, \"Take our money. We want to pay for Figma.\" And he's like, \"Okay, maybe this is going to work.\" Does that sound about right?\nClaire Butler (00:25:11):\nWell, it's interesting, and that goes up to the bottoms-up model that we could talk about. I think the difference, if you think about a company like Microsoft and what this looks like, this is just a really good example of this bottoms-up motion in market. Here's a funny story that I want to add. Our first meeting with Microsoft actually came, and this is the scrappiness of working in an early stage startup, because I slid into the DMs of my friend's ex-boyfriend. That's how we got our first meeting with Microsoft.\nLenny (00:25:41):\nWell done.\nClaire Butler (00:25:41):\nI know, I know. I saw that they had signed up for Figma, and I was like, \"Wait a minute. I think I know this person.\" And that's how we chatted with them and first got feedback from them, so that's just a funny anecdote.\nLenny (00:25:53):\nThis could be a new strategy if everyone's going to try to-\nClaire Butler (00:25:55):\nYou literally do whatever. Uber driver, shared Lyfts, we can talk more about that. But yeah, you got to do whatever you can to get early people to try your product out and get really scrappy. But for Microsoft, over time, we would have, I think it was... What was the team that got acquired that we went into Microsoft? I'll have to remember the name, but it was a small team within Microsoft and they were... Xamarin, it was Xamarin. They were to ones who were using Figma first, and we saw that, so they were that patient zero at Microsoft. And then we had, slowly over time, more pockets within Microsoft using the tool.\n(00:26:28):\nBut again, we've never gone through Microsoft procurement, Microsoft security. It just started popping up throughout the organization. And we have these really cool Node graphs that show this too, where you'd have these little pockets of people and then it would jump to another, like they'd have one more collaborator and then jump from another pocket. There were these really cool maps of how that spread within the organization. And eventually, we got to the point where that was a very comprehensive Node graph that had this massive thing of all of these people from Microsoft using the product.\n(00:26:55):\nBut still, it was only on credit cards. I don't think we even had an enterprise product at this point, and so there was no salesperson for them to talk to. And Microsoft was like, \"Wait a minute. We need to organize this. We need security. We need account management. We need procurement involved.\" And I think that that's what it was. They wanted to pay for it and they wanted us to have this enterprise product, because they had these requirements and they wanted to have a better control over it, because it was just popping up within the organization without their control. And so that's probably a good example of what that looked like as this bottoms in motion just spread to a really large organization.\nLenny (00:27:34):\nThis Node graph thing, is that a tool you built that's showing, helping you visualize within a company how it's all clustering? Or what is that?\nClaire Butler (00:27:41):\nWell, our data science team built it. I don't know if it's like... Yes, I'm sure it's an internal tool. I just remember there was a website in Node or something that we would use, and you could type it in an organization's name. You still could do this. It's within our data analytics system. You type in the name of an organization and it just pulls up everybody. And it shows, because Figma spreads through new users, but also gen one, gen two, these people invite people. And you can see these Node graphs of how somebody started Figma, maybe at the center, and then they invited someone else, and then it shows how that spread.\n(00:28:16):\nAnd so you get these clusters, and you can see the clusters are teams, but then you can see someone invited someone in a different org to a file and then that started a new center of a cluster. They're really interesting. And you can pull up, you can type in any org, any org at Figma and see what that Node graph looks like. But they're super interesting to see how those spread.\nLenny (00:28:37):\nThat is super cool. And I imagine that also informs how you go to market by figuring out who spreads to who and who's often [inaudible 00:28:45].\nClaire Butler (00:28:44):\nTotally, and that's when these internal champions, that's what the key is. And that's maybe the takeaway of how important these internal champions are, because you just need someone to land there and then them maybe passing it up. You could hover over and see this person's at the center of this Node graph and all of these people that spread from this one person at the company. And that, I think, was the unlock to be like, \"Oh yeah, these internal champions, they're really the key to all of this.\"\nLenny (00:29:12):\nI remember it spreading at Airbnb early on. I think Airbnb was one of the early customers and it was just one designer, a few designers starting to spread to the product managers. I was just a member on the team being like, \"Goddamn it, we just switched to Sketch. Are we going to switch again to a new product?\"\nClaire Butler (00:29:25):\nThat was the hardest thing to feel like I don't want to switch twice. That was definitely something we had to get over.\nLenny (00:29:29):\nBut it happened for good reasons. Okay, one last thing that you mentioned that I wanted to follow up on. You said something about shared Lyfts, and maybe that's a funny story of some sort.\nClaire Butler (00:29:38):\nOh, I don't know specifically. Actually, Dylan specifically is such a hustler, especially in those early days. And he would just, really anyone that he would meet, he would talk about Figma with them. I don't remember who it was, but there was definitely a situation where he met someone in a Lyft and then they became one of our users. He used every angle he could to try to get introduced to new designers, especially in his pre-launch days where we didn't have as many connections to just get people to try it out and get more feedback.\nLenny (00:30:06):\nOkay, cool. Let's get back on track. We were talking about the go-to-market motion that you executed and modeled at Figma. There's two steps, right? Step one is get ICs to love you, and then step two is help it spread from that person, right?\nClaire Butler (00:30:21):\nYep, yep.\nLenny (00:30:23):\nOkay, cool. So, let's start with step one.\nClaire Butler (00:30:25):\nOkay, cool.\nLenny (00:30:25):\nLike I said, obviously, it'd be awesome if somebody loved your product at a company. What did you actually do to make that happen in the early days?\nClaire Butler (00:30:31):\nYeah. It's really interesting when you think about the early days too, because you're like, \"All right. We don't exist.\" How do you get them to love you when literally, they've never heard of you before? Also, like you were saying, in your situation, \"Oh, I used Sketch. I was maybe in Photoshop before that, something else. I just made the switch over to this new tool. We finally got it working. I really don't want to move tools again.\" You have that inherent thing against it there. Especially I thought about this, and I think there are four main areas that we focused on to make this start, to get it going, and then we kind of still do this stuff today.\n(00:31:05):\nThe first thing is all about credibility. I think in the early days especially, credibility is so important in establishing that initial credibility, again, especially with a technical audience like designers. The second is actually building the product with your users. And I know you had Sho on your podcast and he talked a lot about this too, just the customer obsession that we have the care of, especially that editor tool.\n(00:31:28):\nThe third is finding a place where you can, in a way, that you can build this relationship over time. Maybe that's specifically through a channel where they don't have to come to you, because they don't really care about you yet and they're probably not going to convert right away or start using you right away, so how do you get them to stick with you over time? So, find out the channel where you can do that and then continue to build that relationship with them. And then the four is just being extremely transparent and honest to build that relationship with people. I know those all sound really fuzzy, so maybe we can go into them specifically.\nLenny (00:31:28):\nAbsolutely. I was going to ask.\nClaire Butler (00:32:04):\nBecause they sound really fuzzy when you talk about them. A lot of this stuff is hard like that, where you're like, \"Oh, that just sounds like buzzwords.\" I can give you some examples of these four things, so maybe it helps to give some color to it.\nLenny (00:32:13):\nGreat.\nClaire Butler (00:32:14):\nLet's start with the first one, credibility. Okay. I was the first marketer at Figma. I think one of the things I learned right away, very quickly was that designers don't want to hear from marketers. They don't want to be marketed to and they have an extremely high bullshit meter. You use a word like efficiency, collaboration, all of those buzzwords, and they're just like, \"I don't want to hear this.\" Traditional product marketing kind of stuff just doesn't work. They wanted to hear technical features. They wanted to understand how technical features work. They want to hear, \"How am I going to use this?\" And then they'll see the benefits, but they don't want to hear from marketers and they don't want to be marketed to.\n(00:32:55):\nAnd so I think especially with our audience in the early days, one of the things that I did was really try to not market. And that's so funny as a marketer to say that, but that was really core to build authenticity with people. And so the way that we did that in the early days was what we had was the tool, and that's pretty much what we had, and we had a design team and we had an engineering team. We did some cool stuff in the tool. First of all, the tool itself was a technical feat. It was the first time it used video game technology, WebGL. Evan's a prodigy. The fact that he got a design tool to work on the internet was just amazing, and so there was a lot of engineering interest there, credibility building of, \"How did you get this to work?\"\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]I got him to make technical content and that, I think, went to number one on Hacker News, that people were just interested in him. And then we had a design team, and our design team was our target audience. And so we talked a lot about how we chose to build features, all the things that went into it. And so many of the primitives of design tools have been like that forever, and so we changed the stuff. One of them would be how we did grids or how we did vector networks, and we'd go into these really deep details of how we chose to make those product decisions, all the craft decisions that went into it.\n(00:34:08):\nI remember one of my bars were deciding if something would hit this or not, if they would be interested was, \"Did I understand it?\" You know what I mean? And if I understood it, it was probably too basic, or if I could have written it myself, it was probably too basic. I remember we did one on grids in the early days, and we went really deep on Joseph Muller Brockmann and his influence on grids. And now, I very much know who Joseph Muller Brockmann is because I work with designers, but at the time, I had to Google it. I was like, \"Who is this?\" But that was one of my bars for if something would be good enough for our technical content, was if I could have written it, it's not good enough. And so that was key for us in building credibility, because we had this design team.\n(00:34:47):\nAnd then when six months after we launched, I actually got to hire someone to do marketing with me, the first person I hired was actually a designer advocate. So it was not a marketer, it was someone who was a designer. The designers and the engineers that I was trying to get to help me with stuff also had to design and build the product, so they didn't have a ton of time. But this designer advocate was working full-time with me on this stuff, and he came from our user base. He was one of the very few people in the early days who just loved the product and was very passionate about it. And that became his full-time job was to represent, to meet with users, talk to them, to write content and create content, and to bring that back to the product, and that was what he did.\n(00:35:32):\nAnd that designer advocacy positions actually scaled with Figma, and we still have it today. It's extreme. I think it's the magic dust, we call it, that we sprinkle on go-to-market to make a lot of our go-to-market function work. But yeah, we didn't focus on marketing, or traditional marketing. We're very focused on the technical aspects.\nLenny (00:35:50):\nThere's so many little lessons there. The designer advocate hire reminds me of something that Datadog did, where they hired engineers to write their blog posts.\nClaire Butler (00:35:59):\nThat's a great idea. Yes, exactly what we did. Yes.\nLenny (00:36:03):\nSo, ways you build credibility, just kind of mirroring back what you just shared, one is writing content. Basically, putting out blog posts that designers would be like, \"Oh, wow. This is really interesting,\" and start to feel like, \"Oh, Figma keeps coming up in these really interesting pieces of content.\"\nClaire Butler (00:36:15):\nYeah, even if they were using it, and I think that that was important. When we launched, people wanted to test it because it was cool and see what it is, but then they bounced. They're like, \"All right. This isn't advanced enough. I'll come back later.\" Which is why we're give them reasons to come back, being like, \"Oh, yeah, but the pen tools always worked like this, but we did it like that. You should test that out.\" And so we kept giving them these nuggets of reasons to come back in. Remember, this was also before multiplayer, and so we couldn't collaborate, so it was use the tools to do these things. That really helps people come back into the tool and spend a little bit more time in it.\nLenny (00:36:49):\nHow many posts would you say you put out in that first six months, just to give people a sense of here's how much? It's probably not a ton, right? It's probably some few really good ones.\nClaire Butler (00:36:57):\nThey took a long time. Also, I had to work with an engineer or a designer to do every single one. Maybe 10 at most. But those ones that went out, we tried to get on Hacker News. We tried to get on Designer News at the time. Twitter, we can jump into that, but it was also extremely big for us. And so it was more about quality than it was about quantity.\nLenny (00:37:19):\nAwesome. Okay, so one is put out great content. People are like, \"Oh, wow. Figma's got some new ideas and maybe I should pay attention.\" The other is having someone that's that function actually talk to them.\nClaire Butler (00:37:28):\nYes. That was when we started accelerating this much, much more is when we brought in that designer advocate to help us with this full-time.\nLenny (00:37:35):\nCool. Okay. Let's move to the next one, which I think is building with your customers.\nClaire Butler (00:37:39):\nThat one, I know you talked to Show, he talked a lot about this, this idea of customer obsession and of building with your customers. And it also goes back to that whole decision that we talked about earlier, about when to come out of stealth. You can only build so much with your customers when you're in stealth, because you don't have that many that know about you. But especially, even in the early days when we only had a couple people, we really did listen. And back to also what you were saying earlier about those steps to product market fit, get one person to use it. That's really what we were focused on, especially in the very, very early days.\n(00:38:10):\nI remember the first one, I think I've told this story before, but was that we had Coda. They were our first user and they were based in Palo Alto. Dylan and I drove down and demoed the product to them, and they were the first ones. Their designer, Jeremy, was like, \"Yes, we'll take this on full-time.\" And I remember, we were both like, \"What? Really? You will?\" That was the first person who said yes to us, and so we were so excited. This was a huge milestone. We went to Oren's Hummus in Palo Alto on the way back to the office to bring some back for the team to celebrate. We were just so stoked.\n(00:38:41):\nAnd then we got back to the office, and I think Dylan gets a text from Jeremy being like, \"Oh, yeah. I tried to share this with Philippe, my engineer, and he can't get the file to open, so I guess he can't use it.\" And we're like, \"What is it? What happened? We finally got someone.\" And I remember Dylan was like, \"Everybody drop everything. We have to fix this.\" And after some looking at the servers and things, they were like, \"Nothing's wrong,\" and then they realized it was a problem with Philippe's MacBook. Evan [inaudible 00:39:08] had a car, so Dylan had to drive Evan down to Palo Alto to fix the MacBook of Philippe just to get them to use the product. So anyway, get them to stick around. That's the first one.\n(00:39:17):\nBut the building with people, the way that we did that was largely through just each person. We really cared and listened to their feedback, especially when there were only a few people. One way we did that was, I remember we implemented Intercom back in the early days, and there were so few users and so few of us that everybody was on Intercom all day too. And so we'd get a chat and I would jump in sometimes. Dylan would jump in, an engineer would jump in. And he'd open up a chat with people and they'd actually debug the product with us live. They'd be like, \"I have this bug,\" and this engineer would be like, \"Let me QA it right now.\" And so that was one example. We all did support back in that day, and the engineers would talk to users directly, get their feedback, and then go immediately fix things like bugs.\n(00:40:02):\nAnd so those are just examples of in the early days, what that looks like, and that just scales a lot over time as you're growing and you're talking to more people. That advocate ended up helping us a ton when they came on board, because some of this stuff, I mean, none of this stuff scales. Your engineers can't do support forever. In the early days, that becomes really important. But when we brought that advocate in, their whole job was talking to users, getting them to try to use the product, but then taking their feedback back when it wasn't something that wasn't working.\n(00:40:34):\nThat helped us scale a lot, so that became really essential, and then telling people, \"Oh, we fixed this.\" It made them feel more ownership of the tool too, being like, \"Oh, yeah. I asked them to do this. They did it.\" That's just another way where you just build a strong relationship with people, because they feel very invested in your journey with you.\nLenny (00:40:54):\nWhich goes back to building credibility.\nClaire Butler (00:40:55):\nAbsolutely, absolutely.\nLenny (00:40:57):\nThere's so many important lessons there. You talked about scaling this, but interestingly, this is very much doing things that don't scale; driving to their office, fixing their wifi on their laptop.\nClaire Butler (00:41:08):\nEarly days, nothing scales in the early days. You just have to do it anyway.\nLenny (00:41:10):\nJust as a tangent, we're talking about getting people to love your product initially. Why is love so important? That's a really high bar, and I imagine you have an interesting insight on just why it needs to be that level of appreciation.\nClaire Butler (00:41:23):\nYeah, and it doesn't have to be over time. These are all things that maybe they just use it first or they're interested, but by the time you're getting to the organization level, or I'm spreading this to my other spheres of influence, like my community, people I know, you're kind of putting yourself on the line. You're taking a risk when you're doing that, especially if it's your job. You're bringing other people in, and you're not going to do that unless you really believe in something. And so just using it isn't enough to get someone over that stage of going from just a user to a champion. And so I think it is this love thing becomes important, because you just don't get the scalability and spread of someone doing this for you unless they have that level of passion.\nLenny (00:42:09):\nThat's an awesome lesson. I hope people are taking that in. You shared this story of Coda and Sho. Actually, he wasn't on a podcast. He wrote a newsletter and he shared all this stuff.\nClaire Butler (00:42:18):\nI read it. Yes, yes, yes.\nLenny (00:42:19):\nYeah. People often confuse the two. They assume it's kind of the same thing. But he talked about how when he joined Figma, this happened. Dylan's like, \"We need to fix this problem.\" He's like, \"They're not even paying us. Who is this? We have real things to build. Why do we have to hop on this bug?\" And then later, he realized why that was so important, and that was a big lesson he learned from Dylan of just this needs to be taken really seriously. If someone's trying to use your product, help them actually be successful.\nClaire Butler (00:42:45):\nAnd we didn't have very many of them, but it's like, yeah, back to what you were saying earlier, how do you get one person to actually use it? And so we very much cared that that one person stuck with it and didn't bounce.\nLenny (00:42:55):\nToday's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI-powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale.

Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no-code playground. That's assemblyai. com/lenny.\n(00:44:02):\nSo, coming back to this go-to-market model that we're talking about, we're still talking about get ICs at a company to love you. Step one was build credibility. Step two, I don't know if these are steps or just things you do in some sequence or not, step two is build with your users. What come next?\nClaire Butler (00:44:20):\nOh, the next one is, this can take time. I think that's a big one. And also in the early days, they're not going to necessarily use you right away, and so it might take time. And then also, when you do get a couple of people who start to use your product, they're going to also start wondering what other people think about your product. And when you're the only marketing hire, and this is something marketers ask me a lot when they're the only marketer in an organization is, \"How do you focus and prioritize, because there's so many things you could do? How do you decide what to do?\" And so the thing that I think about a lot in this early phase, in thinking about ICs is, \"How do you get to them, and where can you go where they already are as opposed to making them come to you?\"\n(00:45:00):\nBecause I'm a firm believer, I think now, we have spaces where people can come to us, but in the early days especially, they're not going to come to your space. They don't know you. They don't care about you. They don't want to go to your Slack channel or something. You have to go to them. And so for us, Dylan really identified immediately that Twitter was the place where that existed, and that had nothing to do with us specifically. The design community existed on Twitter way before we did, and that's something that they just did on their own and that grew over time. They had this large network on Twitter of influencers, and that's also how people learned about things.\n(00:45:38):\nAlso, design's changing all the time, and so people would share best practices, things that they were doing, resources, and that just became kind of a home for designers. So, we really went all in on Twitter. That really became a key, our channel that we focused on, and really only focused on one. That was it, and we got pretty advanced on how we did this. Dylan is also a great engineer, if you don't know that about him, or a scrappy engineer who-\nPART 2 OF 4 ENDS [00:46:04]\nClaire Butler (00:46:00):\nA great engineer if you don't know that about him, or a scrappy engineer who could figure things out. And he had this idea and he built this tool or this scraper where he identified a couple influencers in the design community. People he thought were people he wanted to learn from and to talk to. And he inputted them into this scraper thing that he made. And then back to this, another node graph, he figured out who followed them and who followed those people and also the influence that these people had over other people, and made this massive node graph of these pockets of different topics of design. And when he looked at it, you'd see a cluster. So you'd have the cluster of iconographers, graphic designers, product managers, and you'd see them all there and you'd see who the influencers were in those areas. And what we did is we found who were most influential to start.\n(00:46:51):\nAnd that was another source, back to using whatever you can to get people to try your products. That's who we asked for feedback in the early days too. Just DMed them. We were like, hey, Raji, we'd love feedback, your feedback on Figma. And that was one of the ways we got to people, but that's also people who we followed, people who we tried to build this connection with on Twitter in the early days. And that's also where we pushed out that technical content that I was talking about. And then we tried to just drive and spur a conversation about these things. First it was our launches, but then later it was this technical content or whatever it was that we were producing so that we could go to people instead of making them come to us just in their feed. And that became super important to us. We'd also interact with people. So Dylan has a huge presence, and especially in the early days and now even has a huge presence talking to users, we all did show too our engineering team. And so it wasn't just the brand handle, it was the people. And I think that that's really important to put a personal face behind things, connect with people, answer questions for people, live there. And over time, we just built this very engaged group of people on Twitter with Figma. And that's still a huge place for us where the design community lives and where we get a lot from our users too. And I think the focus on that, and I think why it's so important is it allows people to passively follow you over time without having to invest in you, within the tool. So it was our way, especially because we knew it would take a while to build a product and get to a place for people to switch full time for them to follow along with us and build that confidence with us over time and keep coming back to the tool.\nLenny (00:48:24):\nThat Twitter graph story is so legendary. I think Dylan even shared the code online. I'm going to try to find that tweet.\nClaire Butler (00:48:30):\nYeah, it's so good. We still use it. We used it again when we were launching another product, we were like, oh, can we go pull that Twitter graph for another audience? I don't know if we ended up using, how much we ended up using it, but I definitely looked at it and I was like, oh, this is so interesting to see for developers or whatever it was that we were looking at.\nLenny (00:48:46):\nAnd also what you just mentioned is really interesting that he wasn't using it to go sell people on the product. It was first get feedback on the product, which ends up selling them.\nClaire Butler (00:48:54):\nOh no, we never heard sold the product. It was always about feedback. And I think that that's so key to all of this is all about feedback.\nLenny (00:49:02):\nAwesome. There's so many lessons here. There's a fourth bullet I think, around building relationships with users.\nClaire Butler (00:49:08):\nOh, just transparency and authenticity. So I think that that really comes into when you get to the scale part, I'm talking about early days, being transparent with your users, and a lot of that does come down to the stuff we talked about too, about downtime, about what that looks like. And we just did that naturally with people one-on-one in those early days. But I think where it gets harder, and we stuck with it because it's in our DNA and how we act, is when you get to scale and you have to still do that stuff with a lot of people who care and who do these things with you. But I think it's just so important that you are honest and also you don't hide behind the brand. That you're human and authentic and transparent with people. And we can pull up the examples. I think the better examples are probably at scale than even in the early days because that's when it gets harder to do that.\nLenny (00:49:52):\nSo let's chat about that. Just... So this is about getting started.\nClaire Butler (00:49:56):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:49:57):\nHow do you do this at scale? Or does it change completely? Do you continue doing this in a different way? How do you approach it as the company grows?\nClaire Butler (00:50:02):\nYou just totally still do it, right? I think that that's just so important, that's how it stays, right? In the early days you do this stuff and you kind of get the flywheel going. You get these people, you have these people who love you, but today that's still how Figma spreads the most, right? We're going into new markets, we're going into new places, we're launching a new tool, and that becomes so important to how we still drive adoption. And so some of those things, the tactics, look a little bit different, but the themes are still the same and what that looks like at scale. A couple of just examples of that are those advocates, right? That's I think a huge one. When I was a marketer that advocate was just my partner. He gut-checked everything that I did. He'd be like, no, that's too thirsty here.\n(00:50:46):\nYou're using a fluff word again. You know what I mean? Also, he was how we pitched the company. He was the people we talked to, he'd go to lunch at Etsy or whatever and just get feedback on things. And that function has really grown with Figma. So now that's a whole team at Figma, it's a large team and it's scaled with us with every product that we launch. So now we have developer advocates, FigJam advocates, and regionally. So we go into a new region and they're part of the landing team. We're in Japan, we need to find the Japan, now we have two of them, it's the Japan designer advocate because it's just so core to how we do things and we've scaled that. So I think on the credibility side, I think that those advocates and scaling those advocates are the magic dust that, I always call them the magic dust, that make sure that we are able to build those relationships and stay authentic around everything we do.\nLenny (00:51:40):\nAnd these advocates, again, they're just, their background is designer, and then they end up being an advocate designer?\nClaire Butler (00:51:45):\nIt's now developer, FigJam person. But they're passionate that... Their profile is, they're passionate users who oftentimes they find us more than we find them, right? You couldn't just post this job online and go source for it. It's like this will emerge from the community and then they love it so much and they know the product so well. They're technical experts. But yes, they were, for the designer ones, they were all previously product designers.\nLenny (00:52:10):\nAwesome. Is there anything else you want to share around at scale, how these things change? You mentioned transparency ends up being really important. What else there do you think is really important?\nClaire Butler (00:52:18):\nI think there's two examples. The one is building with users. Because I think this is a good one that I like to get into because you're like, how do you scale that? You get so many bug requests, you go to our feature request page on our forum, and it's just so many. But also as you're building product, you're always like, oh, well I could go do all of these fixes and bug updates, but I also have to go build new stuff to grow. And that's always a tension with any company as you're looking at a roadmap. One of the ways that we've done that and still continue to focus on things that people care about that's so related to the craft of quality is through we do quality weeks with engineering.\n(00:52:53):\nAnd then we decided a couple years ago, we had this idea where we were like, oh, what if we package all of those quality updates up into one thing and launch them together and we could even show the tweet or the forum request that spurred us to do this. And that was where our idea of little big updates came, which is a launch that we do every year. Figma, they come from these quality weeks with engineering, that's where the engineers can just go and look at Twitter, talk to our support team, get all these small things that annoy people to fix them, and they just fix them all and they get so many done. And then we launch them all together. And that's one of our most popular launches that we do because people are like, yes, I care about this. This improves my quality of life every single day.\n(00:53:37):\nBack to that discussion of two clicks versus one click and things like that, they're that small, but we still do it. And I love that little big updates when I think, Airbnb did something like that too, with the a hundred updates thing on their website.\nLenny (00:53:49):\nAirbnb has shifted fully to that, which is only big launches, just wait twice a year and launch a bunch of stuff. That's exactly, that's fully how they operate.\nClaire Butler (00:53:58):\nThat's another way that we do the building with, and I think that even giving the engineers, we give them the ability to pick them, right? So they're like, oh, yep, this tweet, I want to fix this bug.\nLenny (00:54:07):\nThat's got to be so satisfying.\nClaire Butler (00:54:08):\nYeah, exactly. And in the marketing even, we'll pull examples like, oh yeah, that for one, the person who said that. So that one's big. And then on the transparency side, I think where this gets hard at scale is all of a sudden you have a lot of people who care about your products. And I think it's really easy as a brand because you are a brand at this point, as you're getting bigger to be like, oh, I can hide behind my handle or the Figma handle, or do I really have to say something about this? And so just two examples of things like that where you just, we've chosen to be transparent when we didn't have to be or you might not, or downtime. Downtime is always a big deal. And I remember there was a specific instance, I think it was last year, maybe two years ago, where there was this issue with these servers and an AWS cluster went down and we didn't know what was going on.\n(00:55:01):\nAnd so we had downtime multiple times in a week and people were pissed, right? Things were not going well. Again, back on Twitter, we built... The double-edged sword of Twitter is you build this strong communication channel with your users and they communicate right back to you if they're not happy. So it's inundating us. And I remember we did a public postmortem and we always do that. If something happens or something goes wrong, we're like, yeah, that was bad. Here's what happened and here's the technical reason and here's how we fixed it. And then we tweeted that and promoted it and took just full accountability for it. And we always choose to make those choices when they're hard. And that was just one example. But I think the hardest example, and back to your question of the most stressful days at Figma, the true most stressful day Figma, for me, was the day that we announced the acquisition.\n(00:55:52):\nThat was probably one of the harder moments of my career, where... My brand is social, that's my job, is running social. And all of a sudden you have this onslaught on social and you have to figure out what to do. And I remember the way that we announced it was we just retweeted Dylan. That was all that we had said\n(00:56:07):\nRaji on our team, I remember I was talking to him about it and he was like, \"We've got to talk to our users. We just have to talk to them directly. We have to show we're the same company. We just have to not hide behind the brand.\" And he was totally right. And so I remember we decided that day that the next day we just had to have an open public forum where we could talk directly with our users and let them ask us any questions. And so we'd held the Twitter space the next day with Dylan and Cho and Raji and Tom, and we just had it open and people could ask us anything they wanted and we were able to be just really honest and transparent with them about everything that we could.\n(00:56:44):\nAnd I think that that is just a really good example of how even when it's really, really, really, really hard, you still have to just be transparent. And I think that that's when the tide started to turn of people giving us a chance to prove that everything would be great, even when it's the highest stakes and the hardest thing of still listening to people, maintaining that connection and not hiding behind the brand.\nLenny (00:57:06):\nIt feels like transparency is core to the values of Figma. Have you codified your values and is that one of them and is there anything there?\nClaire Butler (00:57:18):\nInteresting. We have codified our values. It isn't explicitly listed out, which is interesting, but I think of it as our value, especially with our users. We think about our values a lot as have fun with it, build community, love your craft, and all of those definitely come through, play, but maybe that should be one because I think it's so core to how we make decisions and our framework of when we have a decision which way we're going to go.\nLenny (00:57:43):\nAnd also we mentioned Cho a couple of times, but on Twitter, he is always asking people, what do you need in the editor? Here's what's going great.\nClaire Butler (00:57:49):\nAbsolutely. It's still how we get so much feedback is talking to people directly and Kris will come on when people have bugs and just respond to them. He's our CTO. People are just actively on there, listening to people, fixing bugs, responding.\nLenny (00:58:06):\nI want to shift to kind of the second step of the go-to-market motion, but before I do that, I have a couple of things I wanted to touch on briefly. One is you haven't mentioned Config, this conference that you ran, which is a good example I think, of scaling a lot of the things you're talking about. It used to be Twitter, social graph, find people on Twitter. Now it's like this epic conference that I think people just love. I was on Twitter the days of Config, and it's just my whole feed was just like, oh my god, Config is the best thing. So many talks and so many people.\nClaire Butler (00:58:34):\nConfig is such a good example. I remember, I can happily talk about Config. The way that we do Config, I think... I'd never run a conference before, maybe that's probably part of it. And I brought somebody on who had, but she and I were both sitting together and being like, okay, so we're doing a conference. How do we get the content for this conference? What do we do? And we didn't know. And so we just decided, oh, so much of what we do is listen to our users. Let's put out this call for proposals and see what they want to talk about. And so that's how we got and get a lot of our content for the conference. And a lot of it comes back to what I was talking about earlier, which is very technical deep content that targets individual contributors for the practitioners of the tool.\n(00:59:20):\nAnd through that process, we build these relationships with these speakers, our advocates help them shape their talks. And then I think that we do produce really strong technical content through that process and through Config. And we're also able to, with these people that we work with, help them grow their own profiles and that also helps them stay more connected to us, helps them become thought leaders in their own right. And so I think we're able to just draw so many different people who are the practitioners and the ICs because we're not just putting thought leadership out there. We're talking directly to how to use the tool and the things that individual contributors are still dealing with.\nLenny (00:59:58):\nYeah, it's kind of a lot like this podcast and my newsletter. It's like how to actually do stuff, not just a bunch of big ideas.\nClaire Butler (01:00:03)\nReally. Yeah, no fluff.\nLenny (01:00:04):\nI remember seeing a tweet about it where someone filmed being inside of and they're like, it's a rock concert, it's not a conference.\nClaire Butler (01:00:10):\nOh, that too. We also just have fun. That's another big part of it as well. I remember literally saying, how can I make this more fun? So that was a big part of it.\nLenny (01:00:19):\nSounds like another value.\nClaire Butler (01:00:20):\nYes.\nLenny (01:00:21):\nOkay. Let's talk about step two of this go-to-market motion that you've developed, which I think if I were to just simply describe it as help people spread it within the organization. Is that right?\nClaire Butler (01:00:31):\nYep. Yep.\nLenny (01:00:33):\nCool. All right. How do you do that?\nClaire Butler (01:00:34):\nAll right, so again, I've got four things here and I'll list them out and then we can go through them. The first is make it easy to try the tool and to share it without a lot of gates so that you can do this. The second is those DAs. I want to talk about how those DAs work in our sales process.\nLenny (01:00:50):\nOh, Designer Advocate.\nClaire Butler (01:00:51):\nYeah, sorry. That's our acronym for them, designer advocates, because they are so core to how we sell and how this works. The third is finding the operational thing that allows you to scale. For us that's design systems, the thing that was the biggest blocker to somebody using Figma and turning it into your biggest reason to adopt. And then the last one was still about maintaining and growing that connection with those internal champions over time. So those are the four things, and again, it looks different, similar concepts with different ideas when you look at that in the early days versus what we do today with it with scale.\nLenny (01:01:30):\nAwesome. Let's get into it.\nClaire Butler (01:01:32):\nAll right, cool. So the first one's making it, the products easy to try and share. So we talked about this a little bit, but if you go to figma.com today, it's very easy to sign up for a free account. I have a free account myself on my personal side for designing my house, which is a thing I used to before, but you just go and you can try the tool. And I think that's so important for us to allow someone to use it over time for a long time until they have confidence enough to be able to want to spread it within their organizations. But then it's also pretty easy to create a free team and share stuff with your organization. In the early days, you could just share a link and that was it, and you could use the tool and everything was free. Once we implemented pricing, which was about two years after we launched, we had this thing called a starter team.\n(01:02:21):\nAnd this is actually something that was switched. So initially the way that it worked was our starter team was that you could have unlimited files but only collaborate with two or three people, and that was the starter team and you wanted to add more people to collaborate with, and then you hit the paywall. We realized that wait a minute, that's hurting us. And so we switched it and now it's like you can have something like three files, but unlimited collaborators. And that was huge for us. And that's a place where you can see it in the metrics very clearly, where it's like, oh, this is really easy for people now to share before they have to start paying. This is huge.\n(01:03:01):\nAnd so then you get people to start using it for free with their teams and the teams get confidence in it before then they all have to start uploading it to their procurement team or whoever it is to start paying for it. So not introducing payment too fast and giving people that time to build that advocacy and to try it out with their teams, with people before they have to pay, I think is huge there.\nLenny (01:03:24):\nThat's such a good and important topic that I want to pull a thread on a little bit. So what you discovered there is you don't want to get in the way of the growth engine of the product. If it's going to grow through people spreading it, you don't want to cut it off at three. That seems like a monumental decision that changed everything. Any sense of just how you came about to realizing that? Or was it just obvious, okay, of course we need to change this?\nClaire Butler (01:03:45):\nWell, I think it was intuitive and it was more about the change management process of how to do that when people... At this point people were using the tool and using that starter tier and setting people or what that looks like. And for a long time you could also get around that and just collaborate with people in drafts and just share a link too. And we wanted to shut that down. So it was a bigger decision on just change management, but I think we intuitively knew it and it was much more about to the change management of how to make that happen.\nLenny (01:04:13):\nIs there anything else you learned about what should be in free and paywall versus what should be in freemium? Just broad thoughts.\nClaire Butler (01:04:21):\nWell, I think the other interesting thing is too, and I think I said this, but so much of ours is, so we have a couple tiers. We have a free tier and then we have a pro tier, and then we have our org tier. And the free tier, free tier includes this free starter team. And so you can just do that, go to figma.com, and go do that. Pro is all enter credit card, and then org is you talk to sales. Org and enterprise, you talk to sales. And so I think the other key thing here is we get a lot of upsells to org from pro. And so it's also a thought of what you put in org versus pro. So that's the other decision because pro is also relatively inexpensive, so that grows a lot too really quickly and it's still very important to us, but still most of our marketing qualified leads that are sales leads likely come from pro or from free.\n(01:05:11):\nAnd so it's the decisions that we think about are like, okay, what do you want to sell on? And to go from free to pro, it has to be pretty natural because you don't have any people involved. And so it's like they have to just do that on their own. And then when you go from pro to org or enterprise, it's more about the organization and the scale. And that's where that design systems conversation comes in that we could talk about. But that was the thing that we really indexed on for org and enterprise of why you would want to upgrade from pro to org. So it is this multi-step process, but it's also nice because you can increase your investment in the product as you're building your own confidence in the tool.\nLenny (01:05:51):\nThe other really important nuance in the way that you structured pricing, it's unlimited viewers, but it's just editors that you charge for.\nClaire Butler (01:05:56):\nYes. So true. So many people, especially if you're a designer and you're working with our product manager, you can comment and so much of this is to yes, you can spread it and you can use Figma for free for a really long time because you can just comment on the tool. And it also gets us through many more places with the organization and helps us be more useful to more people because yeah, viewers are free.\nLenny (01:06:21):\nThis one topic could be a whole podcast. And I have so many questions. Let me ask maybe one more and then I'll move on. How often do you revisit the packaging and pricing at this point? And do you have any advice there?\nClaire Butler (01:06:32)\nYeah, I mean it's interesting because the product's still growing. We just launched variables and dev mode back in at Config this year, and that influenced pricing and packaging and still is, right? And so FigJam too. And so I would say the core foundations aren't something we revisit a lot, but we're continually adding new features and we have to think about what tiers should they go in, what does that look like? So those things influence that all the time.\nLenny (01:06:56):\nBy the way, I recently upgraded to the non-free pack because I hit that limit of three with the designer that I work with.\nClaire Butler (01:07:02):\nYeah, it's also just kind of annoying because you have to keep moving things in and out drafts.\nLenny (01:07:06):\nThat's exactly what it is.\nClaire Butler (01:07:07):\nIt's like, oh, this is worth my $12 a month or whatever, just to not have to bother with it.\nLenny (01:07:11)\nYeah. Once you realize, okay, yeah, it's not that much in the scheme of things, I'm just going to, but it's interesting how it's not that much, but I still like, nah, I don't really want to pay that if I don't have to.\nClaire Butler (01:07:20):\nOh, for sure. We all do that. Right? Especially because so much of pro, so many people have individual pro accounts, right? Because not necessarily a business or maybe it's a small business or you're an individual and it's very different from an organization where someone else is paying for it.\nLenny (01:07:33):\nYeah. So funny. Okay, step two is around designer advocates. Talk about that.\nClaire Butler (01:07:39):\nYeah, so I just think these DAs, so sorry, I keep calling them DAs because that's what we call them internally.\nLenny (01:07:44)\nIt's cool. Now we know.\nClaire Butler (01:07:45):\nAdvocates are just so special and such a big part of Figma. And like I said, it took us so long to start charging or bring in a sales team. And when we first hired our first salesperson and our first sales rep was the same day that our next designer advocate started, who... Eventually the first designer advocate left and did something else. And we brought in another designer advocate and he started on the first day that the sales team started. And at this point, more people were using Figma. We'd had that pro tier going for a while, and Tom, who is still here today and is leading that team, Tom Lowry, he was a passionate Figma user, but he was a passionate Figma user who brought Figma to his organization. But the first one, we were so early, he didn't have an organization to bring it to, he just loved the product. But Tom, he brought...\nPART 3 OF 4 ENDS [01:09:04]\nClaire Butler (01:08:27):\nHe really didn't have an organization to bring it to. He just loved the product. But Tom, he was the internal champion at his company, who got his company to adopt Figma. So, when he joined Figma, that was really the mindset that he brought to this, was also like, \"How do you use this as a team?\"\n(01:08:42):\nAnd why I think this is so special, and was so foundational that they started together, is that they would go talk to users together, and they would bring him into the sales process. But he was never a salesperson. Never had a quota, doesn't live on the sales team. Technical expert who has such a deep passion, and a deep, deep, deep, deep understanding of the tool, that he would come in and just help explain the product to other designers.\n(01:09:08):\nAnd it goes back to that same theme that I talked about earlier with marketing, where I realized that I would never have the credibility with designers that a designer has. Same is true with sales. They're never going to know the product as well as a designer will.\n(01:09:21):\nSo, Tom being there, and Tom being able to be like, \"Oh, I understand exactly what you're talking about, and what your problems are. Here's how this works.\" Or \"Here's where you're blocked,\" or \"Here's an idea or best practice how to use this.\"\n(01:09:34):\nThat just became so powerful and so useful for them and for the sales team, that they ended up calling it the Tom Factor, [inaudible 01:10:15]. So, it wasn't necessarily a structured process at the beginning. They'd just like, \"Hey Tom, can you come help talk to this company with us, or help show them how this works?\"\n(01:09:51):\nBut then they called him the Tom Factor because he was so powerful, and their deals were so much more likely to close if he joined the calls. But it wasn't his full-time job either. He also is connected to the products. Because he's this special person who was a designer, was a [inaudible 01:10:40] user of the product, and then talks to hundreds of customers. So, he has the best way of synthesizing product feedback, and then bringing it back to the product team because he has all of that context. So, I think that that role is just so special, and it's something that we've actually chosen to scale because it's just so valuable. In the same way it's valuable for marketing, it's valuable for sales.\nLenny (01:10:29):\nI think we're going to spur a lot of companies building these teams with this conversation.\nClaire Butler (01:10:32):\nI can't speak highly enough about it. Marketing, we think about it, as we're scaling this role, we're marketing product and sales. That's where these people come in. And I think when you have a technical IC audience, I don't see how else you could build any credibility or get anywhere with people if you don't have someone who deeply understands it, integrated in marketing and in sales.\nLenny (01:10:52):\nWho does this team report to?\nClaire Butler (01:10:54):\nMe.\nLenny (01:10:55):\nAwesome.\nClaire Butler (01:10:56):\nYeah.\nLenny (01:10:58):\nOkay. So, we're talking about how to help your product spread within an organization. Talked about developer advocates. You talked about making it easier to spread. What else?\nClaire Butler (01:11:06):\nLet's talk about design systems. Let's say you're a designer and you're designing an app, and you need a button. Rather than going in and making a new button every single time, you need a library of the button ... with the color, the spacing, the padding, all that stuff already predefined.\n(01:11:24):\nMaybe it's tied to code, maybe it's not. But you just want to pull that in. And then, maybe there's someone on the design system, and maybe there's a brand designer or someone who's like, \"Oh, we changed this from this font to that font.\" That you know that, and it just updates everywhere. Or a padding change, and it updates everywhere.\n(01:11:38):\nAnd that's the most simplistic version, is a button. But this stuff gets way more complex. This turns into, \"Here is our welcome screen. Here is our header bar.\" All of the different components that then become whole pages. And it's a huge efficiency.\n(01:11:54):\nIf you have a very robust design system, you're just pulling in all of those components, instead of having to design those from scratch every single time. And it's consistent. If you have hundreds of designers in an organization, they're all making buttons, they're going to be slightly different. And then engineering's like, \"Wait. What patenting do I use?\" It's very inefficient. So, a lot of organizations use these design systems, and they become very advanced over time. But Figma did not have design systems in the early days. Or if we did, they ended up having them at the file level. But you couldn't share them with other people.\n(01:12:25):\nSo, that was a huge blocker for us for a really long time, was these big companies were like, \"Oh, yeah. This is cool, but I need a design system. How else am I supposed to work with engineering?” Because this is so big in engineering, too. Because when you're able to identify all of these different buttons and these components in advance, you could tie them to code. And then it's easier for them because they don't have to inspect it every time. So, it's way better for everybody. It was our biggest blocker. But then we decided, \"No, we're going to focus on this.\" And in the early days, that was just meetups still. And it was like, \"We need to do design systems meetups.\" And we were all like, \"What are design systems?\" Or that I'm just like, \"What is design systems?\"\n(01:13:03):\nAnd then I went and read a pattern way of thinking and Brad Frost's atomic structures design systems, and started learning about it. But anyway, in the early days, we just literally brought … There's a community of design systems people, and we brought all of them together. Met with our product team, met with Dylan, started just having these really informal meetups around design systems to learn from these people and start just learning, hearing from them. And then they started building out more features from it. And then we just started really leaning into the technical aspects of how companies use and scale design systems. Because, while design systems are so important, it's also very hard to get an organization to do it. Because it's like an efficiency thing that they also have to invest in, that is immediately connected to a launch that day.\n(01:13:43):\nEvery company is at a different phase of maturity of where their design system is. But we really leaned into the content, into the features, into eventually showing how people do it in Figma. Both at the beginning level, but then at the very advanced level, to really lean into that. And then, that also went into marketing. That was ... We have DesignSystems.com, it's a Figma property. We had a whole conference around it in the fall called Schema, where we just bring in these advanced design systems practitioners and they just show you how're they're working. And that's so important, too, because design systems are one of the main reasons you upgrade from pro to org or enterprise, is you're at this phase where you're getting more organized. You're more advanced, you're a bigger company, so that's one of our big gating features for upgrade, so that became just the key thing we leaned in on.\n(01:14:30):\nAnd that's bottoms up specific, because the people making the design systems are not like the VP, still. The next phase of bottoms up are the ICs, and then the design systems people. And now those internal champions are largely the design systems people, too. They're either the biggest blockers or the biggest champions, depending on if you can win them over.\nLenny (01:14:51):\nI love just that lesson of the thing that is blocking you from being adopted, see if you can turn that into an advantage.\nClaire Butler (01:14:57):\nTotally. Totally.\nLenny (01:14:58):\nFeels like, looking at Figma, it's like, wow, with so many advantages for a product to spread ... It's single player, you can use it on your own. It's got multiplayer, you could invite people. It gets better as more people are using it.\n(01:15:09):\nVersus, I don't know, a company like Slack, where it's useless on your own. Is there anything there about just, these lessons you're sharing are most helpful for a product that is useful on its own? Or could it be useful for all kinds of products? Anything there?\nClaire Butler (01:15:25):\nThat's what I was talking about with the IC. An IC has to get a lot of value out of this on their own. And I think it has to be technical. Or, that's a hypothesis that I have. It's certainly easier if it's a technical product. They get a lot farther, because people want to talk much more about the product.\n(01:15:41):\nThey care so much about the craft, and they want to spend a lot of time learning and understanding it. And I think that's true with designers, that's true with engineers. That's not true with every audience. Not every audience is ... deeply cares about wanting to learn the craft in the best way possible for a specific thing. So, I think that one of the ... I don't know about requirements, but things that makes this a lot more likely to be successful, is that your IC, there's a tool, and they can use it on their own. And it's technical. I think that helps a ton.\nLenny (01:16:12):\nComing back to the strategy of helping Figma spread within an organization, I think you mentioned there's one more item around champions?\nClaire Butler (01:16:20):\nOh, yeah. Just the last thing there is, you have to keep that relationship going with those champions forever. Because they don't go away. And sometimes they get mad at you, too. I remember, there's one. I think it was at one of our companies, one of our bigger companies. And he was upset about something, and he tweeted it.\n(01:16:41):\nAnd then we immediately had to go talk to him and understand what he wanted, and what was wrong. They don't go away. But then also, I think a lot about how, through the process of maintaining a relationship with those people, we're actually able to help them, and what they get out of it beyond just the tool. Especially over time, especially as we have a larger platform, I think a lot about how can we help them grow. Whether that's growing their careers. Like they, because they brought on Figma, they get a promotion, or whatever that looks like.\n(01:17:11):\nBut we have more direct control over things like, \"Oh, you're going to speak at one of our events. We're going to amplify you on social. We're going to promote you and make you a thought leader.” And it works really well for everyone. Because these people also have the deep technical expertise to show other people, \"Here's how I've flip my design systems. Here's how I do this.\" And [inaudible 01:18:03] people who want to learn from them. And we have the platform to be able to amplify them. So, I think a lot about, \"Yeah, how can we help these people grow in their own careers, and get something out of this, too, beyond just the level of the tool?\"\nLenny (01:17:42):\nAnd then that builds back into building credibility for Figma, because now there's all these additional designers talking about Figma.\nClaire Butler (01:17:48):\nTotally. It's all a circle. It's all [inaudible 01:18:23].\nLenny (01:17:49):\nFlywheels within flywheels. What a business you've built over there. Maybe just the last question along these lines ... What changes as you scale? A lot of these are things you did early on. What changes as you grow as a company, in this bucket of helping the product spread?\nClaire Butler (01:18:02):\nYeah. I think the key thing is that you have to keep doing it. One of the things that I feel like, at my role now at Figma, that I think a lot about, is how I can keep advocating for this stuff when we are starting to implement more top down motion, and having to really prove ROI. Or thinking about, \"How do you scale the sales team?\" And all those things.\n(01:18:24):\nSo, a lot of what I'm doing, too, is thinking like, \"Okay. How do we keep this going and keep this model successful as the company is still growing?\" Because it's not necessarily as intuitive as you are starting to add in more of some of these more traditional methods and motions. So, that's something that I think about quite a bit. Things like that conference that I talked about, Schema, that's a big one. Config, that's a big one. Scaling our DA team, and really having them grow with the company across regions and across products, is really big. So, it's how do you keep protecting those things. Because it's not immediately obvious when you bring in just a ton of new people.\nLenny (01:19:03):\nRight. It's easy to break the thing that was working.\nClaire Butler (01:19:04):\nTotally. And you have to do new things, too. You have to layer on new things. But how do you not just walk away from this thing that got you to where you are, as well?\nLenny (01:19:14):\nIs this a fit for everyone, this sort of approach? Let's say every B2B SaaS company, what are maybe prerequisites for who should apply this sort of approach and this motion?\nClaire Butler (01:19:25):\nI thought about this a lot myself, actually. Because Figma also has new products. So, I think to myself, \"Oh, can I replicate this?\" Like FigJam. FigJam's one of those examples. And Dev Mode, all of a sudden we're working with developers. So, I've thought about this a lot. And I don't know if there's like, \"Oh, you have to have this, or you have to have that.\" But I think there's certainly things that make it easier. And they're both true on the market side, of the type of the audience, and also on the team side.\n(01:19:50):\nWithin the market, I already mentioned it. But I think it really helps if people are technical. And you have this technical audience of people who really care about the craft, and they get a lot of value out of the tool by themselves. Because that just allows them to really learn something and really build confidence in something, before they have to spread it or start collaborating. And it gives you something to talk about with them that's not collaboration. Because, like I said, no one wants to talk about collaboration. Nobody wants to talk about it. So, you have other things you can talk about. Even though collaboration's so important, no one wants to talk about it.\n(01:20:19):\nSo, being technical is important. And caring about your tools, that's another one that I think a lot about. As a marketer, I don't know how much I care about my tools. Some of them I do, but a lot of them I don't. If you're like, \"Oh, Claire, you have to move from Dropbox Paper to Google Docs,\" I'd be like, \"Fine.\" Maybe that's their personality. But designers, specifically, and I think engineers are the same way, just as examples, have deep passions for their tools. Probably because they're in it eight hours a day, so they're using them all the time. So, it certainly helps if you ... These people already care, care deeply, about what their tools are.\n(01:20:55):\nAnother thing that helps is that you have a community that exists within the target audience already. We had that with designers. Yes, we grew it a lot, and have grown with it a lot. But like I said, that Twitter community, that existed without us. That was there before we were there. So, it made it a lot easier for us to get started, because we didn't have to make something to bring people to us. We had a distribution channel already in place that we could work through. That helped a ton. And then I think the last one was that that core IC audience has a lot of connection points within the organization. Designers are so collaborative. Like you were saying, as a PM, you were working with designers. They work with everybody. If you're building something, you need comments, you need feedback. So, it was really natural for them to be a super-spreader, because their role was such that they were collaborating with a lot of people.\nLenny (01:21:44):\nAnd again, when people are hearing this, they're like, \"Of course Figma did so well. They had all these advantages.\" But I think people forget how many disadvantages that also [inaudible 01:22:24]. Like convincing a designer to switch to a new tool ... very hard.\nClaire Butler (01:21:54):\nOne of my favorite stories there is that when we launched Designer News, which was a popular forum back in the day, the first response was, \"If this is the future of design, I'm changing careers.\" Because designers do not want to be collaborative. There was this process where people were like, \"Oh, no. I want to do my work on my own, and then present when I'm ready.\" It was a massive shift in getting them to think in a different way to do this. So even to me, it was intuitive. But of course, you'd be collaborative. But designers did not want to be, all of them, right away.\nLenny (01:22:23):\nI think it's only a clearly successful product after the fact, only after the fact. This reminds me of another story [inaudible 01:23:02] shared with me about Uber, which was also very classically not collaborative and very siloed. And there was a big push to adopt Figma to help encourage more sharing, because that was against the culture.\nClaire Butler (01:22:40):\nYes, yes. That was a key problem. And it's still a key problem with a lot of design organizations, is that they're siloed. And it's an organizational shift to get people to be collaborative.\nLenny (01:22:50):\nWhat sort of team do you need to have in place to approach growth and go-to-market in this way? What did you find was really important?\nClaire Butler (01:22:57):\nThe most important thing there is that you have an executive and a leader who believes in this. I did not start this; Dylan started this. He was the core person who believed in this, and who drove a lot of this. And he continues to. And he's built this up to be a culture of our team.\n(01:23:13):\nAnd since he believes in it, he's able to help bring more people on board and make everyone believe in it. And then, I think the other thing is, through that, is that thing that we were talking about earlier with metrics. I think so much of this is people being like, \" That doesn't scale. How do you measure this?” And yes, we are [inaudible 01:24:05]. We are working on all those things. But it's not immediately clear. The metrics don't immediately show you if something's working or not. It goes back to signal over metrics. And I think that that's so important.\n(01:23:43)\nAnd having leaders who believe in that, too, who are able to trust their own intuitions and their own guts, is so important. And it's so interesting, too, because I was just thinking when I was ... Just now, that I was talking about earlier about how trusting yourself and trusting intuition is the hardest part, the most stressful part in the early days. But even here, it's the thing you need the most to be successful. So, I don't know how that connects back, but it just feels like that's just so important in this type of model. And with just being at a startup, is that you're able to believe in it, and have the confidence and the trust in yourself.\nLenny (01:24:16):\nI'm going to quickly summarize this model just for people to have a very clear, succinct explanation, and then comment on anything I'm forgetting and missing. I'll keep it really brief. And then we'll get to our very exciting lightning round.\n(01:24:28)\nSo, the idea here, basically, is step one, make individual contributors at a company love your product. Step two is get them to help spread you within the company. And to get people to love your product, the four keys that you shared is: Build credibility for your product, build a product with your users, focus where you can connect with your users, one to many. In your case, it was Twitter. And build a relationship with users so that they can start to trust you. And transparency is a big part of that. Before I move on to step two, anything I missed there?\nClaire Butler (01:24:56):\nNope, that's it.\nLenny (01:24:57):\nOkay, cool. And then step two is help them spread that product within the organization. And what you found was really important there. One is make it easy to share the product and try it for free. Two is designer advocates being involved in the sales process, have the Tom Factor. Find and target the operating thing that spreads adoption. In this case, I think it was design systems, you mentioned mostly. And then the final piece is shine a light on champions, and help them be successful. Make it help them in their career.\nClaire Butler (01:25:25):\nYep, that's it.\nLenny (01:25:26):\nAwesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\nClaire Butler (01:25:30):\nYes.\nLenny (01:25:32):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\nClaire Butler (01:25:35):\nI recommend management books to lots of people. The other piece of this that we didn't touch on at all is scaling a team, and all the things that go into management.\nLenny (01:25:41):\nThat'll be our next step, our next podcast.\nClaire Butler (01:25:44):\nTeaching, and also growing new managers. So, Radical Candor and Dare to Lead, to be honest, are the ones I recommend the most. Because I do a lot of [inaudible 01:26:26] coaching new managers and helping them learn how to manage. And those are the first two I start with, because they're so good.\nLenny (01:25:58):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've recently watched and really liked?\nClaire Butler (01:26:02):\nI just watched 100 Foot Wave on HBO. And I watched it because I'm going to Portugal next week, and that's the place where they have the biggest waves in the world. And it was just really interesting to learn all about this, Nazare and Portugal, and all the waves and the surfing culture that's grown there. That was just a fun one that I watched recently.\nLenny (01:26:21):\nAnd is your plan to do a 100 foot wave?\nClaire Butler (01:26:23):\nNo. Because I am expecting, so there will be no surfing for me.\nLenny (01:26:32):\nOh, wow. Congratulations.\nClaire Butler (01:26:28):\nYes, I know. I will be doing yoga on the beach while my partner surfs.\nLenny (01:26:32):\nAmazing. We just had a kid. That's a whole other podcast. This podcast, just, parenting starts to come up again and again. It's interesting. Okay, we'll keep going. What is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you love?\nClaire Butler (01:26:48):\nOkay. You might cut this because it's a little promotional, but FigJam. In the last couple of months, especially, I've spent a lot of time having to create strategies and files and explanations, and I've spent in meetings. And I spend all of my day in FigJam, literally, all of my day. And I work with Figma. I use the product. And I was using Figma for a long time. But FigJam for me, in my role, literally use it every single day. And now I cannot imagine living without it. It replaces so many different tools for me.\nLenny (01:27:20):\nGreat pitch. We will not be cutting that. I'm also a big fan of FigJam.\nClaire Butler (01:27:23):\nGreat. It is true, it's very true. I'm in there all the time. I think I'm the most active FigJam user. [inaudible 01:28:01] validate that in the metrics. But I'm in FigJam all the time.\nLenny (01:27:31):\nNext question, what is a favorite life motto that you like to repeat to yourself, that you share with people? Something that comes up when I ask that.\nClaire Butler (01:27:39):\nWhen I was younger, I really was ... I've always been motivated. But like, \"Oh, I have to get this thing right now.\" Whether it was in my career, or I was an athlete growing up. I really wanted to perform and do well in things. And I just put a ton of pressure on myself.\n(01:27:53):\nBut I recently got, or not recently, in the last maybe five years, got this motto of consistent pressure over time as being more of my motto. And taking some of the pressure off of having to do things immediately, or get to a certain place too fast. Maybe it's more of like Atomic Habits, or things like that. But I'm just much more in this mode of like, \"You're not going to get everything done. It's a startup. But career, whatever, it's not going to happen immediately.\" You just have to keep working at it, and not giving up. And having that grit to keep going and keep pushing over time, is way more important than any immediate accomplishments.\nLenny (01:28:26):\nThat is so good. I just added this question to lightning round and these answers are so good each time. Consistent pressure over time. I so get that. Reminds me of how I think about the newsletter. It's just like, \"Keep at it, keep at it. It doesn't have to be the best thing ever, every single time.\"\nClaire Butler (01:28:40):\nJust don't give up.\nLenny (01:28:41):\nGreat answer. Final question, what's your favorite use case of Figma that you never expected?\nClaire Butler (01:28:46):\nI think I mentioned this a little bit, but I use it for home renovation, FigJam especially. I renovated a house with my partner, and we're doing another one right now. And I couldn't do renovations without it. I copy and paste. I start with Pinterest, get ideas. But then I pull them all to the mood board on FigJam.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]And then I circle things, and this helps me communicate with my partner. I'll send it to him and get comments from him on stuff, links. So, yes. We also will draw out rooms and model things up, and have them on the iPad. Yep. Interior design and home renovations on FigJam.\nLenny (01:29:23):\nClaire, we've talked about making people love your product. I think people will love this episode. Hopefully, they'll also spread it within their organization. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\nClaire Butler (01:29:37):\nI guess Twitter. I'm not active, per se, but that's probably ... I don't look at LinkedIn, so Twitter. That'd definitely be the place. Just Claire T. Butler there. And then, helpful to me, you can tell me your feedback on FigJam and Dev Mode. That would be really helpful to me. And then I guess the other thing is parenting tips with work. I'm a little nervous about that. I love my job, love my career. And I'm going to be a mom soon, and need to figure out how to make that work. So, I want to hear how other people have done that.\nLenny (01:30:06):\nI can give you two quick tips right now. One is, there's a guest post during my Pat Leave, that Tamara ... I forget her last name, wrote. Which is basically a leave guide, a guide to setting yourself up.\nClaire Butler (01:30:16):\nOh, I need this. I'm working on this right now. I need this.\nLenny (01:30:18):\nOkay. I will send this to you, and I'll link it in the show notes. Also, right before I went on Pat Leave, I had Noah Weiss on the podcast, who was just leaving Pat Leave.\n(01:30:27):\nAnd he gave me this awesome advice of \"Don't over-extrapolate every moment.\" This is less about getting ready for paternal leave, and more just being in it. Which is, \"Don't over-extrapolate things that are going on.\" That one thing that's bothering you or is a problem, is not going to continue, necessarily.\nClaire Butler (01:30:43):\nLet it go. Good one. I love it.\nLenny (01:30:46):\nAll right. Well, that's a parenting podcast, a little bit, which is totally cool. Claire, thank you again so much for being here. I'll let you go.\nClaire Butler (01:30:55):\nThank you. That was really fun.\nLenny (01:30:56):\nThat's my KPI for this podcast.\nClaire Butler (01:30:59):\nGreat, great. Great.\nLenny (01:31:00):\nBye, everyone.\n(01:31:02):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Bending the universe in your favor | Claire Vo (LaunchDarkly, Color, Optimizely, ChatPRD)\n\n## Transcript\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:00):\nPeople often think that I get hired into later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company, and in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup.\n\nLenny (00:00:11):\nEverybody wants this. Everyone's like, \"Yes, move fast, amazing quality.\" What's an example of that for you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:16):\nI communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster. If you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half.\n\nLenny (00:00:24):\nThere may be a trend happening here of combining engineering product.\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:27):\nI'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. There should be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design speed. What is best for the organization?\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nYou built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there.\n\nClaire Vo (00:00:44):\nIs it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably.\n\nLenny (00:00:56):\nToday, my guest is Claire Vo. Claire is a longtime chief product officer at Color, Optimizely, and currently chief product officer at LaunchDarkly. She's also been a two-time founder, engineer, designer, and a marketer. She's also the creator of ChatPRD, which I suspect is the most used PM-specific AI product out there, which she builds on nights and weekends.\n\n(00:01:19):\nIn our conversation, we dig into what PM skills AI will complement and potentially replace in the future, the story behind ChatPRD, and Claire's advice for how to stay ahead of the curve on AI within the PM role, the importance of feeling agency over your career, and how to bend the arc of the universe to achieve the things that you want to achieve, insights into what it takes to be a successful woman in tech, especially as an exec, how she creates a fast pace within larger companies while also keeping the bar very high, the rise of the CPTO role, combining product and engineering under one leader plus a ton of career advice both for early career people and senior leaders, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:01):\nThis episode has something for anyone that's in product or interested in the role of product, and I'm very excited to bring it to you.

Are you working in a feature factory building filler that nobody wants? Probably, because the sad truth is that most SaaS features are rarely or never used, costing the industry billions every year. Let's change that. Product managers, Dovetail is holding their first industry conference, it's called Insight Out, and they want you to come.\n\n(00:03:34):\nOver one day in San Francisco, the product community is coming together to learn how to better leverage customer insights and build products that people actually love to use. It's on April 11, and you can hear from product leaders from Uber, Twitch, Meta, and Netflix as they share their strategies for driving innovation, thriving in uncertainty, and balancing customer-centered work with business needs. And here's the kicker, it's absolutely free for online tickets. Just go to dovetail.com/lenny to register. This is thanks to Dovetail, the best way for product teams to get the most out of customer insights. Check it out at dovetail.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:16):\nClaire, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nClaire Vo (00:04:20):\nOh, thank you for having me. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nI'm even more excited. You're someone that, to me, has always felt inevitable would be on this podcast and that we'd be doing an episode together. Do you feel the same way, or not? And it's okay if you don't.\n\nClaire Vo (00:04:32):\nIt's a privilege and a pleasure, and I'm glad I'm here. I've been so impressed with your guests and your content. It's been so exciting to see just the wide range of product leaders and thinkers in this space. And if I can be on a list of product leaders and thinkers in this space, then I'm doing something good. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure.\n\n(00:04:53):\nI want to start by talking about career advice. I was perusing your LinkedIn, and your career path is basically what most PMs probably dream of in their career. Just to summarize, you went from associate product manager to product manager to senior product manager to director to senior director to VP to SVP to chief product officer, and now you've been chief product officer of three different companies. And along the way, you're a founder, you're a designer, you're an engineer.\n\n(00:05:22):\nHere's my question. If you had to boil down what you think your secret sauce has been to progressing so far and so quickly throughout your PM career, what might that be?\n\nClaire Vo (00:05:33):\nYeah, so when you list it all out, you can probably guess underneath it all is a relentlessly curious, impatient, eager to build person at their core. I just like building stuff and I find a lot of fun, and I think if you find a career or a craft that's fun, it's easy to accelerate your growth in that career. One thing, I just love what I do.\n\n(00:05:56):\nBut when it comes to career growth and that progression from, I actually started as a copywriter of all things, copywriter all the way up to a CPO or CPTO that runs an engineering organization, it boils down to something really simple, which is know what you want out of your career, be clear and ask for it, and then make it easy for your boss or whoever can support or champion you to get you from here to there.\n\n(00:06:20):\nAnd so I'll take a really specific example from earlier in my career, where I had been in management for design and product management, so a senior manager level over product and design at an e-commerce company, and worked very closely with growth and marketing. We were just two sides of the same coin and worked very closely. And the head of marketing left and there was this big to-do pretty quickly of, \"Well, what are we going to do with marketing? And do we need to hire somebody?\"\n\n(00:06:49):\nAnd I sat for about a half a day and I thought, I think I can help here, drew out an org chart, put my name on the top, walked into my boss's office and said, \"This is one potential solve of your marketing organization question, is we'll bring product and marketing growth together. I can be in this position. Here's how I'd change the management structure underneath this. Not just where do you put me, but where do you put everybody else? And I think this could work for the company, and this is how I'd suggest we roll it out and this would be my JD.\" And I got that job. I think when people ask me about career advice, they want to hear, \"What can I do?\" Really, what do you want? And how do you make it as easy as possible to make the case to your boss to get you here to there?\n\n(00:07:33):\nThe other thing that I give people advice about is know what you want out of your current role and know exactly what you want your next role to be. And I even know this, and I even say this to my boss. When I was VP of product at Optimizely, I said to my boss, \"I want to be a chief product officer. Here's how I'm going to get us here to there, and I want you to partner with me on it.\" And even coming into this role when I was interviewing at LaunchDarkly, my boss, Dan, the CEO of LaunchDarkly asked me, \"What do you want out of this role?\" And I said, \"I want my next role to be a CEO role, so I want this role to fill in my gaps, learn, help me elevate my experience to get me to that next step.\"\n\n(00:08:14):\nAnd so I always know what that next role is going to be and I'm always clear about it. Now, I think there's a fine balance here. There's one thing to be very clear about your goals. It's another to suck the oxygen out of the air about only talking about getting promoted. These are probably 0.005% of my interactions with my boss are about my career growth and my path. It's very small. \"Am I clear? Are we on the same page? And am I communicating as I'm making progress against those goals?\"\n\n(00:08:44):\nHigh-slip people I think get promoted basically as fast as the org can support. I've almost never wished I promoted somebody earlier. I've seen managers or folks promote a little too early, and so as somebody that's managing their own career, you have to be a balance of ambitious and assertive and take care of yourself and advocate for yourself, and the work needs to speak for itself at the end of the day, and that's what's going to drive for your career growth. And so know what you want but do the work and produce the results, and you can have a career like mine.\n\nLenny (00:09:24):\nMaybe first to summarize, some of the core advice you're sharing is know what you actually want because you're not going to progress towards this amazing future career if you don't actually know where you're going. Otherwise, you'll be pushed in directions that you're not necessarily interested in going.\n\n(00:09:38):\nI have a sense of where you want to go to tell people and ask for it. \"Here's what I want to be doing in the future. Help me get there.\" And I love the other point you made of just, don't over-focus on that. There's many people that spend a lot of their energy on, \"I need to get promoted. How do I get to the next level? I deserve the next level.\" And I guess maybe along those lines, is there any other advice you could share of just how to avoid being that person that's just constantly obsessed with promotion? Any more advice of just how to find that balance?\n\nClaire Vo (00:10:06):\nYeah. One, you've got to lock to the norms, the talent norms of your organization. You should know how those things work, and they can work very casually if you're a very small startup and they can work more formally if you're at a very large company. And one, understanding how promotions operationally happen inside an organization can help you have those conversations at the right time in the right moment with the right context. That's one thing I advise. We're a slightly larger organization. We do promotion cycles. We have times during which we promote people. And so if you're talking to me four months before a promo cycle, maybe it's top of mind, maybe it's not. I sometimes functionally cannot promote people inside larger organizations whenever I want.\n\n(00:10:52):\nOne is, I think, understanding the talent calendar of your team, especially at a larger organization. I think the second thing is really the conversation needs to be about what you being in a different position does for the company and why the company needs it. Often the conversation is, \"I want to be promoted because I want to be a director of PM, because I want to become a manager, because I need direct reports.\" Instead of saying, \"Look, your span of control, you have nine direct reports, you need leverage here. I have a lot of credibility with this side of the product organization. I think we could be doing more if this position existed. And I think I'm good for this position because of what I've proven A, B and C.\"\n\n(00:11:43):\nThat's solving a problem for the company. That's not solving a career growth issue for an individual. And I think people who want to be promoted need to think in that orientation versus the other, because honestly, especially now, let's say [inaudible 00:12:01]. There are not just these wrote every 12 months we're going to give comp increases and merit increases and you get to be promoted. We really have to be thoughtful about the structure and size and organization of teams. Product teams are naturally pretty small.\n\n(00:12:19):\nSo, there aren't just management and director and senior director roles to go around. And if you want to get into a management, for example, you have to prove that you're good at organization design. I think really focus on why a role is good for a company or necessary for a company and then why you are the best for that role, rather than, \"I want to get promoted.\"\n\nLenny (00:12:41):\nThat is such good advice and such important advice that focus on how do you solve problems for your manager and the business, not, \"Hey, here's what I need for my career. This sucks. My career is stagnating.\" I love that. And I love so much of your message is empowerment. It's not just, here, there's the place you're in and there's not a lot you can do about it. Look for opportunities to help your manager, help your business. \"Here's what I can do to move things further.\"\n\n(00:13:06):\nAnd I think there's an element of timing that you touched on. Propose this at a time when something could happen. You shared this example of there was a marketing gap.\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:15):\nYep, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nIs there another example where you did this sort of thing where you presented, \"Here's how I can help the org,\" and that helped another promotion? If not, that's good.\n\nClaire Vo (00:13:25):\nIt's honestly how I expanded into leading engineering teams in the technology organization. I was at Color and there was a real need to up-level our engineering organization, and I knew exactly what to do. I had high confidence I had the skills, both technical and organizational, to scale the engineering organization in a way that was really critical to the business, both from a architecture perspective and from a team and talent perspective. And so that was one where I knew there was a problem to solve. I knew that problem was important. I knew we had to solve it fast, and I was confident I knew I could do it. I had confidence that I could help there.\n\n(00:14:06):\nAnd so I'm still doing it today. And at Color, I came in as product. I very quickly began leading the engineering organization, which was fabulous, and then I actually took on some of our non-clinical operations as well where we had a pretty operational leader. We had some high-scale challenges to deal with, and it fit my talent set and I knew I could help the company pretty quickly.\n\n(00:14:32):\nAnd this is the other advice I might give particular to PMs. PM is such a generalist role, it's okay to go a little left and a little right to go up. I took this marketing growth role. That was actually my first director role. It wasn't only for product, it was for marketing. And I had to learn marketing and I had to develop skills there, but it was a foundation on which I could build a broader leadership career. And so I do think also looking left and right outside of your scope of product can be a really effective way to find growth opportunities.\n\nLenny (00:15:08):\nI love that advice, and it leads to so many unexpected opportunities. One of the, I think, big questions with PMs, and coming back to your original advice of know where you want to go, there's so many directions a PM can go. You can eventually become a founder, become a GM, become a CO, something else. And trying these sorts of things often helps you understand, \"Here's what I'm actually excited about. Maybe I want to move into design.\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:15:31):\nYeah, and one of the other things that I think people don't understand, and maybe I experienced this as a founder and I really feel it inside companies, is the universe is bendable to your will. And what I mean is in most, at least in the stage I operate in in startups and growth stage companies and late stage startups, organizations are very fluid and I like to organize around talented motivated individuals.\n\n(00:15:58):\nAnd so just because we're organized in a particular way now, just because these organizations are separate or these are different, together, doesn't mean that's necessarily the way they have to be, and so you should think about your career growth in the existing structure of the organization. But as an org design thinker, it's a very important job that I have to do. You also have to think of this system as a living, breathing entity that can shift over time in particular around highly motivated, highly talented people.\n\nLenny (00:16:30):\nAnd I think along the same lines, referencing this advice you've already shared of just thinking from the perspective of what is my manager and folks above, what are they struggling with and how can I propose, \"Here's a solution that happens to also have me move into a more interesting role?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:46):\nYep, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:48):\nThere's a direction I wasn't planning to go into, but I think it's really important and interesting is people like you that are incredibly good and successful end up taking on a lot, and that often ends up not being what they want.\n\nClaire Vo (00:16:58):\nSOS.\n\nLenny (00:17:00):\nExactly. Any advice on the classic, be careful what you're good at advice? Any advice on just how to not end up with everything?\n\nClaire Vo (00:17:08):\nI really believe operating in your zone of genius. I really believe in leaning into strengths. And if you are in a position in which you're good at things and you've been giving a lot of responsibility, but you have tremendous growth edges and you're spending more time on the things you need to level up than the things you are exceptional at, I think that's not fair for the organization. I think that's not fair for you.\n\n(00:17:32):\nI truly believe defining and understanding your zone of genius, where you are exceptional, where no one else can step into the job and do just as good of a job as you can, and where you derive tremendous intellectual emotional joy out of the work is what makes it sustainable over time. And so I don't actually think it's about the volume or breadth of the work. It's about sustainability of the work. And can you show up every day energized and engaged and excited about what you do?\n\n(00:18:04):\nAnd I think being very aware if you are operating the space or if you're not. And this might go back to, I think, I have never regretted promoting somebody too slowly, I have regretted promoting somebody too quickly. High-slope individuals in particular areas want to get more responsibility, want to have more scope, and I've seen less experienced managers or directors or even people at my level want to give opportunities that put people in a position where they're neither effective nor happy. And so I think being self-aware of that is really important, and then I also think as a manager, being cognizant of that is really important.\n\n(00:18:50):\nIndividually, I do do a lot, but I do feel like I'm in my zone of genius and I also know that part of staying in my personal zone of genius is having this breadth of responsibility but preserving builder time. And what I mean from time is I have to have time to produce real work that comes from me as an individual, and that means that calendar management is quite important. Time management.\n\nLenny (00:19:21):\nWe're going to talk about some of the things that you built.\n\n(00:19:23):\nIn terms of finding your zone of genius, any advice for someone that's trying to figure out what it is that is in that zone of genius? I know there's a Ted Talk of here's how to think about the zone of genius specifically [inaudible 00:19:33].\n\nClaire Vo (00:19:32):\nYeah. I'm not going to relay it in precision, but one of the tactics that I've seen out there is basically go through your calendar for the last month or quarter, whatever it is, write everything down, and basically group them into, I hated doing this, I didn't love doing it but it was fine, I love doing this, and then I love doing this, and if I could spend all my time on this, I would be the happiest person in the whole world. And literally categorize the way you're spending your time into those buckets, and then put the bottom buckets away. Just focus on that top bucket and go, \"How can I be here more?\" And often, that is a true guide to where your passion is, where your special expertise is, and where you're going to add a lot of value because you're highly engaged.\n\n(00:20:26):\nI think the other thing is really asking yourself, and this maybe goes back to the career advice perspective, really asking yourself, \"What do I do that no one else in this organization can do?\" There are lots of things that I do that other people in the organization can do, but what are the things that I do that are... You think about a differentiated product that are hard to replicate, and knowing what that is and leaning into that can drive a lot of exceptional career growth but also just make you quite happy.\n\nLenny (00:20:58):\nWhat's an example of that for you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:21:00):\nI think I'm actually quite good at traversing across and up and down. What I mean is I am fluent across product engineering, design, data and operations, and candidly revenue in a way that vertical or functional leaders maybe are less so. I feel like I have a high level of fluency broadly and can bring conversations between functions together against a business objective pretty easily. It's just the way I'm wired. I was a founder. It's second nature.\n\n(00:21:31):\nAnd the other thing that I think I can do pretty well that I find very joyous is traverse elevation. And so, yes, I love to be up here and think about strategy and vision, but I also like to drop into the details to move things forward. And I think that operating horizontally and then being able to spend some time in the vertical up and down, wherever that vertical up and down happens makes me quite happy. I think I'm pretty good at it.\n\nLenny (00:21:58):\nAmazing. We're going to touch on some of these things you just mentioned actually, but real quick, you mentioned this idea of essentially an energy audit. There's actually a really good guide that I'll point to in the show notes by Matt Mochary that walks you through how to do this. And we talk about this a bunch on this podcast actually, this whole idea of just find things that give you energy, do more of that. Find things that zap you of energy, do less of that. Easier said than done when you have a job and you have to do stuff that people are paying you to do, but it's still really helpful if nothing else to help you point you where you want to be going in your career long-term.\n\n(00:22:29):\nOkay, so you mentioned you're a founder, and it feels like you're a founder at heart, but you've been working at larger companies for a while now. And I hear that you're really good at setting a fast pace within larger companies and maintaining that startup focus while also having a very high bar for quality and product. Everybody wants this. Everyone's like, \"Yes, move fast, amazing quality.\" Why would we not want that? I'm curious just what you actually put into practice concretely that allow for you to build teams that move really fast and maintain a high bar. Are there processes you find helpful, values, ways of working?\n\nClaire Vo (00:23:06):\nYeah, it's really funny, people often think that I get hired into the roles that I get hired into in later stage companies because I'm supposed to teach them how to operate like a big company. And in fact, I say I'm hired to remind them they can operate like a startup. And so I think about it completely differently.\n\n(00:23:23):\nAnd there are two things I think about in terms of pace and high bar. From a pace, it's know what your internal pace is, and essentially don't let it degrade to the pace of your recurring meetings. I often find that pace of organization locks to pace of the calendar, and so I am really thoughtful that reoccurring meetings do not drive next steps. It's a very tactical thing, but when somebody says, \"Oh, we'll discuss this or we'll decide this in the next meeting,\" it's, \"No, we should discuss this now. We should decide this tomorrow.\"\n\n(00:23:58):\nThe other thing that I think about is setting one click faster pace expectations inside an organization. I tend to come in and love this, hate it, it's what I do, which is if I look at an organization that is operating at a lower pace than I would expect, I communicate to my leaders that my expectation is they bring in the clock speed one click faster, which means if you think something needs to be done this year, it needs to be done this half. If you think it needs to be done this half, it needs to be done this quarter. This quarter, this month. This week, today. End of day, in this meeting. And actually setting an expectation that your natural pace is going to be slower than your ambition and being explicit about pulling things in I think can change the way expectations are set and honestly change the energy and momentum in the organization.\n\n(00:24:51):\nThe third thing on pace is personal SLA. I never want to be a bottleneck for the organization. This is one of the more challenging things about being in my role, is you are often a point of decision-making, tie-breaking, next steps, approvals, socialization. And if my personal SLA is slow, then the rest of my organization cannot be as fast as possible. I try to be fairly responsive. I try to say, \"Do both very high rate,\" and also very quickly. It's really hard, sometimes it's not totally possible, but it's a goal I have.\n\nLenny (00:25:27):\nI love this clock speed concept of just let's move one iteration faster than we would normally move. How do you actually do that? Is this just you doing it and then everyone trickles down from the way you're approaching it? Is this a principle on a team? Is there a phrase you use?\n\nClaire Vo (00:25:41):\nYeah, it's a phrase I use and something I asked our leadership teams to do. It started at, one, I'm going to do this, and two, my expectation is you look for opportunities to do this. And the reason I think this is effective, it's very tangible and it's very tactical. It just is one of those things that a moment when you're about to say a due date, you check yourself and you go, \"Is this right or do I need to pull it in by an iteration?\" And so it's a very tactical piece of advice and expectation I give to my leadership team. If they can show up that way, then the expected pace of the organization goes up, and then people tend to rise to the occasion.\n\nLenny (00:26:26):\nAnd then it connects very directly to your first piece of advice, is not rely on the meeting cadence to determine your action cadence. I imagine that's a similar situation where you tell people, \"Here's how I want to operate,\" and then you actually work that way and that starts to filter through.\n\nClaire Vo (00:26:41):\nYeah, I just think there's this anti-pattern of, \"We'll make the decision in the next meeting,\" or, \"We'll follow up on this in the next meeting.\" That is an artificial timeline introduced by Google Calendar or whatever calendar you use. It's not a real thing, and so I want to put us on real timelines. When can we make the decision? How much information do we need? And that doesn't mean that every decision is made now, today, tomorrow, but it does mean we don't snap to artificial cadences to make our product move forward.\n\nLenny (00:27:12):\nAwesome. Let's talk about quality. What are some lessons there?\n\nClaire Vo (00:27:17):\nYeah, I think in terms of high bar, there's probably two things that I think about as a leader. There's the talent bar being exceptionally high, and then there's the product bar being high.\n\n(00:27:28):\nI'll start with talent, which is, on the talent side I think you have to define the bar. You have to be really specific, and that means you have to think about pretty deeply what are your leadership principles? If your leadership principle is bring the clock speed up one iteration, be explicit that that's what you expect to see, and then articulate that and hold people accountable to it.\n\n(00:27:51):\nAnd so I do think it's really important to have a specific and measurable career ladder, especially at the senior levels. I often find that they're very soft. They're hires and manages multiple departments or takes in cross-functional stakeholder feedback. Those are just not tractable, specific things. And so I think, PMs, put on your product definition or OKR hat or whatever and define some real goals for these levels and be specific in a way that you can look at people and say, definitively, \"Yes. Measurably, yes, they're meaning this bar measurably. No, they're not meeting that bar.\" And so I think that's very important.\n\n(00:28:39):\nThe second thing I think is you have to normalize feedback. And Brené Brown, fellow Texan, love her, \"Clear is kind,\" I think conflict-avoidant, feedback-avoidant cultures degrade the talent bar. They just do, because the expectations are not stated and you're not holding accountability. And I do not think that's kind. That is not setting up people for success in their careers. That is not helping them become the best teammate that they can become.\n\n(00:29:08):\nI really like to normalize feedback and, as I say, take the temperature out of the room when it comes to open and candid feedback. And that means being very clear when people are not meeting expectations, making it very clear that questioning ideas is not questioning innate talent. And I think that has something that people need to hear to normalize feedback. But I think feedback is quite important.\n\n(00:29:30):\nAnd I think the third thing is unfortunately when you're working to build a high talent bar and high talent density, then when folks aren't a fit and it's not working, moving against that quickly is part of the job. And it's a hard part of the job and it's part of the job that most managers really avoid, but I think it's important because it keeps your overall team operating in a really healthy, effective, performant way that makes everybody happier, including people that probably weren't a great fit for the work of the role at the time.\n\nLenny (00:30:02):\nIs there an example of you being surprisingly candid to someone or giving feedback, hard feedback, to someone about quality, something that's just like, \"Oh wow, that's what I should be doing?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:30:16):\nThere were two leaders in my organization, I won't say which ones and I won't say when, but two leaders in the organization, partners across product and engineering, and they could not get it together. They could not work together. They were having misalignments and priorities strategy. They could not communicate. They were having conflict in front of the team.\n\n(00:30:38):\nAnd the managers that had managed them were taking this very soft pedal approach of, \"You need to work on your [inaudible 00:30:47] functional stakeholder, and here am I expecting all this performance management stuff to happen.\" And I called both of them individually and I said, \"The way you are operating is not meeting our leadership expectations. If you do not change, you cannot be part of this organization anymore. I believe you can operate differently. I do.\" And I did. I believe these are very talented people who could operate. \"I believe you can operate differently, but it is your responsibility to do so, and I need to see change starting tomorrow.\"\n\n(00:31:20):\nI wanted them to succeed. And in fact, they did. It snapped in, they got it, and one of the... Turned into one of the most influential effective managers in our team over the course of probably the next six to nine months. And I think just clearly saying, \"You are not meeting expectations. You will not be successful here if you continue on this path. I believe you can get here, but it is your responsibility.\" That is the conversation that is clear and kind and honestly very effective in most instances.\n\nLenny (00:31:55):\nThat's an amazing example. Clear is kind, as you said. It reminds me of Kim Scott, who's on the podcast, shared this story about Bob. I don't know if you remember that story at all of just this guy at their company who was just doing a bad job and everyone knew he was doing a bad job, and then they had to fire him. When they're firing him, he's just like, \"Why didn't you tell me? Why didn't anyone tell me that nobody thought I was doing a great job?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:16):\nAnd I honestly think saying, \"You are not doing a good job,\" is much kinder than, \"I think you can improve on this aspect or that aspect.\" Or, \"I've gotten some feedback that you could be better at...\" That's not kind because it doesn't set somebody else up for success either in your organization or somewhere else.\n\nLenny (00:32:36):\nOkay, let's go in a different direction. Let's talk about being a woman in tech.\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:40):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny (00:32:41):\nThis doesn't get talked about a ton on podcasts like this. I know you have a lot of thoughts. Obviously, you've been through a lot. You've had a lot of experiences. There's probably a lot of stories you haven't shared in other places, so I just want to give you a chance to share what you've been through, what you've seen, and any advice you may have.\n\nClaire Vo (00:32:58):\nYeah, and I'm happy to talk about this. I know a lot of people don't want to be defined or consistently asked about being a woman or a mom in a C-level leadership role. Let's not have women in tech panels anymore. But I've been reflecting a bit on this lately because I just came from a few years in healthcare, which, from my experience, it's a lot more women in leadership roles. I was a little spoiled, even in our technology organization. And now, I'm back in startups and tech, where the ratios are completely opposite, especially in roles like engineering, which is a team that I run.\n\n(00:33:30):\nAnd look, this is just, it's math. I think Carta said that 13-something percent of founders last year were women. It's declining year over year. FEMA led founded teams, or at least 2% of venture capital, women hold 30% of senior leadership org roles. Women are 30% of software engineering teams. This is just math. We're just facts. We're not in the room in the equal proportions. And as somebody who has, despite the numbers, had a fairly successful career so far in technology, I feel like I owe it to the industry to say it hasn't been easy and it's still not easy, even at my level.\n\n(00:34:09):\nAnd what I want to be clear about, because it gets talked about a lot in forms like this, this is not about imposter syndrome. How could I have any right to imposter syndrome? I've proven myself. I've been a founder, I've raised venture capital, I've had a successful exit. I've been, as you said, a CPO across increasing large teams. I get to invest in red companies. I'm on boards. I get to be on this podcast. I'm a TikTok influencer. This is not about feeling like an imposter. It's really about, it is hard and it is different, and the numbers pencil out in a way that is not favorable to women.\n\n(00:34:47):\nAnd as you said, there's been a lot of stuff in the past that you look at me now and you say, \"Oh, she did associate and all the way up,\" but I had to fight for my all-girls school to carry computer science at the same rate that the all-boys school had it naturally. I grew up in teeny tiny startups in the early aughts. I saw some nonsense. I had VCs tell me, \"Don't get pregnant,\" when I was... These things happened. And yet here I am, and it's fine.\n\n(00:35:21):\nAnd I'm not complaining. I just think what people also don't understand is that stuff still happens. I don't need to litigate who it happens with, where it happens. It still happens. I have arrived and it still happens. And the reason I bring this up is I think it should be a point of reflection for industry, and I think it can be a really effective point of reflection for women who want to get into leadership roles.\n\n(00:35:46):\nAnd the way I approach it is I'm just very curious. I wonder what is structural about technology that creates these things happen? What is cultural? What is external? What has happened to me or happens around me? What is internal? What do I bring into the room that doesn't serve me? And so I try to stay very curious. And then constant product thinker, what are the points of leverage I can use to move things not just forward for me, but for the industry broadly? How can I influence thinking? Where can I not? Where can I walk away from things?\n\n(00:36:24):\nAnd then as for the internal aspect of it, I think this is also a very powerful thing, which is I try to stay in an empowered space. I know my value. I have no time for imposter syndrome. It's not a constructive thing for me, but I do think knowing that, as I said earlier, the universe is bendable to your will. There are things we can change. I don't think these numbers are not tractable. And so my recommendation and what I'd love to say to the industry generally, to women in particular, is curiosity and empowerment have been my path to joy in this sometimes complicated industry. And I think there's a lot better we can do. There's a little bit of ways to go.\n\nLenny (00:37:10):\nIs there a story that you could share if you're comfortable of just something you've gone through or been through that maybe people are like, \"Oh, wow, I see what stuff she's dealing with or other women are dealing with that I had no sense of?\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:37:21):\nI've been trying to wrap my head around this one, which is I consistently get asked if I'm technical enough. Not even if I'm technical enough. Let's put enough aside. If I'm technical. And it's fascinating to me because as a technical co-founder of my startup, I wrote code for the first 12 months solo. I led the engineering team there. That code is still in production in very large environments. I have run multi-hundred people, engineering teams for many years, and I spend my Saturdays and Sundays shipping code. This is what I do. And truly, the first question most people ask me is, \"Oh, well you're not technical though. You're a product person.\"\n\n(00:38:11):\nAnd I've been really trying to unpack where that is coming from. It's hard for me to imagine somebody else that looks different, that has a different name, that has a different gender getting that question with my background. And so that's one of those things that has really been spinning my head. Again, it's not about imposter syndrome. I don't have anything to prove to people, but I am quite curious where that orientation comes from. And if it comes to somebody like me, who has really had some proven success, I know it's happening to other people, and I'm hoping that I can do something from my position to turn that a little bit.\n\nLenny (00:38:50):\nAnd this connects to what you shared, the advice you had of just try to get curious about why it's happening, which is exactly what you just said. Is that just mostly to help you not get upset and frustrated? Let me just understand, why is this happening again and again?\n\nClaire Vo (00:39:02):\nOne, I do think sitting in your power is very effective. And so curiosity means that I'm in control, and I do think I'm in control more than I'm not. That's one part of it is, I think. And the other thing is I think a lot of this is it's complicated. It's structural, it's cultural. It's what you see and what you don't see, not just in the workplace. It's what you see and don't see in media. Am I reading my 7-year-old and my 4-year-old books of, \"My grandma's a software engineer?\"\n\n(00:39:35):\nBooks called the Mom Test, which I actually think is a great book, but it has this underlying presumption of who is technical, who's not, who understands things, who doesn't. And that all bubbles up into how individuals experience an industry that's driving tremendous economic growth here, where at the end of the day, it's about economic participation. It can be about individuals and aspirations, but it is also about economic participation.\n\n(00:40:00):\nThe reason I'm curious about it is I do think it's complicated and I do think you can be successful, but I don't think we're being successful at the rates I would love to see. And I think we're missing a lot of innovation and a lot of economic growth by not having incredible, technical, capable women start companies and lead organizations. And so I think we're all missing out for that, and I'd love to see more of it.\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\nAnd is there an answer to how do we do this better? Anything you think, hey, you've seen work to help get us past this?\n\nClaire Vo (00:40:34):\nI think normalize seeing it, so thanks for bringing me on this podcast, but I do think normalize seeing it is one of the simplest ways. If you close your eyes and imagine a software engineer, my dream is you imagine a diverse set of folks. You don't imagine a very specific art type. And so I do think you can't believe it unless you see it, and so the more that you can provide platforms for diverse voices to talk about their journey in technology, expose that there are leaders out there that come from different backgrounds, technically, culturally, all those things, the more the industry can imagine different types of leaders in different types of roles.\n\n(00:41:17):\nAnd so I just want to see it more. I want to invest more and raise the voices of female founders. I want to call out their amazing female CTOs out there, all those things. And I think if you can see it, you can start to unlock these very embedded concepts of who is and is not a technology leader who is and is not technical.\n\nLenny (00:41:40):\nAwesome. I love that advice. It's something I try really hard to do with this podcast.\n\n(00:41:44):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I haven't actually heard the story.\n\nClaire Vo (00:42:45):\nYeah, this was a fun one. Again, this is the universe is bendable to your will and lean into your power, which is, I had been running Experiment Engine, which was a platform for enterprises to run high scale experimentation programs. Not necessarily the underlying A/B testing technology, but all the stuff around hypothesis gathering, insights, aggregation, operations, keeping things on track. Because I really know, as you do, that high scale experimentation programs can be very impactful to businesses.\n\n(00:43:19):\nThat being said, it was like a niche inside in industry, as opposed to a large TAM problem. And so I think we just fundamentally hit a TAM ceiling here. We had a great product for a great market that was very narrow. And three years, four years into running the company, I knew that to be true and I knew that we would be better served by being part of a larger organization, and one of those organizations could be a large testing company. And so I remember that was noodling on my mind, but we were also really trying to sell to enterprises.\n\n(00:43:52):\nAnd I heard that Microsoft, who was one of our biggest customers, was doing a experimentation day with Optimizely, and I knew Optimizely was a natural acquirer. And I knew I had to get into that room, so I called Microsoft and I said, \"Hey, friend of Microsoft, I'm going to be up in Seattle seeing our other customer, very large Seattle company, this week, week of experimentation day. Could we stop by?\" And they're like, \"Oh yeah, sure.\" Well, then I went to other big Seattle companies and said, \"Hey, other big Seattle company, I'm going to be up Microsoft at their experimentation day. Would you be...\"\n\n(00:44:34):\nI got these two meetings to manifest against each other, and then I walked into that experimentation day and I eyeballed the CFO of Optimizely and I sat in front of him and started pulling up the product and coding at the same time. I was just like, \"I'm going to sit in front of him in the row and I'm going to do this and we're going to have my screens.\" And then I went up and did a demo. And I'm not saying that's the thing that made it happen, but I will say very quickly after that, we became very close partners and ultimately they acquired me.\n\n(00:45:06):\nAnd I give this advice to founders because one of the things that, and founders and PMs, one of the things that I really hire for is scrappiness. I think you have to be able to do a lot with a little, and I think you have to know where you're getting and, come hell or high water, figure out a way to get there. And this was a very fun example of working my way into the right room, setting myself up for the success that I wanted, and having the backing, the good job, the great product, the outcomes to earn it. But you also have to get yourself in the room.\n\nLenny (00:45:39):\nAnd how many months pregnant were you?\n\nClaire Vo (00:45:44):\nI was extremely pregnant. A ticking time bomb of a belly is a really good negotiation tactic in a deal. I think I remember when we were negotiating the final term sheet, I was 34 weeks pregnant, something like that, and they said, \"Can you fly out to San Francisco?\" I was in Austin at the time. And I said, \"Literally, you can fly me out today and back tomorrow, and then I'm not allowed on planes.\" And that's how. It was very fun. It was fun, and what a happy acquisition. I can talk all day about how that was great. Great experience.\n\nLenny (00:46:11):\nAnd I love it's another example of the phrase you've been coming back to of bending, I don't know if it's bending the world to your will.\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:17):\nBending the universe towards your will.\n\nLenny (00:46:19):\nThe universe? Even bigger. I love it. It feels like a recurring theme here, is to take agency and control where your career and life is going. And that's such a good example of just finding a way into this room that would be very hard for someone to get into.\n\n(00:46:33):\nYou've touched on the CTPO role that I haven't heard much about. And I know that this is a big topic for you, and I feel like there might be a trend happening here of combining engineering product. Can you just talk about this role and why you think it might be emerging?\n\nClaire Vo (00:46:51):\nYeah, I get asked about it a lot because it's not super rare, but it's not super common either, and I think it could potentially be rising. And I'm using CPTO for short code of running product and engineering design functionally together. It's very different. I've done both. It's very different than a pure product or a VP product role.\n\n(00:47:13):\nAnd so first, I talked a little bit about how I got into this role. I do think you have to be technical to do a role like this. I think a lot of people look at my professional background and think that I use my broad leadership skills and leverage of a great SVP to keep engineering team going. But no, actually I spent quite a bit of time on the engineering side, because as somebody who is responsible for the business outcomes of the product, one of the best ways to drive value is having a highly performant engineering team that works on a scalable platform.\n\n(00:47:45):\nAnd so I spend a lot of time making sure that we're building the right architectural decisions, that our infrastructure meets the needs of our team, that our edge team is operating in a way that drives velocity. And I just don't think you can do that job if you don't understand how software gets built on a technical level. So I'm the kind of person that when we're doing a product review, I have the PRD up and GitHub up and I'm comparing both, because I think both sides matter.\n\n(00:48:10):\nI think the other thing that's different about this role is it's quite operational, and so you really have to know about operations and organization design. Edge teams are by nature much larger than product organizations. You just think about the classic ratios, there are more people in engineering than there are in product. And the talent challenges are significantly different in engineering, whether it's the high volume of recruiting, culture-shaped challenges are different. You have to really think about org design. And so you have to have a different level of mindset around organization design and operations when you're in a CPTO role.\n\n(00:48:51):\nYou're on pager duty. You're getting paged at 1:00 AM if a service, if there's a Sub-Zero and it goes down. That is not what it's like to be a product leader. So you got to know what you're getting into and you have to be technical. And then the thing I would be remiss to say about this role is the P and the T get a lot of air time. Product and engineering get a lot of air time. Design data, these are such functional, very important organizations, and why these roles get... That's what the role is and how you could be good at it or whether it would be a fit for your skills.\n\n(00:49:24):\nThe question of why have this kind of role, and I think there's two reasons. There's the obvious strategic reason of, they're all the same thing. They're all building capital P product, they're all builders, they're the same types of folks, they're all builders, and bringing them under one house allows you to optimize for the whole, as opposed to optimize for the function. And if you can find a leader that is effective at that, I think you can get a lot of value added. And honestly, the second thing is it provides a tremendous amount of leverage to the CEO in many ways. At the end of the day, R&D is a very expensive and complicated investment the company is making, and having a single person responsible for R&D investment at the executive level is quite important, especially when you're candidly spending a lot there.\n\n(00:50:21):\nAnd so I think it's those two things. It's, these are one team. There should be be no debates over what's best for product or what's best for engineering, what's best for design. It should be what is best for the organization at whole. What do our customers need and what do our business needs? And then it's the accountability candidly of this quite meaningful investment against business objectives and having a singularly responsible individual to care for that investment.\n\nLenny (00:50:46):\nIt sounds wonderful, having one person to deal with across all these functions.\n\nClaire Vo (00:50:50):\nIt is and isn't. I'll just say, I've done both. I've been a CPO next to an SVP of Eng. I've run both together. Founders can play this role. And again, this is why I say you have to optimize around talent in your organization. If your CEO has the skills, bandwidth, et cetera, to do this, they can do this. You can keep the organization separate. They can hold that. If they have a different area of expertise, if they've never done that before, if it's just not working operationally, they have broader areas of focus, then bring it together under someone. I don't think there's a perfect organization structure. This has just been one that's worked well in the shape of organizations that need someone like me.\n\nLenny (00:51:33):\nAnd along the same lines, designing an org around the person, I imagine there's not many very engineering background experience people that are also really good at product and can do design. I guess how deep do you need to be in each of these functions to be successful in this role? Because it feels really rare.\n\nClaire Vo (00:51:51):\nStart a company and then you have to do it, in some ways. I've worked for both and they've told me, I've worked for two, they go, \"I'm not a founder, but I'm the CEO.\" And I go, \"That's fine. I'm an operator, but I'm going to bring a founder mindset.\"\n\n(00:52:08):\nAnd so I think as a founder, especially early stage, you do all of this. You see how all of this is one person, because honestly sometimes it is one person, and sometimes that person is you. And so I do think working in a very small startup gives you the opportunity to experience a breadth of functional skills and develop a breadth of functional skills that can set you up for this kind of role much further down the line. I do think early stage startup experience is one of those shortcuts to getting visibility here.\n\n(00:52:46):\nI think the other thing is, again, I said this earlier, so many people get siloed into, \"I'm a product manager, and so my job is this, but it's not that. And I can only do this, and if designs are needed, I am blocked and I will just wait.\" And I just give permission for people to make... We have a leadership principle inside our team that's like, \"There are no lanes.\" Our lanes are dotted. They're not solid in that you can shift over and pencil out a design, an engineer can write a spec. All those things are fine. They're natural, they're normal, and I actually think they're quite healthy. And it's that kind of thinking that probably is going to breed the type of leaders that could do this type of role.\n\nLenny (00:53:29):\nAwesome. It reminds me at GitLab. I just interviewed their head of product, or CPO, and they have a core value of, \"Short toes.\" Don't worry about stepping on people's toes. Have short toes. Don't worry about people getting into your stuff. It's all good.\n\nClaire Vo (00:53:43):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:53:43):\nOkay. You mentioned AI. Amazing segue to my next topic that I want to spend some time on. You built a tool called ChatPRD. My guess is it's the single most popular AI PM-specific tool out there, other than some big company's tool like, I don't know, Sprague or Figma or something like that. First of all, just what is ChatPRD, and then why did you build it?\n\nClaire Vo (00:54:06):\nYeah. ChatPRD comes out of, again, pace setting. And I'll actually tell you the real genesis of ChatPRD, which is at a previous company we had a quite technical product we needed to build. We're scrappy and resource-constrained, and our platform PMs were working on something very important, but this was critical and we needed to get it done. And we didn't really have a platform technical PM to spec this thing out. And it was quite complicated.\n\n(00:54:35):\nAnd I raised my hand and I said, \"I'll IC this. I think I know what we need.\" And between the beginning of the meeting and the end of the meeting, I had used ChatGPT and a prompt to come up with a very serviceable PRD spec for this very technical product. And I took that prompt and that long-running ChatGPT thread and crafted the Claire version of a product leader or product person that could, with really solid consistency, output product specs, give good feedback, build out plans, build out tracking mechanisms and goals.\n\n(00:55:20):\nAnd so while I say, \"She may just be a prompt, but she is prompt,\" this was lovingly crafted over several months. And so when the GPT Store came out, for my team I just said, \"Hey, you all know I've been writing PRDs with ChatGPT.\" I created a GPT and just gave it to my team. I was like, \"Here, you can use this if you want it.\" And they really liked it, and other people started asking about it and I eventually ran into the monetization and access wall that is the GPT Store right now. And so I've also been having a lot of fun coding again, and so I thought, this is easy. We're just going to stand up a standalone app and wrap, come on, it's a wrapper, it started as wrapper, wrap some of these capabilities and just publish it and put a fairly reasonable price tag on it and see what happens.\n\n(00:56:12):\nAnd now, I have thousands of people using ChatPRD. Every day, people are creating dozens of specs and PRDs every month. It's everything from, \"I'm an engineer on a team with too few PMs and I get blocked, so I'm going to build my own requirements,\" to, \"I'm a solo founder and I need to put some structure on my thought for my team,\" to, \"I'm a PM and this has saved me truly hours of work to get the basics of my product requirements done so I can spend time on the details.\" And then I've added on more functions and capabilities than the standalone app. It is my personal product copilot that I've released for the world.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nOkay. First of all, where can people check this out? Is it chatprd.com?\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:53):\n.ai. Come on.\n\nLenny (00:56:54):\n.ai, of course.\n\nClaire Vo (00:56:54):\nYeah, chatprd.ai.\n\nLenny (00:56:58):\nI saw some stuff about the country that has .ai is just making so much bank right now.\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:01):\nSo much money.\n\nLenny (00:57:02):\nAll these domains.\n\n(00:57:04):\nThen in terms of the stack, just to be clear, so it started as a ChatGPT prompt, custom prompt, you evolved, then it became a GPT, a custom GPT, and now it's your own app that is using the OpenAI APIs behind-\n\nClaire Vo (00:57:17):\nIt is, yeah. It's using the assistance APIs. And what's different about the standalone app versus the GPT is every person that uses the standalone app gets a customized assistant. It learns from their specific content. It learns from their role. It learns from their company. If you use the GPT version, you're not getting that customization. When you use the standalone app, you are getting that customization. And then I've layered on a couple of different capabilities. In addition to having the chat format, it will actually create the document for you and iterate on the actual doc for you, and then working on some additional tools and integrations in the future.\n\nLenny (00:57:55):\nOkay, great. What are the most common use cases again? Just so people can get a sense of, \"Oh, let me use this for these things.\"\n\nClaire Vo (00:58:00):\nYeah, about 60% of people use it to put in an idea and get a PRD out. Just get the specs of what are my objectives and user goals, what are user stories, what is out of scope, walk through the UX. In our standard template, I have what's called a narrative, which is, how do you pitch this product? Which I feel like is a thing product managers miss a lot, which is how to position and pitch it, sequencing and milestones, measurements and goals, all those sorts of things.\n\n(00:58:33):\nNow, that's the out-of-the-box template. As I said, you can actually customize what your PRD template is in ChatPRD if you do something different or want something different for your company. About 60% of people are using it for that. 30% of people, I would say, are using it to put in a spec or a PRD or a strategy doc or a roadmap and improve it. And then the rest are using it to brainstorm ideas, internal PM work. How do I come up with a good agenda for X, Y, and Z? That kind of stuff.\n\nLenny (00:59:02):\nAmazing. Okay, so I wrote a post recently sharing a bunch of examples of how people are using different GPT specifically at work, and I think it's spurred a lot of people to experiment with this stuff. If there's one tip that you could share for someone that's trying to build a GPT or their own custom app using APIs, any advice?\n\nClaire Vo (00:59:24):\nPrompt matters. We went through this whole cycle of prompt engineering is a thing, it's not really a thing, fine-tuning is... Prompt really does matter, and a good PM, I do competitive analysis. I use the same input and look at different GPT or ChatGPT. I look at the GPT Store version, I look at other PM tools that do this and I look at mine. I think mine is actually better.\n\n(00:59:50):\nAnd then I'm getting into a mode now where I may do some model experimentation and tuning behind the scenes, so it might not be OpenAI, it may be other things, but it matters. The instructions matter, the context matters for the quality of the output is something that I would say when building these kinds of products. I think the other thing is there is no solution right now for monetization. Knock on wood, open it and we'll figure it out. If I had more time, maybe I would create a platform out of what I've created for ChatGPT to let other people monetize their GPTs and add on capabilities. But it's not out of the box yet for folks. There's a lot of work that I had to do to get it from here to there.\n\nLenny (01:00:31):\nAre you making real money with this thing? And is it an idea that this becomes the thing you do someday maybe long term?\n\nClaire Vo (01:00:38):\nMy original goal, and I said this out on X, my original goal is I just want to buy a nice glass of wine a week. That was my goal. I could buy cases of wine now. This is very exciting for me. It's making what I would consider real money. Is it a venture scale thing? No. Does it need to be? No. I have a goal around my kids' education expenses. I would love for this to cover a little bit. I have a ambitious but not audacious goal for ChatPRD.\n\n(01:01:13):\nThe other goal that I have, which is, let's put monetization aside, is this is my joy space, zone of genius joy space. And my goal with ChatPRD is it has to be a hundred percent fun for me. This is my hobby, so I'm not doing anything that makes it not fun. It is a pure bliss space for me. I get to code on the weekends, I get to do customer support at night, and I get to build things that I would use. I get to learn new technologies. I want to keep it in that space because it provides a lot of joy for me. Put money aside, I just want it to be fun.\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\nLove that. Okay, so some people listening to this, especially PMs, may be like, \"Claire, what the hell are you doing? Are you going to replace product managers in a year or two?\" This connects to something I've just generally been thinking about and that's come up a bunch, is just over time, which skills and jobs of a product manager will be greatly enhanced by AI and which will be completely replaced by AI, if any, so that people can understand which skills they should be investing in and which maybe are less important.\n\n(01:02:22):\nI guess just broadly, do you have a sense of just here's skills that are going to continue to be incredibly important and AI will not take these skills and jobs off your plate? Versus, these are going to be the less important, AI will do these?\n\nClaire Vo (01:02:36):\nAt the highest level, I tend to be very short-term pessimistic, although I'll frame that short-term pessimistic and very long-term optimistic. I am a big believer that technology has made society generally much more affluent, wealthier, happier, healthier. I am a big believer in technology and I am optimistic about its impact on the human race. There are lots of things that are not going well, but I really do believe that innovation and technology, I'm excited for my kid's future. I'm not afraid of it.\n\n(01:03:11):\nNow, that being said, I am of the mind excitedly that this is going to change stuff in companies incredibly quickly. And part of building ChatPRD is I hold myself to the bar as a technology leader, I need to be leading the league on understanding what this can disrupt, using these tools to make a better team, and actually shifting the size and shape of my organization in response to the technology around us. Is it going to eliminate PMs next year? Probably not. Are the ratios between PMs and other teams going to shift over time? Yes. Are the skills required going to shift? Yes. Could they shift much faster than we all anticipate? Probably. I think there's a lot of change coming and I want to be prepared for it.\n\n(01:04:00):\nNow, what do I think this replaces and what does it not replace? I was reflecting on this question and communication, lowercase C, I feel like is one of the places that's going to be replaced. And I call it lowercase C. It's the functional trading of information that allows other people to do jobs. I think that these language models and these tools are really good synthesizing information, putting together communication, and can coordinate who that communication goes to and get it out in many modalities of content.\n\n(01:04:41):\nAnd so I'm really thinking about the PM as the keeper of cross-functional relationships and communication is really, I think, potentially going to change. Now, but capital C communication of are you influential? Are you convincing? Are you bold? Can you get this system of humans to follow you down a path? That's, I think, going to be much harder to replace, and so I'm thinking about the edges of communication and where they'll change and what they won't.\n\nLenny (01:05:15):\nThat's really interesting. I did a little poll on Twitter asking people of between communication, execution, strategy, and product sense, which skills are most likely to be basically taken over by AI. And communication was number one, by far. I have a contrarian perspective. And strategy was the least voted. I feel like, so strategy work is essentially, \"Here's everything we know about the world and competitors and the market and our advantages. Here's a plan to win in the market essentially.\" I feel like that's what AI is incredibly good at.\n\nClaire Vo (01:05:49):\nI agree with you. I totally agree with you. I think, and again this comes to synthesis, good decision-making, and communication, if you can synthesize, distill it into a plan and communicate that plan, I found these tools exceptional. Use ChatPRD and give it a try.\n\n(01:06:09):\nNow, I think it's the human aspect though of boldness, seeing the future in a way that a thing trained on priors cannot. Those things I still think, and then charisma and attracting all those things to actually make the thing happen are pretty hard to replicate, which is why I love using ChatPRD. I'm not going to come up with the most genius way to do data export for Snowflake for some... That is a solved area that we should just scaffold up. I should customize it to what we do, and then we should ship it. That is not a place where my magic skills as a human are going to impact.\n\n(01:06:54):\nBut I don't think a lot of PMs see it that way. I think there's this real identity shift that's going to happen where PMs think that their value is coming from their ideas that they manifest into the world and how they individually manifest them. And I think we're going to shift to, are you building the right stuff? Are you building it quickly? And is it delivering? No matter what the tool chain is.\n\nLenny (01:07:19):\nYeah. I think your point about getting buy-in and getting everyone aligned, I don't know how an AI bot does that unless everybody's got their own little bot and they're all talking to each other.\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:29):\nThey all just get along.\n\nLenny (01:07:30):\nWe're in. I'll [inaudible 01:07:32] this a little higher.\n\nClaire Vo (01:07:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\nI actually made this list. I feel like this could be the entire podcast, but I made it a quick list of, \"Here's the jobs of a PM.\" And it's interesting. I don't know if this is really a question, but it's just interesting to think about which of these will some ChatPRD maybe do in the future. What does the job feel? You're writing PRDS, you're setting goals, proposing a roadmap, aligning a team behind a roadmap, developing a strategy, developing a vision, communicating timelines, finding blockers, and unblocking people, getting buy-in from up on high, getting budget resources for your team, giving feedback on product and design. Those are just some of the day-to-day jobs. I'm so curious just which of these AI can actually just do and not have to worry about it.\n\nClaire Vo (01:08:17):\nI think a lot of them AI can do. And so the question is, which of them do you want to hand the keys to an AI tool? And which of them are going to be much more valuable as a tool that an individual or a team's intellect can use to do a better, faster, higher impact job?\n\n(01:08:38):\nAgain, I believe in technology and I think this stuff, what's interesting about this moment right now is every week I see something that I would not have in a million years thought was possible three years ago. Every week, something new comes out where it just changes my mind of what's possible. I believe all of those are 80% good functionally tractable. The question is, is 80% good functionally tractable the best way to do that? Or can we take a certain type of person with a certain skill set backed by a purpose-built toolkit and make it 3X better, 4X better, 10X better? I think that's the more interesting question.\n\nLenny (01:09:16):\nI think on the point of amazing things are happening every day, we had SpaceX launched the Starship and it was barely mentioned anywhere. We have the spaceship that could take us to Mars and, \"Meh, we don't need to talk about that.\"\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:31):\nWe get the kids up and stream it on YouTube.\n\nLenny (01:09:32):\nOh, that's awesome.\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:33):\nIt's magic. We live in this magic time. I think it's so fascinating. But I agree, we're getting spoiled by innovation.\n\nLenny (01:09:41):\nYou said that there's this ratio that might shift with product managers, engineers. I'm curious which ratio, because engineers are also getting more efficient, and so it's interesting if the ratios will be consistent as engineers become more efficient, PMs get it more efficient.\n\nClaire Vo (01:09:53):\nI wonder if whole roles get eliminated and replaced, and then ratios aren't even the right way to think about things. There's the ratio of this PM role to this many, one PM to seven to 10 engineers or one EM to... There's those ratios.\n\n(01:10:12):\nI also think there's going to be this interesting shift of as a manager, as a leader, how you allocate budget against tools and people I also think is going to shift. And I saw something where somebody said that every role that they got asked to open, the team had to spend a week trying to automate it before they were allowed to open the JD. It's just this very interesting... In my mind people, think that's scary and it's going to reduce jobs. Yes, and I do think there's also potentially other jobs that open up that can become very interesting.\n\n(01:10:45):\nAnd so I don't know how it's going to pencil out. I really don't. What I do know is things are going to change and I, as a leader and a person that cares for people's long-term careers, want to be much more forward-thinking than close my eyes to what the possible maybe dramatic changes are in our industry. I'm thinking about it, I'm experimenting with things, and I'm hoping that in our team in LaunchDarkly we're leading from the front here as opposed to on our back foot.\n\nLenny (01:11:17):\nI'm thinking many people listening here are like, \"Okay, I need to get on top of this. I need to stay ahead. I want to follow Claire's lead.\" Is your advice simply create GPTs, play with ChatGPT? Is there anything else there to help people?\n\nClaire Vo (01:11:29):\nI also think PMs need to be thinking about building product skills particularly around these non-deterministic products. It's been [inaudible 01:11:40]. Part of why I built ChatPRD is not just to stress test how these sorts of things are going to change the product function. It's literally, this is a new type of product built by a new type of technology and it's moving very fast. And learning how to build these kinds of products, if you can do that, I just think back to when mobile happened, if you're a PM that jumped on mobile, you had the pick of the litter when it came to jobs in very interesting startups.\n\n(01:12:11):\nAnd so I think we're in the same moment here where, if you can ratchet down and specialize and learn a new technology, you actually can get into very interesting positions. Those are both of my motivations on ChatPRD, is understand how it impacts the function that I lead, but also understand how to build a great product with these underlying technologies that are just much different than the technologies that I personally built on before.\n\nLenny (01:12:37):\nAnd so for someone, let's say, not super engineering-oriented, I guess how do you recommend people on your team explore this sort of thing? Is it [inaudible 01:12:46]?\n\nClaire Vo (01:12:45):\nYeah. I do think studying products that are out there is quite interesting. I love this idea of doing outside-in product tear-downs. What is good about this? What is bad about this? How would I have written the PRD here? What would I be measuring? How would I think about error states? How would I think about if this is a great product, a good product, or an okay product? I do think doing that sort of crit on an external product can be a really accessible way to start to stress test your own skills around this and figure out where there are gaps.\n\n(01:13:20):\nThat's one thing I think you can do. Two, I think there's a lot of no-code, low-code stuff you can play with. Even if you can't put your hands on keyboard and write code, you can certainly stitch together things and try some no-code tools. That's another way to do it. The other thing is find where it's fun. I think how fun is Midjourney? How fun are some of these more creative tools? And so find where there's something fun and build art out of it as a mechanism for learning. It doesn't always have to be commercially driven. It doesn't have to be part of work. It can just be find a space that you're personally interested in and play with what's out there.\n\nLenny (01:14:00):\nAwesome. One last question about ChatPRD. With Copilot, there's all these stats. It's making engineers 50% more efficient, whatever percentage. Do you have any sense of efficiency gains so far with ChatPRD?\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:14):\nI have qualitative feedback from product managers who have used ChatPRD, who have said, \"This has saved me dozens of hours I would've spent on writing documents.\" And another person said, \"I am a single PM on a team that's growing and I don't think we're going to have to hire another PM now.\" There's the people, there's both the individual aspect and the hours aspect, which is it's helping individuals PMs get higher leverage across a broad engineering or building team, and that it's helping them spend their time more effectively.\n\nLenny (01:14:57):\nMany people don't want to hear that they don't need to hire a PM. There's many people looking for jobs right now.\n\nClaire Vo (01:14:59):\nIt's true, but we can't... I think we saw this in the last couple of years. Inefficiently hiring and building unsustainable costs into a company leads no one to success. And if that's a lesson that I can teach anybody, it's sustainability in organizations is the responsibility of a leader. Yes, I would love to give everybody positions. There are not positions to have. And the best I can do for the people in the team is be really responsible and really thoughtful about that because that helps me grow their careers and helps me sustain their careers long-term.\n\n(01:15:41):\nIt's incredibly complicated, but also on the flip side, this is a very small startup. They can't afford another PM and they're extending their runway to build something transformational by not growing the team. And so, yes, people [inaudible 01:15:57] their teams and have these jobs and startups can't afford it, and they still have great things to do in the world.\n\nLenny (01:16:04):\nGreat answer. To start to wrap up our conversation, I have these two segments, Failure Corner and Contrarian Corner, and we can pick which corner you want to head to. Would you like to share a story of your career where you failed and something you learned from that? Or something you believe that most people don't believe? Which corner sounds more interesting?\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:24):\nI'll take Contrarian Corner.\n\nLenny (01:16:26):\nLet's go for there.\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:27):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:16:28):\nI need some sound effects for these corners. Do share.\n\nClaire Vo (01:16:33):\nI'm sharing this because you just released your podcast with Marty again. And I'm a sales-led product apologist unabashedly, which is, I think that it is okay to listen to the market and to be commercially oriented in products in ways that probably would make some folks in some types of product organizations squirm a little bit. And the reason why I believe this is I think there are tremendous businesses built on sales-led motions. And I disagree with the fact that that means you do not care for the craft or the experience of users. I think it can be the best of both worlds.\n\n(01:17:19):\nI love sales. I say if I was not in this role, put me on a quota and make me enterprise West. I love to sell, but I think product teams, this opposition we have industry-wide with sales-led I'm not convinced is healthy in every organization. And I was listening to the podcast and I think you all were talking about, you said, \"SAP is like this. And who wants to be SAP?\" Man alive. There are a lot of companies out there that would love to be SAP, now with a better product, with better experience, with more love from the industry maybe. But what a powerhouse company. And I think we as PMs turn our nose up to powerhouse companies too often because we want companies to be product-led, not sales-led.\n\nLenny (01:18:07):\nAmazing. I'm going to not go deeper into this topic because I don't want to be speaking on behalf of Marty's perspective, but there's so much debate that came out of that episode and I love that it trickles to more opinions being shared about ways product can work.\n\n(01:18:20):\nI guess, just to understand your takeaway here, is sales-led companies can be awesome. They can build amazing businesses, and it can be great to be a PM at a company like that.\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:27):\nYeah, and they can build great products.\n\nLenny (01:18:30):\nGreat. Claire, is there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nClaire Vo (01:18:39):\nI will say, because we've been talking a lot about AI and replacing PMs, I love to sell. I love to help people get jobs, so if there are ways that I can help people find great fit companies, it's one of the things that I get a lot of energy out of. I just want to say that in the world. It's something that sparks a lot of joy. I get a lot of it inbound, \"Can you help me get in here? Can you help me get there?\" But if there is a tractable way that I can help you get to a connected to a company or a role that you think is great for you, that's fun for me and I'm totally open to it.\n\nLenny (01:19:09):\nHow would people reach out to you to try to help you get them [inaudible 01:19:13]?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:15):\nI am, of course, on LinkedIn. I'm on X at ClaireVo, all one word. And then if you really want to go into the archives, I have a very fabulous TikTok where I'm ChiefProductOfficer. It's all one word.\n\nLenny (01:19:27):\nAmazing. We'll link to all these in the show notes. And we will refresh these two facts at the end of the podcast anyway, because I always ask this anyway. Before we do that, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:28):\nI am so ready.\n\nLenny (01:19:41):\nOkay. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nClaire Vo (01:19:46):\nHigh Growth Handbook I love, and I like Scaling People. These are two books that the reason why I recommend them to people is because they have solid playbook answers to 80%, 90% of everyday leadership scaling people questions. And so they're just great reference books for what I think great leadership inside startups can look like, and they solve some of the things that you don't need to solve novel-ly. And then one on the fiction side that I've been recommending is Circe, which is a retelling of Circe's story from her perspective. It's a great read, and everybody I've recommended it to really loves it.\n\nLenny (01:20:28):\nFrom Game of Thrones?\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:31):\nNo, Circe from the Odyssey. Odysseus [inaudible 01:20:34]. She turns men into pigs.\n\nLenny (01:20:36):\n[inaudible 01:20:36] lack of culture.\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:37):\nIt's great. My kids are very into Greek mythology, so this is me meeting them on my side.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nAmazing. The first two books are both Straight Press. Shout out to Straight Press.\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:46):\nYeah, Straight Press.\n\nLenny (01:20:47):\nAnd I have both books in the back there, and my laptop's actually sitting on Scaling People.\n\n(01:20:52):\nNext question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nClaire Vo (01:20:57):\nI have kids, so I don't get to go see movies. Movies are, that's an adventure. It's basically a vacation. I saw Poor Things, which if you like capital W weird capital A art, highly recommend Poor Things. The show that I recommend to people, I love Mythic Quest. Everybody references Silicon Valley, but Mythic Quest gets at some of, I was in gaming once, gets at some of my experiences in the technology organizations. It's got a technical female lead and think it's quite funny. I like Mythic Quest.\n\nLenny (01:21:31):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:31):\nI like to ask candidates how they would improve our business model. I think so many PMs come in with a point of view of the product and the target market but don't actually understand the underlying mechanisms of how we make money and what our unit economics are and how that could be improved. And the candidates that do come in and have a strong point of view on business model often are pretty successful in our organization.\n\nLenny (01:21:55):\nAnd what do you look for in a good answer that's, \"Oh wow, this candidate's great?\"\n\nClaire Vo (01:21:59):\nIt's thinking along the chain of value from how do we identify people in the market? What does our pricing model look like? What could they hypothesize our underlying unit economics or cogs are? And then where are their points of leverage along that whole funnel? It's really, do they have a mental model for thinking about a business model? Have they thought at all about how we make money, either top line or margin? And then can they identify places where they might improve it?\n\nLenny (01:22:28):\nAwesome. Basically understanding the business really well. Great.\n\n(01:22:30):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:36):\nOkay, I'm going to make you laugh because you've gotten all these cars, right?\n\nLenny (01:22:40):\nYeah, I have such expensive cars.\n\nClaire Vo (01:22:42):\nYou've got expensive cars. It's not new, I love my minivan. I am a big fan of my minivan. As my friend says, \"It's like driving around your living room.\" And when you have two kids, you know what I want to do? I just want to drive around my living room, Bluey included. And so no Rivian, no Mercedes-Benz, but I really love my Pacifica.\n\nLenny (01:23:06):\nPacifica? Okay, I was going to ask.\n\nClaire Vo (01:23:07):\nBut the actual car product that I really love, I love Waymo. We're in San Francisco, we've got these autonomous vehicles. It is, top to bottom, just a lovely product experience from the app to when it shows up, the sound design is great, the cars are comfortable, the displays in the car are great. It is, now every time a tourist comes in, a friend comes in to visit San Francisco, I make them take a round-trip ride in a robot car. And then even I've had a customer service experience with the Waymo team where my friend left an iPhone and [inaudible 01:23:44] and customer experience was great, 24-hour service. Top to bottom, great product design, great service design.\n\nLenny (01:23:53):\nI just got into Waymo actually in the wait list, and so I'm excited to actually try it. I was actually treated as press early on to ride in a Waymo with a person from the company, just to experience it. And then I never got access to it after. Now, I finally can try it.\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:08):\nEnjoy. It's so nice. It's my preferred mode of travel.\n\nLenny (01:24:12):\nThe future. We've talked about a lot of ways the world is changing. That's another great example.\n\n(01:24:18):\nTwo questions to go. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family they find useful in work or in life?\n\nClaire Vo (01:24:26):\nFast beats right. Every time when debating between, do I noodle this for a thousand years and try to come to the perfect solution or do I make a decision and get executing and direction I have conviction on, I consistently see and believe that fast at the end of the day, wins. Fast beats right.\n\nLenny (01:24:51):\nFinal question. You mentioned TikTok. You put a bunch of awesome content out on TikTok. Any advice, slash is there a tip you could share with someone that is trying to be successful on TikTok from your experience?\n\nClaire Vo (01:25:03):\nI've been neglecting my TikTok for a little bit with new job and winter with sick kids. This is my advice, and I think you know this, consistency drives audience growth, which is, when I was on TikTok posting every day, you would get followers and engagement and the algorithm would bless you. And when you don't, you don't. I think consistency in almost all things wins.\n\n(01:25:27):\nThe other thing that I think is a really good advice for any quote-unquote creator of whatever scale, of whatever ambition, is I think thinking about content creation as documentation, not creative generation is really helpful. I just like to talk about what I think about at work and I like to, an interesting meeting or interesting interaction, document why I thought that was interesting or what could be done better. And that becomes the basis of a very natural flow of content for me. It's a tactic that's worked really well for me and helps me do stuff in my free time.\n\nLenny (01:26:00):\nAmazing. It might be time to start exploring Instagram also with all this TikTok news.\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:05):\nI know. Yep.\n\nLenny (01:26:06):\nClaire, before we started this podcast, I asked you what your goal for this was, and it was to be helpful to people. I think we've 100% done that in so many different ways. Thank you again so much for being here.\n\n(01:26:16):\nTwo final questions. We already covered these, but just to refresh people's memories, where can people find you online if they want to reach out? And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:24):\nLinkedIn, X, I'm ClaireVo, all one word. And then on TikTok, get me back into it. Give me a follow, maybe I'll start posting some of my excellent content. But it's @ChiefProductOfficer.\n\nLenny (01:26:37):\nAwesome. And then how can people be useful to you?\n\nClaire Vo (01:26:41):\nHelp each other. That's what I want the most, which is I do really see, it is a tough time in tech right now and there are a lot of people looking for jobs. One, I think help each other. And then the other thing that I really, if I could ask your audience anything, is if you have a job where your job is typing into an internet box to create products out of nothing, really acknowledge the privilege and joy of that job and try to have some fun because a lot of people want to sit where you're sitting. Have fun. Appreciate what you have. Enjoy it. Enjoy each other.\n\nLenny (01:27:13):\nGreat and important advice to leave people with. Claire, thank you so much for being here.\n\nClaire Vo (01:27:13):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:27:18):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:27:21):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The ultimate guide to OKRs | Christina Wodtke (Stanford)\n\n## Transcript\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:00:00):\nI felt like it was a problem that was very solvable. And we ended up renting a stadium to just hire 60,000 drivers in a couple of weeks. So I think looking back, it was certainly a risk. When I got there it was in a house and I realized I've probably made a huge mistake, but we were growing very quickly already, even at that small scale of 4,000 orders per day.\n\nLenny (00:00:29):\nCrystal Widjaja has been leading product and growth teams at some of the largest consumer businesses in Southeast Asia, including Kumu, where she's currently the chief product officer, and Gojek where she built and led the growth team through the early years of what is now the largest super app in Southeast Asia. To put this in context, Gojek completes more rights per day than Lyft and more food deliveries than GrubHub, Uber Eats and DoorDash combined, and it's the number one mobile wallet in Indonesia and Southeast Asia. In my opinion, American startups have a lot to learn from startups in Asia and Crystal has been at the ground floor of some of the biggest successes there.\n\n(00:01:06):\nIn our conversation, we covered the biggest growth unlocks that Crystal has seen across the companies she's worked at, what growth investments usually pay off and which often don't, we dig into growth models, a bunch of tips for accelerating growth, why most analytics efforts fail in how to avoid that, how to hire and structure your growth team, and we also talk about the nonprofit that Crystal started that aims to help young women get into STEM called Generation Girl. Crystal is such a star, and I hope that you enjoy this episode as much as I did. And with that, I bring you Crystal Widjaja. If you're setting up your analytics stack, but you're not using Amplitude, what are you doing? Amplitude is the number one most popular analytic solution in the world used by both big companies like Shopify, Instacart, and Atlassian, and also most tech startups.\n\n(00:01:59):\nAmplitude has everything you need, including a powerful and fully self-service analytics product, an experimentation platform, and even an integrated customer data platform to help you understand your users like never before.

How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (00:02:40):\nAt least 40%?\n\nLenny (00:02:40):\nAnd how many of them screw that up, and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (00:02:43):\nWell, based on our data about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. So if your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chalked full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (00:03:02):\nI am zero percent surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing longterm retention, getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (00:03:17):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify and Zora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go, faster.\n\nLenny (00:03:34):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out Flatfile at flatfile.com/lenny. Crystal, thank you so much for being here. I've read a bunch of your stuff online. We've exchanged a bunch of emails and tweets, but this is the first time that we're actually chatting for real, and so I'm really excited to, yeah I'm excited to learn from you and for folks to learn about you.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:03:56):\nWe may have crossed paths on Clubhouse and the audio forums or on the Twitterverse. So it's really cool to see you.\n\nLenny (00:04:04):\nWow. I just remembered that. That is so right. I think we were talking about Reforge and Eppo. Is that right?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:04:11):\nYes, that's right. Good times.\n\nLenny (00:04:11):\nOh my God. Clubhouse days.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:04:13):\nThe days when club does was a thing. They have a thing too, to learn about exponential decay.\n\nLenny (00:04:18):\nOh man. Okay. Maybe we'll get to that. And we're going to be chatting a lot about consumer growth and a bunch of stuff along those lines. But before you get into that, you have a fairly unusual path and also geography as compared to many of my other guests. And so just to set a little context, could you just walk us through your career path and journey from, I think as an investment banker initially, and then currently as chief product officer at Kumu and then living in Singapore also? So yeah, tell us all about your path.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:04:45):\nYeah. I think my path was certainly a nonstandard one. While I grew up in San Jose, the Bay Area, you could see companies like Lyft emerging around the year that I was graduating college. But really it was how do I graduate college as quickly as possible because this is very boring. So I took a Poli Sci major. I am not a math or a computer science major. I didn't know what a consultant was because I was just trying to get out of college. I didn't realize people start looking for jobs before they'd graduate. So the last two weeks of school I was looking on Craigslist, because I was like, \"Craigslist is how everyone gets a job.\" I'm a first generation American student, so my parents could not help me at all with like, \"You should look into this company called McKinsey,\" or, \"Here are all of the life paths that you have ahead of you.\" So I ended up taking an investment banking research job.\n\n(00:05:46):\nAnd my job there was to figure out how to call startups and analyze their potential for VC financing or M&A advisory. And I barely knew what those words meant at the time. I ended up owning a huge Excel database of 130,000 rows, 60 plus columns. And because again, I am very impatient, I was like, \"This is a terrible experience. How would I create a customer database?\" And so I ended up Google fooling all of the work needed to build a MySQL database, I presented a plan, and investment banking, surprise, surprise, is not very tech forward. So they looked at my plans and they're like, \"What is this MySQL thing? Isn't that super expensive? What is open source?\" So I ended up leaving that job because I realized that if I wanted to get into something more tech, it would probably not be at a investment bank. So I did took the investment banking strategies that I had learned there and applied the same pattern matching to companies in Southeast Asia.\n\n(00:06:55):\nSo my family originally is from Indonesia. I thought I have a kind of safety net, I must speak Indonesian really well just by birth, so maybe that's a great country for me to look at. So I took the approach of let's find a company that makes a lot of sense, that I feel I resonate with. And I literally cold called emails some companies. So Gojek being on that list. I literally emailed someone after Googling HR at Gojek and said, \"I'm willing to move to Indonesia, take a bet on me.\" And they actually did. So I got extremely lucky. Five years fly by insanely fast. I went through building out the data team from scratch. When you have all of the data, you know how much fraud you have in the system. So then I ended up building out the fraud and risk team, picked up performance marketing, and then it was like, okay, now we're ready to grow. So you have all of this data now take on growth.\n\nLenny (00:07:55):\nGot it. You were very modest about Gojek and the success of that company, and also Kumu where you work now. So just to set a little context for folks that aren't familiar with these companies, can you share how big they are and how big of a deal they are in Southeast Asia?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:08:11):\nYeah. They are pretty massive. So Gojek is now called GoTo, they just merged with the largest eCommerce platform in Indonesia. So across Southeast Asia, we had about 170 million users. Southeast Asia has scale. If you ever wanted to work at scale, you would go to Southeast Asia. We had 20 plus different services from transportation to food, shopping, medicine delivery, bill pay, movie tickets. So it was like all of the startups in America in one app, all being built at the same time with the same user base. And so everything was tremendously layered, because you could fill all of these opportunity gaps in the market where a single app would probably not be as sustainable.\n\n(00:09:00):\nSo Gojek is massive across Indonesia, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam. And then Kumu is kind of a super app for social. So Gojek was very transactional. It was like, \"Here's a job to be done. I want to pay for something and someone delivers it to me.\" And with Kumu, it's more so of a, \"I want to do clubhouse, Zoom, Google Hangouts gather around all in one app.\" So we cover social feeds, audio, video, multi seats. There's a ton of different use cases that we serve on Kumu. And Kumu is primarily in the Philippines, but ranks top 10 and a bunch of countries as a top grossing mobile app.\n\nLenny (00:09:40):\nSo with Kumu you joined when they're already doing fairly well. But Gojek, as you said, you joined very early. What did you see in that company that helped you decide to join such a risky, early stage company? For folks that are maybe thinking about joining a startup, what kind of things did you take away of what to look for?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:09:58):\nHonestly, it's probably a lot of luck. But also at that age I realized I have very little to lose. So with Gojek I think I felt like it was the right company because I was able to really clearly understand the value prop. Traffic in Indonesia is crazy. It takes you two hours to go 20 kilometers. So of course you want to take a motorcycle taxi to beat that traffic. Of course, you don't want to go out and get food and then have to come back this long pathway of two hours. So I think taking that Warren Buffet approach, I knew that the product made sense. The market made sense as well. So drivers, there were already a thing, but it was very hard to connect them to the consumer.\n\n(00:10:42):\nIt was painful to haggle prices. There were lots of restaurants scattered across Indonesia. So the value prop and the market made sense and the channel by which you would do it through this mobile app made a little bit less sense at the time because most drivers didn't have a mobile app, but I felt like it was a problem that was very solvable. And we ended up renting a stadium to just hire 60,000 drivers in a couple of weeks. So I think looking back, it was certainly a risk when I got there, it was in a house and I realized I've probably made a huge mistake. But we were growing very quickly already, even at that small scale of 4,000 orders per day.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nI want to spend a lot of time talking about what you learned, driving growth at these companies. But one quick question. So, Gojek's the super app where you do a lot of stuff in one app. Do you have any insights into why a super app hasn't emerged in the US?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:11:40):\nYeah. I think the sentimentality of a conglomerate is very different in Southeast Asia. So we've grown up with a specific conglomerate owning, not just the mall that you go to, but also the apartment building that you live in, and the school that you go to. And so they're very well integrated and there's this sense of trust in a conglomerate. Whereas in America we already shy away from, does Google know too much about me? There's also, I think, the second aspect of it, which is that in Asia, we've kind of leapfrogged to the computer era. So everyone has a phone, but you may not even have a computer in the entire household. And so when your phone is full, are you going to delete a photo of your kid or are you going to delete this app? You're probably going to delete the app. So for anyone to really survive, it has to be part of this super app concept.\n\nLenny (00:12:34):\nOh wow. I've never thought of it that way. That you don't have a lot of space on your phone and so you want one app to do a lot of things.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:12:40):\nThat's right. So there's a decision factor that you don't really have in the US because the cloud storage and device capacity there is a little bit bigger.\n\nLenny (00:12:50):\nInteresting. So in the US you can have different apps to be... Basically a super app doesn't have to be the best at everything. The fact that it does enough and everything good enough. Wow, it's fascinating.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:12:59):\nYou just need to get the job done.\n\nLenny (00:13:02):\nAmazing. Okay. That's super interesting. Okay. So transitioning a bit to growth and things you've learned along the way. So you talked about how, I think Gojek, you said hired tens of thousands of drivers really quickly. Are there things that startups in Asia do that you think companies in the US should do and can learn from in terms of growth?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:13:22):\nYeah, so we did crazy things. If someone told you, in the US, that they were going to rent out a stadium, pre-load a bunch of mobile devices, market that drivers should come here in mass for a job fair. They're going to give them a phone and send them on their way, some people would say, \"No. That's crazy. Won't we get in trouble.\" And to an extent, maybe that's true. So maybe there are some limitations there, but this concept of doing things that are somewhat crazy, but validate a point, doing stuff that don't scale, especially I think is really the bread and butter of what we did at Gojek. We were insanely scrappy.\n\n(00:14:02):\nWe would do things as simple as wanting to test a subscription feature, which was just released in Singapore a couple weeks ago. We ended up saying, \"We have this voucher system that we can distribute vouchers in the back end. We obviously know our driver's phone numbers. Why don't we just add them to a WhatsApp group?\" We'll add a hundred drivers randomly to a WhatsApp group. We'll tell them, \"Every time you are on a ride with a customer, try to sell them this pitch. You are the only driver who can sell a subscription package. Have the customer give you $10. Text us when they say yes. Someone will be sitting by this phone all day, every day.\n\n(00:14:46):\nWe'll look up the customer that you were on a ride with in the backend, we'll give them the vouchers in the back end, and then we'll deduct $10 from your balance.\" It works. It's really this Wizard of Oz experience. We don't have to build anything. I coordinated with a bunch of interns and we were able to validate some of the value prop and conversion rates that we would expect in a subscription service. When we wanted to do a new onboarding screen, but turns out we have lots of engineering work to do, we took a screenshot of the screen as is, and we just had our designer put what the onboarding flow might look like if we had to overlay it on top of the screen.\n\n(00:15:27):\nAnd we just sent that as an in-app message. And then eventually I think finding stuff that does scale intuitively. We knew that we were sending out lots of fake features through things like Typeform surveys. Things like a personality quiz can be very easily done through Typeform. And we realized that if we built in the in-app webpage and we made it easier for us to do a website deployment on our backend side, we wouldn't have to wait for a mobile app release to test some of these new features out that could be done on web. So it's really just like, what is the user experience that we want to create? How do we manifest that as quickly as possible? Let's just try that first.\n\nLenny (00:16:13):\nGoing back to the stadium example. I know you said that you hired a stadium full of people, I didn't realize it was actually a stadium that you-\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:16:19):\nThat it was literally a stadium that we rented, like a football field, a couple football fields if I'm not wrong. It was long lines, boxes of phones and SIM cards. So it was a lot of just doing really hard work to get to that scale.\n\nLenny (00:16:35):\nWow. I know you do a lot of advising too. Do you advise startups to be more scrappy and do things that don't scale? I imagine because in the US the culture is a little different.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:16:45):\nThe only thing better than knowing... If you have data of what your customers are doing, that is the best data you could ever get. And so if you don't have a tested hypothesis, if you can't think of a way to run an experiment, then honestly that idea is pretty useless. Maybe it makes sense to the market, to the model, but you could have weird consumer sentiments. Not everyone is a rational actor. So testing the actual experience and seeing how people respond to it, that's the best possible data.\n\nLenny (00:17:21):\nPulling that thread a little bit, for startups, experiments are often hard because there's just not enough data and enough users. How do you think startups should approach that? Can you run experiments when you're really, really early?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:17:32):\nYou should. Even if you have a sample size of 30, the data you get back, generally, does not change but its precision will. So mathematically speaking, you're going to get the same level of trends, but the precision at which you understand those trends will become more deep if you have more data. But the underlying information that you're getting out of that won't be very different at larger scales. So what's better than having 30 data points? Certainly having 100. But what's better than having zero is definitely 30.\n\nLenny (00:18:10):\nFascinating. So contrarian. Running experiments at 30 people. I love that.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:18:14):\nYou have to. Every idea is so cheap at that scale. You could do things that don't scale dramatically better with 30 people than at 100 if you're testing.\n\nLenny (00:18:29):\nJust to pull on that a little bit, when you're running an experiment with 30 people, what do you look for? You're looking for 20 of them to do something, a large percentage of that group does something?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:18:39):\nSo everyone wants to go on retention. They want to see that users are doing this thing, and they want to get from step zero to 100 really quickly, but they don't realize that users make decisions based on succeeding events. So what's one step before the user makes that decision? What are the things that they have to do, the things that have to be done? So we're always looking for what is a specific reason that this user might have converted? For things like GoFood it would be things like when does a user try a new merchant if what people are ordering right now or just food that they already trust and know. If you need to have trust in order to purchase food from a merchant, how do we generate that trust? So we actually hacked it by connecting people's Facebook connect login.\n\n(00:19:33):\nSo we had already had permission to look at who they had connected with on Facebook. We actually looked at the food that their friends had purchased and used that as a data set of, \"Hey, here's food that Lenny purchased and liked. Maybe you would like it too.\" And so that was one way to hack the trust factor. And we did find that when we told people, \"This friend purchased from this merchant,\" you would be twice as likely to purchase from a brand new restaurant then users who did not have this feature. And that increases GMV, that eventually gets you to the conversion rate that you wanted, but it solved a different problem. Before how do I convert, it was how do I solve for trust? How do I break the barrier of facilitating that decision making process, that aha moment, by fixing the setup moment, which was trust?\n\nLenny (00:20:31):\nAnd that's just a general rule of thumb you have. Don't use retention as a goal. I know you wrote about this somewhere. Is that a rough rule of thumb you use?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:20:41):\nI think a lot of people thought that I had meant retention sucks, don't care about it at all. But in reality it was really when you think about retention, that's just not specific enough. So there is this mental model that I use from made to stick where they'll tell you like, \"Lenny, think of everything in the world that is orange.\" And you're like, \"An orange. What else?\" And then if you change that structure with sandbox to think of everything orange that's in a construction site, then you really start to realize and grasp at concrete concepts, and can actually action on them in real life.\n\nLenny (00:21:25):\nGot it. Speaking of retention, where have you found products and companies have the most success increasing retention?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:21:32):\nIt's usually the step right before conversion. So if they aren't sure why the user opens the app or they aren't sure why the user got to this checkout page, it's often some copy or the path has been ineffective in some way. I'd like to see founders think about the user psych model that Darius Contractor often talks about. So you need some momentum in that user journey to get them over the hump of some of these very painful user processes like typing in a credit card. That's a lot of work. How do you lower that friction? And being able to sequence the right steps effectively and just moving around screens actually can do a lot.\n\nLenny (00:22:21):\nGoing even deeper there. So the companies you've worked at, the companies you've advised, you're on the boards of a couple companies I noticed, what have you found to be really good uses of time in terms of growth investments, things that often work? And then a second question, what do you find is rarely successful or people invest a lot of time and ends up not being really useful for growth?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:22:44):\nYeah. I think I see a lot of founders grasping at straws. So there'll be this brand new feature that does something different from what people are already doing on our app, like this will make things work. But they don't have any Wizard of Oz test, they haven't proven that people want to do that, they don't have any data of users currently trying to do that. And that's a sign of why this, instead of literally anything else that you could be doing. I do find if you have a lot of people landing on a webpage or an app and then not doing anything, then it's probably copy.\n\n(00:23:25):\nThey haven't even experienced the product, it's clearly not the product that's wrong. So how can you change the copy and resonate with the pain point rather than the solution you are offering so that users understand how to fit themselves into the use case? So copy is a big one if I see conversion rates aren't landing between app launch to some first action. But if there is conversion and they're just not as frequent, I try to look at what the most painfully long conversion events are. So users who eventually check out or eventually completed the aha moment, what are the user paths, and what is the longest one that seems like it's the most painful? Are there enough people trying to do that?\n\n(00:24:13):\nAnd how do we shorten that cycle? So for Kumu things like users wanted to sign up and find their friends on Kumu. And so they were using search frequently, search was underutilized API, it was slow. We sped that up. Conversion rates go from 60% to 90% over the course of a few weeks of just optimizing that and putting more content there. So looking at where are people doing things and then failing, you already know this percent of people would convert if you fixed this, that's a definite potential win. So we try to layer these definite wins with crazy bets of brand new feature with no data. At least run an experiment if you can. But I always try to layer in these sure wins.\n\nLenny (00:25:01):\nWhen you talk about conversion being good and bad, do you have a rule of thumb or of a mental model of here's a rough range of this is good and we should not really spend a lot of time on this and this is bad and we should optimize?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:25:14):\nSo assuming that the frequency is correct, so you have a weekly frequency, if users are coming back, if it's a free product, 60%. It has to be at least 60%. If it's a free product, we go over a week. If it's a paid product, I usually look at that more as maybe 20 to 30%.\n\nLenny (00:25:32):\nAnd this is retention, people coming back the next week?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:25:34):\nExactly. Coming back in the second week or month or whenever your frequency ratio is. And this is at scale. So if you are much smaller, your friends and family that better be near close to 80% no matter what, because if you can't even convince the people who care about you to use the product, it probably isn't going to solve the job for anyone else.\n\nLenny (00:25:56):\nVery handy. Very concrete numbers. And then your point is that when you're a startup, it's only going to go down because your early adopters that are more excited and they'll be more excited by coming back. So you want to start really high.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:26:10):\nDon't make the same mistake that Netflix and Spotify have made, which I guess is when they've launched, they've started international expansion and they see this very small percentage of users start to sign up for Spotify or Netflix. There are very few people though in Southeast Asia or internationally that have the types of credit cards that Spotify or Netflix would accept. And so when they launch in these markets and they see a ton of uptick in the first week, they're like, \"This is only going to get better.\" When in reality it's like you just pulled forward everyone who could have possibly subscribed to you, now you're going to have to work a lot harder to get everyone else.\n\nLenny (00:26:47):\nThe 60% number. So you're saying it's then every week, 60% of the previous week come back, roughly. Is it just a rule of thumb?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:26:54):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:26:55):\nIs that how you think about it versus say cohort retention? Is that just because it's easier is just a simple rule of thumb?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:27:01):\nAm actually thinking of it as cohorts. So 60% should be your week one, and then it should flatten. I think I usually give teams two to three weeks or frequency periods to see things flatten, but it better flatten around 60% for a free product. That's actually what we saw at Gojek. Early days it was like 60, 70% retention rates because people were using this product that really solved a huge problem for them. And I think that's when I knew we were going to be fine. If people keep coming back, the product just needs to work.\n\nLenny (00:27:36):\nWow. So week one, 40% of people drop off week two and beyond basically nobody drops off is what you look for.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:27:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:27:43):\nWow. What a high bar. But I like that, because-\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:27:47):\nYeah, well Gojek is a decacorn.\n\nLenny (00:27:50):\nOkay. There we go. If you want to be a decacorn, there's your new benchmark. Amazing. Okay. There's a bunch of other stuff I want to dig into. One is just data modeling and thinking about growth strategy as a founder. So say a startup is just trying to think about, how do we drive growth, where do we invest, do you have a framework or a process? I know this might be a really big question, but just for founders to think about how their growth works, what their drivers might be, how would a founder approach that problem?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:28:20):\nFor sure. So I thought that this was not an obvious process. It wasn't an explicit process until I worked with Reforge to build my data four PMs program. Got to get that plug there.\n\nLenny (00:28:34):\nGo Reforge.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:28:35):\nI basically talked with the Reforge folks about here's what I would do in all of these scenarios. And they're like, \"Oh, so you mean you're doing this step one, step two?\" And I was like, \"Yes, actually. How did you figure that out?\" So I don't really think in-frame works, this is just a logical process to me. But I think what I've figured out is, it's step one, you have constraints. Similar to our sandbox example of everything in the world that's orange versus everything in a construction site, you have to think about the physics of the current market, the product, the model and the channels that you're using. So to use Gojek as an example, it would be market of Indonesia.\n\n(00:29:16):\nHere are the consumers in this market, the driver's side supply side in this market. Here is the product, mobile app. We're able to connect drivers and consumers. There is a allocation that we create model. We charge per order, channel. We are able to do this through push notifications or in acquiring new users. It might be through Facebook ads, or, and this was a really big insight for us, it's the real world. There was a physical conception of a driver in a jacket driving around the city who was marketing Gojek for us. And word of mouth actually was primarily driven by, \"I saw a driver on the street, so I knew Gojek was here.\"\n\n(00:29:58):\nAnd that actually was a huge driver of all of Gojek's growth as it expanded to new cities. So step one is, what are the physics? Step two is when you think about loops and growth funnels and the quantitative inputs to each loop, does that fit into these physics or do you have to change four or five different things? So we were very careful about changing too many parameters and making too many bets on too many variables going our way. So we would always change one small thing at a time and make sure that it fit into the model.\n\nLenny (00:30:38):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country and by user stage.\n\n(00:31:16):\nEppo does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead uses our north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com. Geteppo.com and 10 X your experiment velocity. So step one, just to cover this, is figure out how you're growing. In Gojek's case, it was partly real world, people just seeing Gojek riding around.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:31:58):\nI think it's both figure out how you're growing and also the elements that you have at your disposal. What are the levers that you have that maybe you've never tried using? When we looked at our model this way, we actually realized we had underutilized the driver's capacity to drive our growth. Pun definitely intended. So in looking at the model this way, we had thought through what is our goal. We want GoPay to be much bigger than it really is. It's a E-wallet service, users are able to get access to this digital balance. How do we drive adoption? And so when we looked at the lever of we have a driver, we actually created an incentive model. So we built a very small service that would check when a driver got allocated to a customer, again, the product and the model, we would then check in the database, has this customer ever used our GoPay product before?\n\n(00:32:59):\nDid they have a digital balance? And if the answer was no, we would message the driver immediately, \"Hey, this customer hasn't done a GoPay top up before. If you get them to give you cash and we deposit it into their virtual wallet, we'll give you extra money.\" So using them as the salesperson. You wouldn't believe how great of a salesperson someone can be when you were literally trapped in a car with them going somewhere. And so you have this captive audience, captive attention, you have someone who has the incentive to cross pay or cross sell someone into GoPay. And customers were able to feel the benefit because the driver was explaining it to them directly. There was no change to the physics, it was a lever usage.\n\nLenny (00:33:49):\nWhat a devious strategy.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:33:50):\nIt was huge. It was 60% of acquisition once we released that.\n\nLenny (00:33:55):\nOh my God. So for thinking through your potential levers and physics of your growth, do you think about it bottoms up, here's all the things that are going on and here's areas we can invest? Or do you have a menu of options top down of here's the 10 things it could be, it's looking like for Gojek it's these four and let's focus on that?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:34:15):\nYeah. I think you always have to start from the fact that we are not wizards. It's very hard to move the physics of a universe when you are trying these new things. So start with what currently works and currently exists and where you think the biggest constraint is or the best lever is, and then fix that one piece because the entire universe isn't exploding. The world isn't changing so dramatically that your physics change. So I think rooted in reality is very important.\n\nLenny (00:34:50):\nGot it. Okay. So it's see what's working, find the constraints. And then step two is basically what can you do to the product to optimize the funnel/loop to make it go even faster?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:35:00):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:35:01):\nLove that. Maybe as another example, if something comes to mind, with Kumu, how do you think of Kumu through this lens?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:35:08):\nYeah. I'm always very hesitant to talk about Kumu, because there's so much competition right now and we are on the cusp of some very interesting things. But I think for Kumu, it's actually very complex because there's a lot of human emotion that is involved. With Gojek you knew if you got the job done. You made a transaction. With Kumu, how do you know if a consumer made a friend, felt like they had a genuine friendship? So you almost have to create more friction to identify users who really got past that barrier and aren't explicit with the activity that they did. So we have features that tell us if a user is really searching for this job to be done, if they really want to be part of a community, how do they fill out this?\n\n(00:35:57):\nDo they fill out the form? Do they fill out a questionnaire of many questions? Do they go through this friction just to get access to a community? So we almost create this artificial friction to help differentiate how deeply a user wants something or needs something. And if the user doesn't fill out that questionnaire, maybe they're actually looking for something else. They were looking for entertainment. They were looking for content or short form content. And so creating almost like hand razor approaches for a user to say, \"I wanted this thing.\" We leave a lot of breadcrumbs in the app to be able to identify those paths.\n\nLenny (00:36:38):\nAwesome. While we're on the topic of these two companies, just maybe for inspiration to founders who are thinking of ways to drive growth, what were a couple of the bigger unlocks growth wise for these two companies or even any other company that you've worked with that's interesting?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:36:52):\nYeah. Definitely, in the early days it was copy. So I think if your product does something that's not super familiar, you have to tie it to something that is. So I talked about using drivers to sell GoPay. Before that, one thing that we did was to actually take someone's virtual account number and put it onto a picture of a credit card. You know what a credit card is, that's familiar to you. A lot of people didn't know what a digital wallet was. And so when they looked at this like, \"Oh, okay. I have this virtual thing that acts like a credit card. It works like my debit account.\" Then they understood the concept a lot better.\n\n(00:37:33):\nAnd we actually saw top ups increase based on us, literally just sending that picture with someone's virtual account number there. So they could go to an ATM and they would just type in the card number as they would a regular debit account. And they realized that they could top up through that channel. Because that was something that was pretty interesting to us, with just how do we tie the familiarity loop back into the consumer mental model of the product and drive acquisition that way?\n\nLenny (00:38:02):\nAnd that was at Gojek?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:38:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:38:04):\nIs there anything else maybe, since you don't want to talk too much about Kumu, any other advisorships or companies, examples of something that ended up working really well to help them accelerate growth?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:38:14):\nThings that have worked really well. So for one of the companies I work with, AB&B, they run a lot of their D2C brands in South America and globally. So one of the features that we were looking at was how do we ensure that subscriptions don't actually become a canceling point for a user. So in the app you could cancel or you could resume your subscription, but you couldn't pause it. So when we looked at the cancellation reasons and we saw that their number one reason was, I still have too much fear, we actually decided, well, let's just add a pause button then.\n\n(00:38:58):\nBecause canceling the subscription is a permanent solution to having too much fear. How do you make a temporary solution that solves the actual problem? Adding in a pause button actually helped alleviate a lot of the churn that was becoming very hard to reacquire back. So that was one fix where we looked at the, again, physics of the model. We're not going to create new changes to the product or create one time buys or reactivation emails. We'll just solve the problem at that small constraint where everyone drops off.\n\nLenny (00:39:35):\nWait, so can you order beer as subscription? Is that a thing? Is this a consumer product or is this-\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:39:40):\nIt was a thing, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:39:43):\nCool. Okay. This also reminds me, at Airbnb, this was actually one of the biggest wins, is adding a snooze feature to your listing. Exactly the same thing. Yeah. All right there we go. Awesome. Tip for folks that have churn problems, snooze/pause. I want to shift a little bit to a post that you wrote that maybe is one of your more popular posts you wrote on the Reforge blog called Why Most Analytics Efforts Fail. And I'd love to hear your broad overview of why do most analytics efforts fail and then how do teams avoid this? Maybe what are two to three things they can do?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:40:18):\nYeah, I'm actually pretty surprised at how much noise that has generated because I guess it came from a place of frustration where I kept telling people like, \"You are doing this wrong. Here's how you should probably be doing it.\" But I think it resonated a lot with folks because they recognize all of those symptoms, but they weren't sure why it was happening. So to say, oh, this is the thing, instrumentation is what's wrong, I think it's a very actionable thing. It's probably one of the most solvable problems out there. It just takes some time and mental model shifts to do it well. So a lot of people look at tracking data as how do I track my OKR? How do I know if I'm going up or down? But they don't use it to track or identify insights. So I will use the example of using Twitter for \"news\" when in reality they're actually using Twitter for entertainment.\n\n(00:41:17):\nDo not treat metric gathering as entertainment. It's not there for you to be like, \"Oh, that's interesting, how novel,\" and then not act on it. So real news is information that changes what you do in the real world. And if you don't change what you're doing, what you are doing is just getting entertainment. So let's use that as the premise. The next step in instrumentation is to look at the fact that measurements do not equate to insights. A measurement would be an observation. It's a data point in your database. So the example being power users do four times more bookings, is an all observed fact because your transactional database obviously says that is the case, but it's on an insight because it doesn't have context. It doesn't give you information that lets you act on it and better understand the problem.\n\n(00:42:11):\nSo another example would be if I see my girlfriend hanging out with a guy I don't know, that is an observed fact that you see in the real world. Your hypothesis could be that your girlfriend is cheating on you, but the insight, the actual fact might be that she's not cheating on you, it's her cousin. And now your insight is, I am paranoid and I need to change my behavior to be less crazy. So the insight will provide value when you have this, why answered? Why is this person doing this thing? Here's why. And then you are going to act differently. So for our purposes, if we look at a GoFood user will transact and is more likely to use a voucher, that's a fact, that's an observation, but it's not an insight. An insight would be something like GoFood users who are power users are more likely to use a free shipping discount on a high GMV basket versus non-power users.\n\n(00:43:22):\nAnd that actually tells you how to change your marketing approach. It tells you in what circumstances does someone do this. When it's a high GMV basket, give power users the ability to get a free discount, but do not do this for non-powered users because they won't convert any better than they normally would. So, that helps you change your marketing spend. It helps you understand the decision points of power users versus non-power users. The insight is instrumenting properties into an event so that you can segment who is doing what behavior and make some hypotheses on that observation. Test that hypothesis, and then you get some causal representation of whether or not that hypothesis was right.\n\nLenny (00:44:10):\nSo it sounds like a lot of the root of the issue is setting up the wrong metrics, the wrong... I guess there's the tracking element of just capturing the right information. And then also just not focusing on insights versus just having a bunch of information.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:44:24):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:44:24):\nWhat are signs that you're doing this? Say someone's going to go load up their dashboard and they're like, \"Am I failing or not?\" What should they be looking for?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:44:33):\nSo I already know if a team is good at instrumentation or not just by looking at the instrumentation spec. The symptom of a bad data tracking approach is you have a ton of rows with a ton of events, but every event has one property or no property being tracked. So an example with Gojek would be when a user lands on the map to select a drop off point, the event would be drop off or map loaded, let's say. And the properties there should be things like how many drivers do they see on the screen? What is the pickup location? What city is it in? What latitude and longitude is it? Is there surge pricing? What is the current minimum fare? Do they have a voucher code?\n\n(00:45:28):\nAll of these characteristics of the experience and the context that can help you look at hey, when a user only sees two drivers on the screen, they're much less likely to convert than a user who sees five drivers on a screen. Now we can look at in what cities and in what latitude and longitudes do we mostly only see two drivers versus five drivers. Being able to do the second layer approach of the why and not just stop at, \"That's weird. When you have two drivers you are less likely to book.\" But then you never ask why. That drives me crazy. Or the inability to even know that there were only two drivers on the screen. You're missing so much context of the user's experience that you're unable to make assumptions about why the user didn't convert.\n\nLenny (00:46:15):\nI love this. Maybe your course is probably going to be the answer, but for folks that want to figure out how to do this taxonomy and events well, how do they go about doing that?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:46:26):\nSo I think it's important to just go through examples. Yes, every product is different, but everyone has the same signup flow for the most part. So look at the signup flow examples that I have in the blog post or in, I believe Amplitude actually has a pretty good long-winded documentation on this, on how to do a event tracking. But it's really a matter of sitting down and thinking really deeply. If I were to press this button, why would I and why would I not? And am I tracking that in my user properties? So it's really just sitting down and mapping out the experience.\n\nLenny (00:47:05):\nSpeaking of Amplitude and other data tools, do you have a default recommended metrics stack for our founders just to start with and maybe a few other things as they evolve?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:47:14):\nThat really depends on how early they are. So if they have a single data warehouse with all of their transactional data, usually I say, you can probably get by with Google Data Studio. It's free usually with whatever you're using. If not Metabase has a great open source free tool. If you have someone who can write SQL or if you have multiple databases, then Metabase is great. If you need in app mobile device event tracking, I usually recommend CleverTap because Mixpanel has unfortunately failed me a lot. And Amplitude doesn't have the CRM components that I would need all in one space.\n\n(00:47:51):\nIf I am much bigger and I need more analytics juice, maybe Amplitude makes sense on top of this, or something that helps me pipe data into more dashboards and do less ETL for me. Then I would get into Segment. And then once you get into experimentation, obviously I have to shout out to Eppo. I think they've really instrumented a lot of the dashboards that I would've normally had to do in experimentation projects. So I usually look at something like Eppo to just automate the decision making flow.\n\nLenny (00:48:21):\nAwesome. I think we're both small investors in Eppo, big fans, a little bit of bias, but yeah's it's an excellent Airbnb team that built it, so it's cool. Shifting a bit from metrics and data to just growth teams in general, maybe first question is just, how do you recommend companies set up a growth team in the early days and then over time?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:48:44):\nYeah. So I can talk about how growth was set up at Gojek as an example, which I think is probably the best practice. So we didn't really know what growth was at that time, but we knew there were obvious gaps to fill. So because we had grown so quickly, the core product team was still making the core product features. As simple as phone number masking. That wasn't a thing yet. You had access to your driver's phone number. It's probably not a great thing. It's probably part of the core functionality and we need to fill that gap. At the same time, growth was still necessary because you had all of these users trying to use a product that aren't quite getting there.\n\n(00:49:25):\nSo things like figuring out what SMS provider we should use to send the OTP to this user who is signing up from this telco provider. That was a growth objective that isn't necessarily core feature work, but was a gap to fill given the onboarding and SMS success delivery rates. Things like telling the driver if this was a brand new customer, because at this point in time, drivers had taken thousands of rides and they assumed every single customer knew how Gojek worked, when maybe they didn't. And so we knew that the protocol was that a power user would know they would make an order and they would just wait. They would wait somewhere, they would keep an eye out for a driver and then they would get on the motorcycle and go.\n\n(00:50:13):\nBut for a brand new user, are you supposed to walk to the driver? Are you supposed to find them? It's unclear to this brand new, uneducated new user how to use the product. And so first time user experience could have been a terrible one where they went and walked off and then the driver came to the pickup point and they couldn't find them. So it was all of these small acquisition, adoption and engagement use cases that growth was filling the gap on. And eventually we embedded our growth, I would say product managers at the time, into these teams and they ended up synthesizing what growth was as a full-time role. Eventually becoming PMs who own specific parts of the product stack.\n\nLenny (00:50:58):\nSo in your experience, and I hear this a lot, is your first growth person shouldn't just come in and figure out what to work on. You should understand here's where we need growth help, let's find somebody to tackle it, versus come help us figure out what to do to drive growth. Is that how you've seen it?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:51:11):\nExactly. I think it's just setting the bar too high to expect someone to come in and model everything. Again, there are physics in place it's very hard to move everything. So it's really about having someone who already has all of this data knows where the biggest gaps are. Doesn't have to start from scratch and figure this out and then just picks some small space to work on that they know is workable.\n\nLenny (00:51:38):\nDo you have strong opinions about growth being integrated? The way that you described where growth PM basically has a cross functional team basically is the PM versus a separate growth team that's off to the side.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:51:50):\nYeah. I think it can work as a separate growth team to the side if the company is truly head over heels, tripping on insane product market fit, if there's insane, product market fit and you are really scrambling to do core feature stacks, then maybe a growth team to come and be clean up is fine. We're the cleanup crew. We pick up the pieces that were left behind, we connect the dots. You forgot to plug this in, we'll plug it in for you. But we were a team of lots of stats heavy people. So a lot of my team were statistics graduates. We cared a lot about looking at numbers and odds and probabilities because it really is a numbers game at that scale. You could work on anything and everything would probably do something. But what was the thing that would make the most impact now and unlock us for the future.\n\nLenny (00:52:44):\nI was going to ask you folks to look for when they're hiring an early growth person, is that what you find, just stats, data kind of person?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:52:49):\nYou have to have someone who knows how to run the numbers. If you're looking at ratios of conversion rates, but you don't realize that this ratio is of a much smaller base size, you're going to make the wrong decision. So someone who is intuitively good at statistics, they know how to do sampling appropriately. They know what selection bias is. The worst possible thing is to have a growth person who thinks they are doing the right thing and is measuring things wrong and then focusing on the wrong areas.\n\nLenny (00:53:24):\nDo you find that it's often easier or better to hire a young up and coming person or find someone that's got a bunch of experience for your first growth hire?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:53:34):\nI would hire someone who is willing to take intro to statistics course. And it doesn't matter if they've had the experience to go wild or not. I think it really is, can they focus on the right opportunity rather than the most flashy thing? And I think both profiles can come under that.\n\nLenny (00:53:54):\nGot it. And then what do you do in a hiring process for someone like this? What kind of things do you suggest founders look for?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:54:01):\nYeah. I actually look for that first principle bias. So I'll give people case studies of here's what we see, how do you know that this is true? And then I have them set up an experiment design. I want to see that they are sampling randomly. Not that they're like, \"I'm going to build this feature and launch it, and of course it's going to work.\" I want to see that they're taking a measured deliberate approach to considering why someone might do this or what tools are available. A growth team can go terribly wrong when they just try to onboard a bunch of brand new tools that don't integrate well and it takes six months to integrate fully, and then they get nothing done for six months. Everything in growth is an opportunity cost of time, trade off with what you could have been doing to the product in that time.\n\n(00:54:50):\nSo we biased towards really quick hacky things. Like in the early days of Gojek growth, I think our first real growth experiment, we were actually still the data team at this time, was to connect a quick Python script to the Twilio API that we had access to. And we SMSd a bunch of drivers through a CSV that we uploaded that said like, \"Hey, your acceptance rate is really low. You're not supposed to do that. Please accept all the rides that you are getting.\" And that actually increased acceptance rates by 2% across the board. And when we looked deeper into that data, it did even more so for brand new drivers. And so we then worked with the data driver onboarding team so that they could better facilitate the onboarding experience for their drivers.\n\nLenny (00:55:38):\nFor the interview question that you described, an experiment design question, do you give that as a project where they have time to work on it or is it a live thing?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:55:46):\nYes. Yeah. I don't think live works really well for these case studies. I want to see people put in the time and the work to do something to the best of their ability. And of course we ask them like, \"Hey, you have five days. We expect you to spend probably four hours on this, so if you don't have four hours within these five days, let us know.\" So we're pretty careful about giving them the appropriate amount of time to do it at the level of quality that we would've expected if they were to work here full-time. So give them those four hours, we want to see do they Google. If they can't figure it out right now, let's see them Google it. We'll ask them what approaches they took, how did they figure this out. And we like to hear people say that they literally had to Google this and read a bunch of white papers. I do that as well.\n\nLenny (00:56:39):\nFor people trying to design one of these for themselves, do you have a question that you've retired that you could share or something that would help somebody design their own prompt?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:56:49):\nYeah. I can give you a template after this call.\n\nLenny (00:56:51):\nAmazing. We'll include that in the show notes. Easy peasy. Amazing. Okay. A last topic that I wanted to cover is a very cool thing that you were involved in. It's a nonprofit that you started called Generation Girl. And I think the mission is to help women and young girls get into STEM. So I'd love to hear about this program, how you got into it, what it's all about, and then also just how listeners can help support what you're doing.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:57:15):\nAbsolutely. Yes. Generation Girl is very near and dear to my heart. So I co-founded this with a couple of amazing women who were also at Gojek, but are now full-time at Generation Girl. So this really stemmed from us repeatedly getting annoying comments about working in STEM. So things like, \"You can't possibly be the engineer on this project. You look like you like makeup and stuff.\" And we were like, \"Yes, I absolutely love makeup, but I also am badass at writing SWIFT code, so step aside.\" So having experienced a lot of the misrepresentation of what an engineer should look like or should like, I think we really look to Legally Blonde, is one of my favorite movies that represents you can take the powers that you have, whether you like engineering or design or data, and you can be whoever you want and still kick ass at it.\n\n(00:58:14):\nSo a lot of the women that we support, we're actually happy if they go into one of our classes and they say, \"Actually, I don't like engineering.\" That's great. That's agency and empowerment that they got to make that decision for themselves without any cultural biases or social pressure telling them that they should feel this way. And so we offer free classes for girls 12 to 17. We have college classes. We partner with teachers about how to teach STEM topics, especially in areas where they don't have laptops for every student. How do you teach how to use Figma and things like that? So people can definitely support us and reach out to us. We have a PayPal on our website, take a look.\n\nLenny (00:58:59):\nCan you share some of the impact that you've seen from this? Are there numbers you can share or anything that you can share around what the organizations have done.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (00:59:05):\nSo we've already had several thousand students go through Generation Girl, summer clubs and programs and classes. So we have an event every week. We have a full summer club that's every single day for two weeks, every summer and every winter. We have partnerships with some of the biggest tech companies in Indonesia, where we partner students with engineers and they work on projects together. And most recently we're part of the MIT solve program with our new initiative Class. So Class, we're creating a free to use site for teachers.\n\n(00:59:40):\nSo right now we have partnered with a handful of universities in Indonesia, both in rural and city of Jakarta where teachers can now have the knowledge and material to explain newer concepts that maybe they're less familiar with, because startup world changes rapidly, how you develop changes rapidly. So this is one thing that we are most excited about because every teacher impacts thousands of students a year. And being able to teach the teachers and give them the resources that they need is something that's really important.\n\nLenny (01:00:11):\nThat's incredible. It's currently just in Southeast Asia, is that right?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:00:15):\nOnly in Indonesia, because frankly, this is where everyone needs the most support. Globally STEM is not well received or welcoming at all to women. I think it's gotten worse over the past few decades. Below 18% of college graduates are women in computer science. So we're really trying to reach the youngest generation because that's when you are told or informed that computer science is for specific types of people.\n\nLenny (01:00:46):\nIt's really sad to hear that it's heading in the wrong direction. What do you think is contributing to that?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:00:52):\nI think there is still a lot of this mental model of what a computer scientist is able to do and how much support they're given. So it's been shown in studies that at the youngest generation middle school, high school, you are more likely to be given introductory STEM classes as a male than as a female. So women just aren't targeted for STEM at that younger age. And so when they enter the high school or college classes for computer science, they're way behind. And that does not feel good. No one likes to be the worst in the class. And so it's more likely that you'll drop out. We've seen studies at Carnegie Mellon that actually would create introductory computer science classes before the college class starts. And for the women who did join those classes, they actually graduated at similar rates as their male counterparts. So it's really setting them up for success.\n\nLenny (01:01:52):\nIf folks want to help. You said that there's a PayPal page. Is there any other sort of action people can take?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:01:58):\nYes. Enterprise software. We love to teach iOS development, licensed software. We have hundreds of students a year, so let us know.\n\nLenny (01:02:07):\nAwesome. And they can reach you on generationgirl.com?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:02:10):\nGenerationgirl.org.\n\nLenny (01:02:12):\nCrystal, thank you so much for being here. I've taken enough of your time. Two last quick questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And then other than the Generation Girl chat we just had, is there any other way folks can be helpful to you?\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:02:25):\nYes. Please find me at crystalwidjaja.com. You can reach out to me and my email is there. Listeners, please do instrumentation correctly. Please don't track your KPIs. Please track your user journeys and experiences. We'll have much funner things to talk about if you do that.\n\nLenny (01:02:43):\nAmazing PSA. Thank you so much, Crystal.\n\nCrystal Widjaja (01:02:46):\nThanks Lenny. This was a blast.\n\nLenny (01:02:48):\nThank you so much for listening.

People all have the same idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:04):\nOne of these themes is simple, pragmatic advice. Sell shit, make money.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:00:07):\nOne of my mantras is just don't die. Being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics puts you in the right mindset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nYou have this concept of tarpit ideas.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:00:17):\nSeems like an unsolved problem. You'll get all this positive feedback from the world and people have been starting that startup since the '90s.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:23):\nRecently you put out a request for startups, 20 categories of ideas and the YC wants to fund.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:00:28):\nWe're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating they are currently.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nA lot of people say you're the king of the pivot.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:00:36):\nA good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you're an expert at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nAre there other patterns you find across startups that do well?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:00:43):\nThere's a lot of founders that come this close to it, all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Dalton Caldwell. Dalton is managing director and group partner at Y Combinator where he's worked for over 10 years across 21 different YC batches, including working closely in the earliest days of Instacart, Retool, Brex, Deal, DoorDash, Webflow, Replit, Amplitude, Whatnot, Razorpay and 20 other Unicorns. Prior to Y Combinator, Dalton was the co-founder and CEO of imeem, which was acquired by Myspace, and Co-founder and CEO of App.net, which was an early ads-free competitor to Twitter. Dalton has seen and worked with more startups than nearly any human alive and in our conversation we get incredibly tactical and deep on the startup journey. Why it all comes down to simply not losing hope and not letting your startup die. What to do when your startup is struggling and how to know when it is time to give up. What makes a great pivot and signs it's time to pivot. How to actually talk to customers.\n\n(00:01:50):\nWhy every single startup goes through a point where they feel like all hope is lost. Why investors say no to startups. What most often leads to startups failing. Why you need to avoid over-delegating early on. Plus startup ideas that you should avoid. And also 20 ideas Dalton is looking to fund. Also so many great stories and lessons. This episode is action packed. With that, I bring you Dalton Caldwell after a short word from our sponsors.

I'm really excited to talk to you today. It's been great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:48):\nSo to prep for this podcast interview, I asked a bunch of founders that worked with you during YC what advice you shared with them along the journey that was most transformative to the way they think about product, the way they think about building their startup, the way they operate. And there's a bunch of themes that emerged and I'm going to touch on a number of these themes. One of these themes is just how often you get to very simple pragmatic advice and how much of your message is just sell shit, make money, don't run out of money. Why do you think founders need to hear this advice, which is seemingly simple and obvious?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:05:22):\nHave you ever seen in NBA basketball or college basketball where they have the coach mic'd up and it shows what they're actually saying in the huddle? You ever listen to what they actually are saying? They're like, \"Okay, we need to really focus and get the ball and win this game.\" If you actually listen to what the greatest, smartest, most successful athletes are talking about, if you listen to what Tiger Woods is saying to his caddy, it all sounds like pretty mundane stuff. It's not like what Tiger Woods is talking about with his caddy is some impossible to decipher jargon. It's like, \"Yeah, you really need to keep your head down on this one.\" It's things like that. And I think the reason this is true is that even if you're in the best in the world, being coached and being reminded of the fundamentals and basics is what puts you in the right mindset and that you already know everything, right? You're at the top of your game if you make it to the elite levels of being a startup founder or basically doing anything that's really hard psychologically.\n\n(00:06:33):\nAnd so yeah, one of my mantras is just don't die. Just keep your startup going. Just keep going. And I say that over and over again and honestly, that is often what people tell me is the most impactful thing I said. It's not that I said some Ninja 5D chess mood that they never would've thought of before. It's just the constant affirmation that continuing to keep going and doing high quality reps is the game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:04):\nI know that you'd give a talk that's exactly called that, How Not To Die. Just to pull on this thread a little bit more, what is the general advice you share there for people that also don't want to die?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:07:14):\nThe way to summarize that is if you look at all the startup stories that we have at YC and all the companies we funded over all the years, the underlying theme is that rationally the founder should have given up at some point. And so again, let's talk about Airbnb, obviously something you know a lot about. They probably should have shut down three or four times before they got into YC. It objectively wasn't working. They were basically ruining their lives, they were disappointing their parents, everything was wrong and it was a purely irrational act for the founders of Airbnb to keep working on their goofy startup. And again, that's just one story. If you look across the portfolio of YC and non-YC companies, there has to be this irrational intention to keep going even when the world tells you it's not working and you feel completely defeated. And you likely have to go through this many times and have these near-death experiences. And then you get lucky and then you look like an overnight success. Right?\n\n(00:08:26):\nAnd so that is the theme that is a summary and I provide lots of data and lots of stories there, but this is one of those things that the longer I have this job, the more I really, really believe this is true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:39):\nWhat's your advice on the flip side of that where there's a lot of startups, especially these days that are just super struggling, have been added for a while, there are mental health challenges, they'd be very sad if they had to shut this thing down, but often it's probably the right move? What's your advice to folks on deciding, okay, actually does make sense to give up in this case?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:09:01):\nI think this is a nuanced question and it's hard for me to say something on a podcast that'll actually be useful to people, but here's a couple of thoughts. One, are you still having fun? Do you still enjoy doing what you're doing? Do you enjoy spending time with your co-founders? Is this actually a fun thing you're doing? And if the answer there is yes, I would tend to lean on the keep going. And then if it's more of, wow, this is actually profoundly affecting me a negative way and my relationships with people in my life and I don't really want to work with my co-founder anymore and things like that, then I would lean on the probably don't do it anymore. Something that a lot of the folks that turn it around have in common is they actually do love their customers and they love their product.\n\n(00:09:51):\nAnd again, in the Airbnb story, again, you know it really well, but they really liked Airbnb and they liked working with each other and they liked the first host that they met and they knew all their names. You know what I'm saying? They loved their startup even though it was going bad. And so that's to me a signal to keep going is that you really, really love what you're doing and the people you're doing it with and you love your customers and you love the problem. Versus where you're just like, \"Yeah, I could care less about any of those things. I'm just having a bad time.\" Harder to be encouraging in that situation. And this is a fixable situation. You can make it more like the thing you love, can't you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:34):\nYeah. This is actually very practical and great advice. This is something people can sense, \"Okay, am I actually enjoying this? Do I want to keep doing this?\" Versus, \"Man, such a drag that I have to keep running this startup.\" Is there anything you could say to folks that are just like, \"I can't stop because it'll feel like I failed\"?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:10:50):\nIf it's really going poorly or if you're having a really bad time, it's no big deal. No one will remember that you shut down your company probably in 10 years or 20 years time. As long as you have integrity, as long as you're an honest person, as long as you handle yourself well through good times and bad, people will remember you fondly. We have such a short life. There's only so many years we get to have our careers, doing something that makes you miserable and the only reason you're doing it is to avoid losing face and you know in your heart is not going to work, I don't know, that seems like a pretty big opportunity cost on literally your life. Right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):\nYeah, that's exactly what I tell founders all the time. Life is short. There's no need to force yourself to work on this. And I really like your point of just, is it still enjoyable? Do you like working with your founders? Following this thread of the struggle training a little bit more, one of the founders that worked with you during YC, his name is Danny Alberson, shared a story how during one of the batches of YC, one of the founders raised his hand and asked you, \"What is wrong with our batch? Everyone is struggling, nobody is doing well. What have we done wrong?\" And you shared a story about Brex that made everyone feel a little better. Does that ring a bell and if so, can you share that?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:12:08):\nThat definitely happened and I think the story is the story of the Winter-17 batch. And in the Winter-17 batch, I funded something like, I don't know, 35, 40 companies in my group. So we subset them into groups. So it wasn't a lot of companies and I knew all of them really well. And founders can't help but compare themselves with other founders all the time about who's doing well and who's not doing well. And there was this one company in my group, this batch, it was called Vyond, that was their name at the time and it was a VR headset thing from these Stanford dropouts. And they basically showed up to group office hours and were just ashamed and they're like, \"Our idea is horrible. We might want to shut our company down. This is really embarrassing.\" I had to beg them to not give up basically. And if you would've asked people in the batch what the worst company was, I think they would've said this one. Again, not because they were bad people but the founders themselves seemed despondent about how it was going.\n\n(00:13:13):\nAnd then funnily enough, this is in the story too, there was another startup also in my group called Cashew, which was this P2P Venmo, excuse me, in the UK and it was going really poorly also and not growing. And so if you just took this snapshot in time in the middle of the batch of who is definitely not doing well, it would clearly have been this Vyond company and this Cashew company. And so to cut to the chase, Vyond changed their idea and got really excited about it and renamed to Brex and this was Brex, which is like a decacorn. And Cashew changed their idea and renamed to something called Retool. And so out of my 35 companies, the ones that objectively seemed the worst in terms of everything is going bad, were by far, in retrospect, the most successful companies in that group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:08):\nWow. Wait, so you're saying Brex was a VR headset company?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:14:14):\nThey thought it was really high-tech. They want to do a really high-tech startup, and so they're like, \"We're going to build a new VR headset.\" And yeah, they were good programmers, but they just didn't know anything about optics or the things you might want to be an expert in to build a headset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:26):\nWow, that's an amazing story. It's a great segue to just another theme that emerged from talking to founders about advice that you've shared. A lot of people tell me you are the king of the pivot of helping people figure out how to pivot. I'm curious just what you've seen makes a good pivot.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:14:45):\nUsually a successful pivot gets warmer instead of colder from what you're an expert at and somehow builds on what you learned on the prior idea. Right? And so in the case of Brex, it was they had worked on a FinTech company in Brazil when they were younger, and so I'm like, \"You need to work more on the thing all about and not the thing nothing about.\" And that was what worked for them. In the case of Retool, it was the same thing. They had built similar internal tools both at their internships as well as for Cashew. They had all these dashboards they built to operate their Venmo competitor. And so they knew a lot about what to build in the case of postprod, pivoting and through idea, they knew a lot about analytics and had strong opinions about it. And so it was much closer than what the original idea is.\n\n(00:15:41):\nIn the case of Zip, Rujul knows a lot about a lot of things and he knew a lot about the crazy picture and process at Airbnb because he worked there. A good pivot is like going home. It's warmer, it's closer to something that you... And it never occurred to you that this thing you know all about would be a good idea or maybe you consciously are like, \"I don't want to work on this because burnt out on it.\" Sometimes someone has to get over this barrier they have on why they don't want to work on a certain idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:18):\nThese are amazing. I like how modest you are. I'm like, \"Oh, here's a big idea.\" And then you just give very tactical items to look for. So essentially a good pivot in your experience is you're getting closer, warmer towards something you have actual experience in, and two, it builds on something you've done. Can be essentially the core idea of a pivot, right? Where you're...\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:16:38):\nIn the example of Segment, which is obviously a really big successful company, they started with something to tell your professor you were confused in class. It was software that they sold to universities. And then they ended up pivoting to something like a mixed panel competitor after two years and it's because they learned about how analytics works running their first idea, okay? And then no one wanted to adopt their mixed panel competitor. And so they were like, \"We should make this JavaScript thing that you embed on your website that can send events to multiple endpoints at the same time so that way people would be willing to try our mixed panel competitor side by side with mixed panels to show that it's better.\" And then they were like, \"Oh yeah, no one actually wants that. They just want this JavaScript to send events to different locations.\" And so there's no way those founders could have started with the final idea. You get what I mean?\n\n(00:17:30):\nThere was no universe where they would've made up the idea for Segment because they didn't know anything about how analytics worked, but because they were grinding for multiple years and became experts on these things is a side effect of their earlier ideas. They ended up with really good unique insights.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:45):\nI think that's a really important point there is you don't need to necessarily have that experience before you start the company, could come from trying to build the company.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:17:51):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:53):\nA big question people are always wondering is, should I pivot? Is this the time to pivot? Should I keep trying this idea? What's your advice there of just, okay, now you should really be thinking about something else?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:18:02):\nAgain, this is one of those where I like to give very bespoke nuanced advice on a case by case basis to the folks in YC. But again, just to give you a preview of how I would think about it, I would look at how many more ideas the founder has on how to make it grow. If it's not going well and you're out of ideas, that is usually a good time to pivot. But when you have half a dozen or a dozen really good growth ideas that you haven't tried yet, try them. Right? Hey, give it a shot. Again, in the Airbnb story, right? They tried all sorts of stuff including cereal and conventions. They had a bunch of zany ideas on growth and they didn't run out of them. And so I think when there's still gas in the tank on an idea that might be a reason to stay the course. And when literally the founder is like, \"Yeah, I don't know, I guess maybe we should pay influencers or something.\" When that's the kind of ideas they're coming up with, that might be a better sign to pivot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:03):\nThat is incredibly helpful. Coming back to Zip real quick, they went through I think six different pivots before they landed on this idea that is now a billion-dollar business. Is there anything from that specific journey that you found really interesting? Because they went in so many different directions like accounting, marketplaces and-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:19:18):\nYeah. I think in the example of the Zip founders, they were both such great experts and I knew Rujul really well. He actually worked with me at YC as a visiting partner. And so I was really close to Rujul and he had done this marketplace called FlightCar when he was younger, which was raised a series B, it didn't work out, but it was a really cool company. And I had a lot of confidence in his competence on running a business and executing fast and just having great instincts. He really knows the fundamentals and the problem was they weren't as clear on what market to go into, is still with me. And so I actually suggested to do something in their case, again, this is very bespoke, but my suggestion was to start by looking at what companies are publicly traded and/or owned by private equity that are large and that also are hated by their customers, and to try to intentionally find where there's a knowable big market within incumbent combined with the software is horrible.\n\n(00:20:29):\nAnd they did that. They basically found out about all this procurement software and what the state of the art was and that was the prompt. Again, maybe he told you this, that was basically the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:41):\nHe did tell me that. I love that example and piece of advice so much. I don't know why more people don't do this. Basically find a large incumbent with very low NPS and try to disrupt them. So straightforward.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:20:54):\nYeah, I mean, I can't promise that works for everyone, but again, in the very bespoke situation with Rujul, it worked really well because he actually knew exactly once he locked in on that prompt, oh man, he ran a masterclass. They did an A-plus job, was really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:12):\nAlso Lou, his co-founder, credit to him too.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:21:14):\nOf course. Sorry. Yeah. We got to give Lou the shout-out. Lou did an amazing job. I just didn't know Lou as well before he did YC. But you're right, we got to give Lou the credit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):\nI was watching your chat with Michael Seibel talking about pivots and either you or he used this phrase of you want to move towards the mountains in the desert to find the gold of a new startup idea versus the middle of the city. You're unlikely to find gold in the middle of San Francisco. Is there anything along those lines that you can share?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:21:41):\nYeah, I think maybe this pertains into what we see from applications and interviews, which is from where I sit seeing everything people apply to YC with and what they interview with and whatnot. People all have the same idea. Basically imagine this, imagine your information consumption where you're listening to the same podcast, wink, wink, you're reading the same people on Twitter, you're reading the same blog post. Basically you have the same information diet of all these other founders and you're friends with all the same people. Does it seem surprising then that you would all end up with similar startup ideas or similar philosophies on what makes a good startup idea? Of course you are. So this is the metaphor on cities is that if you just are following the same principles and have the same information flow into your brain, you're going to come up with the same ideas with everybody else.\n\n(00:22:37):\nAnd so the prompt here is to try to go more off the beaten path either from your personal experience, like in the case of Brex and Retool or Whatnot. There was no one else trying to build marketplaces for Funko Pops. Go deeper in your own personal interests or experience to find something that just your exact peer wouldn't come up with in exactly the same way. And again, the Zip example, I don't think other people were trying to build wonky procurement software. That was not an idea that we saw much of. And so again, the prompt to people is try to mix up what your information diet is or what areas of expertise you have and mine that well, versus just having all the same thoughts as everybody else. And so again, let me give you one more example.\n\n(00:23:24):\nA few years ago, startups around trucking were super new and fresh because no one was doing them and they worked really well and then it became completely conventional wisdom to do trucking related startups. I'm not trying to diss anyone, but you'll see things that become fashionable really quickly because someone found success in this unfashionable space and then it becomes fashionable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:45):\nThis is a good segue to something I definitely want to spend time on, which is you have this concept of tarpit ideas, which are essentially ideas people all gravitate towards and get stuck in and either pivot into and then can't pivot out of or try to pivot out of. And essentially it's just consistently bad startup ideas that people continue to try to start. Can you just talk about this and then what is examples of just bad startup ideas that people should stop trying to start?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:24:10):\nFor people that are familiar with this terminology from us, sometimes they get defensive and don't get what we were saying. By definition it is only a tarpit if it seems like it's not. If it's just a regular idea that is hard, that is not a tarpit. The weird aspect of what we call a tarpit idea is an idea that a lot of people come up with and then it seems like an unsolved problem and you get lots of positive feedback for. Right? And you have a really good set of arguments that it's a really good startup idea. And that's different than a bad startup idea. Do you get what I'm trying to say? A bad startup idea is, I don't know, something that is obviously bad or something where you just can't get any positive feedback on. But some of the most common tarpit would be something like building an app to coordinate with your friends to decide where to go out at night or where to meet up with people, which is really, it's coming from a good place. It's a good idea.\n\n(00:25:10):\nIf you ask your friends, \"Hey, would you like an app for us to coordinate to hang out more so we can be friends?\" They're like, \"Yeah, I would love that.\" You'll get all this positive feedback from the world. And man, people have been starting that startup since the '90s and so you can validate it. Part of being a true tarpit is that you can get good initial validation. Do you get what I mean? And so anyway. And honestly I worked on tarpit ideas myself as a founder, which is a music discovery. This is something I did in my first startup. Music startups are hard and trying to be like, \"Oh, we're going to fix music discovery.\" This was classic things where you can get lots of positive feedback and even get users to work on those things, but there are aspects of it that make it a very hard idea. So does that make sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:59):\nAbsolutely. I'm also guilty of this. I had this startup called Localmind that allowed you to talk to people, check-in in various locations around the city, on Foursquare and Google back in the day and asked them, \"How's it going?\" And everyone when they used it, they're like, \"Holy shit, this is the most incredible thing I've ever seen. I could see what's happening at this bar that I'm about to go to.\" And then they never use it again.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:26:19):\nDo you remember when Foursquare clones was all anyone worked on for-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:21):\nYeah.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:26:21):\nYears?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):\nThey told us Foursquare is going to own this. There's no way this idea you're building is going to be its own thing. And now, yeah, Foursquare is a B2B business.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:26:30):\nYeah. And all the Foursquare clones, if they didn't pivot out of doing what they're doing, wouldn't have worked. So anyway, that's a tarpit, is just something that's super appealing and a lot of people do it. And then you can get validation and that's why is a tarpit, is it draws you in and you get stuck because it seems like it's a good idea and you get all this positive feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):\nAlong these lines, I was talking to a founder recently and she's asking me, \"What causes an investor to say no to you when you're trying to raise money from them?\" And I know every investor has a very different perspective on what turns them off to a startup, but is there anything that you find is just like, here, if you do these things, investors will say no.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:27:09):\nMaybe my best advice here is for founders to put themselves in the shoes of investors and just imagine what their life is like and how if you are in their shoes you would make decisions. And so given this framework, a lot of investors just don't make that many investments and as per what we talked about earlier, life is short. And so there's lots of things that an investor that in their hearts thinks it is pretty good and they're like, \"Oh, I like this person and I like their pitch, but I only am going to do a few investments. And so even though I really like a lot about this, I'm going to say no.\" And I often think that founders think that there's some secret truth that's being held from them on why someone says no or they want more feedback. \"I need feedback.\" That's like, well, the feedback is we didn't want to invest and it really is just that.\n\n(00:28:05):\nAnd so I think if you put yourself in the shoes of an investor of like, \"Hey, I only could do a few of these a year, I have very limited budget.\" They're really just trying to pick the things that they're either personally most excited about or things that they think can be truly phenomenally big in some way. Or again, I know you do investments too, so it's that you only get so many shots as an investor. And so anything that doesn't seem like this is the one, this is the one I want to do is a no. And that that's actually why they're saying no versus, \"Oh, you had a bad zoom setup or something. Oh, we didn't like what color your shirt was. We said no.\" I don't think that's how this actually works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:50):\nI think that's such a good piece of advice that it's not necessarily they don't believe in what you're doing, it's they have better options and they're waiting for something that hits the higher bar because they have a lot of options.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:29:00):\nYeah. Because again, if you ask someone or put yourself in the investor's shoes, wouldn't you be making decisions the same way? Usually founders are like, \"Yeah.\" If you do that exercise, a lot of this starts to make way more sense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):\nSpecifically when you're evaluating startups. I wasn't going to go into this, but I think it might be interesting, is market size. How do you think about the importance of large TAM as an investor YC?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:29:25):\nI think it really depends on what stage you're investing at and it's absolutely critical the later stage you get. Right? If you're going to invest in a very high valuation, it is really important. The earlier you go, the less it matters. And some of the most phenomenally good startups, if you were really pedantic about it, the TAM would be tiny. The TAM of Uber would be nothing, right? The TAM of Airbnb would've been nothing. TI funded Razorpay, which is I think the largest payment processor in India, and the TAM of that was tiny because no one was using credit cards in 2015 in India. So you had to believe that the size of the credit card industry in India would 100X. Well, guess what happened? You know what I'm saying? So I'm not saying that having a large market someday doesn't matter, of course it does eventually. But trying to be super pedantic about market size when it's a pre-seed company or someone applying to YC, it's just not something I'd put a lot of thought.\n\n(00:30:34):\nAnd again, Whatnot. What's the TAM of the collectible Funko Pop industry? I don't know. I don't think it's that big, man. I don't know if you did that analysis when you invested, but I think is pretty small, but I wasn't worried about it. That was the last thing I was worried about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):\nIt makes so much sense that at YC you don't think about it that much because of, as you said, many startups pivot anyway. So if you like the team-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:30:57):\nYeah. And I'm not saying it's not important, it's not... And the things I'm worried about is like, hey, how do you get users? Hey, how do you grow? Things like that. Are you making something people want? Those are the things I'm really worried about as opposed to, ooh, I ran an Excel model and I'm worried this might not be a big enough TAM. That's not the top of my list.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:15):\nI think it's important to acknowledge that a lot of investors are very... YC I think is unique in a lot of ways where you invest very early and you help people through this journey. A lot of investors are very focused on TAM, so you may find you're getting turned down because they don't think there's a big enough market for you to build a big business, right?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:31:32):\nYeah. Or that you're asking them to believe a crazy leap of faith that, again, they could say, \"Well, it's theoretically possible you'll be able to sell more than Funko Pops, and I understand that that is your pitch, but I have other opportunities that are less risky.\" You know what I'm saying? A lot of founders make the argument that the TAM is big, and you can say, \"Wow, that's a really interesting argument and I'm not going to argue with you about it, but no, I'm not going to...\" And so again, it's hard to get someone to engage in a debate about TAM even if you have some proof points. Ultimately, a lot of investors just don't like that risk. Fair enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:15):\nFair enough. Going in a slightly different direction. So someone else that worked with you, another Lenny, Lenny Bogdonoff who started a company called Milk, and then he was head of growth at OpenAI for a bit. He asked me to ask you about things product leaders and startups should watch out for. Does that ring a bell?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:32:35):\nI don't remember the specific office hours, but I understand the question and I of course remember Lenny. I think that the advice that he's referencing here is just how important it is to not overdelegate and for the founders to stay close to things, as well as watch out for the trap of hiring super senior people with fancy resumes, really early in a startup. I think that's what he's referencing there. And again, this is definitely one of those very basic things that we find ourselves repeating a lot where they're like, \"Yeah, yeah, I get it. Don't overdelegate. We get it, Dalton.\" And then two years later they're like, \"Wow, we overdelegated. We need to go clean that up.\" So that is probably the best product advice. And the folks that are really great at product, the founders that are always deeply in the weeds on product and still care a lot and are still talking to customers, no matter how late stage it gets, again, I'm sure you experienced this in Airbnb culture, but you can't delegate caring about your users and you can't delegate caring that the product is great. That is so critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:36):\nTo make this even more real, what is it that you see them do? It's they hire a PM too early, they hire a senior salesperson too early, what are the-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:33:43):\nYeah, I think that you get pushed often by investors to hire executives or to scale the team or you raise all this money, you got to spend it, you got to show you're serious about growth and building a world-class organization, whatever, stuff like that. And so you end up with super nice people with super shiny resumes from big tech companies. \"Oh wow, they did this amazing thing at Google.\" And then they hire them and then you wake up one day and you're like, \"Oh wow, everything went wrong.\" It's not really anyone's fault, it's just that you took your eye off the ball and this is what happens to first-time founders a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:24):\nHow do you as a founder then have time to do all these things? Is there any guidance you give just like don't overdelegate, don't over hire? But also, you have 24 hours in a day? Is it just find the time, prioritize well, or is there more to it?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:34:39):\nI think if you just care a lot about your customers and you care a lot about the product, your instincts are pretty good on what to spend time on. And so for example, spending tons and tons of time hanging out with investors and networking, it's probably the thing that I would be cutting. You know what I'm saying? It's what we talked about earlier. If you really love what you're doing, no one needs to tell you how to reprioritize your time. Your intuition will be correct on what you should be spending all your time on, which is being obsessed with product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):\nI love that advice.

Okay, so one of your current colleagues, not former colleagues, Gustav, was on the podcast previously. His episode is, I think, the fourth most popular episode of all time currently, so no pressure.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:36:54):\nOh, Cool. Okay. I don't know if I can feed with that. All right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:56):\nI think you can. So I asked him what is often the most common reason a startup fails? And his answer was they don't talk to customers, they don't find product market fit. They nothing else matters if they can't do that. And so his advice is talk to customers more often. So two questions here. First of all, just is there anything else you would add to why do startups fail? I know we talked about some of these already, but just what comes to mind there?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:37:23):\nI completely agree with what Gustav said, but to look at this from a different frame, I think is that the founders lose hope. And when you and your heart is like, \"Yeah, we're failing.\" I can see it when I'm meeting with a founder, when they resign themselves that they're failing versus. First is when like, \"We got one more move in us. We got one more try.\" You can see in their eyes when they feel like there's more ideas or there's some last ditch Hail Mary thing. It doesn't always work, but it's almost like you have to not accept that you're going to fail. And as long as you don't accept that that's going to happen, there's usually a lot more moves you can try to save the company. Maybe it's to get profitable, maybe it's to do some other zany thing, maybe it's to launch a new product.\n\n(00:38:17):\nAnd so it's pretty rare, I would argue, that the cause of death is that they had lots of firepower and they were feeling really positive and they just ran out of money. That's actually more rare than founders think. It's much more common that they still have some money left. I'm not saying a lot, but some money and they're just like, \"Yeah, I'm done. I'm out of ideas. I don't want to do this anymore.\" And again, fair enough. But do you get what I'm saying? I think founders are afraid that they're going to run out of money and that's why they're going to shut down. And it's way more common that their idea doesn't work and they have a big fight with their co-founder, and then they can't agree on what to work on, and then they just like, \"I don't want to do this anymore.\" And they shut down. That is the most common cause of death, is something that sounds like that story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):\nThat is so interesting. And again, this comes back to your core advice. Don't die. Just don't die. We talked about this already of just sometimes it's actually okay to die. And I guess just to refresh that lesson is if you're not having fun anymore, maybe it's okay-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:39:16):\nYeah, you're out of ideas. You're like, \"I'm done.\" If in your heart that you're done, you don't have to keep going through the motions. No one benefits.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:23):\nAnd you've also seen enough cases now, you've shared a few of these where all hope was potentially lost, but they kept going and then they turned into a huge success story. And I think most people don't see those examples. I guess is there anything you can share just how often that happens, how often you see that turn around?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:39:41):\nI would argue that if we define it as the company had a near death experience where it was going poorly and the founders seriously wondered if it was all going to be over, a hundred percent of the time people go through that where the founder's like, \"Yeah, I guess we're done. I guess we should pack it in.\" And at least you feel that way at some point in your startup journey, man, everyone goes through that. And again, there's gradations, people that actually truly got down to very, very hard situations. It's still a high percentage, maybe 50%. I mean, you can ask founders, there's a lot of founders that come this close to it all being over and through sheer will just keep it going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:21):\nThat is really empowering, I imagine, for many founders hearing this of just knowing every single founder goes through, okay, I think it's actually over. Following on this real quick, the advice that Gustav shared, which is about talking to customers. I'm just going to keep trying to pull wisdom out of your head. Do you have any advice for just how to effectively talk to customers? We're always hearing, \"Talk to customers. Build things they want.\" Easier said than done. You get a lot of asks. You get one customer asking for a lot of stuff. There's a big company that's like, \"Build this thing, we'll pay a million dollars.\" Just do you have general guidance of just what to pay attention to and what to build versus avoid?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:40:57):\nYeah, I think when I talked to aspiring founders about this a lot, they're like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I talked to customers. We get it. Cool.\" And I'm like, \"Cool. Well, how many customers do you talk to?\" And they're like, \"Well.\" And they get really quiet. And so I think this is one of those things like, hey, you should have a healthy diet and exercise every day or whatever, where people know it and that doesn't mean they do it. And so I think to start with, you have to get out in the world and talk to people in person. And you can't just hide behind your keyboard and call that talking to customers. Right? I think a lot of folks, the inclinations are to build a landing page and buy some Instagram ads and try to get people to sign up for something. And again, maybe that's something, but I think a lot of the reason people do that is they're just shy and they don't want to put themselves out there because it's a little awkward to go talk to people.\n\n(00:41:49):\nAnd you have to set yourself up to go out in the physical world, get people to meet with you, get them to take you seriously, show them a product you're building. And so again, it'd be very tactical here. You can do a self-assessment. In the past month, how many in-person physical meetings have I had with potential customers? Maybe you've done a lot, I don't know, listener, maybe you have, but it's shocking how many companies I talk to, they're like, \"Well, we're focused on raising our pre-seed round before we talk to customers.\" Things like that. And again, I think the core, core thing going on is just social anxiety and looking stupid. And I think you just got to get past that. You just got to start doing it until it doesn't feel bad anymore. Think about how stupid the Airbnb founders must have felt. They were like, \"Hey, you should rent out your house and I'm going to come and sleep in your house, and here's an airbag.\"\n\n(00:42:51):\nThe whole thing is a little awkward, right? So you got power through the awkwardness of talking to people, and once you start doing it's actually fun. And so once you get used to overcoming this awkwardness, I think people do much better at talking to customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):\nWhen someone does this self-evaluation, is there a heuristic that tells you this is enough? What do you look for? Is there a number? How many per week? How many per month?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:43:17):\nYeah, I don't know if I know a good number. I think it's look at your calendar and there should be 20 or 30% of your time that the calendar says something like customer meeting, customer call, meeting with who, meeting with this person. And when the calendar is not that or it's all... Again, what you're actually doing is just buying ads to try to validate your idea, I don't think that's talking to customers. I think that's something else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:46):\nThat's an awesome heuristic. So roughly fifth of your time at least should be talking to customers.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:43:51):\nYeah. And again, it depends on the idea space you're working on. Some are more, some are less. So yeah, it should be a fair amount of time. And nothing substitutes for an actual conversation versus just staring at analytics dashboards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:02):\nMakes so much sense. So the Airbnb is a classic example of they went to New York and talked to their host and things like that. Is there another startup that comes to mind that did this really well, that found just a really cool way and hustle to talk to customers?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:44:14):\nWell, again, some of the companies we talked about, I mean, for Brex, they were just talking to other people in their batch and that worked extremely well. Same with Retool is they just sold it inside of the YC network. I think with Zip, they were just beasts at getting companies on calls with them to ask them about procurement. And I think they had way more than 20% of their time. When you looked at their calendars, oh man, they were talking to customers a lot to build their first product and pre-selling it before they built it. Same with PostHog I guess that's a different go to market. They launched this open source thing to start with and their calendars are filled with people that were trying to implement the first open source version of PostHog or were so excited about it.\n\n(00:44:59):\nAnd people on Hacker News were excited about it and they had this huge influx of people that were excited that PostHog existed and had lots of feedback and web reports. It wasn't always positive, but they never lacked for people that wanted to talk to them once they launched that, which was very helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):\nOn Zip, I actually have a lot of their story in one of my series on how to build a B2B startup. And what they did actually, as you know, is they just called, DMed people on LinkedIn and ask them for advice on, \"Hey, we're trying to understand how you enjoy your current procurement products.\" And then they ended up being early beta testers. And I think they did hundreds of these. They just-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:45:38):\nOh, yeah, no, it was a numbers game. They were just grinding at this. And so yeah, that was very good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:43):\nThe other classic YC stories, the Collison Collision, I think it's called or the-\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:45:47):\nCollison Install.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:49):\nOh, Collison Install. Okay. Can you tell that story briefly?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:45:53):\nThe Collison Install is what often happens with customers, is that they say, \"Yes, I want you buy your product.\" And then they do not implement it, they just go quiet. There's no implementation and this is very bad if you're selling software to someone. If they never implement it, they're going to churn. You basically failed on the one yard line, okay? And so they developed this tactic to be like, \"Oh, well, I'm at the neighborhood, I'll drop by your office to help you implement Stripe and just create...\" Again, it was a little awkward like we talked about earlier, but you would be like, \"Yeah. I'm in the neighborhood. How about I drop by?\" And then they would show up and they'd be like, \"Cool, cool. Can pull up your text editor?\" \"Oh yeah, cool. All right.\" \"Hey, can I drive? Can I have the keyboard?\"\n\n(00:46:43):\nAnd they would just install Stripe into the customer's website, smiling, being charming guys. And they'd be like, \"Oh, that's cool. Okay. Well, can we roll out the website now?\" And they basically would not go away until you finish the implementation of Stripe. And again, it was actually helpful because they were doing all this white glove service to get it implemented. That was very effective. And I think the takeaway from that story is even when you get a yes, you're not actually done with sales. You have to finish the last mile to get the thing implemented. And they were very good at that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:18):\nThat was an incredible story. And now they're, I don't know, a hundred billion in business and that's how it all begins.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:47:24):\nYeah. I was an early Stripe customer at my startup and yeah, Patrick would... We used Google Talk at the time. Patrick would be sending me messages on a weekly basis just checking in. And so again, it's funny how successful these folks get, but yeah, Patrick was very hands-on with all of his customers and was extremely available. I can say that because I was one of them. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:47):\nAnd I'm sure he had social anxiety going through all that. That wasn't a comfortable thing to do, just keep pushing people to install your software and deploy.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:47:54):\nOh, surely not. If you want your startup to work, this is just what you got to do. Comes with the territory.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:01):\nThis is going to be just a way broad question and I don't know if you'll have an answer, but just are there other just patterns you find across startups that do well? This is maybe the $64 million question of just founders and what they do that ends up leading to success.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:48:15):\nI don't think personality types matter as much. I've seen very quiet people, very extroverted people. You name it. I've seen all sorts of personality types. So for me personally, I don't think there's a personality type that people should copy and be like, \"I need to be like this person. I need to be Steve Jobs. I need to be Elon.\" I don't really believe in that because there's just so much variation. Tony from DoorDash is so different than a lot of folks, and Rujul is so different and Grant from Whatnot. These are all very, very different people. Patrick is a different kind of person. Ryan from Flexport. These are just very different personality types. But the thing that I would argue folks that build really big companies have in common is they just really want it and they really believe in themselves and they really believe they can make it work. And that they're somehow deep in their internal psyche, there's something that's like, \"I'm the one and I won't accept this not working.\"\n\n(00:49:26):\nAnd even though objectively there's all this data coming in, this isn't working, this is bad. My employees want to quit, my executives want to quit. Whatever it is. Somewhere deep down in there, they're like, \"Oh yeah, I'm going to make this work. This company is going to be big.\" And they just believe. And it's almost like that internal gravitational force inside of them is so large, it warps the world to bend to that will. And people start to believe it because they believe it so much and they convince their employees to believe in and they convince everyone around them that this is going to happen for them. And so again, this is not a personality trait. I'm arguing this is a core belief.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:10):\nSo interesting. And it connects so much to what we've been talking about. Just don't die. Don't lose hope in what you're working on. A founder hearing this might feel like, \"Man, I don't know if I'm so convinced this is going to work.\" In your experience, how much of this is internally, they're so certain and convinced versus externally, they need to show this confidence?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:50:31):\nWell, I think it's internally they're convinced. Yeah, I'm not sure it's external. But, and this is the big but, no one has this at the early stages when they don't have a good idea and they don't have customers and it's objectively not working. And so again, I know a lot of founders are like, \"Well, I don't feel that way. Oh no, maybe I'm an imposter and I shouldn't do a startup.\" Well, of course you don't feel that way if you haven't talked to any customers and haven't built a product. But what usually happens is you pivot to a good idea where you start with a good idea that you care about and customers you care about and you launch it. And the better the product does, the more obsessed you get with your own company.\n\n(00:51:12):\nI think in the case of Stripe, I don't want to tell Patrick's story for him, but I recall him saying at some point he wasn't as sure that Stripe was going to work until they were a year or two in. And then once it started working and then they really believed in it. But it wasn't like he woke up one day and like, \"Stripe is the thing. It's going to work.\" I think you build conviction and you have this network effect virtual cycle where you get work conviction. The more customers reflect back to you and data reflects back to you that you're on the right track.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:45):\nThis is exactly what Scott Belsky shared in our episode when I asked him when to pivot is, do you have more conviction this is going to work or less conviction over time? And so I like that connection we just made there. Okay, so we've talked about all these way startups fail, bad ideas, tarpit ideas. I want to go to the flip side and talk about good startup ideas. So recently you put out a request for startups, which is essentially 20 categories of ideas that you want to fund, that YC wants to fund. Can you share some of these ideas that you're excited about? And basically you're looking to fund and looking for founders to work on.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:52:21):\nYeah. And so we put out the request for startups just to inspire people to maybe apply with ideas that aren't the ones that we always see. It's not prescriptive like we will only fund ideas on this list. It is not that at all. Remember what I talked about earlier with information diet? We're trying to mix up some of the information diet about what kind of ideas people might be contemplating. There aren't currently. And so a couple of the ones that we put out there, I made one about ERPs which is enterprise resource planning software. And I did that because I get so few applications on that and they're usually pretty good. And I just would love to see more people look at that and learn about what the ERPs are, just because it's so rare that people apply with that. And now I have a feeling we're going to see a lot more applications working on that. And so it worked as intended, which is to introduce this idea space to founders that didn't even know what an ERP was. Now they'll go learn about it.\n\n(00:53:16):\nAnother one is we'd like to fund open source companies. And so that's one of the RFSs where if more people apply to YC with open ideas, I think we'd be pretty excited about that. Maybe founders didn't realize that that would be something we want to fund. Same with space companies. Yeah, we've had a lot of success with space companies. Several of the folks that are actually going to space right now that aren't SpaceX or YC companies. And so I think sometimes founders feel like those ideas are too bold and ambitious, but no, I'd love if more people apply with space companies. And so think about it that way, where we're trying to put out of idea spaces that perhaps someone subconsciously filtered out as what might be a good startup idea. And hopefully that creates a new set of startup ideation for the person.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nAnd we're going to link to this page in the show notes for folks that want to explore. I'll give a couple more real quick. A way to end cancer, no big deal. Spatial computing, new defense technology, bringing manufacturing back to America. So a lot of hard science, deep tech stuff, which is maybe a new... I don't know. I imagine you guys have invested this in the past, but it feels like trend.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:54:30):\nWe totally have, right? So these aren't like, \"Oh, we've never invested in these before.\" It's more of like, \"Hey, it'd be cool if we saw more applications along these lines.\" It would be nice because it currently feels a little bit under... There could be more startups working on this stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):\nYeah, instead of the tarpit ideas. A couple more real quick, better enterprise glue.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:54:51):\nYeah, I like that idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):\nSay more about that. What does that look like?\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:54:55):\nThe software to connect all these business systems is usually pretty brittle and janky, and there's been lots of good startups founded to solve this problem. I think there's still a lot more room for improvement and likely LLMs will improve. We'll probably be able to create better and better glue so all sorts of software systems can talk to each other. And so again, very broad idea. But yeah, I think we'll see a lot of very successful companies where that's the kernel of the idea they start with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):\nAwesome. One last one. Small fine tune models as an alternative to gigantic generic ones. Yeah. Sweet. And so we'll include this link in the show notes and folks can click on each of these and there's a lot more explanation of what it is you're thinking about there. Awesome. Okay, just a couple more questions.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:55:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:39):\nOne is just your background. So from what I've read, in the early 2000s, you were basically hanging out with some of the biggest success stories of today. Folks like Zuck and Reid Hoffman, Sam Altman, Elon, Sean Parker. This is before they really became anyone and they all became very successful. I'm curious just looking back at that, what you've noticed is consistent across these folks that ended up being really successful over time.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:56:06):\nBack in 2003, being in Silicon Valley and being interested in startups, it was a really small space. There just weren't that many people that were into this stuff. And so I remember I cold emailed Reid Hoffman when LinkedIn was 12 employees and he just responded and he's like, \"Oh, let's have lunch.\" He was just a guy and everyone else that was doing, I guess you could call it social networking, that was the people that I knew. There was a few conferences you would go to and there'd be 30 people there. It reminds me of stories about the Homebrew Computer Club. I'm not saying this is as cool. But when I read stories about what it was like when the Homebrew Computer Club existed, it was a very small number of people that all knew each other that were real weirdo outsiders that were into this stuff, okay? And so that's what in the post.com boom Bay Area startup scene, that's legitimately what it felt like.\n\n(00:57:03):\nAnd so I didn't think a lot about the personality traits of these people. Again, they were all pretty different people, but what they had in common is the folks that are now the really big names just had a lot of staying power. Right? So when I met Sam, he had dropped out of Stanford to work on Loot, which is hilariously a way to find people around you to hang out with. An interesting theme here, huh? He was cool. He was this really young guy and he just did that. It wasn't huge. And then he got into other stuff and ended up working at YC, ended up getting involved in hard tech and has now reinvented himself as the big mind behind AI, which again, awesome. But if I think about who he was back in the day, yeah, he was a 23-year-old working on a thing for feature phones to find friends in your neighborhood.\n\n(00:57:58):\nTheir customer was Boost Mobile. I bet you could go find the commercials for Loot that Boost Mobile put out on YouTube. Those are actually pretty funny. Have you seen those commercials?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:06):\nNo, but I'm going to go check them out.\n\nDalton Caldwell (00:58:07):\nAnyway, it's pretty funny. So yeah, that's the real story. And then, yeah, I remember I was in downtown Palo Alto at the time, and some of the folks I was friends with were friends with Sean Parker, and this was actually before Sean Parker went to Facebook. He was part of Napster. And so one of my friends was like, \"Oh, we need to get my friend a ride to the airport.\" And so I ended up giving Sean Parker a ride to the Oakland Airport. And again, what was he like? I don't know. He just basically sat in the back seat on the phone the whole time. But again, my point is I wasn't like, \"Wow, these are going to be really big successful people that one day will be important in the world.\" It just felt like a bunch of nerds that really liked the internet and computers, doing things that they were interested in and were just obsessed with this.\n\n(00:58:57):\nThey weren't like, \"Gee, should I move to New York?\" Or, \"Maybe I should go to law school.\" It was people that were very bought in to staying working on internet companies. And so you'll see these folks just reinvent themselves multiple eras, right? Okay, like Reid Hoffman, he worked at PayPal, right? And then he did LinkedIn and then he was a VC. He's had all these different eras where it's the same person, but it's almost like a different figure, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:28):\nThere's a lot of interesting lessons there. One is that your career is long and you'll have the opportunity to do many things and you can continue to shift. In my example, this is my fourth career, I realized. I was an engineer, then a founder, then a product manager, now whatever this job is. And I think that's really common. I think the other, again, is the personality types point, which I didn't comment on, but I think it's so important that you can be super introverted and be super successful. You can be super extroverted and be very successful. And I think the key there is use your skills and strengths to achieve the same things. You don't have to be the amazing presenter on Steve Jobs type stage. You can do the same thing in a different way. And then the other point there is, again, coming back to you just need to be really excited and enjoy the work you're doing because that'll drive you forward and make you be successful. So I like that the story is a summary of so many of the things you've shared so far.\n\n(01:00:21):\nThere's other two other fun stories, maybe pick one. The other one is you sold your startup to MySpace and your job was basically to save MySpace. And then the other is you're the reason Andreessen Horowitz missed out on Instagram and couldn't invest. So which of those would you want to share?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:00:41):\nWell, it's the same story. And the way that it's the same story is my second company... Basically, I sold my first company to MySpace. It was the music company that I worked on. And they recruited a new CEO who was formerly the COO of Facebook called Owen Van Natta. So again, hilariously part of the same little circle of people. And Owen was like, \"Okay, we need to fix MySpace. Rupert Murdoch's got the juice. He wants me to fix it. We're going to do it. So come up with some ideas.\" And the best idea that I could come up with at the time was doing something around mobile photo sharing, something like Twitter, but for photos. And I figured with MySpace's user base, that would work pretty well. This was in 2010, so it was right as the App Store was getting big, and I had a lot of success in the App Store with imeem. It was one of the top downloaded music apps. And so I was like, \"Wow, the App Store was really good.\" And I was really into apps being the thing.\n\n(01:01:40):\nAnd at this time, Facebook was a little early on. They were trying to do cross-platform mobile apps, if you recall. And their apps were not great. This was, again, ancient history. So that was my plan. And then immediately Owen Van Natta was fired, and so I didn't even really get onboarded. And so I just left. I think I worked in MySpace for a month because the person that acquired my company got fired and I think the whole word chart got fired. I didn't even know who to talk to. It was really great. It was a great experience. You know what I'm saying? I wasn't really sure who my point of contact was at that point. I don't think they knew either. It was just a mess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):\nJust message Tom.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:02:19):\nNo, no. He was long gone. Seriously. I know you're kidding. But no, literally, I don't know who was left at that point. Tom was long gone. And so I was like, \"Well, I should just do a new startup and I should work on something like what I was thinking about.\" And I ended up starting the company and quickly was able to raise an angel around because people remembered my company from the first one. And the major investor we had was Andreessen Horowitz. This is one of their first board seat investments, like Marc Andreessen was on my board. And again, I have my own set of stories about that, but it was interesting experience and we launched it in... I think we got half a million or a million users. You can go find tech print articles about it. We launched on Android and iOS and it was mobile photo sharing, and actually it was growing pretty well. Okay?\n\n(01:03:11):\nAnd then what happened is there was another portfolio company called Bourbon, which was originally a ForceWare clone that was built by these two guys. And they decided to pivot out of that and into what... Which was pretty similar to my thing. Again, fair enough, that's just how this works. And they did something smart. Again, this is just me talking, I don't know what their version of the story is. But what I think they did that was smart is if you looked on the paid app store charts, the number one app was Hipstamatic and Hipstamatic cost money. And what do we know about what people want? They want things that are free that cost money, right? And so they basically built a pretty legitimate knockoff of the Hipstamatic filters, combining it with a social graph, and they launched it and it pretty quickly took off. So of course this is Instagram, right? And so it took off really quickly and that was a wild experience for me to be like, \"Oh, this seems familiar.\"\n\n(01:04:07):\nAnd basically because Andreessen Horowitz had invested in my company, was on the board, even though they were investors in Instagram, that was a conflict and they didn't do the deal. And then for whatever reason, this became a big source of Silicon Valley gossip, which was like, \"Wow, I can't believe this happened.\" And so it was just a really weird experience for me as a founder to be right in the middle of something that became culturally so important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:37):\nI imagine there's a bullseye in your back from a16z for a little bit.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:04:42):\nOh, I don't actually think they care. I don't think they held it against me because what did I do wrong?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:50):\nIt's true.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:04:50):\nI started a company. You know what I'm saying? Obviously there was some frustration, but I was guy who had a company that they invested in. I don't know. I didn't feel didn't much higher for them. I think this is just how life works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nYeah. I wonder if they changed their conflict policies after that at all.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:05:10):\nI don't think so. I think this has happened multiple other times, but those aren't my stories to tell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:17):\nAnd by the way, I don't know if you mentioned the name of your startup, it was called PicPlz, right?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:05:21):\nYeah, it's called PicPlz. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:21):\nGreat. Okay. So for the final phase before we get to very exciting lighting round, I have these two segments, recurring segments. I have failure corner and contrarian corner. We can do both or we can pick one or the other. Failure corner, share a story of a time in your career where you failed and when you learned from that experience. Contrarian corner, what's something you believe that most other people don't believe?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:05:45):\nYeah, I think for contrarian corner, I know where I would start and I think it's relevant for your listener. I think this is relevant to this and you could argue this isn't contrary, but here's what I think. I think growth and growth hacking and doing all this analytics, A/B testing stuff, is a total waste of time for very early startups. And that one of the weird things about having lots of startup advice on the internet, again, this is one of the reasons we started making videos at YC, is a lot of the advice was catered towards later stage companies. Like, \"Oh, here's how you set up your board and here's how you motivate your sales team.\" It was all aimed at series A, series B founders, and not for seed stage founders. The problem was seed stage founders would consume all the later stage advice and get really confused.\n\n(01:06:35):\nAnd so the anti-pattern I see is there are lots of founders that are very familiar with your awesome work, which again, I really recommend, I like it. But when you have no customers and you're reading Lenny's guides on how to set up split testing and how you did growth at Airbnb, oh man, that is so dumb. That is so not helpful. And so you see this inclination away from getting a first customer, getting one customer and talking to that person, and instead they have all this really complex growth hacking theory. I think this also happens if you worked in big tech where your product already has scale. And so if you work at Facebook and your job is to launch new little features, yeah, of course you should make heavy use of analytics and A/B testing and split testing and feature flags. Yeah, yeah, yeah, makes sense. But when you have no users, what are you doing? So do you think that's contrary? What do you think? I'm just trying to argue this advice applied to a startup that's too early is actively not helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nI think it's contrarian for many people. 100%. I also 100% agree with it. It makes me feel like I need to, at the top of my post, share here's who this is for. If you're earlier than this, ignore it. If you're later than this, ignore it.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:07:49):\nI mean, again, I'm not saying you do anything wrong, but imagine if the OG Airbnb founders took all of your current advice and applied it when they had four users and they knew their names and they were trying to run complicated growth hacking split testings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):\nYeah. Maybe just to clarify when you talk about growth hacking. So obviously when you're starting something, say a consumer app, you need to get a bunch of users somehow. What's your sense of just when you say don't do this sort of thing, but this is okay? What falls in those buckets?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:08:20):\nI think it depends on the idea. I think in the case of Whatnot, it was consumer app and they needed to get users. But they were very intellectually honest on the metrics for how you get a marketplace off the ground. And they didn't just go dump all their money into Instagram ads. They effectively knew they needed to focus on buyers and on the buy side and build momentum on the buy side. They really understood marketplaces. And so for consumer, I think it's having a sophisticated view of how you get the consumer company off the ground. I think if you look at the Facebook story, them getting a hundred percent penetration on the Harvard campus first instead of launching overall. Again, good strategy, would recommend that strategy. So again, the way to extrapolate that is know what your comps are of what companies you... Or type is, and then look at what they did on the zero to one and ignore what they do today. Right?\n\n(01:09:20):\nDon't pay attention to what Facebook does today if you're a brand new startup founder, pay attention to Facebook when they were getting their first thousand users. What were those tactics?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):\nI feel like this should be its own episode where we just go into how to get your first thousand users. I know there's a video actually we'll link to that Gustav made with YC's advice on how to get your users. Did you want to visit failure corner or not? Or shall we move on?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:09:43):\nI failed at tons of stuff. As an investor, I make lots of bad investments as well as good ones. I think in my startups I pivoted a lot and a lot of things I did didn't work out. And so again, I just gave you a specific story with PicPlz, right? You just heard a specific story there. I guess what I learned is that you just can't let it get to you too much and you got to keep going. And that if you keep going, no one really remembers those as much and it doesn't really define you. Fear of failure shouldn't dominate all of your thoughts. And instead you should use your energy and positivity to keep trying to do good work, right? Because back in the day, if I would've been like, \"Well, I guess startups aren't for me, I guess tech isn't for me.\" I wouldn't have had a career doing any of this stuff. I wouldn't be working at YC, I wouldn't be advising companies, right?\n\n(01:10:36):\nSo I always had to have in my life a lot of optimism and energy and use that energy and motor to keep me going. And it served me really well, right? Even if lots of stuff I tried didn't work and continue to not work. Again, obvious stuff I know, but yeah, that doesn't mean it's not true, even though it's obvious.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:58):\nI feel like that's a recurring theme here and I love that it's another version of just how not to die. There's the startup itself that shouldn't die, and then there's your just drive and motivation to keep going and try new things when things don't work out. I love all the recurring themes and messages for people here. Dalton, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:11:20):\nYeah, I guess the final thought is if someone wants to do a startup and doesn't know where to start, just to give you permission to talk to potential customers and try to pre-sell something before you write code and have those conversations. I think so many folks don't know where to begin on starting a startup, and my tactical advice is start doing customer validation first versus building a PowerPoint deck, versus trying to raise money versus all these other things. I think a lot of people don't use that strategy, and basically if you find people that are really excited and you do line up customers, that is a great green light that it is time to do a startup, right? That can get you down the path. So yeah, I think that's my final advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:09):\nAnd then with that, when does the building come in? Is it build it while you're talking, build it before you... It depends on basically-\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:12:15):\nBuild it once you have some conviction and then you're like, \"Oh, I think I would have a customer. I think that at least one person would use this thing I want to build. At least one.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:23):\nI love it. I love the simplicity and pragmatism of all of your advice. Dalton, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:12:33):\nLet's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:34):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:12:38):\nI think a lot of founders are afraid of doing sales and they don't know how to do sales, and they think they need these really experienced sales coaches and they need all this training, and I'll be like, \"Well, go on to Amazon and find the most popular sales books like Getting to Yes that everyone reads, and just read those and that'll get you 80% of the way there.\" You know what I'm saying? They want to hire someone for millions of dollars to give them sales coaching. I'm like, \"Well, have you read these really basic sales books?\" And they're like, \"No.\" And so I think that's a low cost way to go on Amazon, Getting to Yes and a few other of the top sellers, I forget the names, and just read those, and that is your crash course on how to be great at sales.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:16):\nAwesome. There's also this book called Founding Sales that I imagine you're familiar with. Pete Kazanjy was on the podcast talking about that and that's something I always recommend because it's just like, \"How founders can do sales.\"\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:13:26):\nStart there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):\nStart there. Great. We'll link to that. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:13:33):\nThis may be warping what you're asking for, but I like to watch old shows a lot, and so I keep rewatching The Sopranos and the Wire, and it always is different to me every time and things like that. I think here's a silly answer. I've been really enjoying watching old episodes of Columbo, which was a television show from the '70s and '80s. I don't know why, I don't even know if this is destructive, but for some reason, I'm really into that right now. It's very old episodes of Columbo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:59):\nYou're an old soul, Dalton.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:14:01):\nI guess. I don't know. It just feels like a time machine to a different time when I watch these things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:06):\nDefinitely, maybe one of the most unique answers yet.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:14:10):\nFair enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:11):\nColumbo.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:14:12):\nWell, again, I guess I'm not trying to give you an answer where I sound super clever-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:15):\nNo, I love this.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:14:16):\nI'm telling you the real answer. So that's actually what I'm watching.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:19):\nIt does actually sound very sophisticated and clever. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask, I guess founders in this context?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:14:28):\nI don't really believe in trick questions, and I think I just start with, \"Hey, so tell me about what you're working on.\" Or, \"What have you learned since you started?\" Again, none of these are trick questions, but I think you can get the most honest and interesting answers by asking the most straightforward basic things and having that be a blank slate for their answers to draw on. You know what I'm saying? So I like the most simple prompts and let them take the conversation where they want to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):\nI know this probably is a very big question, but just what do you look for in their answer that gives you a sense of this is a good or bad answer?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:15:05):\nFor YC interviews?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:05):\nYeah. And I know this is its own podcast episode.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:15:08):\nI think evidence that they actually have thought about it. As per I said earlier, that they've done research, that they have opinions, that they care about it. Right? Sometimes when people answer questions, you can just tell that it's really superficial, and they haven't put much care or soul into their answers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):\nAwesome. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:15:35):\nI like my Oura ring and my Apple Watch and all that good stuff. I've been a fan. There's a YC clinic called SiPhox, S-I-P-H-O-X, I just sign up for, and they do at-home blood testing. And basically I'm trying to sync that at-home blood testing thing into all my other devices. I don't know. I really enjoy all the stuff that Apple and other startups are working on and YC companies are working on around personal health. And so yeah, those are products I'm into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):\nSiPhox. Okay. And wait, then you do a needle and stuff and you take your own blood?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:16:09):\nIt's this little tiny needle. It doesn't hurt at all. It takes a few drops of blood and you do it at home and you mail it in and then it has all these blood tests. It's actually really cool. Yeah. It was one of those cases where I saw it and then I later was like, \"Oh, wait, that's a YC company.\" Basically, I became a customer and was pleasantly surprised that it's a YC company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):\nAnd I think I found it. So it's S-I-P-H-O-X health dot com.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:16:38):\nYeah, it really rolls off the tongue, right? Yeah, that's the name of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):\nVery cool. Okay, I see the little needle. Okay, great. Go SiPhox. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life, share with friends?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:16:55):\nJust check in with yourself that you're having fun and that you enjoy what you're doing. And if you don't, you should probably make a change, whatever that is. And again, if you're a founder, you're in control, right? You can change your own company. But I think a lot of people go through life and they don't ask themselves this question, am I having fun? Am I enjoying? Do I value what I'm spending my time on? And I think that you just can go back to this over and over and over again as a good prompt on how to decide what to do with your life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:29):\nEasier said than done to change that in many cases, but it always starts with realizing, okay, this isn't actually what I-\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:17:35):\nYeah, and bidding to yourself. Yeah, I'm not really enjoying this, and then trying to be like, \"Well, how can I fix it?\" Having that conversation with yourself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):\nYeah. It reminds me of a Steve Jobs quote where you wake up day after day, it's okay to wake up some days being like, \"I don't want to be doing this.\" But if it's every day and continues to happen, then that's a sign you should change it.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:17:53):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:54):\nFinal question. You and Michael Seibel have been doing this incredible podcast together. If somebody wanted to check out the podcast and dive in, is there an episode that you love most that you think they could start with?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:18:05):\nIt depends. Some of the episodes are more for folks that already have a startup and they're dealing with problems. I don't know. Some of the episodes about investors or things like that. It's very clear that the audience for those is current startup founders. And there's a lot that are just more life advice, how to make decisions and think about. And those have strangely become very popular and gotten a lot of views with non-startup founders, which is a pleasant surprise. And so I'd recommend those for folks in the audience that are not currently startup founders. I don't know. Life tips from top founders, I think is a good-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:41):\nOh, from billionaires? Is it that one?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:18:43):\nYeah, yeah. I think that was pretty popular. So what I'd be looking for is diagnose, am I a current founder and I have founder problems? Or am I just looking for general philosophy type questions? And I really like those philosophy ones. We have one for high school students, the audience is, here's advice for high school students that are interested in startups. Here's some tips that you should be thinking about. Again, pretty narrow target audience, but I love that episode because we're really trying to speak directly to that audience and I think it's pretty good advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:13):\nDalton, you are wonderful. Thank you for sharing so much wisdom. This is action packed. I'm really excited for founders to listen to this. I think it's going to make a big dent in a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and follow up on some of this? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:19:27):\nI am on Twitter/X.com and Dalton.C is my username. And also my LinkedIn is pretty good. It's pretty popular. I don't know. Just search for my name on LinkedIn. And yeah, I'd love to see you all there. And then how can folks be helpful? I mean, honestly, it's just great when folks want to apply to YC and do a startup. And so feel free to dive into other videos and apply to YC. And something that's really special about my job is I get the privilege of getting to fund companies that they already know me from videos and they're shocked that I'm exactly the same as... Effectively, they're like, \"Wow, you're just that guy from the videos I've been watching, and it's so cool that you're just exactly like you seem in the videos.\" And so basically, yeah, if people like what I have to say and they like the videos and apply to YC, I would love to fund their companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:21):\nDalton, thank you so much for being here.\n\nDalton Caldwell (01:20:24):\nSure thing. Thanks so much, Lenny. Appreciate it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:26):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
