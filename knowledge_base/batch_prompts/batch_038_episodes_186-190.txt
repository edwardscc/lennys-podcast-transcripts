I do not recommend using SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who likes SAFe, found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:18):\nYou've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with product owners, Scaled Agile, and all these things.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:00:23):\nThis product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today. It was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on. I ended up going to a ton of Agile conferences and speaking about product management, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nIt feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:00:44):\nA lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. When you look at agile methodologies, what we're really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:05):\nToday my guest is Melissa Perri. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational book Escaping the Build Trap, and her most recent book Product Operations. She's also the CEO and founder of The Product Institute, which trains product managers at all levels. She's trained PMs at almost every Fortune 500 company at this point, and in our conversation we dive deep into a topic that I don't spend a lot of time on on this podcast, product owners, Scrum, Scaled Agile, and building product at very large non-tech companies.\n\n(00:01:38):\nMelissa shares the history behind these ways of working, what she's seen work and not work when companies roll out these frameworks, and most importantly what you can do as a leader at one of these companies and as a product owner working in one of these companies to level up your organization and yourself. I learned a ton from this conversation and I'm really curious to hear what you think since we don't cover this kind of stuff on this podcast too much.

Melissa, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:02:19):\nThanks, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):\nFirst, let me give a little context on this conversation that we're having. I think it's going to be a little bit unique. I was doing a deep dive on the job market in tech, and I saw something that was really surprising to me that the product owner role was the third-fastest growing role in tech, and this was just in the US, the data I was looking at, but I think it's probably true broadly. This was extremely surprising to me because I've never worked with a product owner, I don't hear anyone in my circles talking about product owners, I've never wanted to hire a product owner, and it feels like it's just this very different part of the tech ecosystem that you don't hear a lot about on podcasts like this, and it's clearly growing so I felt like it'd be really helpful to spend some time helping people and helping me understand this part of the world.\n\n(00:03:08):\nI asked you to come on to talk about this. You've been up close and personal with a lot of companies working with this way of working with product owners, Scaled Agile and all these things, so I couldn't think of a better person to have on here to help us understand what's happening here, and also just to help people do this better. Melissa, thank you again for coming on and helping us understand this.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:28):\nYeah, I'm excited to talk about this. I have been really passionate about this topic for many years and I've been talking about it in both agile circles and product management circles, so pretty excited for the listeners to hear what else is going on out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

Hi Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:13):\nYes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, [inaudible 00:05:22], and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:31):\nYes. We just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:53):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema, not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:06:05):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:24):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co, that's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:06:39):\nBefore we get into the history, is there just anything broadly that you think might be helpful to share before we dive into the history of the product owner role and all these things?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:06:46):\nMaybe it'll help to set some context of where did I see all of this start emerging as well. When I started in tech, I was very much a product manager, never heard of the product owner role before in my life. In Escaping the Build Trap I talk a lot about how we used Scrum when I started working with this team in a startup, and it was the first time I ever heard of it. That was 2011. At the time, the person who was teaching me about agile was very like, \"Hey, this is flexible. We're just going to break things into sprints. We're going to sit there and actually talk about the work. This is made for us to actually get better at our jobs.\" We were pretty sold on it and it was never dogmatic. As I worked at other companies, I found that they were being a little more dogmatic with their Scrum, with their stand-ups, how we actually run things.\n\n(00:07:36):\nThen I started speaking at conferences, and one of the first conferences I spoke at in New York City was called Lean UX, and there was a bunch of people from the agile world there too. I learned that this was much bigger than what we were learning in my company and what we were doing in these companies. There's this whole group of people out there practicing agile, and I was like, \"Oh, this is cool. I want to learn how to do things better. Teach me about your philosophies.\" I ended up going to a ton of agile conferences and speaking about product management.\n\n(00:08:04):\nAt the time, people were really excited to hear more about it, and I started to learn that there was this product owner role in Scrum where I was talking more about how we traditionally talk about product management, understand your customer, go out test things, make sure there's a hypothesis, don't just blindly build what you want to build. I found out that that was not the case in a lot of these companies who are adopting Scrum and introducing a product owner role, so I started doing a lot of trainings through my school product institute and I'd get called into these large companies, all these large banks, probably around 2014, 2015, to help them learn product management. I was really excited about this because before, they didn't want anything to do with it. They were like, \"I don't know what product management is. I don't need this.\"\n\n(00:08:47):\nI go in to train people and I found that a lot of them had been going through an agile transformation and they had all of these new product owners where they came in and they basically said, \"Hey, you're a product owner now. Your whole role has changed.\" They came from all different backgrounds. Some were developers, so a lot were business people who worked on the banking side, a lot were business analysts, some were project managers, but they just collectively took a bunch of people and said, \"Tada, today you're going to be a product owner because we're going to do agile now.\" I will come in and help train these people.\n\n(00:09:20):\nWhat I found was that there was a really big misconception about what those people should be doing compared to what they teach in agile and Scrum versus what we all consider great product management. I've been trying to fill that gap for the last almost 10 years working with these companies here. Then I would go to their leaders and at the beginning of these agile transformations, I'd be like, \"You can't just do Scrum. That's not going to make you amazing at delivering products. There's so much more to this.\" The leaders didn't quite understand that.\n\n(00:09:51):\nI'm noticing this really big shift in the industry where we're finally getting there. A lot of companies are doing it well now. Capital One is a great example that took their agile transformation and started adding product management on it, and they've really turned that around in the card business. So many organizations are still at the beginning of this journey and they're at the place where I saw people 10 years ago. I think there's still a lot of companies out there. Maybe we take it for granted in tech or in Silicon Valley about how many companies are doing this and how big this scope is where they're making these roles, but they're not really doing product management end to end. That's where I've seen all of these areas and I've been trying to help organizations for the last 10 years really set up robust product management practices. It's not just one piece of development, it's how do we actually build better products?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:42):\nI love this example of Capital One. It can work really well and you can get to a place where it's actually really productive. There's a few ways we can go about this. Do you think it would be helpful to talk through the history of the product owner role just like where it initially emerged?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:10:56):\nYeah, I think that's a great place to start. I think it brings a lot of context too to what's happening. People forget about the history here. When I explain it to people, I say we had product managers in Silicon Valley, right? They were in Google, they were in all of these companies, Amazon, and they were born out of this business role. From a software native company, your software is the business, right? It's what you sell, it's what you actually look at. Our product managers in Silicon Valley, they're doing market research, they're talking to customers, they're working with developers, they're iterating, they're doing the end-to-end product management.\n\n(00:11:31):\nWhat happened on the other side of things, especially in large companies, is the emergence of product management from Scrum, from product ownership. That's usually the first time these companies were introduced to product management was from implementing a product owner role and then going, \"Hey, we're still not meeting our goals. Are we building the right thing?\" Then they started thinking product management. Where that role came from is Scrum. If we go back and talk about the history of agile, agile was a movement that got started by software developers. In 2001, the Agile Manifesto was written. A bunch of developers got together in Park City, Utah, they were all skiing together and they said, \"Hey, we've been independently all working on how to develop software better.\"\n\n(00:12:18):\nSome people were practicing Scrum as we know it today. That was Ken Schwaber, Jeff Sutherland. There were people who were doing different types of agile frameworks as well, Kanban, where you were moving it through a Kanban board. There was behavioral-driven development, there was feature-driven development. That was the style of agile. There was XP, extreme programming, that was started by Ron Jeffries. All of these people found each other saying, \"Hey, we've been trying to push the boundaries of how do we develop better software,\" and they got together and they wrote the Agile Manifesto as we know it today.\n\n(00:12:51):\nThe Agile Manifesto is really just a guideline on how they're striving to not just be people who code what people want, but building better products. How do we build better products through software development? The premise to remember this is, and I keep saying it, but they're all software developers. Nobody was a product manager who went to that meeting. Nobody who wrote the Agile Manifesto was actually a product manager. I've spent a long time talking to these people as well over the past 10 years just saying, \"Hey, how did this come about? Where did this come from?\"\n\n(00:13:23):\nThe one person who was really close to them who was a product manager was Jeff Patton, but he never signed the Agile Manifesto, he wasn't at that meeting. He talked to them a lot, he was able to see what was going on, but all of this was a purge from how do we build better products from a development perspective. That's really important to know. Two of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto, Jeff and Ken, as I was talking about, they were independently coming up with Scrum on their own in their different companies, and they got together and started to codify it and they said, \"This is how I'm doing it, this is how I'm doing it.\" They ended up writing the Scrum Guide. The Scrum Guide is what a lot of people base their agile practices off of today. In the Scrum Guide, it outlines a bunch of roles that you would do on the development team, and then it says how you should be developing products.\n\n(00:14:11):\nMost people out there are working in Scrum today, and what they say is, \"Let's break things down into two-week sprints.\" You can change the length of your sprint if you want to, but two-week sprints is pretty standard at the beginning. We define what we're going to work on in the backlog. It's the product owner's responsibility to define what goes into the backlog, write down the user stories for it, do all that. Then the development team comes in, they discuss it, the product owner prioritizes it, they ask questions, and then the development team commits to what they want to build and they go out and do it. At the end, the result is a potentially shippable product, not necessarily shippable, but potentially shippable.\n\n(00:14:48):\nThey're trying to break it down into small chunks and build things instead of what they had been doing in a lot of companies, which was building stuff for three years and then releasing it in a big bang. What all of the people who signed the Agile Manifesto realized was if we do it the other way, if we do a waterfall type environment, agile waterfall, that's where we go across, there's a lot of risk because we don't test it with the customer and we don't get feedback on it if we spend three years building it and never show it to somebody. It really approached a different way of building software. It said let's chunk it down and try to get feedback faster. Really noble intention.\n\n(00:15:24):\nIn the Scrum guide though, it introduces these new roles. We have developers as we know and love them, we also have a product owner, then we have a Scrum master, and the Scrum master is in charge in Scrum of actually helping people do Scrum better. That's literally their job. How do I do Scrum better? How do I make sure that the team is working well together? They host things like retrospectives where at the end of a sprint we say what went well, what didn't go well, how should we actually inspect and adapt our process. The product owner is where things get murky.\n\n(00:15:57):\nThe product owner in general first showed up with Scrum, and if you go and you read the first Scrum guide, which I pulled up and started reading, because I've been very fascinated about how this is described, it says that the product owner is responsible for maximizing the value of work done, the team does the work. Interesting, because now the product owner is not quite part of the team. The team consists of developers with all the skills to turn the product owner's request into the potentially shippable increment each sprint. The team is usually seven plus or minus two members.\n\n(00:16:29):\nThen when you go further into the first version of the Scrum Guide, it does say that the Scrum master works with the customers and management to identify and instantiate a product owner. The Scrum master teaches the product owner how to do his or her job in order to optimize the value of the use of Scrum. If they don't, the Scrum master is held accountable. Then it's got another tip if we go deeper into this. It says per commercial development, the product owner may be the product manager. For in-house development efforts, the product owner could be the user department manager.\n\n(00:17:01):\nWhat's interesting is that that was the first version of the Scrum Guide, and I get into arguments about the Scrum Guide with people all the time. 2013's version though, the more updated one that you could go and find is the one that almost every company has run an agile transformation off of. It loses that thing that says the product manager could be the product owner. It doesn't say it anywhere in that guide. This was the first version, and you can kind of tell it was an aside. It's like, \"Oh, by the way, the product owner in Scrum doesn't need to be a product manager, it could be the customer, it could be a developer.\" It's usually the customer.\n\n(00:17:34):\nWhen they were writing this too, sometimes the customer was an internal person at a bank or somewhere where we were building software who was asking for the software. They were like, \"Go build me an internal tool. Go do this.\" Now we're just asking for requirements inside a company, and that's where you can start to see how the product owner role kind of evolved into somebody going to ask, \"Hey, what do you want me to build? What's required here?,\" and then just listening to somebody come back and say, \"I need this feature, I need this feature, I need this feature.\" Scrum doesn't describe how to get the stuff into the backlog, and it didn't in the 2013 manuals. The manuals have all been a little bit better, they've all kind of been updated since then, and they do describe it has to start with the vision a little bit more, you have to break down the vision for the product and get in there, but none of that existed in the early versions of Scrum.\n\n(00:18:29):\nWhen people got trained on how to be a product owner, what was happening here is, and this is the whole other world of Scrum over here, when people get trained to be a product owner, it's usually a two-day class where they teach them, \"Hey, this is how you break down a backlog. This is how you do stand-ups with your teams. This is how you think about prioritizing work. This is how you manage your backlog, prioritize it for the developers. This is how you work with the retrospectives,\" but it doesn't teach them about experimentation, it doesn't teach them about market research, it doesn't teach them about data, it doesn't teach them about any of the things that we need to be a product manager.\n\n(00:19:06):\nThen what happened was we went into these agile transformations at these companies and they said, \"Hey, let's adopt Scrum because Scrum was built as a way to build better products faster.\" It's literally the tagline. Everybody was like, \"Yeah, I want to build products faster. Okay, great. Let's do Scrum.\" All these large organizations back in the early 2010s, in the 2000s said, \"Oh, we got to be better at software. How do we do this better? Otherwise, we're going to lose when it comes to innovation.\" They adopted Scrum as a way to build software faster.\n\n(00:19:42):\nNow, what happened is in order to do Scrum, Scrum basically sells training. That's what Scrum does. All of these agile coaches would come in and teach the product owners, newly minted product owners, took all those people, made them into product owners, put them through a two-day class and then say, \"Go.\" That was the beginning of all the agile transformations, and that's where a lot of companies still are today. This product owner role did not emerge from product management as we know it today, it was a way to help the developers prioritize what to work on, but that was it. The product owner was held accountable for making sure that they were working on the most pressing things or the highest value things, they do say that, but to me, if you look at it from a developer perspective, it's also the person where you can say, \"Hey, well, you told me to build that, right? We didn't build it wrong. You told me to build that.\"\n\n(00:20:35):\nIt almost gets into consulting territory where you're like, \"Okay. If the product owner prioritized all this stuff for me and told me what to do, I can't be held accountable if it was the wrong thing to build.\" Some of that stuff does come up in a lot of teams that struggle to adopt agile, to adopt Scrum. I feel like there's a big misunderstanding out there about what is this role and what should we be doing, but the premise of this is when we talk about Scrum, it's just one piece of the puzzle, and when people talk about agile now, they almost always associate it with Scrum.\n\n(00:21:10):\nI was actually Googling agile methodologies, and like I said, the other ones, Kanbans is an agile methodology, XP is an agile methodology. They don't have product owners, they do not exist in those methodologies. There are four developers to work on things, or teams to work on things. XP would consider product managers in the teams as far as I know it, but Scrum kind of sees it as a separate thing.  Agile methodologies, everybody says, \"Oh, they're Scrum now,\" so it gets a bad connotation out there about what to do with it. I think Scrum if you do it well is bad, but you have to understand that it's just one piece of building great products, it's not the whole thing, and companies will adopt it like it's going to radically transform everything. To be fair, a lot of times it's sold that way too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:59):\nThere's a bigger picture question that's coming to mind as you talk about this. I'm imagining founders listening to this and smaller companies listening to this be like, \"Why do we need any of this?\", especially Silicon Valley startups, \"We're just going to build stuff. We don't need these frameworks, we don't need a Scrum master. We just have awesome developers and product managers and we're just going to build awesome stuff.\" I don't know anyone that has worked this way that has built amazing things. Can you talk a bit about who ends up looking for solutions here, where this even comes from, what companies need help here versus, \"I just don't need any of this?\"\n\nMelissa Perri (00:22:36):\nA lot of large companies turn to Scrum or to the frameworks, and it's because they traditionally didn't grow up building software. They're looking at how do I implement something that has rigor at scale, and that's where you see a lot of Scrum come up. Now, I've seen startups using Scrum. Some of them do it fine, they understand that it's just more about trying to get things out the door every two weeks to test it with customers. I think if you keep that philosophy, like I said, I used it and we didn't have a lot of rigor around it, that was fine. When we were doing Scrum, when I did it with my team back in OpenSky, we got to this point where we were like, \"Two weeks is too long. We're just going to ship things every week.\"\n\n(00:23:12):\nWe just talked to each other, we skipped stand-ups, which is sacrilege in Scrum, but we kipped daily stand-ups. We didn't need to stand around and talk about it, we talked to each other every day. For me, what was amazing and where I see teams actually thrive when they start using Scrum is when you go and talk to people. You're having the conversations about the work, you're breaking it down, you're understanding it, so the developers and the rest of the team can go hit the road running and people can ask important questions. If you're not doing that, that's where I think things like a framework help, but if you already are doing that, you don't need a framework, you don't need Scrum, you don't need to be prescribed to this two-week sprint or anything like that.\n\n(00:23:52):\nAs long as you have a methodology, it doesn't even have to be a defined methodology. As long as you have a way of working that gets things out to customers, well, who cares? Who actually cares? Where there's a lot of, I think, baggage in the industry and where I hear product managers get really frustrated and other people as well, developers too, is that when you do Scrum by the book or how people teach it and how they write about it, it's a million meetings. I know they were put in there so that people were forced to talk, but when you already know what you're supposed to work on, why do you need to keep doing meetings? Shouldn't you just go do some work?\n\n(00:24:28):\nA lot of developers complain, a lot of product managers complain that Scrum has too many meetings and they don't actually get to do work. That's where I think you have to go back to the inspect and adapt part. A lot of people who are very religious about Scrum will come and yell at me about this. They're like, \"Oh, well, that's not how it's supposed to be. You're supposed to inspect and adapt.\" Agree, but a lot of people aren't doing it and that's the piece where you go and you say, \"Is this serving us? If not, let's get rid of it. Let's not do those types of things.\" When you're a small startup, I don't think you need a lot of this overhead. It's really much designed for larger scale companies, and those are the ones that you see really adopting it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:06):\nFrom what I've seen on the data, it's also companies that are as you I think alluded to at the beginning, not necessarily software first, product first companies. Feels like it's very common in banks and telecom companies and companies that aren't product First and software first.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:25:21):\nThere are SaaS companies that do Scrum out there and they like it, and I don't think they're very dogmatic about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:27):\nGot it. Yeah.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:25:28):\nThey do it for a reason of just trying to provide some more context to their teams about how to work together at scale. I've also seen places where they don't prescribe whatever methodology you want to work with for the teams, but instead they'll spend a lot more effort breaking down the road maps, thinking about what are we going to do each quarter, trying to set those themes, and then they just let the teams run, and that works as well. I think it really depends how they adopt it, but I would say it's not a hard and fast rule that no startups are doing this. Some are doing it, I just don't know how it's going for them. To me, it might be overkill if you're doing that with a team that's pretty experienced in doing this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):\nWhat I was insinuating is less just Scrum as a general idea and more very structured rigid processes and also product owners. Then there's this whole concept of SAFe that we can talk about. Should we get into that or should we talk about product manager versus product owner and just the challenges people have there?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:26:33):\nLet's talk about SAFe because that's where a lot of this started to get Confusing\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:33):\nOkay, cool. Let's go there. Yeah.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:26:37):\nScaled Agile Framework came out of the desire to figure out how do we scale Scrum and different processes and bring it to organizations at scale. It originated from a more structured approach to agile too called Rational Unified Processing. Now, SAFe wasn't the first thing that started at scale. There was also LeSS, which is a Scaled Agile Framework, and then Jeff Sutherland who did Scrum has Scrum@Scale. It's not the only scaling framework out there. There's a lot, there's actually a lot out there, but SAFe was one that was marketed the best. The way it's marketed is will tell you everything you need to do, to do all of your agile teams with Scrum and put them all together.\n\n(00:27:22):\nThe idea behind SAFe was that Dean Leffingwell came up with it. He wanted to really show how you tie multiple teams together at scale in an organization and how do you bring some rigor and process to that. The executives at really large enterprises, we're talking tens of thousands of people, they love SAFe because it prescribes a lot of an operating model of what to do when it comes to development, but it also gets billed as like, \"Hey, this is the whole model for you to go do software.\" If you look at it, it's a big map that everybody kind of makes fun of a little bit, and it describes all different things on it if you look at the map. You can click in and you can see the definitions and you can see what's going on in the areas.\n\n(00:28:10):\nThe SAFe image has gotten bigger and bigger over time. I think, what is this? Version six. I do know a lot of people who worked on SAFe, so I know a lot of trainers and I've worked with companies. The first time I was introduced to SAFe was when I was working with a bank back in 2015. I came in to train their product managers, I'm doing my training, we're setting them up on how to go talk to customers, talk about hypotheses, MVP, and somebody came up to me and they said, \"Hey, Melissa, all of this is great, but I don't have time to go talk to customers because I'm a product owner.\" I was like, \"Well, what are you doing on a day-to-day basis? What don't you have time for it?\", \"I got to write my user stories.\" I'm like, \"Okay. How many user stories do you write per day?\"\n\n(00:28:53):\nThis was for the developers to have a full backlog so they could all work, right? She's like, \"Oh, yeah. I spend pretty much 40 hours a day writing user stories.\" I'm like, \"On what?\" We're like, \"What are you controlling?\" She's like, \"The login API for a bank.\" I'm like, \"Can you log in?\" She's like, \"Yeah,\" and I'm like, \"So what else are you working on? Is there a new initiative? Is there a new thing?\" It's like, \"No, I was reorganized into a team where I became the product owner. I have a product manager who goes and talks to customers, but then she comes and she tells me what to build, and then I write the user stories around it and I put it into the backlog for the teams.\" I was like, \"What is this?\" Then they said, \"That's SAFe. This is what we're working towards.\"\n\n(00:29:34):\nThis was my first experience with SAFe, and then I ran into another company that did it, another company, same thing over and over and over again, where all these product owners were just basically trying to keep these backlogs full for developers, and they were working on such a narrow level. When a lot of organizations too I saw it reorganized into agile teams, they did it by component. Everybody was over every tiny little feature, and these teams were massive, super huge scope, and some of the stuff was just not prioritized. It was done, you didn't need to work on it. They were finding work to do so people wouldn't get fired. That's how the product owners operated. There was all this legacy baggage sometimes in companies where they were all re-put on things by component, and they're just making up work to do.\n\n(00:30:21):\nSAFe introduced this kind of split between product manager and product owner, and if you look at the map, the product owner is part of the agile team where they sit with the Scrum masters, which is a team coach that they call here and the developers, and then the product manager is sitting with a system architect and what they call a release train engineer. What SAFe does is they pull a bunch of agile teams into a release train and you get on the train when you're ready to ship things and you make sure that it all goes pretty smoothly to get to that potential shippable increment or that big feature launch that you would be doing with SAFe. \n\n(00:30:58):\nSAFe's really good at prescribing how to do that, they're great at describing how to do the release trains, how to bring those teams together, how to put them on it. Then they do this thing called big room planning where they get the entire release train together, all these teams, they put them in a room and in every quarter you're breaking down what we're all going to work on. Where I hear frustration from teams every time I come in and train them is that when you do big room planning, a lot of times it's a commitment. You start at the quarter, they haven't been doing good discovery because remember, these people have not been trained on good discovery so they don't really know what they should be working on, they haven't been out talking to customers a lot of times. They kind of scramble, they figure out what needs to happen. Usually they have a backlog of stuff that does need to happen, it just has to get done. They map it all out in a big room together, they commit to it, and then that's the quarter.\n\n(00:31:47):\nThey ask me, \"When am I supposed to do discovery?\" I'm like, \"Well before that ideally you should have a vision. You should be breaking it down, you should be putting discovery into that vision, talking to customers, feeding that in there.\" Then I hear, \"We don't have time to do that because we sprint back to back.\" I was like, \"What does that mean?\", and they're like, \"As a team, we go and we basically do two-week sprint into two-week sprint into two-week sprint, and I got to make sure my developers are full. I got to make sure they have things to work on. If I go take time off to go talk to customers, which also is not my job as a product owner, it's my product manager's job, they'll feed me in what the customers are saying, then I break those down into features and I can work with the developers on it.\" That's how all of this stuff starts going.\n\n(00:32:32):\nWhat happens in organizations that they don't understand here is that it's not the most efficient way to work. I see a lot of developers out there become almost ... How do you describe it? Reliant on the product manager or product owner to tell them what to do. Even though you build them this great vision and you explain what needs to happen, they go, \"Oh, I can't work on it because the product owner hasn't prioritized it.\" Then they asked me, \"If I don't have enough for the developers to do on feature work, what are they supposed to do?\" I said, \"I guarantee you there's a ton of tech debt they could be working on. You don't have to scope that out. Let them choose what's the most important thing. They should be working together as developers and architects to figure out how to tackle some of that tech debt, how to get into it while you're figuring out is this the right thing to be building.\"\n\n(00:33:23):\nWith all of this stuff, people feel like they don't have time because they're in a million meetings, and the expectations of these companies is that every sprint, we're delivering software towards these roadmaps that we promised in the last quarter and we're not checking to see if they're right, we're not checking to see if they're actually helping us move it forward, and a lot of times the organizations are not set up with the right feedback mechanisms, the right user research and the right data to tell us if everything is working so they can feed that in to the next release planning. They're just planning, planning, planning, breaking it down into sprints and going.\n\n(00:33:58):\nSAFe is not good at describing how you do all that other work. In a lot of this stuff too, there's pieces that they put onto this map of SAFe where they're like, \"Hey, you should do OKRs,\" and it's like, \"This is what OKRs are. You should do a roadmap. This is what a roadmap is.\" How all of that cycle works together where you're balancing discovery and delivery and feeding it in is really confusing in organizations. Then what it's basically saying is a lot of the discovery work goes into the product managers, and the product managers, the product owners report into the product managers. What I've seen that doesn't work here is that you're basically making these product owners order-takers. They are extremely tactical, and then when it's time to actually be more strategic, let's say you want to be promoted to a product manager, some organizations, that's not even the same business line, not even the same career path. It's product owners go over here and product managers go here and they report into different people.\n\n(00:34:58):\nIf you ever want to move from product owner to product manager, a lot of times you don't get experience with the strategy, figuring out what customers want, breaking it down, looking at the market research, determining is this valuable, is this what we should be working on. They're not even getting exposure or a chance to do that because SAFe is like, \"No, that's the product manager's job. Your job is to go really deep and work with the developers.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:21):\nWow, okay. A lot of this sounds quite absurd as someone hearing all of the details and looking at this image. That being said, many companies are adopting this. It feels like it's growing. More and more companies are adopting this as the way to work. I imagine the incentive is we just want to build great software and we don't know exactly how, and there's this process we can plug in and it'll help us do it. I guess thoughts on that, and do you find it can work or often works or often doesn't work? What is your experience with people adopting this and how it goes?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:35:59):\nI know a ton of companies that adopted SAFe about eight years ago and have gotten rid of it. Capital One just came out and said they got rid of all their agile roles, all their Scrum roles. They were early adopter of SAFe, they don't do it anymore. They wrote about that in the newspaper. I've seen it happen more often. Now, in a lot of our organizations too I'll see parts of them do SAFe and other parts not do SAFe. It could change business line to business line. I don't think though that people grasp how much it's still out there. I get questions on SAFe every single day on the podcast. Everybody asks me, \"Why are we still doing this?\" It's for what you said, executives buy SAFe because it's the only framework out there that basically draws them a map and says, \"Plug and play, do this.\"\n\n(00:36:50):\nThat's why everybody's so excited about it because it's the only thing that specifies things to this level, and they went, \"Oh, it's something I can understand, it's something that actually has definitions around it.\" To be fair, that was a great thing for SAFe to do as a marketing tool. Bravo, they created this thing that everybody wants, a good product to sell, but it's overkill, and that's what I keep hearing from organizations is it's basically taking the responsibility away from leaders to go figure their stuff out themselves as well. If you are a new leader and you've just been dropped into this role, I have tremendous empathy for them because yeah, where do you get started? How do you try to run a technology organization?\n\n(00:37:33):\nSomebody came and told me, the CIO came and told me I'm in charge now. I'm in charge of all of the developers, or I'm in charge of all the product managers. Now, where do you start? I can totally tell why people adopt SAFe because you're like, \"Oh, I've been looking for the handbook. I've been looking for something to do here.\" The problem is it's only solving a little bit of the puzzle, which is bringing those teams together. People do say it does really strains well, but it doesn't tell you also how to do your job as a leader, it leaves it all out. They talk about portfolio visions and portfolio management and SAFe there too, but more often than not, I come in and I find everybody above product owners and product managers, let's talk about directors of product, VPs of product, they don't know what they should be doing as a VP of product or a director of product. It's like, \"What's my role? What should I be feeding in here?\"\n\n(00:38:23):\nSAFe doesn't even have that in there, that's not even a role. Product manager going up into those levels is not really there. What do you do when you own a whole product line in an organization? What you do when you're the head of product for a credit card at a bank, right? What's my job? Doesn't say that. There's a lot of people out there in these organizations that I've been working with who I'm like, \"You are supposed to be doing strategy, and this is how you do strategy. This is how you go out and talk to customers. This is the patterns that we have in software. Are you doing a platform strategy? Do you need APIs? How do you think about your app strategy, rolling it out? How do you do this here?\" All of that stuff doesn't quite come from ways of working, which is what SAFe is doing. It's about how do you do your jobs in those areas?\n\n(00:39:12):\nA lot of organizations who adopt SAFe don't realize that you need a head of product, you need somebody to actually be feeding that vision all the way down and make sure it's breaking up around the teams and controlling that portfolio vision and doing all of these things into it. I have not seen SAFe slowing down by any means out there for people adopting it, I see more and more organizations adopting it. I think we take for granted too in Silicon Valley how many people are just starting on their journey for digital transformation. There's a lot of pharmaceutical companies, banks, insurance companies, they outsource their development or they had an IT team, but they never had to really think about it before because digital wasn't as important. Now they do.\n\n(00:39:59):\nSome of these companies, most of these companies are Fortune 50 companies, right? Fortune 100 companies. I think a lot of the ones I see, at least banks, realized early on, \"Hey, when it comes to apps and how people interact with our stuff, software is important,\" but there's a lot of companies that did not catch that train and they're just starting, and then they turn to things like SAFe because it gives them a guideline. \"Hey, I've never done this before. I've been in this bank for 40 years. All I know is waterfall type development. What do we do?\" Then we'll go, \"We'll go look at SAFe.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:33):\nI love that we spend time on that because I think it's really important. You can be cynical about all this and be like, \"What the hell are people thinking? This is crazy,\" but as you described, people just have a problem to solve, they've never done this before, they look for solutions, they find something that seems right, they see other people doing this and like, \"Okay, let's try this thing.\" What you've seen is it rarely actually works out the SAFe specific approach.\n\n(00:40:59):\nThere's a few ways I think we can help folks. One is someone trying to do say an agile transformation or a digital transformation, your advice for how to actually do that better. Then I want to talk about say you're a product owner or a PM within an organization that works like this. What can you do? Maybe let's start with the first. Say someone's trying to figure out, \"We need to build better products. Something's not working right.\" SAFe is an option. Your suggestion is don't maybe do that. What should people do? I know you're not going to have the answer in a short answer, but generally, how should people approach this?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:41:33):\nYeah. When I've worked with companies on digital transformations, you want a development operating model. That's where a lot of these agile methodologies came out of. You have to understand that's just the development operating model, that's not actually going to help you with go-to-market, with launching your products and with product management. What I advise for companies to do is first sit down and say, \"Hey, how do we think about building our operating model?\" When I think of product operating models and what I do with companies is we break out how do you determine product strategy? Do you have a good product strategy? You look at your organizational design. How are we actually organized around our products? Do we have good coverage of product managers and do we have skilled product managers up and down the organization?\n\n(00:42:20):\nThen we want to look at product operations. Do we have the infrastructure in there to help support these teams? Can they get the data to make decisions? Can they actually be in touch with customers? A lot of these large organizations haven't actually thought through many of those steps as well that enable product managers and development teams to be successful. They don't have ways for them to go and talk to customers. That's why they're not doing it. I have a lot of empathy for people in these organizations as well who can't do product management well because of the bureaucracy or the things around it. Leaders need to solve that, right? They need to understand what the role is and they need to open it up.\n\n(00:42:57):\nThen we got to look at our culture and incentives. Are we just rewarding people for shipping as many things as possible, which is like, \"Hey, just put everything you possibly can into that release train or that backlog,\" or are we coming back and saying, \"Hey, is this valuable? Is this tying it back to our business?\" Many organizations do not have a great product strategy, many large organizations that I've worked with, and it's that tying it back to the value piece, tying it back to, is this going to reach our company goals? If you are a huge organization and let's say making billions of dollars a year, and your goal is expand geographically, what are you doing in your portfolio to actually enable that? What products are you building to expand geographically? So many organizations don't have the transparency to actually even see that.\n\n(00:43:50):\nOne crazy thing, a lot of people give large organizations a lot of flack for, and I know Marty does this too, for focusing on processes. I don't think processes are the enemy here. For example, if I hear somebody really worried about getting a roadmapping tool in there or something like that, I'm like, \"Yes, you need that because you have no idea what your 4,000 teams are doing.\" If they're actually coming back to the business goals, you have no infrastructure in there to be able to see that transparency. Those types of blocking tackling is absolutely necessary for a transformation for a organization to be stood up around software product management. You have to have the transparency to actually see those things.\n\n(00:44:29):\nYou do need to have enough process so that you as an organization can be efficient in getting things out the door, and that's what I think SAFe was trying to do, but it's not working because it's not solving the problems of the product management and it's not solving that problem of connecting the value back to the product teams. Instead, it's seen as a role that almost babysits developers or tells everybody what to do. Where's the discovery? Where do those things come in? I know with the SAFe image that we got over here, they try to drop things like Lean UX in there, which Jeff Gothelf thinks it's hilarious, but it's not really pulling it all together of how do we do this on a cadence? How do we help people go out there and actually talk to customers? How do we enable them to do it?\n\n(00:45:15):\nIf you're starting a transformation, it's not just thinking about how do we build the product, but you should also be thinking about how do we launch the product and how do we make sure this is the right product to do. That's the big pieces of it, and that's where all that product strategy comes in. You should also look at the career paths. This is what really bothers me about agile transformations and what bothers me with Scrum and SAFe is that when we organized in these large organizations into agile teams, we made all these new roles called a product owner, and so many organizations don't have a career path for them so they email me and they go, \"What's my career path? What do I do next? Where am I supposed to go?\"\n\n(00:45:59):\nI've been saying for 10 years, this is not a team role, it's not just a team role, it's a business role and it rolls all the way up to helping you further your business. You have to make sure that people on teams can be promoted to running multiple teams, can be promoted to running an entire product line. To us, that's so simple in Silicon Valley native software companies, but it's still unheard of in other organizations. What happens too, and this is where I think leadership and C-suite needs to really pay attention, because we're transforming in this way of working, what happens is some of the roles that we had before do not serve us now. Maybe we don't need a million project managers, maybe people in the business who decided what we're going to build, are they the right people to bring with us on this next phase into product management? Can they learn? Can they grok software? Do they understand those pieces? That's what we have to ask.\n\n(00:46:58):\nOrganizations are so afraid sometimes to put these career ladders in because it kind of overhauls their traditional ways of working, and then they've got people who've been in these organizations for 40 years and now you're saying, \"Hey, you're actually not in charge of that, the product manager is in charge of that,\" and that's scary. A lot of them get in the way because of that. If you really want to transform though, the C-suite has to be like, \"Hey, we're going in this direction,\" and just put it down because I've seen it run by a lot of middle managers, a transformation run by tons of middle managers, and those are the jobs that are usually in most jeopardy when you start transforming and you have to re-skill and you have to figure out what to do, and they don't want to do that. They're not going to be the ones who jump up and down and say, \"Hey, let's do this.\"\n\n(00:47:41):\nThere's a lot of people out there, I think, pushing organizations to try harder and to internally as well. I've worked with a lot of people who run these transformations who just really want it to work, and I think they do it with the best of intentions, but the C-suite has to understand this is not just a transformation project, this is a whole new way of working, and if we want a whole new way of working, we have to really rise to that occasion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda.

One is, just to clarify, you recommend not using SAFe, you don't think that's a good approach?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:49:21):\nI do not recommend using SAFe. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:24):\nGreat.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:49:25):\nThere are people who like SAFe. Let me just say this, there are people who found success with SAFe. Every single person I have talked to who like SAFe found success with SAFe, they ended up ripping it up and making it into something else. It's not actually SAFe by the book. If you do that, fine, that's any process. If you ended up adopting SAFe and you want to go back and look at it and say, \"Actually let's just get rid of all the stuff that's not working and keep the stuff that is,\" fine, but being open to understanding this is not the way that we do good product management. There's not a lot in SAFe about doing good product management. That's the stuff that we have to understand. It could help in certain areas, and I do think it does help in certain areas, bring some rigor to things, but if you take it too far, it will destroy things.\n\n(00:50:17):\nThere's actually a great story about a water company in the Netherlands and they decided to adopt SAFe, and this was on the news a couple months ago. They decided to adopt SAFe in their IT teams and start working with it. They ended up going bankrupt, and the reason they ended up going bankrupt is because the teams were learning the processes for SAFe, they were taking so long to deploy their new invoicing system and payment collections that they couldn't collect payments from customers because they got so caught up in the process.\n\n(00:50:53):\nThat's what I see happen a lot in these organizations. Instead of talking about what's really important, which is, \"Hey, how are we serving our customers? How are we winning in this market? How do we stem churn? How do we do all these things?\", we're talking instead about, \"What stand-ups are we doing? Oh, how do we do this release planning? Oh, my God, you guys didn't sprint back to back, you did it wrong.\" We're talking about work about work, but we're not actually getting into what are we achieving here, and that's the part I do not like about rigid processes when it comes to this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:28):\nThat touches on the other theme I wanted to bring up is it feels like the stuff is a kind of replacement for skilled, talented people, a product leader that understands how to do these things and has product taste and has organized teams to build great product. It feels like people are just, \"We don't have that so we're going to create this. This process is going to fix all our problems.\" Can you talk about just the importance of that, the people you hire to run these things as key to this, if that's true?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:52:00):\nIn a lot of organizations, the people who buy SAFe, they have not run large scale technology organizations before, or they're new to this way of working so they adopt SAFe and they hope it works because it looks like a nice plan, like we said, to go out and do things. When you're doing a transformation, a lot of companies are pulling people into these roles for the first time. I've said since day one that I've been working with companies, it's okay and I think it's noble to want to train people and put them in different roles. Cool. If you're going to spend money upskilling your people, do that, but you also have to intersperse people who know what they're doing. I think at leadership it's really important to bring in somebody who knows what they're doing to help run this type of thing.\n\n(00:52:44):\nThere are more people out there and more leaders who have done this before because we've been doing this for 10 years. There's Shruti Patel, she's chief product officer at US Bank for small business banking. I just had her on the podcast. She worked at Shopify, she saw how great teams worked, and then she was able to come and help apply that at a bank. She's experienced, right? She's an experienced product person who comes in to help. Melissa Douros is the CPO of Green Dot Bank and she had worked at Discover Financial leading the transformation there, did all that work, and then could bring it to Green Dot Bank. She can see what needs to happen, what needs to actually go on here.\n\n(00:53:23):\nWe've got more and more people out there who have done this before who are looking for these opportunities to do it in the bank, and I think it's important for C-suite to bring them in to actually look at that. Where I've seen transformations be the most successful in all these organizations is when you do that mix, you keep some of your people, but you also bring people in to learn. I get hired all the time to come in and train. I've worked with almost every Fortune 50 company at this point, fortune 100 company too, and I get in, I come in to train a lot of product managers. We do it through Product Institute and we'll train everybody. What used to happen about eight years ago is they train everybody and they would say, \"Go.\" Where do you go after you bring in the consultants to do training to keep learning? How do they watch other people in the organization do great product management if there's nobody in the organization who's done it before?\n\n(00:54:20):\nLuckily I think a lot of organizations are realizing that, so more leaders are out there who are saying, \"Hey, I've got to actually intersperse skills here. I need to bring in some more directors who are experienced here, some more individual contributors who are experienced here.\" Those organizations I think are wildly successful because they recognize it and they say, \"I've got to make sure that people can learn from others.\" That's how you keep developing, that's how we all keep developing, it's not just doing all external classes. That's where I think these things become powerful. You could do that at all levels. You don't have to just do it with the teams, you could do it at director level, you could do it at VP level. That's how we should be thinking about this.\n\n(00:54:57):\nNow, there are some CPOs out there and some VPs of product in these large organizations who are new to this way of working, but they've committed themselves to learning and to trying to figure out how to do it best. They're not saying, \"Hey, I'm just going to adopt SAFe or I'm just going to do whatever is over here,\" they're actually saying, \"What don't I know?\" I'm watching them go out to talk to other CPOs, do all these other things. They usually have great market knowledge, great business knowledge, and they're fantastic at strategy, and then they hire people underneath them who are great at the other pieces like the execution and getting the software at the door. I think those people are successful in it as well because they notice their skill gaps and they hire for it just like any great leader would.\n\n(00:55:41):\nIn these organizations, I do see sometimes SAFe for something being a crutch for people who don't know what they're doing to bring in. If you really think about, \"Hey, how do I make this better?\", and have that continuous learning mindset and that way to want to propel this forward, I think you'll consider other options and start to think about broader than just SAFe, broader than just agile, what do we need to make this successful?\n\n(00:56:07):\nThe key part of this too is recognizing that product management is not just this role in Scrum. I say this in my talk too, I say Take Scrum away. You still need product management, right? Product owner doesn't exist without Scrum, that's not a thing, but you still need product managers and that's why all product owners should be product managers, they should be fundamentally product managers. That's why I do not like these career trajectories that keep them separate. Sure, if you want to have a principal IC product manager like they do in a lot of large Silicon Valley companies, perfect, let people keep working on those things. They don't have to go into management, but that doesn't mean they're different. Between an IC product owner and an IC product manager, it shouldn't be different there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:55):\nPerfect segue to where I wanted to go next, which is say you are a product owner today listening to this and you're like, \"Man, this is exactly my life. What can I do?\", what's your advice to folks in that role right now about how to potentially become product managers, build the skills they need to not just be stuck in this career path that doesn't go anywhere?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:14):\nYeah. I think the first thing is bringing awareness to that your role is more than just working with the developers. A lot of leaders argue with me that we need product owners because it just doesn't scale. You've seen massive companies at scale where they don't have any product owners. I do not understand that. It's a weak argument to me, it's a very weak argument. It just means you don't know how to distribute the work evenly and give a little bit of strategic guidance to product owners so that they can gon, or product managers, on a team so that they can go and build visions and cut down features and stuff like that. If you're a product owner and you're like, \"Hey, I don't have the opportunity to talk to customers, my product manager does that. I am just working with the teams. I want to be more strategic, I want to think longer term,\" I'd say try to take some ownership over that and push back on the things that are being given to you.\n\n(00:58:04):\nI was doing a workshop for Mind the Product back in the day, and I had a product owner in my workshop and she said, \"I don't think that things we're working on,\" they were doing SAFe, \"are the right things to work on.\" I said, \"You should bring this to your manager,\" and she was like, \"I don't know. I'm going to get fired. I don't think it's the right thing. What am I going to work on if we're not going to work on this?\" I'm like, \"Well, this is the beauty of product instead of project, we stay with the product.\" Just because your project ends doesn't mean that you lose a job. She put together this whole thing, went and said, \"I don't think we should be working on this,\" and they promoted her. They were like, \"Fantastic.\" She took this leap of faith and went out there and started saying, \"This is more. We need to do more.\"\n\n(00:58:44):\nI think if you're a product owner and there's no career path for you, start asking leaders what your career path is because it's going to make them go, \"Oh, great question. What should the career path be?\" There's a lot of literature out there about how we make career paths, so you can start there. Ask what's next for you after this product owner role. I would ask the product managers if they're doing all the customer research, see if you can do some customer research with them. Go sit in on this. A lot of them will say, \"I don't have time. I don't have time to do this.\" Strip back all the user stories you're working on, stop thinking about it as a quantitative metric that needs to just go up and up. Instead, really think about the value you're delivering with your team. Is this the right thing?\n\n(00:59:24):\nWhen you talk to leaders and when you present your case, you say it in a way of, \"Hey, I'm working on X, Y, and Z feature. What's the goal here? When we release this, what do we hope will happen?\" I think that's one of the best questions anybody can ask if they're worried their company is not focused on outcomes. What do we hope will happen when we release this? What metrics are we going to change? How do we instrument it to make sure that's true? Then we can go back and actually see if it changed. One simple question to get alignment on it, and then you can start to say, \"Oh, that didn't work or this did work.\" Great. Why did it work? You can open up those conversations.\n\n(01:00:00):\nI'd say there's a lot of things you can do to help move your companies forward, and I have seen in a lot of these organizations too, a groundswell of product owners and product managers saying, \"Hey, what's next for me? What's going on?\" That makes the organizations go and figure it out. I was working with one Fortune 10 company not too long ago, their C-suite, I've been working with them for a very long time and they're finally like, \"Hey, we're going to codify the product manager role and we're going to have it all the way up and down our organization, we're going to make roles, we're going to make responsibilities.\" To me, that was music to my ears, but the reason they were doing it too is because they noticed there was a lot of churn in the organization in that role, and they also realized it's a critical role.\n\n(01:00:44):\nThey're losing good people because people from the outside are coming because they want to work for this great big organization that's doing super well, fantastic, but they get in there and they go, \"Where's my career path? What am I supposed to do? Where am I supposed to go?\" A lot of leaders are out there now realizing, \"Hey, we do have to get our stuff together,\" and the only reason they're coming to this conclusion as well is because they're looking around seeing other people doing it and they hear it from the teams, they hear it from the product managers. I don't want people to think, \"Hey, I have no power. I'm in a 10,000 person organization.\" The more you bring this up, the more your leaders will respect it because they don't want to lose you, they don't want to lose good people. If you want to be great at your job and you need more support there, speak up, speak up.\n\n(01:01:31):\nAt a certain point, I do tell people this. If you feel like you can't do great product management in your organization, try to find another organization. I know that is hard to say and I respect people are tied to insurances and it's hard to change jobs, but if you do have the opportunity to look for another organization that does it well, I would go there. I would also say in large corporations too, I've seen certain business lines and certain divisions do it super well and then others not. If you are in a large corporation, maybe think about moving internally, laterally to a different team and seeing if you can work there. I'd find the leaders who know what they're doing and go work for that. That's usually the best move here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:11):\nThe point you made about how a lot of companies don't have any product owners and have scaled very wide, just to reinforce that in the data dive that we did on job market trends, no tech company has a product owner basically, no top tech company. I know there's an important distinction here. These are tech, software first, product first businesses where their business is the software they're building, and a lot of the companies we're talking about here are not that. They're banks and telecoms, pharmaceutical companies. I get that it's a very different world, but I think it's important to highlight, \"You can become very big.\" Google has no product owners as far as I know, Amazon, Microsoft, Netflix, no company you've heard of that's a tech company has a product owner. They're all product managers, they're all product managers.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:02:56):\nYeah. I don't want people to think that there aren't people who build great software in these large corporations too because there are. There's pockets of people who are doing it super, super well. If you are one of those people who's been pushing the boundaries, doing great work, and your title is a product owner, what I always tell people on your resume, if you're looking for your next job so that you're not pushed out, let's say, of these large corporations like a Google or somewhere like that, and that's where you want to work in a tech firm, make sure you describe how you did your job from a value perspective. Do not talk about your agile cadences. Get Scrum out of there. Talk about what value you brought to the users and what metrics you moved, and that's how your resume should be laid out.\n\n(01:03:40):\nI do read tons of resumes to hire people, and also chief product officer, same thing. If I see immediately implemented Scrum processes across the organization, I'm like, \"No, that's not what I need. That's not what I was looking for.\" I was looking for what are you going to do to push the strategy in that part of the organization? What are you going to do to actually build better products for customers? Then when you get into the interview, you can talk about what things you did to do that, but you want to make sure that you're focused on really understanding the customer and translating that into great products, and the outcomes that we were looking for when you do it on your resume, I think that's important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:15):\nOkay. I want to spend more time here because this is so important. This is highlighting here's the difference between a product owner and a product manager. If you want to move into product management and become a great PM, if you're a product owner today, even if you're not a product owner and just want to get into product management, can you again just highlight here's the big difference and here's the skills that people value most in a PM versus a product owner.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:04:38):\nYeah. When I see product owners write out their resumes or describe their job functions, they always approach it from a process standpoint. I prioritize the backlog, I worked with the developers to break down the work, I checked the developer's work and did the acceptance criteria, I wrote the user stories, all those functions is what I see over and over and over again in product owner resume. What you want to do instead is say, \"I led the,\" we can even do the login API,\"I led the work around the login API. The problem that I was solving around it was trying to enhance security for our login protocols to meet regulatory requirements. I interviewed a bunch of users, I got up to speed on the regulatory requirements, I worked really closely with our legal teams and our compliance teams to translate that into something that was going to secure our bank, and when we launched, we were able to meet our compliance, save our bank a couple million dollars, and we smoothly transitioned into these new security requirements without disrupting any service for customers for four million customers.\"\n\n(01:05:40):\nWay different story than I prioritized backlog and I shipped it off to developers. Take it a step further. If you're working on customer-facing things, who are your customers? Did you go out and talk to them? By interfacing with customers and understanding them, I was able to solve XY, and Z problem with them, which resulted in a measurable amount of XY and Z metric going up for the business. I ran this function, I ran this feature, I launched this feature, I watched it through, I iterated on it, I did the stuff that was needed to make this successful. That's what I want to see on a resume.\n\n(01:06:15):\nEven if you have a product owner title, I'll still read the details and everybody else will too, but I will say there's sometimes a poor connotation when you have that title unfortunately because of the baggage that's associated with agile. Even just on resumes, I would say do product owner/product manager in there just to let people know that I know how to do this and I've been doing this well. If you do that in your bullet points, that shows up as well. There's also this whole concept that we didn't even get into about certifications. People keep asking me if I want to transition into product management, should I get a certification, an agile certification?\" I feel like these were bigger a couple years ago, but they're still big. If you ever see somebody with a CSPO on the end of their profile, which you probably have seen on LinkedIn, it's a certified Scrum product owner.\n\n(01:07:05):\nNow, one thing to remember, and this is about all agile stuff, is we call it the agile industrial complex, agile coaches and agile trainers, the whole Scrum team, scrum.org, Scrum Inc, SAFe, everybody, the way they make their money is through consulting to teach you these processes and by having people be trained to get these certifications. They come in and they say, \"All your people need to be certified Scrum product owners. Give me 2,500 bucks per person,\" and then they get a certificate at the end of a two-day class that says they're a certified Scrum product owner. It doesn't necessarily mean they could do the job, it doesn't necessarily mean they could do product management, but let's think about when we're talking about too should we adopt SAFe in general, should we adopt these things, think about how these organizations make money.\n\n(01:07:56):\nThey're selling certifications. Of course they want more and more people to adopt it. That's the idea here. They're selling you this dream that you just certify all your people and then you could be working on it. They take all these people, they put them in two-day classes or whatever, and they turn them out and then they say, \"Go, you're a completely new role.\" It doesn't work that way. That's not in the best interest of your company, that's not really what we're looking for here, and that's why all of this stuff needs to go deeper. If you've done a CSPO class and you have that certification, it may help you get hired at another large enterprise that is adopting Scrum and SAFe. That will probably help you there.\n\n(01:08:36):\nIf you want to transition into tech and go into the companies that we talk about, they're probably going to look at that and say, \"This person doesn't know what they're doing. This is not here.\" If you do know what you're doing and you did that for a reason, because some people need that to get promoted, some companies actually require it, which is crazy, but to get promoted or be that thing, I have tremendous sympathy for that, but you're going to have to do a lot of work explaining in your resumes and stuff as you transition that you know more than that. You're not just a CSPO with a two-day class, you have done the work. That's where all of this building up on your resume becomes really, really important. It's not just about getting certified.\n\n(01:09:14):\nI had people ask me, they're like, \"Can you just certify product managers?\" I'm like, \"No. If people take my course, I give them a certificate of completion and as a completion.\" You finished a course just like any other course, but I will not certify product managers because I do not think you can ever say somebody is prepared and able to do their job from a short class. Now, there are some agile agencies that do a lot more training where you have different levels, and what they would do is they would train people, but then they would make them go do work and they had a coach that they worked with, and they go back and forth and they could demonstrate that they could do the work over time to get to the next level.\n\n(01:09:56):\nIt's almost like the PMP, the project management certification where you have to have time actually doing the job. That's different, that's a different type of skill, it's a different type of certification, but if you see any CSPOs, it's typically a two-day workshop that they went to and then got certified. That's the difference with this. I would say be careful if you are a product owner wanting to be a product manager of just certifications. All the large tech organizations I know too, they're not looking for certifications in product management or product ownership to hire people, they're looking for experience, but the organizations that might not know what they're doing, they are looking for CSPOs, they are looking for that.\n\n(01:10:37):\nIf it's required by your organization, you might have to ask, \"Are we all well set up here to do our best job? Is this the place where I'm going to learn how to be a better product manager?\" I also feel bad though for people because it's hard to be a product manager, it's hard to get your foot in the door. I'm so torn on it because there are organizations that hire people with a CSPO and they require it, so of course if it gets your foot in the door and it helps you do it, but if it's not going to help you and it's not going to put you on the career path you want, I don't think it's worth money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:14):\nI think one interesting thread throughout this whole conversation is rarely is a plug-in play-ish easy solution going to be the answer to your problem, whether it's plugging in SAFe and it's going to help us build great software, taking a class helping you become a great product manager, be skeptical of that.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:31):\nYeah. There's no quick way to doing any of this, there's no fast track. You don't get to skip over all the hard things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:39):\nYeah. Bummer.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:41):\nYeah. I wish.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:43):\nYeah. One question I wanted to clarify. When you come into an org and they have product owners, do you encourage them to get rid of product owner as a title and role and make them product managers or do you keep product owners?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:53):\nI say that we should have a hierarchy. You would have all product managers on a team, they would be an IC, individual contributor, so they're either an associate product manager and that's if they don't have all the discovery experience or maybe they know basic Scrum, totally fine, you can be an associate product manager, but if they don't know how to talk to customers, digest what the customers are saying and turn that into a feature direction and a backlog and this is how we're going to work, all that stuff needs to be in there. If they don't know how they should be measuring things, you're not quite a product manager yet.\n\n(01:12:28):\nAssociate product manager, and then product manager, and then a senior PM. A senior PM can work on a Scrum team as well or a development team. I do encourage them, I say, \"Get rid of these two different titles because it's confusing everybody.\" I help a lot of people with career paths too. I've seen companies with 47 different titles for product managers because somebody in this organization is called a product associate and somebody over here is a product manager and that person is a platform product manager, and that person is a platform product owner, and this person is an API product owner. You can have product manager, senior product manager, all that stuff, but I would not confuse people with the two different titles of product owner versus product manager.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):\nBut importantly, there's a bar for who is called a product manager because if you take a product owner as you've said, and say you're a product manager, they're going to be a terrible product manager. Your advice is make them an associate PM, and then once they reach a certain level, they've graduated to product manager.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:13:28):\nIt depends. I don't say this as a hard and fast rule because there are product owners out there who've been doing their job very well. Just because they have a title of a product owner doesn't mean that somebody can't do the job of a product manager. There are plenty of people out there who were just named this because a company names them that and they know what they're doing, so don't look at that hard and fast. When we do this, we typically will say everybody's got product owner on their title, change it to product manager, but we will go back and look at what is the actual skillset.\n\n(01:13:56):\nWhen I've come in to work with companies on transformations, what we typically do, the way I get introduced usually is we come in and they're looking for some kind of training for all of their product teams, and then we bring in Product Institute and we do our online training, Then afterwards I work with the organization, I say, \"Now that everybody's been baselined and trained, we have to figure out who is going to be a great product manager and who's not,\" so there's an awareness. You know what's interesting? Once people figure out what the job's about, a lot of them opt out.\n\n(01:14:24):\nWhen I did the transformation at Athenahealth, we had 365 product managers and they all had different titles too, product innovation, all over the place. We turned them into product managers, we trained everybody, we gave everybody the opportunity to learn, which I think is great, and then we gave them opportunity to practice their skills. What happened is at the end of the training, a lot of people raised their hand and said, \"Oh, no, no, this is not what I wanted to do. I thought it was very different. I did not realize how much people work it was. I have to go influence these people, I have to do all this stuff. This is actually not really what I wanted to do.\"\n\n(01:14:59):\nWe found other roles for them that were what they wanted to do or they decided to leave. That was up to them, we didn't cut anybody, but we moved some people into operations because they wanted to be a little more heads down to find process. That was their thing. We moved people into data roles who were good with SQL and were good with data analysis. We moved people into user research roles because they wanted to talk to customers, but they didn't want the responsibility and the accountability that came with the product management piece because they realized it was so intense.\n\n(01:15:29):\nI've seen this happen a lot in large organizations. You baseline everybody, you show them what the role is and then you let them go practice it, and then at that point some people will opt out and then you have to go back through your people and say, \"Okay. How do we level-set now? Who's doing really well? Who's not doing so well? Which teams need to have more experienced people on it because they don't have anybody to learn from?\" That's where we would say, \"Hey, let's hire some ICs over here or a director of product management who can help train these people and help them keep growing.\" That's been super successful. I've seen people bring in some more directors, scattered them around, and they've leveled up these product owners who were not necessarily doing great product management and now they're doing fantastic.\n\n(01:16:13):\nI've watched fantastic leaders in these organizations that are not software native or doing these transformations. Bringing the right person, you can make amazing product managers. Give them a year or two and completely turn it around. It's totally possible. It's totally possible to take people and train them, and I firmly believe in that, but you got to get them exposure to what good looks like. If you are in an organization and you cannot see what good looks like anywhere, that's a red flag. That's where leaders need to look at their organization and say, \"Do I have people with these skills interspersed around so that everybody can start to learn, so that everybody can actually be on the uptake of this and make sure that we are well-balanced?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:56):\nThat was an awesome nuance and addition. I'm just looking back at all the things we've talked about. We've covered so much ground, the history of agile and Scrum and SAFes and product owners, we've gotten into all kinds of advice on how to do this better as a company leader, as a product owner, as someone thinking about even moving through product management. Is there anything else that we have not covered that you think might be helpful to touch on or wrap up on?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:17:25):\nI think I would tell people to remember that when you look at agile methodologies, and if you look at it with small agile, what we are really saying there is we want to be able to move quickly and deliver great value to customers. If you embrace those principles, you're going to do well, but if you think of agile as just a defined super cut and dry process where you have to follow every single little step here and there, that's not going to serve you because you're not getting back into why are we doing this.\n\n(01:17:54):\nThere are some great agile coaches out there. There are first principle approaches to doing great product work and doing great development work. They're there because they are not just selling Scrum, they are there to make people better. Those agile coaches I think can make great fantastic teams, and I've worked with a lot of them, and I think they are really there to just make it a better environment for the people who are working and to help the company produce better products. That's their whole goal.\n\n(01:18:21):\nThen there are people too who are wedded to this is SAFe and you will do it by the book. This is Scrum, you will do it by the book. I'd be very skeptical of that because what's the end goal? What's their end goal? Like I said, a lot of people out there get paid by certifying people and by consulting on these processes. McKinsey made a huge division to do this, and a lot of SAFe was actually introduced to organizations from McKinsey and from large organizations, consulting organizations like that. They came in and they said, \"Yeah, this is what you do. I'll teach you how to do SAFe, I'll teach you how to do Scrum.\" They have been building those consulting agencies off of agile transformations.\n\n(01:19:03):\nWe always laugh when I talk to other people who've been doing transformations and coaches. I go, \"Why is McKinsey always coming in here and doing this?\" I've followed them into so many organizations and I've been like, \"Oh, wow, they screwed this up. Let me go fix it.\" There's always a saying that nobody gets fired for hiring McKinsey. McKinsey's big, people trust their name. A lot of the people at McKinsey haven't done this before, they've never been inside the organization trying to transform it and stay there for a long time. That's why I'd be really skeptical of who's selling that.\n\n(01:19:37):\nIf you approach agile from a perspective of I want to be agile because I want to release things quickly and get feedback from customers and make sure that that's great, look at all of your processes like that and say, \"Is that serving the best interest of our company and our culture and our customers? Is this making our customers proud of us? Is this helping our customers receive good value?\" If your processes aren't, fix them, change them, inspect and adapt, ease a lowercase agile principle. We should be looking at every process we do and saying, \"Is it working?\", and not be afraid to change it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):\nI think it's important to highlight this can work. There are ways to reorganize the way you build product at a very large company where you can actually deliver great product consistently. You've seen that happen a lot. Anything you want to add there to give people hope?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:20:30):\nYeah. The biggest pushback I hear from large organizations, especially ones that are not software native as banks or insurance companies, whatever it is, is that we're not like Google, we're not like SaaS companies. It's true, you're not a SaaS company. The way that you do it is going to be slightly different than the way that Amazon runs or the way that Google runs. I don't see many companies actually run the same, and just because it works at Google doesn't mean it's going to work at an insurance company that's a hundred years old. That's okay, but you could still learn from people who've been producing software at scale for many, many years. You can still learn what makes them successful, and then you could take some of those principles and apply them to your organization and then figure out where we need to adapt. That's what I would look at.\n\n(01:21:21):\nI see software strategies and digital strategies becoming so intertwined into the strategies of companies in general, whether you're an insurance company or a bank or anything. They're becoming so heavily entwined in the C-suite strategies. The first thing I would say, and where I see a lot of companies struggle with this is you have to make sure that it is thought of at the C-suite. What some organizations do is go, \"Oh, no, that's IT work. Let me push all the software strategy down.\" If you're doing that, you're missing out on innovation, and this is where the product role comes in and where I think more organizations need chief product officers because they're the person in the C-suite saying, \"How can software enable us to be 10 times better and crush our competition, whether we're a bank or insurance company or a pharmaceutical company? What can we do with our software that's going to put us ahead of the competition, that's going to put us ahead of the market?\"\n\n(01:22:16):\nIf you're not having those conversations when you're thinking of your long-term company strategy, you're behind, you're behind because that is what every small high-growth startup is doing that's coming out to try to disrupt these big companies. The big companies are successful, they have a lot of money so they don't have as much urgency as sometimes these smaller companies do to change or somebody who's failing to change. That's why things are going so slow, but at the same time, if we don't pay attention to that and we're not considering it, that's where the danger comes in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:46):\nI imagine people are going to have a lot of questions and hope to get even more advice. A couple of final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to ask more questions along these lines, maybe get your help on some of this stuff? Then finally, how can listeners be useful to you, Melissa.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:23:02):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn. If you go search for Melissa Perri with an I, P-E-R-R-I, you'll find me there. My LinkedIn is /melissajeanPerri. I'm happy to connect with people there. My school is called Product Institute, so if you're interested in doing product management training or getting help with some of this stuff, go to productinstitute.com and reach out to me. I run a podcast too called The Product Thinking Podcast. We answer questions every week, and a lot of them are around SAFe, agile and all these topics, so if you have a question and you're saying, \"Hey, how do I do this?\", definitely reach out and let me know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nAwesome. Melissa, I learned a lot. I feel like a lot of people who listen to this podcast, they're like, \"I had no idea about any of this, and now I understand all these terms that I kind of hear occasionally.\" Thank you for coming and sharing all of this with us, especially the advice for folks that are in this world right now.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:23:49):\nYeah. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:51):\nBye everyone.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:23:52):\nBye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:55):\nThank you so much for listening.

This is a rare two-guest episode. Melissa and Denise are authors of an awesome new book called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. Melissa is a legend in the product management community. She's the author of the foundational handbook, Escaping the Build Trap. She runs a product management training organization called Produx Labs, teaches product management at Harvard, and has worked with hundreds of companies on their product management function. Denise is a product leader, coach, and consultant helping companies with their product vision, strategy, and execution, and works with Melissa at Produx Labs. \n\n(00:01:02):\nIn our conversation, we get super deep into the emerging role of product ops. As you'll hear in our conversation, over the past few years, this role has gone from almost non-existent to something like half of scaling tech companies with at least one product ops person. This new role is probably the thing that's most changing in the role of product management. After this conversation, I'm convinced it's a great thing. \n\n(00:01:24):\nWe chat about what the role concretely is, how it differs from product management and project management, what to look for in your first product ops hire, how to roll out a product ops function, why product managers shouldn't be afraid of this role and how your life gets significantly better, plus, a case study on how they rolled out product ops function at a large company, and so much more. With that, I bring you Melissa Perri and Denise Tilles after a short word from our sponsor.\n\n(00:01:50):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:03:17):\nThank you. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:18):\nThanks for having us.\n\nLenny (00:03:19):\nYou are the second ever guest duo I've had on the podcast. Melissa, this is your second appearance on the podcast, and you two have a new book out, which I have right here. It's called Product Operations: How Successful Companies Build Better Products at Scale. What I want to do with our time today is to help people fully understand the role of product operations from every direction as much as we can get through in an hour. How does that sound?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:44):\nSounds great. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:03:44):\nGreat.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:03:45):\nLet's do it. \n\nLenny (00:03:45):\nAwesome. So first question, just to set a little context on this role, how popular and how common is the role at this point? I did a quick skim of just awesome companies and really successful companies, and every single one of them seems to have a product ops role at this point. OpenAI, Uber, Stripe, Ramp, Deal, those are just the few that I looked at. Is that what you're seeing? How should people think about how popular and how common this role has become?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:04:12):\nI think over the last few years, we definitely have seen product operations start booming. It did originate in a lot of big companies that you mentioned too like Uber. The head of product operations at Uber and the person who started it, Blake Samic, is a case study in our book and he also did it at Stripe and he does it at OpenAI. So it's pretty funny that you mentioned those three because that's Blake right there who did that. We have seen a very good transition from people whispering about product operations, and I know when I wrote my first book, Escaping the Build Trap, in 2018 I mentioned it in there because we had just started doing it at Athenahealth. \n\n(00:04:49):\nI saw this as a really big issue in trying to make a complete product management function there and especially at scale. We had 365 product teams. We were trying to figure out how does this all come together, and product operations for me was a key part of it. So when I had first written it into that book, a lot of people were like, \"Oh, what is this thing? I think we need it. Do we need more?\" and that's what got us to start writing this book. Since then, I've seen a lot more companies coming out and either making more mature product operations teams that started probably before that or actually introducing them now.\n\nLenny (00:05:21):\nI guess maybe thinking about just tech companies, if you had to put a number on some rough percentage of interesting fast-growing, hyper growth, these startups, is there a percentage you'd put on how many of them have a product ops person at this point?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:05:34):\nWe don't have a hard and fast number, I'll say that on this, but we have seen that. Let's take a sampling of maybe something that I know better. When I teach CPO accelerator, when I teach people in these cohorts, out of the 20, 25 people that we'll have in a cohort, I'd say at least half of them have somebody doing something product ops related. It might not be a mature function, it might just be one person on it, but at least half of them have somebody doing something.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:06:06):\nThat's a good yardstick because I teach a product operations masterclass for Produx Labs with Melissa, and it's been interesting. I do some pre-work and try to understand where folks are in the products journey. When we started offering this class in 2020, about 60% were products curious. As time has gone on, it's really gone down and people have started to add it. They just want to understand what's the best way to optimize it. So I would say it's gone from that level to, say, probably 60% of them do have it now and then want to understand how to optimize it.\n\nLenny (00:06:41):\nDo you have a sense of when this started to inflect and become such a common thing? When I was a product manager, I had no product ops person. So it's really fascinating to me to learn about this emergence. I know there's probably not a date, but just it sounds like maybe after your last book was published. Is there a timeframe of this became a thing? Is it this guy you mentioned that's now at OpenAI that started spreading it? \n\nMelissa Perri (00:07:01):\nBlake, I think, was one of the people at the beginning who was talking about it the most and he's done a lot of work, I think, to push product operations and tell people about it. So that was great. I know Pendo has been speaking about product ops a little bit more and that's where I started to notice that it was picking up steam. I think around 2019 is when Pendo started talking about product operations. So it was roughly right after my book came out that I saw more people speaking about it and now they're trying to figure out, \"Do we standardize it? What do we need? How does this actually look like in organizations?\" but I think it's been probably a good five years of now hearing people doing it in realtime.\n\nLenny (00:07:41):\nAwesome, and it sounds like maybe just in the last few years it started to really take off. We actually had Christine from Pendo on the podcast talking about product ops about a year ago at this point. So this is a great followup to a lot of that. Before we talk about what is product ops and what are the functions, what would you say are the biggest benefits to a company having a product ops role and also just what's a sign that you should probably seriously consider bringing on a product ops person and starting to invest in that area?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:08:08):\nIt's really about helping the product managers focus on what they were actually hired for, the strategic work. In my role on the operating side and managing teams and Melissa as well, more and more product managers are taking on the data, harvesting the data, implementation and just to get data to work with, they're spending 20%, 30% of their time. So what would that look like if they were enabled and had all of those great inputs to actually focus on company growth, achieving the value, achieving the scaling goals that the company had? So it's really about helping them focus on what they were hired for.\n\nLenny (00:08:48):\nAgain, when I was a PM, I had no product ops person, and having read your book, basically all the things product ops does is stuff PMs historically have done. To me, it's scary to give up all those things and put them on someone else's plate. There's the ideal of, \"Oh, amazing, I don't have to do all these things. I'll focus on things I really get excited about,\" but there's also this new fear of, \"Oh, someone else is going to take these things and maybe they won't do as well. There's this new process I have to think about. There's new lines of communication.\" So what's your biggest pitch to a product manager starting to hear about product ops and this fear of like, \"Oh, man, my job is going to be weird. This new person I have to deal with all the time. I used to do all these things.\" How do you help a PM get excited about this?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:09:30):\nProduct operations does not take away decision making rights from the product manager. It's there to inform them. So if you're judging your success as a product manager of, \"Hey, I do the SQL queries and I have to spend the 50 hours to set up all these customer interviews and calls,\" that to me is very operational process type work, but it's not work that's going to help you make a decision about your product. That's why we're looking at the product operations team because what I've seen is product managers doing this off the side of their desk like me too. I got excited about this because when I was at OpenSky in early days of my product management career, I had to go learn MongoDB to get data out of a database. I was sitting through a MongoDB class learning how to do this. I knew SQL, but we did not use the SQL database then. I had to go learn MongoDB so I would stop bothering the engineers to be able to actually just measure if my products and my features were doing anything correct. \n\n(00:10:27):\nThat was a lot of time that I spent doing that instead of spending it on good feature work and on understanding my customers and working with my developers and figuring out what we were actually going to build, instead I'm out here learning this programming language, which I never used again, by the way. Never used it again after that. That to me is the stuff that product ops takes away from the product managers. \n\n(00:10:51):\nWhat I constantly hear from product managers though is, \"I am so busy, I don't have time to do the things that I need to do correctly. I'm so busy trying to line up customer interviews,\" or, \"I'm so busy just trying to get data out of systems. I'm fighting these fights to get the things that I need to do my job correctly that I don't have time to do my job correctly,\" and that's what we're trying to help them with. So I wouldn't be afraid that product ops is coming in here. It's not supposed to be something that's providing more overhead. It's supposed to be something that's a little more liberating and helps free you up from all the busy work.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nThat's a great pitch. I always thought product management is an insane role with way too much going on, and that's why everyone's always burnt out and stressed. There's just so many things you have to do. So I totally get how this is happening and why this is happening. I love that you're helping people figure out how to actually do it well. Let's actually get into what the role actually is. I think it's a really confusing role. A lot of people hear product ops and everyone know what it is. There's maybe research synthesis, there's some data stuff. What's the simplest way to think about what is the general consistent roles of a product ops person and what they can do for your company?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:12:03):\nThe way we think about it is structured around the three pillars that we talk about in the book, so business and data insights, more of the quantitative side, making sure that the product manager has all of these engagement and revenue inputs to make smart decisions, the customer market insights, so the qualitative. We talked about this a little bit earlier in terms of finding folks to speak to, making sure you're speaking to more than one just customer. Finally, the third pillar is process and practices. So it's really around those areas and it depends on what your company needs and where the biggest opportunities and challenges might be.\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nAwesome. So the three, just to reshare what you just said, the three pillars of product ops, business, data and insights, customer and market insights and the process of how you build product and helping the business operate more effectively in the way they build product.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:13:00):\nSounds great when you say it. Yes.\n\nLenny (00:13:03):\nI have the notes and this is exactly described in your book, so well-described. Is there one of these three that you find most important, impactful? Is it really dependent on the business and their needs or what the PM wants to do? How do you think about, I don't know, which of these three is maybe most important or is it a super dependent?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:13:20):\nSo we usually see that high growth companies start with business data and insights and make sure that they can actually monitor what they're doing and get the strategic inputs. We see larger companies and enterprises go more towards the process and governance, especially if they're in, let's say, a transformation because they don't have the infrastructure to run good product. Let's say it's that way. They're usually just starting out, they're just forming their teams. Let's say they just trained product managers and now they're like, \"What else do we need to do besides just training product managers to make this work?\" So they need an operating model and they typically don't have a product operating model. \n\n(00:13:58):\nIn that case, they're looking at even just, \"How do we do roadmaps across the organization so that I as a chief product officer or VP of product can actually just have transparency into what my teams are doing?\" Jira does not work for that. You need a portfolio tool to be able to roll that up into something that makes sense. Again, that helps me as a VP now or a CPO make strategic decisions and it helps me monitor my teams and understand, \"Are we actually spending money on the right things? Are we doing the right work?\" So they tend to do it more on the process and governance side, but it's all in service of being able to make rapid strategic decisions and get good products out there to the world.\n\nLenny (00:14:40):\nThat's a really handy way of thinking about it. So just to say what you said again, for high growth companies, you're finding of these three pillars generally where product ops can help most is the business and data insights, helping them understand what's happening and make decisions more quickly, which makes a lot of sense. For more established older companies going through a digital transformation, oftentimes it's helping them with their process and making them more efficient in how they operate. Is there also a bucket for the middle pillar of customer and market insights or is that spread across?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:15:11):\nThat's the squishy middle. When I do teach this class, I ask people what their perception is of product ops and people never think that. So that's an area definitely for growth I think at a lot of companies.\n\nLenny (00:15:26):\nHow does that piece work with user research and that team?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:15:30):\nSo we've seen a lot of the work that is done in that team. They work with user research. Now, in organizations where let's say, this happens in a lot of organizations but not all of them, where product oversees design as well and user research and it oversees UX, this becomes seamless because you are going to have, let's say, a product ops person usually with a user research background who's going to be helping to do the stuff we talk about and the customer market insights piece, which is pulling all the research that's been done, like the customer interviews, all those things together into things like a findings database. So there's great tools out there like Dovetail, but you can also roll your own, and it's about aggregating all the interviews or customer research that's been done so people can query it and start to see what do we already know so we're not going out there and duplicating a bunch of research.\n\n(00:16:22):\nIt's also about finding participants who want to opt into research. So making sure that you have customers aware that, \"Hey, we might contact you to do customer interviews. This is why. Do you want to participate in alphas and betas? If so, this is what it entails.\" If we can build a database of people and customers that we have who opt into those types of things, it makes it easier for product managers to go out and contact them and say, \"Hey, by the way, we got a beta. Do you want to do it?\" They know what it is, they're expecting it. They know what the cadence is that people will reach out to them on to do research, and the user researchers can use that as well. \n\n(00:16:58):\nNow, the thing about the customer and market insights piece is that that person who's streamlining those activities and building those systems, they're not usually the same person who's doing the user research. So this is not about taking user research away from product managers or from user researchers, it's about enabling them to do it more effectively, enabling the insights to be put out across the company more effectively, and also helping them get in touch with users and get that feedback. \n\n(00:17:30):\nAnother piece of this too that we talk about is getting qualitative insights from sales and support. So we always hear from sales teams, and this is the classic product management tension, \"The product managers aren't listening to me\" or, \"I've told them five months ago that I had this problem with these customers that were going to churn.\" We didn't build those features. What this function does with the customer and market insights here is that it helps get a lot of that information back to the product team in an effective way. \n\n(00:18:00):\nThen it also helps communicate back to sales, \"Hey, let's be a little transparent about how we're using that feedback.\" So that's how we can communicate it back in strategy. Let them know where we stand with working on those ideas or solving those problems for customers, but usually, there's a wealth of qualitative information stuck somewhere in our organization systems, whether it's in Salesforce, whether it's in support tickets, in somebody's Google doc of their customer interviews that they've been doing, and what we're trying to do is get that out of these individual systems and into somewhere where a lot of people can take those qualitative insights and start to learn from them.\n\nLenny (00:18:36):\nPeople always ask me, \"What's changing in product management? What's the future of product management?\" I'm always like, \"Nothing. It's going to be basically the same. It's just never going to be fully defined. It's going to keep doing this weird role,\" but I feel like this is actually the answer. What's changing in product management is this product ops role is emerging, taking a lot of these things that PMs don't necessarily want to be doing or aren't amazing at and giving you more space to do the things they really want to do. So I think that's pretty amazing. I think if you think about the timeline, you said five years ago there was no real product ops. Today, half of companies essentially have a product ops role and I'm guessing in another few years it'll be much higher. So this is really interesting.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:19:12):\nI'm excited about it too. I think what we saw before was that, like you were saying, product management was this squishy role for a long time, but now we're standardizing what do product managers do. What's happening, I think, though is product managers become more prevalent, and as people realize that this is a critical role for companies, whether you're a software company or a bank or something else. We build businesses off of software in today's world and if you're not building software, you are behind. With more and more software that we're putting out there, product managers don't have time to go do all these things off the side of their desk and it's fine when you're a small startup. I was doing it too. Like I said, I had to go learn MongoDB when I was in a smaller company, and then we start to scale and I've got more and more product responsibility and I'm like, \"I don't have time to go learn MongoDB now,\" and that's where people start to burn out and where they get frustrated, like you said.\n\n(00:20:09):\nWe've got more and more systems, we've got more software tools out there that product managers are using, and it becomes a lot to track. So it's either, for companies, do you want to hire 10,000 product managers and let them all do these things off the side of their desk and then concentrate on strategic work 30% of the time or do you want them concentrating on strategic work majority of the time and then help build a product operations team around them that can create these shared systems and this infrastructure to allow them to work better?\n\nLenny (00:20:39):\nI think that's such a powerful way of thinking about this. I imagine PMs listening to you saying, \"I don't have to learn MongoDB and SQL anymore,\" would think. Actually, no, I think that's good. They should learn to do SQL and run their own data, but I think the important pieces here, yes, it would be great, but as you scale, it becomes harder and harder to have time to do all that because things ... You end up with other work that you need to be doing. So in theory, it would be awesome if your PMs could run their own queries and do their own research and create the whole process, but it just becomes harder and harder. \n\n(00:21:12):\nIt reminds me of a lot of companies that are trying to delay hiring a product manager in general and instead giving the role to engineers and designers. My feedback is always like, \"That's great as long as they want to be doing all these things that are not generally what they enjoy doing,\" like an engineer doesn't necessarily love running meetings and writing one pagers and strategy docs and taking notes. So I think it's a similar thing where, sure, it's great until you don't really want to be doing that or you don't have time for that and you have your actual job you need to be doing.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:21:41):\nThat's your full-time job and your OKRs and your goals are really around the outcomes for the company, you're like, \"But I wrote 20 scripts this year.\" So we need to help them focus on the things that they're being expected to deliver in terms of value.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:21:56):\nI also think it's funny how many people want to be a product manager until they realize what product management entails. This happens a lot and I saw it with my MBA students at Harvard too. We do a whole class, they play a product manager. I had a lot of people opt out of being a product manager at the end of it. They were like, \"I did not realize it was like that. I did not realize I had to do so many things.\" I think a lot of what gets them as well is the type of context switching that's required as a product manager. So you already, just with the basis of what we have to do, do so many different things of user research, working with the designers, working with the developers, working with executives, working with different stakeholders. You got to context switch to be able to relate to all them. You got to empathize with all these different people. You have to do all these different tasks to do this type of work. \n\n(00:22:46):\nThen you got to go figure out what template to put your roadmap in, which is going to be different template than the other 80 product managers on your team because somebody didn't come in and just say, \"Hey, we're going to use this.\" That type of work to me is just distracting from it. Is it hard for a product leader to just be like, \"Hey, this is a template we're using\"? No, but then if that product leader has to go out and train 80 other people on that template, make sure it's consistently updated all the time, make sure it's in the right formats, make sure it's in the right software, that is where the overhead comes in, and a lot of product leaders are doing this right now and what we're trying to do is free up individual product managers, but also those product leaders.\n\n(00:23:33):\nSo I work with all these CPOs, these VPs of product and they're like ... I see them just not working on strategy. I'm like, \"Why are you not working on strategy?\" and they're like, \"I don't have time to do that. I'm in here stopping all these fires. I'm figuring out what template I should put my roadmap in.\" Like I said, it's not hard. They know what template it should be in, but think about if you now can delegate that to somebody else and say, \"I want it in this template. Go roll it out. Go roll it out, go train everybody on it, find the right software for it, do it.\" It frees those people up, the leaders, to go work on strategy. That's why you're spending so much money for a product leader, anyway. That's why you spend so much money for a product manager, anyway. So to me, these things are not impossible to do. It's just do we have the right people doing them?\n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nFor PMs that are trying to figure out what remains on their plate, what are the the pieces that a PM should keep and not offload on a product ops person?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:24:33):\nThey don't want to offload decision rights. You should never be outsourcing your decision making to a product ops person. That's not the point. They're the product manager for the product managers. That's how I think about it. So their decision should be around, \"How do I operationalize great product management here?\" but as a product manager, you shouldn't be delegating to them to make any decisions about their product, and that's not their job. If they are coming to you and saying, \"You should build this,\" that's not their job either. That's not the right thing. \n\n(00:25:03):\nSo making the actual decision and then putting that decision into play with your teams, that's the type of work that you want to hold onto for a product manager. So while a product ops person can help you point you in the right direction, let's say, to find customers, maybe even help you get in touch with the customers, send out the email to invite them to a meeting or operationalize that, hopefully that's automated. I would love a product ops person to automate that type of stuff. You are going to be doing the user research. The product ops person you can go to and maybe say, \"Hey, this is the type of problems that we're understanding,\" and maybe they help you find other pieces of information around the organization on those topics and bring it to you, but they're not going to be the ones reading through all this information and being like, \"You should build this.\" \n\n(00:25:49):\nThey're also not going to be the ones who you say, \"Hey, I made this decision about what to build, told the team about it, the team got together. Can you go monitor the developers and make sure they're building it on time?\" No, they're not project managers, they're not the people who are going to be on top of your developers watching them build things, making sure that everything's out on time. That's not their role either. They're not going to handle hard stakeholder conversations about trade-offs for you, all of those things that you are going to want to keep ownership of because at the end of the day as a product manager, your job is to produce outcomes and you do need to make sure that you're monitoring those outcomes and moving towards them. You don't want to offload their responsibility.\n\nLenny (00:26:31):\nSo I took a couple notes of just things that the PM continues to own, whatever, in quotes, no one owns anything, strategy, vision, prioritizing, resource allocation, trade-off decisions, hard conversations around trade-offs and stakeholder input and things like that. Is there anything else in that bucket of just stuff a PM, a product manager continues to be responsible for?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:26:55):\nWell, there's a big piece that we're missing, go-to-market, and that's where product ops could really make a difference in terms of connecting those teams, but also being the first point of contact for sales, first point of contact for product, and enabling just some efficiencies if we want to call it process or method, but just trying to help break down the silos. \n\n(00:27:19):\nA company I'm working with right now, there's big challenge with that and it's a large enterprise level company. So how do we break down all of the different silos between departments and team leads and whatnot? So it's really talking about, \"Here's how we're going to do it. Here's some simple templates we will use at training sales, training product,\" and then getting that into play. Doing the book and doing our research, that was a consistent story point from a lot of people that we interviewed that go-to-market was a really big pain point.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:27:50):\nSo I think too what Denise was saying is product ops will take on a lot of the coordination of those types of things and making the standardized templates, but as a product manager, your role in informing what the go-to-market is doesn't change. You're still putting the inputs in there. So maybe product ops will provide, for example, templates and help say, \"Hey, here's the different pieces that we need to make a go-to-market plan,\" for example, \"Here's the templates. Here's what I gathered from people,\" but you as a product manager still have to fill out your parts. \n\n(00:28:21):\nYou still have to go talk to the salespeople. You still have to work with the marketing people to make sure it's positioned correctly, but the product ops person can help with the program management around it of getting those people together, having consistent templates, creating the cadence for when you review those things, making sure that they all align and they're all in one place so you're not going to find them everywhere, and then making sure that go-to-market process is consistent across the organization so that it's not like, as Denise said, it's not like everybody's reinventing the wheel and somebody on a go-to-market team has to figure out how to go-to-market differently with a different product team.\n\nLenny (00:28:57):\nAwesome. That's a really handy and important addition. You mentioned project management. I imagine many people think product ops also takes on project management. What's a good way to think about project management versus product ops? There's also program management. Do you have a way of thinking about those roles?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:29:15):\nThe way I like to think about it is, however, whatever they're doing in terms of the three pillars of product ops is really thinking about, as I mentioned earlier, increasing the speed and quality of decision making and all of the pillars of play into that. Program manager, I think, is really thinking about larger company initiatives and the duration of their work is ongoing versus a project manager, they're responsible for certain project that's at a time box and an end date, but it does get a little wiffy, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:29:43):\nI want to go back to the three pillars real quick and go one level deeper to help people understand what they actually entail and what are the jobs of a product ops person. So just we could even keep this brief, but just let's say with business data and insights, what are the functions and jobs and things that a product ops person would be doing for your company?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:30:02):\nA lot of companies will have a data science team or a business intelligence team and you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you don't have to have your internal product ops type of intelligence team, but it's about connecting those and making sure you're putting that with a product lens, and especially, say, with finance too. You don't want all the product managers hitting up the CFO for that month's revenue or having questions. So it's about accessing all of these inputs and putting it through a product lens and then making sure that product managers actually know what to do with it, can action it.\n\nLenny (00:30:36):\nSo it's essentially running queries for you, generating charts and graphs and recommendations based on what the data's telling you. Basically, it's doing all the data stuff that a PM would be doing. Is there anything else there?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:30:51):\nAlso helping the leaders too. So we're talking about it from a product management perspective, but I think this one especially becomes really critical for leaders and executives. A lot of times, and I sit through board meetings where we talk about ARR, we talk about retention, we talk about net retention, and we talk about all of these business metrics, and they're great for monitoring the health of our business, but where product ops comes into play in business data and insights is how do we monitor the health of our product.\n\n(00:31:22):\nSo as a chief product officer, ARR is interesting to me, but it's not as interesting to me as ARR by customer segment. It's not as interesting as ARR by product line. It's not as interesting if I take that and then look at it by retention or adoption by product or feature set or adoption by customer segment by product. When we start to put those lenses on it, they now become a really powerful strategy insight. \n\n(00:31:49):\nSo what I think these people do and do really well is even at the executive level, they help you ... You as a product leader are like, \"I need these types of insights. This helps me. This is how our business runs and this is how I want to set the strategy.\" These people make those dashboards, make those repeatable insights for you. Then ideally, they know the data so well and they know your business so well that they can surface up other opportunities for you as well to look at data that you didn't know was there or can find these interesting trends.\n\n(00:32:18):\nSo they are very much like the people digging into the data, they're just doing it with more of a product lens instead of, like Denise said, an overall company metric lens. It's not just in service of the product managers. I just wanted to point that out because I think this becomes so powerful for leaders because if leaders don't understand those types of metrics, they can't actually monitor their strategies. They can't go back and say, \"Oh, we decided to go upmarket into the enterprise.\" Look, we've got enterprise revenue, but are you actually looking at where the enterprises are adopting different product lines? Are you looking at how the enterprise uses different features, and if certain enterprises are using these types of features, are they less likely to churn? It's those types of insights that I think are really important on this lens.\n\nLenny (00:33:09):\nAs a PM hearing that somebody else will be doing this, it feels really weird. This feels like such a core job of a PM is to spend a lot of time with data, try to find opportunities, try to find things going well, not going well, but I think the message, again, is not you shouldn't be doing that as a PM and it's not bad if you are really good at it, it's you probably just don't have a lot of time to do it well. If you can find someone that's really good at this and has time, that doesn't have all the other thousands of things on their plate, you'll actually end up finding more interesting results, finding more interesting insights. You're probably missing a bunch of stuff because you don't actually have a lot of time. Is that generally the way you think about it?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:33:45):\nYeah, and I think too, the business and data insights people, they're not going to be experts on product. They're almost always not. We had a couple analysts at Produx Labs and they were ex-McKinsey, ex-Deloitte. They didn't know anything about product. So we taught them the product piece and we were the ones who were like, \"Here's the interesting data I know I'm going to need to see,\" and they were able to pull those things together in views where we could actually dig into it, but that was a jumping off point on the quantitative research where we're like, \"Okay. Now we need to go do the qualitative.\" \n\n(00:34:18):\nI think for product managers, you still need to be super comfortable with data. If you can't read these charts, if you can't see or understand trends, and a lot of times too, if you're putting this stuff in Looker or a BI tool, ideally, you can pull ad hoc reports yourself. It's just that you don't have to craft a SQL query to do it. You still need to understand the relationship between data and product and you still need to understand what good data looks like. You need to understand too things like causation and correlation. You need to understand that, \"If I put out this crazy marketing launch on Thursday, that's why all of a sudden we got a million signups on Thursday and we didn't get a million signups on Wednesday.\" They still need to understand all those things, and I don't think that becomes any less important. I don't think understanding and interpreting trends becomes any less important as a product manager's job. I just think it's about putting data into the hands of product faster so that it's not about you having to fight your way through bureaucratic processes at your company to get that data.\n\n(00:35:21):\nSo product ops can help streamline things that we know we're going to look at repeatedly. There's a bunch of stuff that we know we should look at. So put them in a dashboard like, \"Why should I have to go pull that report ad hoc every single time?\" Put them in a dashboard, put them in a report. Same for board slides. We had one of my friends who's the chief product officer of Forsta, Brian Bhuta, and he said, \"I love product ops because when we prepare for board meetings, I know there's a certain set of information that I'm going to have to put together for this board meeting, and then when we go do it manually, it becomes obsolete by the time the board meeting's over and then I got to start again and prepare for the next three months and do the board meeting again.\" So it's like you don't want your data to be obsolete. You want this to be in a repeatable fashion for things that you know are repeatable, but it doesn't get you off the hook of still looking for trends and looking for insights.\n\nLenny (00:36:17):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers, and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

Not everything can be productized, but do you have a perspective on that, that ops is often a sign where software, hopefully someday, could do itself?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:38:02):\nYou still need people to oversee those programs. So I don't think they would fully be obsolete. It wouldn't be like this whole role goes away completely, but they're the people who should be looking at, \"What can we do to optimize and streamline this?\" and not do it with human components. I think that's why a product management mindset lands so well to a product ops function too because you're like, \"How do I use software or tools or processes or frameworks to help fill in some of these gaps and standardize it and then let it run?\" That what I was meaning by the shared services model. \n\n(00:38:32):\nIf you really think in that format, it's not like, \"Hey, I need a team of 10,000 product ops people.\" I think you're doing it wrong if you're doing that right. It should be a well-run lean team who thinks about how to leverage tools for this or building your own or whatever and your products for the product team, and that's how it should be seen. So what I mean it shouldn't be obsolete one day, if you are building, let's say, products for the product team, you still need somebody to look over that product and make sure it's relevant. At the pace of everything changing like it does today, so many things are so different than they were five years ago, you want somebody to be looking over that and making sure they're still up-to-date, it's still relevant, it still works for our company and stuff like that, but you're going to have a smaller subset of people doing that. It's not going to be like, \"Oh, I need a product ops team for every product manager that's on here.\" That's not how it should work at all.\n\nLenny (00:39:27):\nI think that is going to make a lot of people feel better hearing that. Do you have any rule of thumb or way of thinking about just how many product ops people you want per product manager, per team? What's a simple heuristic for just how many people you may need?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:39:43):\nI don't have a hard and fast rule on that one, but I would say if you are at a one-to-one ratio, you're doing it wrong. Absolutely. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:39:47):\nIf you're at one-to-hundred, you're doing it wrong. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:39:54):\nYeah, too. I also think it's like ... So when we talked about it too with this hybrid versus shared services model, if you have a hybrid model, let's say, and typically, this is a symptom that your data is not well-instrumented. Let me put it that way as well. Sometimes you need a stopgap holdover until you can well-instrument your data or something, and that could be as long as it takes for certain companies. In this case, like we said, you might have a business data and insights person aligned to every director of product who oversees multiple Scrum teams. You might have one aligned to every VP of product, depending on how much help you need to get the product data out of things.\n\n(00:40:37):\nNow, if you have a very well-instrumented dataset like we were talking about at Doodle or something like that, you're probably going to have way less people because the product managers are armed and capable of going in there and being able to pull the queries themselves, do their ad hoc research themselves because they made it accessible and you made it possible for them to go do that. \n\n(00:40:59):\nSo I do think there's a balance there between how good your company is instrumented both for everything, for all three of these pieces that we're talking about relative to the size of your product ops team. It might take some more manpower at the beginning to get it going, but, ideally, you streamline this team and it becomes pretty lean and pretty small and they're overseeing multiple programs or software systems that run themselves.\n\nLenny (00:41:25):\nWell, it gives me a lot of hope that this isn't going to become just another massive org within a company. It is looking at companies that are incredibly efficient like Ramp and Deal that have very few employees, very few product managers, and they have product ops people. So that tells me there's a lot of leverage that you can find from just maybe, I don't know, one or two that's probably not a large team of product ops people there.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:41:48):\nWe say too, get started with one person. We described these three pillars and repeatedly through the book we're like, \"Hone in on what's the most important part for you that's going to help you right now,\" that we talk through, and then just take one person and throw that out there. Usually, you can get so much leverage from that that it frees you up to do a lot of the stuff that you need to get done. Then when you're ready and you see the next hurdle and it's not something that first person can take on, then you might add one more person.\n\n(00:42:18):\nThere are different expertise, I think, between the three different pillars and the people who would oversee it, and that's something to take into account as well. So like we said, in business data and insights, that person typically is not an expert on product. Hopefully they get ramped up on it working with you, but they're typically not an expert on product. A lot of times these people are not coming from a product management background. That's going to be actually a different person than I would look at to help with the governance and product pieces. That person needs to be a product background person because they're usually helping roll out the roadmap stuff, coach people on how to do it, helping to define the different systems and processes that you need on your product operating model, and if they have no experience with product management at all, that's going to be really hard for them to do and it's probably not going to be great. \n\n(00:43:05):\nWe do see this trend of people throwing agile coaches at this, and agile coaches who have never been a product manager before in a well-run company are going to struggle there because they're going to revert back to agile processes and optimizing for things like Scrum, but they're not going to do what that role is designed for, which is to help product management processes. We don't usually need another agile coach telling us how to run a standup. We need people to come in and help us figure out who's invited to these cross-functional roadmap reviews, what inputs do we need on there, and what decisions do we need to make coming out of it, and how do we communicate it at the correct level to executives as well so we're not digging into Jira at these meetings in front of A CEO. CEOs don't care about what's in Jira. Well, they shouldn't. Let's put it that way. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:43:57):\nShouldn't.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:43:59):\nThey want to know like, \"What are the big pushes that we're doing to help us reach our strategic objectives?\" So it's helping that they know a little more about the right size of communication, the different cross-functional teams, what product managers do on a daily basis and what's important to them, and that's really critical in that role. So that's where, I think, your teams might just be slightly bigger from a perspective of more than one person. I'm not saying hundreds of people, but you might need a couple different people in this organization because the roles are slightly different. For the market research and the customer research thing too, you might need somebody with a user research background for that. Somebody who did research ops is a great person for that.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:44:41):\nIt's pretty unusual, I think, to see companies start out with an entire team. I worked with Sam's Club and they were planning to do it that way, but mostly we see it starting organically. I think the way [inaudible 00:44:53] mentioned in her story of being a PM and feeling the pain and having the empathy of wanting to make it better, and that's typically the generation of these roles, that it might be someone being allocated part-time from their PM role and finding out that they really do enjoy this enablement aspect of it and that's where it grows.\n\nLenny (00:45:12):\nAwesome. So let's just lean into this topic of just how to start rolling it out at your company, and you've already talked about a bunch of tips there. By the way, if you buy your book at the end there, there's this really beautiful little guy, there you go, I think, on the camera of just a little yellow brick road of all the steps that it takes to roll it out. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:12):\nYes, Candyland.\n\nLenny (00:45:32):\nCandyland. So on this topic of just who to start with, sounds like you recommend start with one person, and what I'm hearing is pick one of these three pillars that you think is most highest leverage potentially to take off your product management plate. Is that right?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:46):\nYup.\n\nLenny (00:45:49):\nSo what else should people be thinking about in starting to roll this role out, starting to build this team?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:45:56):\nThat's a great question. So one of our case studies is Shintaro Matsui at Amplitude, and he created the role at Amplitude. When you think about, it's Meta. So they're creating a tool that helps in terms of product operations, but they're enabling it there as well. So he's done a really great job of getting that set up and really being a thought leader there. So the case study that we chatted with him about was introducing it and how do you get it going and how do you build the momentum and show the quick wins. That was his top tip was making sure that you set, understand, first of all, you may have a perception of what the biggest needs are, but doing your listening tour and doing your user research, some research sprints, understanding there may be a huge opportunity, but it also sounds massive in your team of one, where can you make the most difference quickly? Where can you have the most impact? \n\n(00:46:46):\nSo identifying those, celebrating those wins, making sure everybody understands that, and then showing what's above the line with a person of one the capabilities you'll have, and then below the line, things that you may not get but you could if we did think about building the team and setting the expectations as well.\n\nLenny (00:47:04):\nDo you suggest they try to hire someone that has already been a product ops person? Is it okay to hire someone that hasn't then they just become a product ops person? How important is that experience?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:47:14):\nI think if you find someone that's done the role of product management, awesome. If someone's set it up somewhere ... Look at Blake Samic, started from Uber to Strike to AI. Clearly, he's got a model going that's really successful. So if somebody could get a Blake Samic, I would say definitely do that.\n\nLenny (00:47:32):\nIt'd be hard to pull him away from OpenAI. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:47:37):\nI don't think he's leaving there right now. Just started, got a lot of work ahead of him.\n\nLenny (00:47:42):\nWe have a lot of LinkedIn requests right now. Here they come.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:47:46):\nPoor Blake. Sorry, sorry for your inbox. I think too it's about if you're going all in. If you're just trying to get buy-in for this and let's say it's originating from a CPO or a product leader who's like, \"Hey, let's start this out,\" but the company's not ready to invest all the way, you might pull somebody from a different function, let's say, have them be the product ops person and try to rapidly demonstrate value. If you're a CPO or a leader and you're like, \"I got budget. I know this is important. I'm totally bought in. Let's go,\" you're probably better off hiring, let's say, somebody who's done this before, somebody who's experienced, but also somebody who could be more of a VP or director of product ops and then they can go do the hiring and figuring out, \"Do we pull people from other functions and streamline it?\" That helps free up the leader as well from not having to go find 8,000. It's never going to be 8,000 people, but eight people to do that function.\n\n(00:48:43):\nSo that would be a way to look at it as well. So if people are not quite sold on it, you might want to start with one function. Figure out where the burning issue is. Demonstrate that value. Show that it's something that you want to actually invest in, and then you might want to hire in a leader or help build up the team from there.\n\nLenny (00:49:00):\nIt feels like that first hire is so important because if they don't do great, the whole role of product ops starts to get a bad tinge within the company. So there's a lot of pressure on making sure that first person succeeds. I guess more reason to buy your book and make sure that they do it right. \n\nMelissa Perri (00:49:17):\nIf you feel like you as a leader can coach the product ops person and you have time to coach the product ops person, let's say, through being a good product ops person and getting started with it and directing them, you're probably good at taking somebody who does not have experience but has the right skillset and then you can teach them. If you have absolutely no time to coach this person and they're not super self-directed, let's say, so they're not going out taking classes, reading the books, doing that type of thing, probably going to want to hire somebody who's done it before, at least that portion of it, and then that person can help coach other people grow the function. \n\n(00:49:55):\nIt's the same thing with product management. We look at these teams especially in a lot of transformation companies. We have a lot of product managers who've never been product managers before, and a lot of leaders who've never been product managers before, and they ask me, \"Do I hire in experienced leaders or what?\" and I'm like, \"Well, if those product leaders need to go coach other product managers, then you need somebody who's experienced in there. You need somebody who knows how to get that work done. If they don't have time to learn, if you're not on a timeline to actually teach these people these things and get them up to speed, then you need somebody to hit the ground running.\" \n\n(00:50:29):\nSo I'd look at it for how much time do we have to demonstrate value, how much coaching is available to get this person into the right mindset and the right skillset to do this and execute. I think that that's needed in almost every role, not just this one.\n\nDenise Tilles (00:50:43):\nOne thing I wanted to mention was whether to hire products or product manager person for the role with the background of product ops or product management, there's not a ton of folks out there that have a products title, but as you're looking, dig in because this person may have been doing a lot of the work as a product manager or within that title. So there's a lot of people out there that probably would fit that profile, but not with a proper product ops title.\n\nLenny (00:51:10):\nWhat are the key skills that you find are really important for finding this person, especially if they don't have this role? My guess is dependent on the pillar, if they're data-focused, research-focused or process-focused. What do you suggest to make sure you're looking for when you're hiring this person?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:51:25):\nWith the business data and insights, you're looking for somebody who's really good at interpreting data, telling stories with data, somebody who's good at communicating to many different types of stakeholders about the data and putting it into useful ways. What I wouldn't hire for that role as a first person is it's not a database engineer. That's not what we're doing. We're not SQL-ing, turning things into the right SQL tables. We're instead trying to get the information out of the SQL tables and make sense out of it. \n\n(00:51:59):\nSo we actually find people with consultant backgrounds who are really good at this because they're usually churning out these types of reports and stuff for PE firms, VC firms, and whoever were their clients to begin with. What would be ideal is if that person has a lot of experience with a BI tool like Looker or Tableau as well and they could use it. That's not always the case. Sometimes those people are really good at Excel and PowerPoint, but they're not great at the Looker and BI. If you could find that two things together though, home run right there. \n\n(00:52:31):\nSo this person's probably a data analyst background. We did have a business intelligence background like you were talking about as well, something like that for the business and data and insights role. It does not have to be a product manager. I think you can help them, steer them in the right directions for what questions you need to answer. They shouldn't be the ones coming up with all the questions you need to answer. It'd be great if they surface some insights, but you ask them the questions, they can go get the answers.\n\nLenny (00:53:01):\nWhat about for the other two pillars?\n\nDenise Tilles (00:53:02):\nWell, in terms of the process and practices, I think this person really needs a super high EQ, understanding what the needs are, but also has a good spidey sense of how much methods do we need to think about bringing to the team and thinking about how those things get introduced that it's not a mandate, but it's a suggestion of how we can work. Typically, product managers will be pretty open to that because if they're like, \"I don't know what the roadmap template is. I don't know what the roadmap cadence is.\" \"Here's some guidance.\" \"Awesome. Now I don't have to think about how to do it, I'm just going to do it.\" \n\n(00:53:38):\nSo I think someone who has a lot of experience understanding the underlying tensions and opportunities, and then feels good and understands how to implement the systems thinking and also understands it's not a set it and forget it, that they're constantly reevaluating the processes, the tools, \"Are these working for us?\" Then understands, I think, in more broadly, \"As my CPO is getting ready for a board meeting, what are the inputs they're going to need? As we're getting ready for the QBR, are the PMs ready? Do we have a cohesive stories? Anybody taking the time to look at all of the different presentations to make sure that we're giving the same perspective or building towards a certain strategy that everybody's focused on?\" So that would be my advice.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:54:30):\nI think for customer and market research part, you're looking for somebody with more of a user research background here, but process-oriented. So I'd look for somebody who knows user research code, knows really good tactics for that because it can help create the toolkits, get the right type of prototyping and usability software in there. They know what good interviewing looks like, that type of stuff, but they also got this need to make things better. So they're like, \"I need to create a system to do this.\" They're good at operationalizing stuff. I think that's a skill for everybody. They're like, \"I can build a system to fix this.\" That's actually a really good interview guild that I would ask a product ops person and I never came up with it. I never thought about that before, but it's like, \"Tell me about some process or something that you had to do in your job that you really hated and that you ended up just trying to automate a way or build a system around it to make it better.\" That would be a great interview question for anybody in those roles, I think. \n\n(00:55:27):\nWith the user and market insights person too, there's not a ton of people out there doing this, but there is a little research ops movement out there that I think could be really valuable here. So Jen Cardello, who is our case study on Fidelity, she runs their user insights team there and she's our VP of, I think it's user insights and she does oversee all the user researchers as well, but she also oversees a research ops team, and the research ops team is responsible for building their participant database. They also help build toolkits for people to do user research. They oversee any of the user research tools. They also go out and train other people in doing good user research. \n\n(00:56:07):\nSo with them, that looks like not everybody's allowed to go talk to customers and financial firms like this because of compliance reasons. They make sure they certify people to be able to go do good research up to certain points and they get levels for how far they can go so that they can democratize the research and help put it into their hands. Then if there's compliant issues around different research studies, they come back to Jen's team and the user researchers will help them complete it. \n\n(00:56:33):\nSo it's about how we ... There's a lot of legal things about what you can say and what you can't say to customers and stuff like that, what you can ask them, and they're navigating those complexities around there. So Jen comes from a research ops background. She comes from a whole UX background, but research ops is her thing and she's fantastic at setting up that stuff. She and I worked together at Athenahealth and she did that there. So I watched her put that into place and it was amazing and now she does it at Fidelity. \n\n(00:57:00):\nSo if you find somebody with that background, golden, but if you find somebody who ... If you can't find somebody like Jen because there's only one Jen, you should look for somebody who has at least a user research background, probably some UX background. They're really good at doing that and they want to operationalize it.\n\nLenny (00:57:18):\nJen's about to get a bunch of LinkedIn requests too.\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:22):\nSorry for your inbox, Jen.\n\nLenny (00:57:23):\nI feel like the research team is going to hate people now for pulling you into product ops. Who would you suggest product ops report to generally at least to start?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:35):\nHead a product. \n\nDenise Tilles (00:57:35):\nCPO. \n\nLenny (00:57:38):\nSuch a clear, quick answer. I love it. How do they find time to train and work with this person? Are they the right-hand person that helps them just make everything more efficient? What's a way? What's that relationship like?\n\nMelissa Perri (00:57:50):\nI think definitely their right-hand person, and we say to a lot of CPOs, especially high growth companies, \"Make your first hire just a product ops person to help you get this data out and start looking at it,\" because that helps them with board meetings, it helps them set strategy. Usually when you walk into a growth stage company, that's the first thing that you need to do is make sure that it's working, that you need to set it. Typically, when you're getting hired, there's usually a strategy problem and that person, they're like your right-hand man trying to operationalize that. So I definitely think that you're going to be guiding them there. \n\n(00:58:23):\nI think this comes back to our question though about, do you hire somebody with experience or do you hire somebody who's new to it? If you as a CPO don't have a lot of time to train up somebody on product ops because you've got 8,000 fires to fight, then hire somebody with experience who knows how to do it and operationalize it. If you are like, \"My biggest issue is business data and insights,\" for example, \"and I just need to get my data so that I can do the strategy pieces and then I need to think through and work through what I want product ops to look like,\" maybe then you just hire the data analyst. If they're confident in the data analysis piece, it's pretty easy, I haven't done this myself, to teach them about what types of information you need to see as a product person. They're going to need a lot more handholding at the beginning because they're not going to know all the different cuts of data, but it's not an investment of an inordinate amount of time to be able to get something valuable back. \n\n(00:59:20):\nIt's not like training for 40 hours a week and then waiting six months to see results. It's more about, \"I need you to go pull these types of cuts. Here's why. Let me explain to you this so that you learn it and then you can think about it next time,\" but that's going to help you there too. So I think it really depends. So how fast you need product ops fully rolled out and then how much time you have to train people, and then where you're starting from there and how big and how much buy-in you have to grow this thing from the get-go.\n\nLenny (00:59:49):\nAwesome. Maybe as a last question, I'd love to go through a quick case study of a company you worked with and just share maybe how you rolled it out, what you ran into, challenges you had to overcome, and maybe the benefits and impact that adding this role had.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:00:06):\nWhen I was at Athenahealth, we were doing a ... Athenahealth has always been a software company, so let me put it that way, but they didn't have a formal product management role and they had just implemented it when I came in. So the chief product officer brought me in. He did not have an extensive product background, so he said, \"I need to train all these product people and figure out what to do with this organization.\" So I came in to help him do that. We had over 360 product managers. We had 5,000 software developers there and it was a massive platform, $8 billion in market cap, I think, electronic health record system. \n\n(01:00:42):\nSo this is where I started to realize we needed product ops. This was me discovering this. So I'll tell you how we rolled it out and probably what we would do differently next time, but we had trained all the product managers. People were starting to use a lot of the things that we were teaching, and we saw that the maturity was getting a lot better in the organization, which was fantastic, but then we started to run into these problems, and these problems that we found could not be solved by just training product managers, and that's where the concept for product ops came up. \n\n(01:01:11):\nWe also realized we had way too many product managers, just way too many product managers. There was one person reporting into one person all the way down, and we were like, \"This is not helpful.\" So we ended up training everybody, teaching people about what the role was, and then thinking through as we encounter these other problems, \"What else do we need besides product managers?\" Product ops became one of the things. We also had people actually move out of product management into other roles. We had people become data analysts, we had people become user researchers, we had people go into other parts of the organization, but a lot of people after we trained them actually just self-selected out of product management and some of them did come to us and say, \"What else is there?\" \n\n(01:01:53):\nWhen we looked at the product ops role, we said, \"Okay. What are the big fires that we have to fight that's just not from a lack of skills perspective?\" That's a big part about product ops. It's not a replacement for product managers or product leaders not having product management skills. It's to help skilled product managers and product leaders do their job better. So this will never replace the fact that people don't have the skills to do their job. \n\n(01:02:19):\nSo where we ran into issues was, one, getting insights back to the executives on what the teams were actually doing. So the CEO and I were sitting there trying to set strategy and set the vision for the company and I was helping him formulate it into written form and help him deploy it and think through where we want it to go. He was in Jira, digging around in Jira trying to find information on what people were working on, and I was like, \"You're not going to find that in Jira, especially when we've got hundreds of thousands of tickets for 5,000 people. You're not going to find this in there.\" \n\n(01:02:57):\nThat started to show me, \"Hey, he's looking for this. What do you want to see?\" He's looking for a portfolio roadmap of what everybody's doing and he wanted to see what are the big pushes we're making from a feature perspective and how do they tie back to our overall strategy and our goals. What's going to help our retention? What's going to help us get new customers? What's going to help us move into the enterprise, which was a big thing we were doing going upmarket into hospitals? We had no transparency into the allocation of R&D on that and also the roadmaps on that. \n\n(01:03:29):\nSo one of the things that we were trying to do in product ops was build that view, try to figure out how we get people to put the right information into Jira at the right level. So we actually had to train people on how to write ... At the time, we only had Jira, so epics in Jira that were not just build a button, they were more substantial than that. They actually had to meet behind it so we could look at it. Then we had to go out and find the right software to roll that up into a portfolio view so the executives could get the insights they were looking for.\n\n(01:04:00):\nWe also had to build a way to track the OKRs that were deployed and actually see where it was. So we had to build the dashboards for that. So we started there and that became really important because that was a big issue was just the executive visibility, how do we make consistent roadmaps across the organizations, how do we get visibility into what's going on. As we started to identify more and more things, we said, \"We're a huge team. We should actually have somebody overseeing this.\" \n\n(01:04:27):\nData and insights was a really big issue in the company in general, and we knew we had to instrument things better, and at the time, they brought in Amplitude and they were starting to put an Amplitude everywhere in the organization, but it wasn't fully rolled out yet. So we had these people who were going around trying to help the individual product teams get the information out of Amplitude and we said, \"We need this to be more of a consistent thing, a consistent program.\" \n\n(01:04:52):\nSo that sparked the need for having our first product operations leader. So we ended up creating a VP of product operations and somebody moved from the product management role into that. She was much more of a process type person. She wanted to really help arm the teams into being able to get good data out there, but she understood product management well enough where she knew how all this stuff worked and she wanted to create the systems internally. \n\n(01:05:17):\nSo reporting into her, we had a business data and insights team that was overseeing Amplitude rollout and they were also putting people around the director level overseeing usually five to let's say eight Scrum teams on the director level, sometimes smaller just depending on the product. We had a business data and insights person embedded at that level to help get the ad hoc reports out now because we weren't well-instrumented. We said, \"We're still making the programs and the shared services at the top level, but these people need to make decisions today. So how do we get them to do that?\" So she oversaw that team. She had somebody directed there. \n\n(01:05:55):\nthen we also had the people looking at the portfolio views and the governance and the rollout and the rollout of that getting put into that as well. So that helped us get going with that. On the other side, so this didn't fall under product operations at the time, but like I said, Jen Cardello was doing research ops there and leading this team around the user insights. She got the participant database out. That was fantastic. She got out a bunch of different user research tools. They made a design systems database too that helped us be able to do prototyping a lot faster and have consistent design processes, which was amazing.\n\n(01:06:32):\nThe head of UX reported into the chief product officer. So it still fell under the CPO, but it reported into the head of UX on that side and that was totally fine because we just collaborated with them pretty much all the time. So that's how we started to roll it out and get going and that's where that need was and it became so much better to get the insights that we needed out there. \n\n(01:06:53):\nThen what happened was, actually, Athenahealth at this time, it was really wild and private. So this is where I left and a lot of leaders left at the same time, but they ended up restructuring it and they actually kept the product ops team. So now, Tim Davenport oversees product ops team. He was the chief of staff for the chief product officer at the time and he's been building it, again, taking the stuff that worked and then building onto it, and they're actually one of our key studies in the book as well about what Tim's doing now and how he's orchestrated as well to help with opex and capex and accounting type issues that they were having too. \n\n(01:07:28):\nSo Athenahealth has been through many different restructurings since I've been there, but they have always kept product ops and their current chief product officer said that he will never go anywhere else that doesn't have product ops. That's how much he believes in it.\n\nLenny (01:07:43):\nWow. What a testament to the value of product ops, 100% retention on the role through all these transitions. One of the interesting things you said is within this VP of product ops managed a bunch of different people and teams, which is really interesting because I always imagine product ops VP would manage product ops people. Is that common where they lead, say, there's a data team you mentioned and a few other team?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:08:06):\nYeah. In this case, we did have her managing the business data and insights people and they were data analysts. I wouldn't say they were data engineers or anything like that, but there were people who were really good at pulling SQL and analyzing data from a product perspective. We actually moved. I should say this as well. We moved a lot of people who didn't want to be product managers but were good at that out of the role and into that role. So they had some product background, they had been trained in product, they were really good at the data pieces, but they were more suited for that than they were suited for product management. Like I said, a lot of people opted out. They were like, \"Get me out of this role. I don't want to do this.\" They wanted more of a transactional type role or diving into data, and a lot of it came down to I think people under anticipate how much they're going to have to deal with stakeholders, and once they have to, they're like, \"Oh, God, I don't want to do this,\" and I see that over and over again when it happens with product management. \n\n(01:09:00):\nSo she oversaw them, but they did work closely with the data people on the CTO side. There was a whole data team on the CTO side who were doing more of the database administration and the instrumentation of things. They were also helping to roll out Amplitude, instrument it correctly, and building the right views and things like Amplitudes or the other product analytics or other tools that they were using. We did not have Tableau at the time. That was something that was added later, but they were in charge of utilizing the data and trying to build those insights.\n\nLenny (01:09:33):\nAmazing. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've never done this with two people. We'll see how it goes. So you can pick the question you want to take or both answer. Here we go. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:09:48):\nI'll take that. Of course, Escaping the Build Trap. It's true. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:09:51):\nI thought you would say that. \n\nDenise Tilles (01:09:54):\nAnother one that I recommend is called Traffic. It came out this year by Ben Smith, around the invention and growth of HuffPo and Gawker and whatnot. I was in media at Condé Nast then, so peripherally part of it. It's an exciting ride that has an ending that we all know, but it's a good story, good tale.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:10:15):\nThe Art of Action I think is a fantastic book on strategy and I always recommend this to people and it's out of the realm. There's a lot of great product management books out there too, but I like this one because it's a sleeper hit, I think, in the product management community. It is a fantastic description of deploying strategy and how you can tell if strategy is well-deployed in organizations or if there's gaps that you need to fill. So I find that when people read it, they go, \"Oh, my God, we have all of these problems,\" and I'm like, \"Yup, that's a strategy deployment and strategy creation problem. That's pretty apparent.\" So that's my favorite book to recommend to people. I love Theresa Torres' Continuous Discovery Habits. Fantastic book as well, just to give a shout out in the product world too.\n\nLenny (01:10:57):\nNext question, favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:01):\nDeutschland 82, 86, 89. It's on Hulu. Highly recommend it, about East Germany. \n\nLenny (01:11:08):\nLike Pedal.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:09):\nYeah, really great.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:12):\nI am going to go ... I just watched the House of Usher on Netflix. I love the ... It's Halloween right now. Well, it was just Halloween. \n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:12):\nPerfect. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:22):\nSo I was watching all the scary movies, but I love the Netflix genre of everything from the Haunting of Hill House. Those were great.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nAmazing. I started watching that and then I gave up quickly, but I should give it another chance. My wife and I have been stuck on Love is Blind. Classic.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:39):\nSame. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:40):\nGood one.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:40):\nSame. \n\nMelissa Perri (01:11:40):\nGood one. \n\nLenny (01:11:41):\nWhat a terrible, wonderful show.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:43):\nIt is. It's the high low.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nNext question, do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask when you're hiring people?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:11:49):\nWhen was the last time you changed your mind about something really important and why? So do they have a learning mindset? Do they have self-awareness? Can they acknowledge where they were and how they evolved? So that's usually a pretty insightful question.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:12:06):\nMine's probably tell me about a time that you failed and what happened. That one's an interesting one too because if nobody has an example of a time that they failed, that right there is an interesting sign. Two, I feel like everybody tries to turn it into a positive story. They really try to spin it and I'm like, \"I don't even want you to spin it. I just want to tell me what you learned.\" It's fine to say what you learned at the end of that. I think that's okay, but they're like, \"Oh, but this happened and all these things were great afterwards,\" and I'm like, \"I'm not looking for a fantastic outcome. I'm just looking for did you fail and did you learn something from it.\" \n\nLenny (01:12:43):\nDo you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:12:47):\nWell, there's one I'm going to have to plug. It's not that I recently discovered it, but I talked about all the issues that we had at Athenahealth with the portfolio management system, and after that, I discovered Dragon Boat and I'm now on their advisory board, but it helped me solve that problem. So much of rolling up everything that was in Jira sits on top of it and being able to look at it in a great view. So that was so, so good. \n\n(01:13:13):\nAnother one that I have not been involved with but that I just really love because I think they're doing great things with, again, in the product ops world, is Dovetail and they are a research repository out there and they're also putting AI on top of it to help generate insights into all the research that's been done. I have no affiliation with Dovetail, but I really love what they're doing because I've had that problem of us rolling our own research repository over and over and over again, and now we've got a tool out there to do it.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:13:42):\nI guess the one I would mention is Vistali, and some product leaders that I'm working with right now are playing around with it, and it's an interesting tool that's a single workspace that you can connect your strategy and discovery and delivery visually and guides people along those paths as well. So interested to play with it more, but it piqued my interest.\n\nLenny (01:14:05):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, often share with someone, come back to often to help either with work or with life?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:14:15):\nMine's both, especially with teams that I'm working with or cross-functional stakeholders that if you try to serve everybody, you serve no one. So it's about honing in on who you're actually building your product for, who your persona is, and then with my children in terms of try to be everyone's friend, but it may not happen. So it goes both ways.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:14:37):\nWhat's the worst that can happen with most of the things that I've done? To me when I get scared about something or trying to do something or even interpersonal reactions where I'm like, \"God, I have to have this hard conversation with this person,\" my brain, I try to tell myself, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" Usually when you sit down and start to think about it, it's not as bad as you anticipate. So for me, that's always helped me manage my anxiety around difficult situations or taking a leap and trying to get out there. I think in my younger days, I was a little crippled by overthinking and by being too anxious about things and not taking big leaps. So I've tried to stick by that and keep asking myself, \"What's the worst that can happen?\" and it's usually not as bad as you think it is. \n\nLenny (01:15:27):\nI love that. Final question, since there's two of you, we'll end in a really sweet way. What's one thing you really admire about each other?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:15:36):\nMelissa is a legend, but behind the legend, she's just a really great collaborative person. So of course, we got to know each other really well writing this book together. We worked together before that, but it was a really great way of staying connected to a former colleague, someone in the industry. Especially during COVID, it was a really great way of building towards something that was bigger than the both of us. So what I love about her is that she's really revered by so many folks, but really approachable and really truly wants to help people.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:16:16):\nThanks, Denise. What I love about Denise is she's really this calming, patient presence and she approaches everything with so much professionalism, but also can really get to the meat of the problem, help calm down certain situations where escalated, turn them around, and she's got this patience and calm about her in everything that she does that helps you focus, helps you concentrate on the big issues and she can really steer people in the right direction. So to me, I've always admired watching her coach and lead people. She led her analysts at Produx Labs as well. When things would go slightly awry or a situation would go out of hand, Denise was always like, \"Nope, we'll just fix it,\" and dove in and was able to make it better. I always really appreciated that.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:17:13):\nOh, shocks. We might've had a few of the what's the worst that could happen moments, right?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:17:16):\nAlways.\n\nLenny (01:17:17):\nAmazing. You two are awesome. For folks listening, make sure to grab their book, Product Operations. You can find it on Amazon, I imagine. Share where else people can find it, but two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nDenise Tilles (01:17:32):\nProductoperations.com, we've got some downloadables that are available for folks and questions if you want to get in touch with us. How can they help us? I'm trying to think here.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:17:44):\nTell us your stories about product operations. We want to hear how people are implementing it, what's working, what's not working. We're always learning about this too, and I think we said in this book, it's ticking off now, but it's by no means standardized. So we want to hear about what's happening, how has your company been successful or not successful with it, what have you seen work, what have you seen not work. So definitely reach out and let us know about it. Also, you can help us by buying the book and leaving us an Amazon review if you do read it because that does help authors and we self-publish this one too, so that always helps us on there. \n\n(01:18:17):\nYou can find both of us on LinkedIn as well. I'm Melissa Jean Perri, I think on, there, but if you look for Melissa Perri, I usually pop up and Denise Tilles. Then if you want to contact us, product operations.com, we got a form on there to reach out.\n\nLenny (01:18:31):\nProductoperations.com. Is that the best way to find where to buy the book or are there other sites you recommend people go check it out?\n\nMelissa Perri (01:18:37):\nWe do. We just got it. Self-publishing has been fun, but we just got it where it is distributing now to Barnes and Noble and other bookstores. So you can usually find it on anything, but if you go to the website, it will have the most up-to-date information on where you can find it. Then if you go to your bookstore and some people are against Amazon, so if you go to your bookstore and ask for it, they will be able to order it for you.\n\nLenny (01:19:00):\nAmazing. Thank you two for being here.\n\nMelissa Perri (01:19:03):\nThanks for having us.\n\nDenise Tilles (01:19:04):\nThanks for having us.\n\nLenny (01:19:05):\nMy pleasure. Bye, everyone. \n\n(01:19:09):\nThank you so much for listening.

We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales. There are a lot of disadvantages to that, but I do think it led to a ton of innovation. That's how we got our very innovative go-to market motions because a lot of those people then moved into different functions at the company. They had all this context on who the user was. They had talked to so many different users at that point. If you take people that are just super smart, they've never done it before, one advantage of that is they can innovate because I think they come in with, I don't know anything. Let me just figure this out.\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Melissa Tan. Melissa was the longtime head of growth for Dropbox's B2B business. She's also their first growth product manager. Then she went on to do full-time advising for companies like Canva, Grammarly, Miro, and Ro, helping them with their growth strategy and helping them build their growth teams.\n\n(00:01:03):\nFor the past two and a half years, she's been leading growth at Webflow. But hot off the presses as Melissa shares at the top of this podcast, she's going back to full-time advising life. So if you're looking for help with go-to market plans, growth strategy, building your growth team, aligning your sales, marketing and growth efforts, she's about to become available, so definitely reach out. In our conversation, we get deep into what it takes to build a high performing team and also how to build a high performing growth team, specifically.\n\n(00:01:30):\nMelissa shares advice for becoming a leader that people will follow from company to company, how to best develop your people to become the best versions of themselves. She talks about the most common ingredients of a high performing team and what she's learned from working with companies like Canva, Grammarly, Miro, Ro, Webflow and Dropbox. We also get into how to interview product managers and she shares her actual interview process, plus who your first growth hire should probably be, the most common mistakes people make when they first start to invest in growth and a real talk story of what Dropbox did right and what they did wrong in their shift to B2B. There are so many golden nuggets of lessons in this episode and I'm excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Melissa Tan after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:14):\nToday's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI.

It's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:16):\nI'm excited to have you on. I hear there's a big development in your career that is going to be out by the time this podcast comes out where you're embarking on a new adventure. I'd love to hear more about it and for folks to understand what you're doing next.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:04:30):\nOver the last couple years I've been at Webflow building out the growth team there. I'm actually transitioning right now and I'm out right now and I'm going to go back into advising, which is something I was doing a lot of before Webflow working, having been fortunate enough to work with great companies like Canva, Grammarly, Miro, et cetera. And so that's one of my biggest passions is working with earlier stage companies once they found product market fit and helping them scale growth. And I'll be going back into advising.\n\nLenny (00:04:59):\nAmazing. That's a huge news because I, there's like a small number of people like Melissa that is available at certain times to work with and this is going to be this window and I just want people to understand what kinds of areas do you think you're going to focus on for folks that may need help and may want to reach out?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:05:17):\nI've worked with companies across many different stages, so even in the early stage as companies are thinking about their go-to market strategy. Previously at Dropbox, I worked across sales. I also helped start their initial product growth and self-serve team for Dropbox business. I've also overseen pricing and packaging at Webflow. So a lot of companies initially as they're thinking about their go-to market strategy, should they be product led? Should they lean more into sales motion? What should the pricing and packaging look like? I've worked with earlier stage companies and then also post product market fit as companies are building out growth and they want to make sure to optimize the funnel across activation, monetization, engagement retention. I've also advised and helped growth teams, so kind of across stages focus on growth and go-to market.\n\nLenny (00:06:03):\nI guess while we're on it, what's the best way to reach out as people are listening to this and they're like, \"Oh my God, I want to get some help on this stuff.\"\n\nMelissa Tan (00:06:09):\nDefinitely LinkedIn is a good place. I check my LinkedIn, so feel free to reach out there.\n\nLenny (00:06:15):\nGreat. So usually we got that covered at the end, but I think that was going to be helpful in case people were like, \"Oh, I see what you can help us with.\" So building on that, I want to focus our conversation on two specific topics that I know that you're specially strong at. One is building high performance teams broadly, and then two is building high performance growth teams specifically. How does that sound as a focus of our conversation?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:06:41):\nYeah, let's do it. Two topics I'm very passionate about. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:06:45):\nSo before we get into it too deeply, I want to first talk about Dropbox. So you're at Dropbox for four-ish years, something like that, doing a lot of their growth work and it was in the middle of a lot of their growth spurts and things like that. And when I think Dropbox and growth, there's kind of this dichotomy I think about. On the one hand, there's just these incredible growth loops that work, this referral program, this crazy word of mouth. There's just this explosive growth story of a product.\n\n(00:07:11):\nAnd then on the other hand, there's this B2B side that from an outsider just feels like that's something that didn't work for a long time. And then Box came around and did that really well, and I think Dropbox has done better since then, but it feels like this combination of really successful growth and then maybe less successful. So I'm curious, just looking back from your experience and from what you've heard, what do you think Dropbox did and what do you think they did wrong? And then just what are some learnings from that experience and watching Dropbox go through that?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:07:40):\nYeah, it's a great question. And having been at Dropbox for close to five years, I did a lot of reflection while I was there. So I was there from 2013 to 2017, around 200 people. I think about a billion dollar valuation to essentially ... I think when I left we were 1,500 people and we're valued at 10 billion at the IPO. I think the things that Dropbox got right, one of them was definitely hiring. So when I think about 2013, Dropbox was actually known in the tech circles as a place that was very selective, very difficult to get into. You could have an amazing resume, and Dropbox was really selective about the type of people they brought in. So I think they looked for two main things. They looked for first principles thinkers, so not necessarily your experience, but how do you approach problems, how do you know the right questions to ask? And then create your own framework around that.\n\n(00:08:32):\nDropbox also hired for people that were just really humble, collaborative and team oriented. And the combination of those two things, people that were just first principle thinkers also just really collaborative to tons of innovation. And so when you think about freemium product led growth, even we created a high velocity sales motion there, there was just so much innovation because you had these folks that just knew how to solve problems and worked really well cross-functionally across product growth, sales, et cetera.\n\n(00:09:04):\nAnd also, broadly speaking, the company just infused the topic of hiring and recruiting into the culture. It was something that as I was there, everyone knew we were all going to be spending a ton of time interviewing. We all were trained on how to sell Dropbox and how to sell the roles we were recruiting for too so that we could close top talent. So I think that's something we definitely got and I learned a ton about. The other thing was the importance of execution.\n\n(00:09:28):\nSo a lot of times at Dropbox we would try something and it didn't work the first time around and it was easy to be maybe say that just doesn't work for us, like growth. We actually had tried to do some growth experiments back in 2013 and they didn't find much traction, but what we found is the devil, I like to say the devils and the details and the devils and how you execute. And so coming back to how do we execute just a little bit differently and some of the learnings there where I think the first time we started growth, we could have been more user-centric and been a lot more hypothesis driven. We were following a lot of best practices that just didn't really apply to Dropbox.\n\n(00:10:04):\nAnd so the way that you execute ends up really mattering. That was the second learning. The third is just focus. I think you alluded to this, I think the blessing and the curse of early success is that you can get pulled in so many different directions and Dropbox had a consumer business, a B2B business, and I think we could have clarified what is our point of view on what the overall motion should look like, how do we blend and think about the journey from consumer to B2B really early on, and I think a learning was that we just started our sales motion and our enterprise a little bit later than we should have and a lot of competition caught up to us.\n\n(00:10:44):\nAnd then finally, I think the fourth one that I really believe in is how do you engage the whole company in thinking about go-to-market growth and revenue. Back in 2013, in tech growth was kind of like this dirty word and revenue was a dirty word, and so we were like, \"Oh, a good product should sell itself. And it wasn't until our self-serve business started to slow down that we started our team because we realized there's a ton of opportunity in just optimizing the experience.\n\n(00:11:10):\nAnd because we started a bit later, it always felt like growth was a layer on top of product. I think the best way to execute is just to have that be front and center from the start. What is our go-to market strategy? How are we thinking about monetization and having that infused into how you think about product development? And that's something both JZ who leads product at Webflow and myself been really intentional as we've thought of the collaboration across product and growth. So that was definitely a learning. So I guess the four things there are just the importance of hiring, execution. Think about your go-to market early on and then how do you engage the whole company on thinking about go-to market and growth.\n\nLenny (00:11:50):\nYou said Dropbox essentially there was a late investment in sales and there's a sense maybe product led growth's going to take us really far. And I imagine look at Jira and Atlassian, they're just all product led and that's amazing. I guess what's your current framework for when it makes sense to start leaning into sales and hiring a sales team for say a product led product that is working?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:12:12):\nIt really comes down to the product because initially I think most companies are leaning heavier into sales or heavier into product-led. You're usually not doing both at the same time. And so a trend I've seen is starting product-led first and the signal is that is a good motion for you is if the product is really intuitive to onboard onto. There's a low learning curve so you don't need a human to onboard the user. Also, if there's a viral component to it, that is really what can take.\n\n(00:12:43):\nDropbox is massively viral. When I think also about Miro or Figma, those also are very viral products. Those have a kind of the DNA of product led. And initially I think when you have scale, you're getting a lot of signal on what is resonating with the user. Initially, you also don't have ... It takes a while to build out the features for enterprise. And so as you're building out the product-led motion, you have probably larger companies in your self-serve base and they are often knocking on your door.\n\n(00:13:15):\nThis happened at Dropbox being like, \"I need you to build SSO for me. I need you to build all these enterprise grade features. It's not secure enough.\" And so you are also collecting the list of things you need to build on the enterprise side. And so I think it's typically looking like you might start product-led, then go enterprise. And then the other direction I've seen is some companies initially are just more conducive to an enterprise in sales motion. Potentially, you need to build custom things for these users. It's also not a bottom-up motion. Maybe the way you sell the product starts with the legal team or the finance team or some important stakeholder, but then a lot of companies now are trying to make that shift to make the product more accessible and go product led.\n\n(00:13:56):\nAnd so then you're thinking about, okay, how do I make this product simpler to onboard onto? How do I think about reaching the end user at scale? And so I think it's basically first figuring out where do you start and then starting to invest in the area. And I guess maybe lastly, knowing how the whole picture fits together. There's a lot of companies that do consumer and B2B and I think the earlier you can figure out how they go together and what the paths and journeys look like, it just ends up being more seamless to the user and, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:30):\nAwesome. Okay, so let me start to transition into talking about building awesome teams and high performing teams. And something that I know about you that I've heard from other people is that you have this reputation for being a person that people follow from company to company, which is the ultimate sign of, I don't know, retention and NPS and product market fit as a leader and a manager. So I'm just curious, what is it that you think you do that gets people to follow you from company to company?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:14:57):\nI've been really fortunate. I've worked with a few folks from my early Dropbox team that I've known for 10 years now, like a couple of times. In some case, three times. And I always feel so privileged that I get the opportunity to work with them again and they have that trust and confidence in me. I think what it is, and it took me time to develop this, is I have a very people focused approach to how I lead and manage. I really think the core of it is deeply caring about people, building that trust, investing in their career development, helping them figure out where they want to go in their career. I think for me it's very personal. I have been really fortunate to have great mentors and managers that helped me in those respects. And so it really started from just paying it forward and wanting to do the same thing for other people that were on my team. I think it just comes down to deeply caring and everything, all your actions follow through from there. So that's how I would describe that.\n\nLenny (00:15:55):\nSome people may be hearing that and feel like there's this choice you have to make as a leader deeply care about the person or drive impact, focus on getting the work done. Do you find that those can coexist or is it this kind of two ends of a spectrum and maybe the question's just like how do you do both? How do you help people yes, achieve and drive impact while also feeling like you really care about them?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:16:15):\nI don't think that they're mutually exclusive of each other because I think the other thing that I really emphasize on my team is being very results oriented. So as a growth leader, for better or for worse, everything you do is very measurable. And so I actually think this is why a lot of folks on my team, something that they actually appreciate is knowing what success looks like and knowing how they'll be measured. And I actually create a very results-oriented culture on the team where it's clear what our goals are, we break it down into the individual levers, it's clear how success is measured for each individual.\n\n(00:16:54):\nAnd so I don't think they are mutually exclusive. And then my role as a leader is also supporting their career growth, helping them meet those goals and giving them feedback along the way. So even though they might sound like two different things, I actually think they can coexist and for me, I actually really lean into both.\n\nLenny (00:17:15):\nWhat's an example of caring deeply about someone and being that kind of leader? People may be listening and are like, \"Oh yeah, I care a lot about my reports.\" But what are some examples of what that means to you that maybe would surprise people?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:17:27):\nI think an example from someone that they joined my team and I just early on thought that they weren't maybe moving quickly enough and they needed some more direction. And so really early into them joining the company, that was about two or three weeks in, I actually pulled them aside and I said, \"Hey, we need to move a lot faster. This is where we need to get to by X. We're a growth team. We need to prove wins out early. This is how I think we should do it. Let's try to create a roadmap, a list of problems to solve, et cetera, hypotheses.\" And they don't have to be right, but just getting something out there, starting to line the whole team on what those are and then defining how we're going to measure success and know we're in the right path. We just need to get there as quickly as we can.\n\n(00:18:14):\nAnd so I gave them that feedback and afterwards, ever since then they have been just on a tear and they actually have mentioned that in later conversations a year into working together that they were so grateful that I had that conversation with them and that I took the time to tell them those things. I think sometimes as a manager it can maybe, you want to avoid the uncomfortable conversations, but I actually think the more direct you can be but also saying this is my intention. My intention is to set you up for success. That goes really far and I think that's a great example of how do you deeply care about somebody and give them direct feedback and you're giving them direct feedback because you deeply care and you also believe that they can do things differently. I think the only reason you would give that feedback is because they can do things differently and you just want to help support them.\n\nLenny (00:19:10):\nIn that conversation. What is it that you did that made them feel like you really cared about them? Because when I hear you describe it's like you're just telling them, you're giving them feedback just like, \"Hey, you need to do a lot better at this. We need to actually hit our goals.\" What was it that made them feel like, \"Oh, she really wants me to succeed?\"\n\nMelissa Tan (00:19:22):\nI think in that conversation what's important is also saying, \"I believe you can do all these things and I'm doing this to support you.\" Or, \"I'm sharing this feedback because I believe in you.\" Also saying that I'm here as support, as you are building that out, let me know what I can do to support you. We can jam on it together if it's helpful. Basically, I guess boil it down to one, restating your intention and why you are having that conversation to sharing that you are there to support them and offering your own help as well.\n\n(00:19:59):\nThose I think are the things that go along well. And I think the third thing is as you give someone feedback, it should never sound like finger pointing or criticizing. It's really just, \"Hey, this is what I observed, this is the impact that it had and here is a different way.\" And so keeping the feedback really about the work itself and the specific things that you think can be improved.\n\nLenny (00:20:28):\nI know you're also a big fan of developing talent internally versus hiring experts from the outside and it's always this decision I think as a leader and as a company. How much do you invest in developing people knowing they can leave anytime, knowing that that's going to take all this time and work? What have you found from and just learned about the advantages maybe of spending time in developing people and helping them progress and just why is that something you find really important?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:20:55):\nI'll start with the why behind developing people. For me personally, it comes from like I'm personally passionate about it just because I feel that a lot of folks invested in me personally when I started out in the working world, I actually struggled quite a lot. I think making the transition from school where it's really clear what success looks like, you're just studying, getting good grades. To work where things are much more ambiguous was a really big transition for me and I really benefited from so many mentors that invested in me that I kept in touch with over the years that have also just helped me with my careers.\n\n(00:21:30):\nTwo that really stand out are from Dropbox, Oliver Jay who goes by OJ and GC Lionetti. So it really has come from a very personal place for me. Secondly, I think it's just makes a lot of sense as you're scaling a company that as you are growing, it just is a smoother transition that the folks on your team can grow with you. People will build institutional knowledge and people talk a lot about founder intuition and that intuition that founders just have. I actually think that extends to early employees too, that have built a ton of context on the user on how to get things done at the company. So the more that you develop talent within the company, the smoother transition is versus bringing someone from the outside where there's just a lot of different factors and there's risk there. And so it really comes from a personal place, but also it makes a lot of sense from just like de-risking the situation as you're scaling.\n\nLenny (00:22:27):\nIn my personal career I had the biggest inflection point and the most progress I made as a product manager was one manager who just did exactly what you're describing, where you invested really deeply in helping me become a better PM and it was not easy. It was just very critical of all the things I wasn't doing perfectly. And I always think about people don't sometimes have someone like that in their career. They don't have a manager like Melissa. Do you have any advice for people that are looking for someone like that or they're just like, \"Man, I have no one around me that's really helping me develop?\" What do you suggest they do?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:22:58):\nAs you are looking for a job, I actually do think you should look to work with people that have that reputation and that you can see that interest that they enjoy mentoring people. They have a track record of developing people. Maybe they have brought other people they've worked with at the company from other companies. Those are good signals that that's something that that person cares about. And even in the interview process, kind of interviewing your manager too and understanding what is their management philosophy, how do they think about your career path in that role? Those are things I would look for.\n\n(00:23:32):\nThe second thing too is as you're interviewing, looking for a manager who especially your success will be tied to their success, this is actually what happened. I mean it's not like you need to be super strategic about that, but when I reflect back at times when I got closest to people was when I was one of the most critical people on their team and they really needed me to be successful and so they also just would spend a ton more time with me.\n\n(00:23:58):\nSo really looking for those opportunities and being really selective in the types of roles you're taking. I also think there have been times for me personally where I've built relationships with someone that wasn't my direct manager that worked at the same company. And this actually has happened a lot at other companies I've worked with where someone knows that it's a passion of mine to mentor people. And so they proactively reach out to me, ask me for advice, ask me, \"Hey, can we set up a monthly recurring sync?\"\n\n(00:24:25):\nAnd so I also think you can look for other people at the company that you work with. And then finally the other thing is looking for external advisors. I actually, in my advising end up mentoring a lot of the people that I work with too. It just organically ends up happening. And so I would say summarize that as just look for the people that you think have this passion, build that relationship with them. And ideally I think you actually build the strongest when you are working together. You just learn so much about each other, but if you don't have that set up, I think there's other ways to just proactively look for mentorship and guidance.\n\nLenny (00:25:00):\nAny tips on the questions? Maybe to ask a manager to help them get to this, if any come to mind and also when you're looking for someone to help you, anything specific you think that people should look for that maybe they may not be thinking about?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:25:13):\nOn the questions to ask when you're interviewing for a role, I would actually ask things like I'd love to get a sense for how you think about ... I mean I think you can flat out ask, I'd like to get a sense of how you think about managing folks on your team, how you think about developing talent on your team and seeing what their responses to that. I would also ask how are you thinking about the career path for this role? And if the person has not thought about it at all or doesn't ask you, \"Well, what is important to you?\" I think those are some signals that it's maybe not where this person tends to spend their time thinking. And then I would also ask other people on the panel that are not going to be your manager but that work with this person, especially if you happen to talk to people that they manage, how is this person as a manager? And that ends up being also very insightful.\n\n(00:26:08):\nThe questions I would ask if you're looking for someone external, I always find that that relationship is best the more organic it could be. I think Cheryl Sandberg had wrote this in her book Lean She basically writes about how some people will go, \"Will you be my mentor?\" And I've got that question too, and it's just a lot of pressure to get asked that question really early in and you don't really know the person. And so the more it can be organic where you talk to somebody, you have actual advice that you want, some people will just reach out to me that I haven't worked with in a long time and like, \"Hey, I'm thinking about a career decision or I'm in this tricky situation at work, can we talk?\" And I just give them advice and they will reach out to me for advice occasionally.\n\n(00:26:57):\nIt doesn't have to be a recurring thing that you have to just nurture that relationship. I think that is a way to do it. Or if you are working with somebody and you want to set up some type of monthly thing, I think you asked for that as well. The only thing is I would just be respectful of the time. So if you don't have anything to talk about that month or anything like that, I'm just always willing to help people. It doesn't mean we have to be frequently in touch. And so I think it's also less about being frequently in touch and it's just going and reaching out when you actually have a problem. People that want to help others are just going to, if they have the time, they'll say yes.\n\nLenny (00:27:30):\nTim Ferriss talks about that too. He is like, \"Never ask someone to be your mentor.\" As you said, that's a scary proposition. You're committing to something, it's pressure versus just like, \"Hey, can we just meet and can I just get some advice? And then maybe after you do that, can we meet next month also?\" And just help it grow organically.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:27:48):\nYeah, definitely.\n\nLenny (00:27:50):\nI want to talk about how you develop talent and what you've learned there. But before that, I wanted to zoom out maybe first and talk about ingredients of high performance teams. So before I ask that question, can you just list the companies you work with, some of the companies you've worked with?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:28:03):\nI guess I've mentioned Dropbox. So Dropbox was my first high growth tech startup. And then after Dropbox I did a lot of advising. So I got to work with Typeform in Barcelona and then someone at Typeform introduced me to Canva. So I met Canva when they were still about 200 people in their early growth journey. Have worked with Grammarly, Miro and then I joined Webflow. And so have been fortunate to be part of a ton of, I guess what I would think are high performing teams.\n\nLenny (00:28:33):\n100%. That's an incredible roster. So here's the question. What are some of the most common ingredients you've seen across these teams, which from an outsider's perspective seem quite high performing?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:28:46):\nI think it first starts with the team having a really clear goals. They need to know what success looks like. And often I think that's for growth teams in particular, it's always really clear, \"Hey, we need to hit certain metrics. We have certain goals for the quarter and for the year.\" And then also having a mission. So the mission's all about the why, right? So an example at Webflow is we have our growth team gold on ultimately the North Star is ARR, Annual Recurring Revenue. And then you break it down into the levers that drive ARR, the leading indicator, so that could be activation rates, the number of customers you bring in, et cetera. And so each team has really clear goals. And then we have our mission. The why. Our mission, the why we do it is we want to build these delightful experiences for our users. We want to support them on their journey on the product.\n\n(00:29:35):\nAnd the reason why the what is monetization is that's just a good signal that people find your product valuable, especially if they're consistently paying you and they're retaining. And then the other thing that I think is important is culture. So how are you going to do these things? When thinking about culture, obviously it depends on the function and the culture you want to set there. For me personally, the type of culture I try to set for the team is one around being really results oriented.\n\n(00:30:03):\nSo something that someone on my team was saying the other day is you always make it really clear that we're going to be measured on impact and that's like how we are ultimately measured as a team. And so really creating that results oriented team. Also, a team that's very team first and collaborative. I think when you have very clear goals, when it's very results-oriented, you could potentially be in a situation where people feel they're competing against each other and you just don't want that. You actually want folks on the team to help each other out to share learnings.\n\n(00:30:33):\nI think that's what ends up being like a situation where one plus one equals three. You're not locally optimizing but you're thinking broader about the team and thinking beyond yourself. The third thing is really this ownership mentality. Something I directly saw at Dropbox is when we were a smaller company, everyone just felt a lot more ownership in accountability because there's just nobody else. You're wearing five different hats. You have to do it.\n\n(00:30:57):\nAs you scale, it's really easy to suddenly feel like that ownership is diluted. And so something I always try to keep in the team, it's a feeling that we're owners and that really proactive mindset of how am I going to solve this problem? I'm blocked by this team, what am I going to do about it? And just being people that have strong sense of agency. And then lastly having fun. I think that especially in high pressured environments, easy to get stressed and all that stuff. And at the end of the day, this is very personal me, but the more fun you can have, the better everything is. And so just making sure you're infusing fun along the way and you're not taking things too seriously.\n\nLenny (00:31:38):\nSo I was taking notes as you were talking and there's kind of these four items just to summarize. One is creating a culture of impact and performance. Two is being team first and making about the team versus the person. Three is creating a sense of ownership and making people feel like they're owners and then having fun, which I love. A question I have there is say within the ownership bucket of creating a sense of ownership, what do you actually do to create that sense amongst the team?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:32:04):\nI think it first starts with defining the scope that everyone is going to own and drive. So as you are setting up the team, it's important that each person on the team has scope that they can run independently and that they are excited to own and drive. So one example here is as I was leaving Dropbox, the finance team looked at our metrics and saw that each growth PM was bringing over a million in AR per year just from all the experiments.\n\nLenny (00:32:31):\nHoly moly.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:32:31):\nYeah. And so that's quite a lot of impact. And being a finance team, they said logically we should just double the team. If each person brings in more than a million, if we want to double the AR, let's just double the team. And so I actually pushed back significantly though. I thought to myself, \"If we double the team, what is everyone on the team going to own and drive? Is it like we split up different parts of the website, different parts of the product 1:00 PM owns just like the checkout flow.\n\n(00:32:57):\nI didn't think that was going to be interesting enough for the team and going to help us recruit people that were excited to solve such small parts of the growth problem. And so really thinking about how do you carve out scope and if you are a growth team, maybe thinking about splitting up by problems to solve that are really meaty by areas of the funnel like activation, monetization, et cetera. So first starting out with carving out good scope. And then the second thing is just infusing a culture of thinking like an owner. This infusing of the culture, I think it comes out in a few ways. One is, and this is really common in growth. Growth is so cross-functional that you often will end up feeling like you're blocked by other teams.\n\n(00:33:38):\nLet's say we want to run an experiment on this part of the product, maybe it's a core PM that kind of owns that service area that doesn't want to drive that thing or let's say or blocked by a bottleneck on designer engineering. It's something where I think if you're thinking an owner, you are not feeling easily disempowered because you can't do something and instead you're thinking, \"What is everything I can do and did I exhaust all the options?\"\n\n(00:34:05):\nAnd then finally it's leading by example. I try to also show to my team that I'm always thinking like an owner and then I'm always trying to do everything I can. And finally as a leader, thinking like an owner also means taking responsibility for your team. And so if things don't go right in my team, I'm the first one to say that ultimately I'm responsible and it's a failure or oversight on my side. And so that is what I think an ownership mentality is. It's just really thinking about the scope, creating that culture and then as a leader it's just seeing yourself as ultimately being accountable.\n\nLenny (00:34:37):\nAwesome. And this connects to something else I wanted to pull the thread on, which is the team first bucket. I think about Meta, not to throw them under the bus or anything, but I feel like everyone I know at Meta their performance review is very tied to their impact. It's very impact driven and that leads to people needing to drive impact themselves. I drove this impact and they look at how much did you contribute to that impact versus other people on your team. And it creates some challenges I think for people. How do you create that feeling of team first, even though your performance as you talked about is so tied to here's your success metric, here's what success means for you, for the team, how do you make it feel team first versus like, I need to do this myself?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:35:17):\nThere's definitely a delicate balance here. It comes down to the way that I think the manager leads the team and sets the tone. And so for me, I always make it clear that even though results are important, it's a team sport. And so I often find that I am encouraging the team to work together. So again, as a leader, you have context in everything happening. So sometimes I know 1:00 PM is working on something or even a PM outside our team is working on something and I try to actually fill in context if I think someone on my team could contribute. And I encourage that action even though it doesn't maybe feed into impact on the thing they're driving. So it really comes down to the culture that you set and what you encourage the team to do. I also think the more that you can see that you actually benefit from helping each other out, the better it is.\n\n(00:36:15):\nAnd finally, I think again, leading by example, because I actually am very team first, I'm often actually helping other teams and doing things that might not ultimately benefit or be part of my scope. A good example here is I was actually driving pricing and packaging at Webflow for a very long time just because no one at the company was driving it and it was a huge opportunity area and I actually was doing it for enterprise pricing too. And so even though I am overseeing self-serve, I was actually supporting enterprise pricing and packaging. And so I also showed to my team, \"Hey, I'm also doing all these things to help the company.\" And I think that is what helps set that tone and that culture.\n\nLenny (00:36:55):\nHow do you then avoid doing too much work? I think there's also this challenge of people being too good at too many things and then they end up doing so many things and then they burn out. Do you have any rules of thumb or lessons there?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:37:06):\nI think for me it's been a learning journey too. I've actually gotten feedback on that very thing for my team that Melissa sometimes taking on too much or trying to do too much. And so I think it's a delicate balance. If we're talking about that person individually, you have to know what your limits are and you also can do things in spurts, but it's important to know ultimately what you can take on. Also I find that putting a specific timeline like, \"Hey, I'm going to do this thing for a quarter, but after that we really need to find somebody else to do it.\" Or hand it off is really helpful. It's definitely a delicate balance. I do think it's a great question because I think that's a common thing people early in their careers struggle with, which is they could lose focus because they're trying to help everybody.\n\n(00:37:49):\nThat was actually a problem I had when I first joined Dropbox is I was the only sales ops person, so I was just helping every sales leader with their metrics and very focused. And so it is a little bit of trial and error. I think the most important thing is to not be so overly focused on just what you're doing and try to help others, but then knowing that there are certain things that just can't drop. And if you start to see things that are starting to drop that you're ultimately responsible for, that's a signal that you're taking on too much.\n\nLenny (00:38:18):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\n(00:38:45):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage, Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead use your North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:39:25):\nLet's come back to the developing talent bucket. I would kind of went on a tangent, but I want to come back to that. So we talked about why you're excited about developing talent, the benefits you've experienced. I'm curious what you actually do to help people become better product managers, leaders of all kinds. What actually have you seen works?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:39:42):\nIn terms of developing talent, I think of this as stages of the life cycle of your relationship, right? So I think at first actually starts is a very meta as a growth person starts with when you hire somebody, really making sure you're finding somebody that is a good fit for the role. It's a good mutual fit. I also tend to look for folks that have a growth mindset.\n\n(00:40:06):\nThere're people that are wanting to learn. They're looking for feedback. They take feedback well. And then after that they join the company, and as a manager, my job is to help set them up for success. So how do I ramp them up as quickly as possible, connect them to the right people, the company? How do I also make sure it's clear what success looks like in their first 90 days? And then how do I help them secure early wins essentially?\n\n(00:40:32):\nSo I often will suggest, \"Hey, you should do this presentation. It's a great way to get visibility early in your journey here.\" Here are some things where there's low hanging fruit or even rotting fruit that you should take on into secure early wins. Then in your journey, I think it's a lot about just giving feedback along the way, making sure you give visibility. One recent hack I have is having folks on the team create looms that they can share with different leaders at Webflow. It's hard to sometimes get visibility and get live meeting calendars, but if you create a five or 10 minute-loom on something you did. That's just a great way to get visibility.\n\n(00:41:10):\nAnd then finally, I think it's that lifelong relationship actually. So I'm still in touch with a lot of people that I've managed and I've helped them. Whether it's looking for their new job or they have career advice, I always make myself available. And so it's actually that lifelong journey of just developing that person. And at some point it's not even developing that person, but it's having a friendship with somebody. And I feel like I've learned a ton from people that I have managed. And so it ends up being this really great thing where you initially started working together but you now know each other so well. And I think that's even how I've developed as a manager is just getting feedback from my team.\n\nLenny (00:41:51):\nThis all comes back to something you mentioned a couple of times earlier, just caring a lot about the person that you work with. Your approach also reminds me of this book, Radical Candor. I imagine you're a fan and that's kind of the way you think about it.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:42:03):\nYeah, definitely. Interestingly enough, Kim Scott was at Dropbox for a short period of time, so when I joined Dropbox, she was actually on my interview panel and we overlapped for three months and she actually workshopped that book with our team before she published it. And that always resonated with me. And I remember her saying you have to ... I forget the exact words, but it's essentially be direct but deeply care.\n\nLenny (00:42:30):\nYeah. Care deeply, but something directly challenged directly. Something like that.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:42:36):\nYeah, care deeply but challenge directly and that has always been something that is something I try to infuse and has really inspired me as leader.\n\nLenny (00:42:43):\nAwesome. We're going to link to that book if folks don't know about it. I love it. You talked about hiring PMs and how that is important in building high performing teams. So let's spend a little time there, maybe just two questions all throughout and you can approach them however you want. One is just what do you look for when you're hiring product managers? You've hired a lot of PMs. You've managed a lot of PMs over the years. What do you look for, especially things that maybe other people don't focus on enough, and then just what is your interview process? What do you find is most helpful for interviewing process-wise?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:43:13):\nIn terms of what I look for, I think there's this kind of known list of things that you probably want to look for, for a PM that I probably are not going to ... I'm say anything groundbreaking here, but obviously communication skills, the ability to manage stakeholders and work well cross-functionally. The things that I lean especially heavy on in my interview process is this concept of first principles thinking or strong critical thinking. So usually there's some live problem solving component to my interview process where I really lean more heavily into how would you approach X problem? And then I dig into the Y and try to understand why would they approach it this way, see what questions they're asking and just see how they approach problem solving.\n\n(00:43:55):\nAnd then the other thing that I look for that I mentioned is that growth mindset. So really seeing how does this person take feedback. And so I'll actually sometimes give feedback to candidates through the process. Something that I do that I learned a few years ago that was super helpful, so I always have a presentation component to the interview process that checks for prepared thinking communication. And I recommend a prep call between the two of us before that presentation. And I actually will give feedback on the presentation.\n\n(00:44:26):\nAnd what this gives me signal is what is it actually going to be like to work together? And then I see how they incorporate it into the final product and that is always really interesting and sometimes it's the biggest signal to what it's going to be like to work with this person.\n\nLenny (00:44:39):\nOkay, this is great. I want to spend a little time here. So what is the actual sequence that you recommend or you use for interviewing? There's a presentation, there's a rep call but also is kind of involved in that.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:44:49):\nUsually hiring manager screen, and I actually do the live problem solving at this screen. I actually think it weeds out the most people. And there's actually two things I do here. One is a live problem solving. How would you approach X? So let's say I'm hiring for pricing at Webflow, I would ask, \"How would you approach pricing?\" I sometimes would say, \"Hey, do you have your laptop? Can you pull up our pricing page? Curious to get your thoughts, what would you want to change?\" That was a trick I learned at Dropbox where we would actually pull up the Dropbox website and be like, \"Hey, what'd you want to test here? Why?\" And you get a ton of signal on how they approach the problem, how they think.\n\n(00:45:25):\nI ask why a bunch. And then the next screen is talking to more folks at the team that test for different competencies. And depending on what you're hiring for, we just have each person focused on a different competency. And it also depends on the roles. So some roles are more technical, some require working more closely with different stakeholders, so you want to make sure you can test those things. And then the final round is the presentation and then also maybe a conversation on other areas.\n\n(00:45:52):\nWe want that kind of come through the interview process. We want to dig in further. The presentation is usually thinking through how you'd approach, your collecting all this information on the company or the problem throughout the interview process. And so it culminates in what do you think this should look like or maybe what would you want to do in your first 90 days? It depends on the role, but it's usually some type of presentation about the problem you would be working on at the company.\n\n(00:46:18):\nBefore that, we have that preparation call with me where often candidates will have questions like, \"Oh, I need to know this data,\" or \"I'm curious about X.\" And so it's really just a call to help them. And then at this stage too, they'll often have the actual draft of the presentation and so we'll go through it together and I'll actually be like, \"Hey, I think you should lean in heavier here. How would you think about this?\" I'll even say for example, at Webflow I'll be like, \"We're thinking about X, Y, Z thing just so you know. And maybe incorporating that into your presentation would be really helpful.\n\n(00:46:50):\nAnd so that's where I get a lot of signal of what is it going to be like to work with this person on a presentation? And then I'll see in the presentation whether they incorporate it or not or how they did. And sometimes I've seen candidates that didn't incorporate any of it and I kind of am like, \"Okay, this is probably not a fit.\" And actually I think that other thing about that call is it helps just set the candidate up for success. It's actually quite a lot of work to create a presentation. The more we can help them by giving them information, making sure they can be successful, it's helpful. And I think guess lastly, it gives them a taste of what it's like to work with me.\n\nLenny (00:47:26):\nI've never heard of that step before. That is really interesting. They actually give them feedback before they present. I imagine they're like, \"What the hell is going on here?\" I thought I was trying to show them what I can do, not like they're going to help me do a great job. That is really interesting. Maybe two very logistical questions there. How much time do you give them to work on this presentation? And then two, you said that you asked some questions related to the actual problem solving versus a theoretical problem. So those are the two questions, I guess.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:47:52):\nTypically we will schedule it about a week in advance. They have a week. The tricky thing here is obviously it's a big ask to ask someone to create a presentation. And so if it's one week that's long enough to create it, but it's short enough that you don't spend tons of time. The other thing is just making it clear, don't exceed more than X number of slides. In Webflow's case we've done, don't exceed more than 30 slides. And that's like quite a lot. We do not expect you to do 30 slides. And then the other thing I make sure to emphasize is it's really about wanting to know how you'd approach it. So don't worry about the slides, be able to talk to it and have what you need to talk to it because we're actually just looking for the substance. And so that's how much time we give them and it's usually a 30-minute presentation with 15-minute Q&A.\n\n(00:48:42):\nThe second part of your question was, so in terms of picking the topic, so there's a few ways to think about it. I know some folks will be like, \"Oh, we have candidates present on something they've worked with in the past.\" I've tried that form and it's really difficult because I found that candidates even sometimes spend tons of time sharing the context of that company. And then also it doesn't really give a sense of, because as you're interviewing from a role, you're getting a ton of context on the actual company and the problem. And so it also is testing for how much did they pick up along the way. Also, would they like working on this area once they join? So there are some candidates that sometimes are concerned about the amount of time they would spend on it or say, \"This is going to be a big lift.\"\n\n(00:49:30):\nAnd definitely mindful of that. I think the main thing though is it is actually in the candidate's best interest to kind of understand what they're going to work on and start to understand,\n\nMelissa Tan (00:49:40):\nFor example, there are some candidates that have gone through the far through process and haven't worked in the Webflow product very much. And I always think that's an interesting flag because if you aren't in the product a lot, you're not going to get good context on whether you like it or not. And so I actually think it's almost even in the best interest of the candidate to go much deeper.\n\nLenny (00:49:59):\nI could spend another hour talking about interview strategy, but I want to make sure we have time for the growth team stuff. So let's transition to that. And my first question here is you've worked with a lot of different teams, a lot of different companies on helping them figure out their growth strategy, hiring their growth teams, just kind of figuring out growth. I'm curious what the most common pitfalls and mistakes you've seen across companies trying to figure out growth and build growth teams.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:50:26):\nOne of the most common pitfalls I'd say is not having, and I've alluded to this, not having a sense of the big picture from the start and not being strategic about what your go-to market strategy is going to be. Also, what is your pricing and packaging going to look like? So I wrote actually an article for the YC blog a few years ago with Abby [inaudible 00:50:48] who was on my team at Dropbox about this because I felt like even at Dropbox, I mean it's a great thing. We were haphazardly finding amazing things. We had a freemium consumer product. Then we realized people wanted a Teams product, so we built a Teams product, but we never created that whole blueprint of what should it look like and what are the different connection points across consumer business? What should our model look like? I've also seen companies that maybe weren't intentional enough about pricing from the start, and so thinking about what is the value metric?\n\n(00:51:20):\nAnd then they've already have massive scale and then they're rethinking their pricing. That's actually quite a big headache to actually think about, okay, how do we grandfather users? How do we bring the legacy customers onto our new pricing? And so thinking about your pricing from the start is important thing might go to market from the start is important. The other thing I have seen a lot is just like, again, this goes back to learning from Dropbox is the execution folks taking a class or reading a lot about growth and trying to do the same thing and not really actually starting from first let's look at our data. Let's talk to our customers. What do we think are the biggest hypotheses? And starting your experiments based on your own data and right-sizing the experiment.\n\n(00:52:10):\nI think sometimes teams are experimenting on things that are too small, that aren't going to move the needle because they heard it was really successful company X, but that company X might be a Dropbox where every 0.5% improvement in conversion makes a difference, but if you're early stage doesn't matter and you need to actually think bigger. The other thing is the opposite problem, redoing a whole thing but not having a hypothesis, this was an early mistake I made at Dropbox where I redid the checkout page to something that I thought was better UX, but then I changed so many different components that even when it failed, it was unclear why it failed. So really distilling it to hypotheses.\n\n(00:52:48):\nAnd then the last thing I would say is figuring out what I call the flying formation of how the different growth teams will work with other companies. And again, I alluded to this, but growth shouldn't feel like it's a layer on top. And a lot of the things that are tricky early on is figuring out how you work with other teams. I think the best or the ideal way to work is to have growth infuse in the company. And so an example here is often the growth team is going to be potentially the closest to the user.\n\n(00:53:21):\nThey're going to get a lot of feedback. They're going to hear directly from the user. As a growth team, I think one of the big values that we can have is actually giving that feedback back to other teams at the company. And so even as a growth team, can we help inform the product roadmap? Also on the reverse, thinking about as PMs, how can PMs be more growth oriented as well?\n\nLenny (00:53:44):\nI like this term flying formation. I've never heard of this before. What is that exactly again? Is that just how growth is integrated within the company?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:53:51):\nYeah, I guess flying formation essentially, I don't know where it comes from. I guess maybe it's a military term or something. Your finger.\n\nLenny (00:53:59):\nI can say that. Yeah, like the Blue Angels\n\nMelissa Tan (00:54:00):\nWork together?\n\nLenny (00:54:01):\nYeah.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:54:02):\nYeah. I think of flying formation as how do we work together across teams. You also can think of it as a DACI too, driver accountable, contribute informed. I think sometimes when you don't know how you're going to work together, you end up stepping over each other's toes. You're unclear. Who was the decision maker here? Who did we need to work with? At what point in the journey? And so the flying formation, what I think it is, is part of it is a DACI of what are the different roles?\n\nLenny (00:54:32):\nCan you define that actually? Because a lot of people probably won't know that term.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:54:36):\nA DACI is a framework to think about the different roles on the team on a project or an area. So D stands for Driver. This is the person driving the project. A is Accountable, this is the person that's ultimately accountable and is often the final decision maker if there's any open questions. C is Contributor, these are all the different teams that are going to contribute. And then I is informed. These are the people that need to be informed, but they're not directly contributing. They're not a decision maker and part of the project.\n\n(00:55:08):\nAnd so it's a nice simple framework for when you are working across teams and it needs to be clear who is in what role. And the area that tends to be the most confusing can be the accountable and who the decision maker is. It can be easy to have lots of teams and then it's unclear how do we get to a decision ultimately and who should make that decision. And that person should often be the person that has the most context or is ultimately responsible.\n\n(00:55:33):\nAnd so I think the flying formation has this DACI. I often also put operating rhythms in it, so it's clear what is happening at what point. And so we created a flying formation when we were first starting the growth team at Webflow and we were trying to figure out how does product growth work with product, how does product growth work with growth marketing? What are the different cadences that each team has? And so very tactically we put a doc together to say, okay, product growth is accountable for all the metrics downstream of signups. Growth marketing is accountable for signups. They're also driving or have goals around CAC, their customer acquisition costs, and these are the different metrics everyone owns.\n\n(00:56:14):\nWe have a weekly meeting where we look at the metrics together. We also will do updates around the room to talk about initiatives and identify areas we want to work with. And then we also think through quarterly planning where we're each identifying projects that we're driving. There's some projects that we might also work on together. And so it's essentially that meeting cadence that you're going to have the operating rhythms. That's essentially how I think about a flying formation.\n\nLenny (00:56:40):\nI love it. That would make a great blog post. By the way, if you're looking for something to write an example of your actual client formation Webflow, I think people would love that.\n\nMelissa Tan (00:56:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:48):\nOne kind of tangent that I wanted to touch on is there's this trend of product teams owning revenue. Elena talked about this on a recent podcast. You have a perspective on should product growth teams own revenue and have revenue numbers as their goals or not?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:57:04):\nYeah, really it depends on the company and what product growth is driving. I've always, in the companies I was at and actually even the companies I advise, the product growth team owns revenue, so it's not always the case. I've actually seen revenue owned by marketing. So marketing makes sense if it's more top of funnel growth. I've also seen it, this is an interesting one, by finance actually. This is usually early in the company.\n\n(00:57:31):\nSo early at Canva, it was owned by finance and that's because finance had a view on everything happening in the business and would actually be maybe advising other teams on, \"Hey, our conversion rates could improve, we need to do X.\" Or we're not driving signups and customers efficiently, but over time it doesn't really sit in finance. That has evolved and then now sits under the person that is driving product growth in product. So I have seen it more often than not being owned by product. Our team at Dropbox moved a ton actually. We started marketing. We actually then report into the revenue org with sales, and then we finally moved into product because we realized so much of our revenue was that product growth motion happening in the product that we felt it was important that that product team owned revenue.\n\nLenny (00:58:20):\nA lot of the things you're talking about are based in how growth starts at a company. I imagine one of the most common questions you get is, how do I start to invest in growth? How do I hire my first growth person? How do I build a team around them? It's one of the most common questions I get. So let's spend a little time here. What is your advice to founders that are just starting to think about building their initial growth team and how to approach that to look for initially and kind of think about that longer term?\n\nMelissa Tan (00:58:44):\nI get this question a lot as well. I'd say initially when a company's starting out, the goal is getting to product market fit and figuring out who their ideal customer profile is, like their ICP. And at this point, I think everyone at the company should be thinking about growth. They're finding their first few design partners that they will co-create the product with. They're figuring out who is their product resonating with, who is maybe also the decision maker in purchasing the product. And they're figuring out, do we want kind of a bottom up product led motion? Are we going to lean more heavily into sales? Are we going to do both?\n\n(00:59:18):\nAfter you reach product market fit and you're starting to get your first few customers, the first growth per person I see more often than not isn't someone driving acquisition. You need to find your first a thousand or thousands of customers and you need to do it at scale. And so if that is the focus of the company, typically what I would recommend is somebody that they don't need to be an expert, but ideally they understand maybe one or two channels well and that they're the channels that you have hypothesis, you will find traction in.\n\n(00:59:50):\nAnd I see this person a little bit like a portfolio manager, right? Because you're trying to figure out ... Usually companies don't have many channels that are split evenly. They find one or two that really work and make up like it's 80/20 rule. It makes us up 80% of where the signups are coming from and this portfolio manager is testing different things out. Even you could leverage agencies. There are a lot of agencies out there for SEO, for paid marketing, et cetera, but they are smart enough to define, is this working? How do I do it at scale? You also want to make sure it's quality signups that are actually monetizable.\n\n(01:00:24):\nAnd so that is a role typically if you're hiring an acquisition of that first growth person. And then the other two areas to focus early on, but I don't think you need a dedicated person for are activation. You want to make sure as you're pouring leads into the top of funnel, you're activating users. And here I don't think you actually need to do AB testing. Your volume isn't probably going to be strong enough. I think even just finding five individuals that are part of your target audience, just doing user testing, set up a Zoom, watch them onboard onto the product and have them talk out loud. You'll fight a lot and you can also just take best practices of onboarding checklists, et cetera. So activation and then I've said this a lot, but pricing and packaging, really thinking about pricing, but I don't think that needs to be a dedicated person.\n\nLenny (01:01:06):\nWhat kind of profile have you found to be most successful for this sort of person? Some people will look for like, I want to hire Melissa and let's just go big. The best person I can find and have them own this versus someone that's just new from school that's going to figure it out and I guess they're somewhere in the middle. What do you find that's best for that first hire?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:01:26):\nIt really depends on the current makeup of the team. How much do the founders themselves or the current team, how much of an interest do they have in growth? If they have an interest in growth and it's more about finding someone to execute, I think it's finding someone that's a bit earlier in their career potentially that is just a strong first principles thinker. I think there's hit or miss on, I'm a former consultant, so I used to always say find a former consultant. I do think there can be hit or miss and there is some value in folks that actually understand acquisition and have done it before and so maybe have figured out certain channels.\n\n(01:02:04):\nSo I think you either go for someone that's done acquisition before, maybe they're a little bit early in their career, so they have this great growth mindset, but make sure they're a first principles thinker. The other option is find just a really smart person early in their career, have them take up Reforge class, have them soak up everything, and then the other option of hiring someone more experienced. I think it really depends on if you want that person to take on a lot more and be almost part of your founding team. And do you want to find someone that is going to join your leadership team?\n\n(01:02:38):\nThe other option I guess is you could also just bring on an advisor and that advisor is someone that's not full time. It can even guide if you hire someone that's a bit earlier, guide that person and that is a really good combination. And so it really depends on the context, who's also on the current team and who you want to bring into. Are you looking for an actual leader that's going to scale with the company or are you not ready quite yet for that?\n\nLenny (01:03:03):\nWhat about in terms of their skillset? I imagine if you're kind of feeling like paid growth is going to be your main acquisition channel, you probably want to find someone that's really good at that versus it might be a virality, product led growth stuff, then you want to find maybe a product range of person. How much weight do you put into that skillset in that first hire?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:03:24):\nI actually think it's less about expertise in skillset, if that makes sense. And more there a ability to, again, I think of it like a portfolio manager. So this is more on the growth marketing side and bringing in acquisition. They are managing a portfolio and they're trying to figure out what works. I actually think you need to find someone that's analytical for this role, but that also understands things like who is the user? They're really creative in finding the user. And so it's actually looking for attributes but not expertise.\n\n(01:03:58):\nI actually think the more expertise someone has, the more it actually can lead to a false precision and then thinking they know what they're going to do. And especially, I don't think you actually need paid marketing expertise until much later when you're starting to think about incrementality or you're managing all these campaigns. I actually think the expertise is more important later. And then similarly on product growth, I actually think product growth is not higher till much later. A lot of early stage companies don't even have a product manager until later. And so I find that a growth product person isn't until much later down the road.\n\nLenny (01:04:36):\nJust a couple more questions. One is, you mentioned that it sometimes makes sense to bring on an advisor. I know sometimes companies have a bad time with advisors that just don't provide much value and they're giving equity. Other times it's transformative. Some of the stories you've shared, when is it appropriate to hire an advisor and is there any, I guess advice for what to look for in a growth advisor at this early stage, especially?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:05:00):\nI would add an advisor if there is probably a knowledge gap on the team is I would say. And their advisors come in so many different forms too, and everyone does it slightly differently. For some folks, it's a monthly call for other times, especially when I'm full-time advising, I'll have weekly calls. I'll even join some team meetings. I'll look at mocks. And so everyone does it slightly differently. And so I think it depends on what you're looking for. I would definitely say that even getting to know the individual and making sure you're on the same page on what you're looking for and what the goals are. And then what I've done in the past too is initially set up a shorter engagement, like a quarter long engagement and then decide if you want to go longer.\n\n(01:05:47):\nAnd I also think it's fine to, let's say you have an advisor agreement, you're not getting value to basically part ways. If it's not, you're not finding value. I think every advisor wants to make sure they're adding value. So I definitely think to summarize, being really explicit on what advice you're looking for and making sure you're on the same page of what you want. And then also set up a try before you buy if you want to do a quarter long engagement first. And knowing you can always part ways if it's not a fit even before that period of time.\n\nLenny (01:06:20):\nLast question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. You've brought up this concept of first principles thinking. I'm curious how you measure that and how you get a sense of, is this person strong at first principles thinking?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:06:34):\nIt's definitely a word I use a lot. First principles thinking, I think of it as you are not using a set framework and set formula, but you're creating your own based on the context that you're getting. And so when I think about first principles thinking often it is knowing what questions to ask so that you can start forming a mental model. And then it is actually starting to form that mental model and then knowing to evolve it and knowing when it's not working and really coming from a place of curiosity of is this really working? This is something that I'm known for on my team as well, which is I ask tons of questions, but it doesn't come from a place of wanting to show that I'm asking good questions or anything that comes from a place of trying to solve the problem and making sure that we're always solving the problem at hand, making sure we're doing the right things.\n\n(01:07:28):\nIf there's new information, do we actually still want to do it this way? And so I think first principles thinking is often about asking questions and then creating your own framework. That's how I would define it. And it's maybe another way to describe it is critical thinking. It's like you're able to think very critically, and I think it's important to, at least for me, create a culture where that's okay. I think the moment you have a culture where people aren't asking questions aren't constantly revisiting their work, that's when you're not maybe pushing yourself to do your best work. And I think it also just creates a fun environment where we're like, \"Oh yeah, why are we doing this?\" And really leading with your curiosity.\n\nLenny (01:08:06):\nIs there an example of a person or moment or question that comes to mind of this is an epitome of a first principles thinker moment or question or a way of approaching something?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:08:17):\nMy aha moment of the value of first principles thinking was when I was at Dropbox and we had the most unconventional people on our initial sales team. Dropbox was known for this. We would hire a ton of really smart people that had never done sales and had them do sales. There were a lot of disadvantages to that, I think. We were figuring a lot of things out. Maybe we should have split, had a few people that knew sales better and a combo of both. But I do think it led to a ton of innovation. Even I actually started on the sales team, this is a fun fact. I used to answer the 1-800 number at Dropbox, and if you go to Dropbox's website, you see a chat level. I used to also do that role, and so I think that what we got from that was that's how we got our very innovative go-to-market motions.\n\n(01:09:03):\nThat also gave a ton of people, 'cause a lot of those people then moved into different functions at the company. They had all this context on who the user was. They had talked to so many different users at that point, and that's actually what helped me a lot when I moved into growth is I had all that context and I learned from that going back to first principles thinking that if you take people that are just super smart, they've never done it before, one advantage of that is they can innovate because I think they come in with, \"I don't know anything. Let me just figure this out.\" Versus someone that think they know all the answers, limits you into what you are going to do. And so my aha moment was really at Dropbox seeing so many times people that had never done these things and then seeing so much innovation come as a result of that.\n\nLenny (01:09:51):\nThat is an awesome story. Is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on before we get to or very exciting lightning round?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:09:58):\nI think that's it. I wanted to make sure, I know I talked a lot about developing people, so thank all the people that have helped develop me in my career and then especially thank all the folks that I've worked with and my team, especially the team at Webflow and particularly wanted to make sure to thank [Xing Lin 01:10:14], Rory Davidson and [Jo Wang01:10:16] who joined me from previous companies to Webflow.\n\nLenny (01:10:20):\nShoutouts. Well, with that, Melissa, we have reached our very exciting lightning ground. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:10:27):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:10:28):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:10:32):\nThe first one is Leaders Eat Last. I really like that leadership book by Simon Sinek. Also two non-career related books is The Untethered Soul. It really has taught me a lot about being present and then also the Four Agreements, which is a very short and easy read, but good principles to live by.\n\nLenny (01:10:52):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:10:55):\nThis one isn't super recent, but Winning Time on HBO. It's about the LA Lakers during the '80s and the Showtime era. I'm originally from LA and grew up a Lakers fan, so it's a fun watch for me and a nice escape.\n\nLenny (01:11:09):\nYou'll love a new movie I just watched last night called Air, which is about how Nike got Michael Jordan signed. And it's similar vibes to that show.\n\nMelissa Tan (01:11:18):\nYes, yes. I actually just watched that recently too.\n\nLenny (01:11:20):\nOkay. Great.\n\nMelissa Tan (01:11:20):\nThat's a good one too. Yeah, I've watched all those basketball.\n\nLenny (01:11:23):\nOh man. I also grew up in LA. Also a huge Laker fan from-\n\nMelissa Tan (01:11:26):\nOh, nice.\n\nLenny (01:11:27):\nFrom before. Next question, what's a favorite interview question you like to ask?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:11:33):\nFor me, it's not a question, but it's that stage of preparing before the presentation and getting a sense for what it's like to work with each other. I think that has been one of the best ways for me to get signal.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nCan you say more on that?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:11:46):\nYes. So it's essentially that prep call before I ask them to do a presentation and going through the presentation together and working together on refining it.\n\nLenny (01:11:57):\nAwesome. We already talked about that, so we'll move on. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:12:04):\nI feel like everyone's saying this, but ChatGPT. I feel like it has really changed everything. There's so many interesting ways to use it. My team at Webflow right now is also starting to think about incorporating AI into the product, and so yeah, I just think that is ... Yeah, so many things you can do with it.\n\nLenny (01:12:22):\nWhat is something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on the way that your team executes?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:12:30):\nThis one here is what I also spoke about for earlier, which is, I mean, thinking through your DACI. It sounds so simple, but I do think a lot of times teams are thinking through how do they work with other teams? Who is driving? Who is the decision maker? And so having a DACI, I have found is really helpful.\n\nLenny (01:12:52):\nFinal question, you've been at Webflow for a number of years. What is a favorite pro tip for using Webflow?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:12:57):\nYeah, I actually have two if that's okay.\n\nLenny (01:12:59):\nThat's good. Even better [inaudible 01:13:01].\n\nMelissa Tan (01:13:01):\nYeah, yeah. So one is thing that I've often heard from folks is it's hard to learn Webflow. And so basically watching our university videos, which is where we teach Webflow while also building the designer, and we actually now enable to have the videos in the product, so you can do them side by side. And then the other one is our Figma to Webflow plugin, which is you can take a Figma design and then convert it to Webflow, which is a great hack if you already have a design in Figma.\n\nLenny (01:13:32):\nWow, I did not know that existed. That is a really smart idea and feature. Melissa, I could see why people follow you from company to company. I feel like the companies that are going to get to work with you in this new stage of your life are also very lucky. Thank you for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMelissa Tan (01:13:51):\nFolks can find me on LinkedIn, also on Twitter, Melissamtan, and then how can listeners be helpful to me? I mean, I love jamming on things, growth, thinking about leadership and managing, so if any of this resonates, reach out. I'd love to have a discussion and yeah.\n\nLenny (01:14:08):\nAmazing. Melissa, again, thank you for being here.\n\nMelissa Tan (01:14:11):\nYes, thanks so much, Lenny. This was fun.\n\nLenny (01:14:14):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# An inside look at Deel’s unprecedented growth | Meltem Kuran Berkowitz (Head of Growth)\n\n## Transcript\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:00:00):\n... early days, it's very important to just go back to the basics, build the skeleton before you put on the makeup. So the first question I would ask is, do you have a website? Is it fast? Do the search engine knows that it exists? Okay, great. The next step would be, can people find it? If they can't find it, do you need to write content to make sure that people can find it? Only after all of those questions are answered, should you then consider, do I have money? Can I put it behind some paid ads to make sure people come to my website? You can't run a successful paid ads program if you have a website that's loading in four plus seconds. So really going back to the basics and starting from a good experience at the core and then expanding step-by-step from there.\n\nLenny (00:00:47):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Meltem Kuran Berkowitz. Meltem is head of growth at Deel, which is arguably the fastest growing SaaS business of all time, possibly even faster than Ramp, which we delved into in a previous episode. They went from $0 in revenue to a mind-boggling $300 million in revenue in three years, while also staying EBITDA positive.\n\nLenny (00:01:15):\nMeltem has led their growth team from the early days. And today leads all their growth efforts, including paid ads, product marketing, content, community, brand and more. Before joining Deel, she was leading marketing efforts at Bench Accounting. In our conversation, Meltem shares how Deel kick started growth through low-cost growth channels like tapping into communities like Reddit and also content and SEO. She also talks about how she evolved her thinking on growth investments as the company grew. She shares a bunch of tactical advice for how to do SEO well, how to do paid ads well, and how to structure your early growth team and prioritize your early investments. She also shares her experience building a culture of speed and optimism and so much more. Enjoy this episode with Meltem Kuran Berkowitz after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:02:01):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself, go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miro-verse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works.\n\nLenny (00:02:44):\nMiro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:10):\nToday's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered this stuff actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. LMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes. Also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines.\n\nLenny (00:03:52):\nYou can try LMNT totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is Watermelon Salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nMeltem, thank you so much for being here, welcome to the podcast.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:04:26):\nThank you for having me, I'm very excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:28):\nI'm more excited that you're here. So you're head of growth at Deel. For people that aren't familiar with Deel, can you just give us a sense of what does Deel do briefly? And then also can you just share some stats around the trajectory of Deel? It feels like it's been this extraordinary journey, and I'm curious just to hear some of the stats of just how extraordinary.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:04:46):\nYeah, so Deel is payroll, HR, and compliance platform for global teams. So essentially we help companies expand globally with tools like Deel HR, immigration, employer record hiring, independent contractor hiring, payroll, both global and US. So whether you're trying to hire someone as a full-time employee in Japan or you're trying to make sure your contractor in Germany has everything they need on day one, our platform allows you to take care of everything all in one place.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:05:13):\nAnd when I joined Deel, actually that was around July, 2020, we were less than a million dollars in ARR. And then over time, within the first year on January, 2021, we were at $4 million ARR. We finished 2021 with 57 million. April '22, we were looking at a hundred million. And then we started off this year with $295 million in ARR. And what we're particularly proud of is that we've been EBITDA positive. So that's something that we are very, very proud of on top of the ARR growth.\n\nLenny (00:05:48):\nAmazing. And you said that you were super early at Deel. Can you give us a sense of just how early and what that was like?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:05:54):\nI was the second hire to the marketing team, and I was I believe either employee 19 or 20 on the overall Deel team.\n\nLenny (00:06:02):\nWe had the head of product from Ramp on this podcast, and it feels like there's this little bit of which company grew faster early on in the trajectory of the two, but we don't have to debate it. It feels like these are maybe the two fastest growing SaaS businesses in history. Does that sound about right?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:06:16):\nThat's true, yeah. So Ramp was the first one to be crowned the fastest growing, and then we took that crown from them. So I think we're both right, in that at a certain point in time we've each been the fastest growing. But they're amazing.\n\nLenny (00:06:34):\nWhat I want to start with is something that I heard about you, which is that you specialize in cheaper growth channels, and that's actually the reason that Deel ended up hiring you, is they wanted to find ways to grow cheaply. And so a couple of questions. One is just, what did you find worked really well from that perspective at Deel? And then two, what are today's maybe cheaper growth channels that you think people are under investing in? Whatever you're willing to share there, I don't know if you want to give away all your secrets.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:06:56):\nI'm happy to give away all and everything. So I think before we dive into the list of cheap channels, which I will get to, it's very important to notice, especially in the B2B world, most of the businesses are started because there's an active problem. And so when you go out to the market and try to answer people's questions, people don't want to be sold to, they want their problem solved. So those cheaper channels are often places where people are just trying to get an answer to their question. So whether that be search engine optimization through the articles that you write for people, looking onto Reddit where people are asking these questions in communities, forming partnerships with other groups that are trying to answer these questions, existing communities where other business leaders are connecting with each other and looking at their peers to find answers to shared problems that they're having, or places like Quora. That's, when you think about cheap channels, that's a really good place to start, is just add value to people, answer their questions.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:07:54):\nAnd when you answer their questions and present your solution, if it's a fit to what they're looking for, that ends up being a cheap channel for you. You don't necessarily have to advertise, when you go to Reddit and you set up those keywords to be tracking when people ask certain questions, you're not paying any money to do that. You're just seeing, oh, someone has this question, I have the answer to that, here you go. And connecting with them, it takes time. But early on, those were a lot of the things that we invested in.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:08:21):\nAnd I think a lot of people jump that because they think, \"Oh, it's one person here, two people there.\" But when you start helping people, that combined with word of mouth, and guess what, these are digital places, you provide one answer and your answer lives out there for other people to repeatedly refine. As long as we're not talking about a closed Slack community, maybe a conversation happening in DMs. So when I think about cheap channels, I think about where are people asking the questions, that might be Google or that might be Reddit or any other channel, and providing them the answers, so they know that your solution exists.\n\nLenny (00:08:59):\nOkay, this is awesome. So this Reddit example is that, which you actually did, you set alerts for when people have questions about HR hiring internationally I imagine, and then had someone go in there and give them some advice?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:10):\nYes, exactly that's what we did.\n\nLenny (00:09:12):\nWow, I love that.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:12):\nIt's important to notice that if you're looking at a subreddit of about a thousand people, recognize the upper size of this audience, you're not going to win 5,000 businesses through that Reddit community, but you're maybe going to win 10% of the people there that are having this problem. So it's very important when investing in these cheap channels to focus on what's the upper limit of the audience size.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:09:36):\nAnd also I see a lot of people sometimes go blindly into SEO. They're like, \"We're just going to write content,\" which I'm a huge fan of SEO, happy to discuss that later, but if people aren't asking this question to Google, you can write all the content you want, it doesn't matter, nobody's going to find it.\n\nLenny (00:09:52):\nI love this so much, because it connects with something I find again and again, is one of the more effective early growth channels is tapping into an existing community and piggybacking off of what they've already built. Airbnb is a little bit of an example where they went to Craigslist. Actually most people pull people off Craigslist, Uber pull people off Craigslist, Lyft, so many companies just piggybacked off Craigslist and built up their own company.\n\nLenny (00:10:13):\nBut what you said is so important, which is you can't just go into a community and be like, \"Hey, everyone, check out what I've got.\" You need to add value to people and add value to the community, otherwise no one's going to pay attention to you, they're going to kick you out.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:25):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:10:25):\nAnd so I think that is a really important insight is if you're trying to say piggyback off of a community, the most important thing is you need to add value to the community.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:34):\nYeah, be someone people actually want to talk to.\n\nLenny (00:10:37):\nI love that. Is there a tool that you found for that Reddit strategy of just how to know if someone's talking about hiring say internationally?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:10:45):\nI did a very janky assistant setup, I'm not proud of it, but it works. Someone else out there built it and I just plugged in the keywords we were looking for into it.\n\nLenny (00:10:57):\nI know it wasn't just Reddit, and I'm curious what else you found was worth your time, but how did you figure out that's where your potential community and potential users were spending time?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:11:06):\nWell, I think over time Reddit became the place that you go to when you want peer answers, whether that peer is someone right next to you or someone halfway across the world. So it was a very obvious place for me to go to understand, what's top of mind for my audience? But also there are so many subreddits, whether it's founders or HR managers, that people are just asking their community. Because oftentimes they have very specific questions. You can't just ask that to Google because they have one thing that means that they might not be able to qualify for the exact solution that is what's most used out there. So Reddit just became the place over the years for people to ask their specific questions semi-anonymously and get answers from their community, and multiple answers to be able to judge which works better versus didn't. So it was one of the first places that myself and my team went to.\n\nLenny (00:11:58):\nAnd is this something that worked really well, mostly at the beginning to kickstart growth or how early was this? And then how much of your growth would you say came from this sort of strategy early on?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:12:07):\nI believe I set up that little keyword tracking within the first day of me starting my role at Deel. So it was very, very early. And we still do this by the way. We still provide answers across Reddit, Quora communities. We're still out there connecting with people. Over time, of course, it went from maybe being 15% of our funnel to less than 5% of our funnel because the rest of our funnel has grown a lot. But the next number of people that we get to share our solution with through those channels have continued to grow over time.\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nComing back to something I asked that I want to touch on is, in today's world are there any cheaper growth channels that you are excited about? Or is it essentially the same idea? Look for where your potential users are and ideally asking questions that you could help answer? Is that roughly how you think about it still?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:12:58):\nThat is still roughly how I think about it. I would add social channels to that as well. I think Twitter's a great place, people ask questions oftentimes, so there are communities. And when someone has answered that question, other people piggyback off of that. But anywhere where someone is asking a question, I would consider to fall into this category of a cheap channel.\n\nLenny (00:13:17):\nWhat's an example of answering a question in a value-add way versus a maybe less effective way in your experience?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:13:25):\nI would say the least effective way would be, \"Hey, we've solved that problem, check out our website.\" Okay, cool, if you have five seconds, do that. But the value-add way would be explaining what the solution to that problem is. Because the reality is there are a lot of people out there who can probably solve this, and then providing your solution, but answer their question first, and then let them decide if they want to come with you or go with someone else. But the whole point of someone asking a question isn't to be sold a solution. It's like, \"I just need an answer.\" So genuinely treat this person like a friend of yours, answer their question, be like, \"Yes, it's doable. No, it's not doable. Yes, you can do it, but you need to consider X, Y, Z. If you want to learn more about it, you can chat with us.\"\n\nLenny (00:14:04):\nAnd these were people on the team or you answering these questions, it wasn't some automated system?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:14:09):\nIt was never automated. It still isn't today. We would never automate our interactions with people. So early days, it was myself, the other people on my team, our co-founders, which to this day they still do by the way. So it's a lot of people on the team. Every single person on the team has access to these. And whoever is the first person to jump in will flag it. And sometimes you'll see on a Twitter, someone will write a question, there's three people from Deel team has answered. We're like, \"Okay, I think enough of us have provided value here.\"\n\nLenny (00:14:41):\nThat's amazing. And I'm spending a lot of time on this, but this is such an interesting and important tactic that clearly worked to help you all start and it's cheap. And most, at least B2B, companies could probably leverage this. So when people are thinking about where to go, maybe do this, you mentioned Twitter, maybe Reddit, maybe Quora. Is there anything else, just like the sphere of potential places founders can go think about whether maybe people are asking questions they could answer there?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:06):\nYeah, there are a lot of closed communities, so there are still ... they could be Slack communities, Discord, places that founders choose to connect with other founders. Or we have partnerships with places like the Y Combinator, where once you go through a certain program or you qualify to be in the club, whatever that club may be, you get to get access to this community where you can talk to other people. So those are considered closed communities. It's not as easy to gain access to. But if you can find a way to gain access to those communities, they're also great places to be.\n\nLenny (00:15:37):\nAnd then step number one is add value, right?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:40):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:15:40):\nYou can't just get in the community, \"Hey, check out Deel everyone.\"\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:15:42):\nOtherwise you'll just get kicked out. You can try not adding value, you're not going to last very long.\n\nLenny (00:15:47):\nYeah. If you think about the pie chart of how growth happened at Deel early on and then today, what would that roughly look like? What percentage of early growth came through this versus SEO or whatever else worked, and then today? Whatever you can share of where growth comes from.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:16:03):\nToday, roughly about I would say 50% of our growth continues to come from what we would consider non-paid channels, through whether it be partnerships, SEO, these kinds of moderations. So early on that was more close to 80% to 90%. But that number has grown. Again, the net number has grown, but the percentage of the overall value has shrunk because other channels have also grown significantly.\n\nLenny (00:16:29):\nAwesome. Okay. So let's talk about SEO. First of all, how important has that been to the success and growth of Deel? And then also just what have you learned about what is important to get SEO right?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:16:40):\nYeah. So I would say for SEO, the biggest mistake people make is they will just shove keywords. They're like, \"Okay, these are the keywords people are searching for, I need to make sure I mention it five times.\" Obviously do that, make sure that the content that you wrote answers the question. But the main thing to think about it is, is the Google search over? If someone reads your content, if they typed in something to Google, and then they read the article that you've published, are they going back to Google to continue reading more or is the Google search over? Because ultimately that's what the search engines care about is, I want to make sure this person gets their answer quickest way possible.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:17:16):\nSo when you think from that perspective, it's much easier to actually write things that people want to read, and you're not just meandering and going on and on, shoving a bunch of keywords that people are just like, \"I'm bored, I'm bouncing, I'm going somewhere else.\"\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:17:30):\nSo asking that question of, is the search over is a really good place to start, instead of just shoving keywords. And our content team is amazing. I would say they're more of an operational team than they are a creative team. The way they run things, the way they publish the articles, there's a very clear framework that is used to decide what gets published when and what doesn't get published by the same token. So all of those things are very important to consider, instead of just being like, \"Oh, this keyword has 10,000 monthly visitors, I'm just going to write a bunch of things about that.\"\n\nLenny (00:18:02):\nWhat's an example of a page that you wrote that ends people search and gives them what they need?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:18:07):\nA lot of people wonder what an EOR is because that's an employer of record. They tend to be confused about exactly what that is. So we do very well in explaining to people what EOR is and isn't and what its limitations are. Because the first question that you will have after the EOR question's answered is, okay, what's the downside? When do I need to not use it? So for us, that's one of the content pieces that does very well.\n\nLenny (00:18:32):\nI'd love to spend more time on this operational element of the SEO team. Maybe one question is just what is that bar that tells you that it's ready to publish and worth going out versus it's not ready?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:18:42):\nYes. So I can't take credit to this, this is all of our team's work. But we have this framework that we call the traffic light system. Essentially we go, whenever the team is going to do a content series, they will go and find up to 700 keywords. These are keywords that are related to what we do. So they might be closely related, they might be distant related. And then those set of keywords get ranked by highest volume to the lowest volume. So then you have an Excel sheet, keywords on the left, volume on the right. And then you go one by one. This does take time. And then say, what is the intent of someone searching this keyword?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:19:22):\nIs this a university student looking to write an article and they're never going to become our customer? Or is this someone that is actually looking to solve their existing solution and they are going to become our customer? So with that, you get the green light ones, which is the intent is very high, this person wants our solution. The yellow light is intent, could be they are a 50:50, maybe they're looking to buy our solution, maybe it's not soon enough. And then the red is, this person is not looking to buy our solution, they're just doing this search for any other reason. So when you do that, then you go from the greens, highest volume to the lowest volume, yellows, highest volume to the lowest volume, and oftentimes you never get to the reds.\n\nLenny (00:20:03):\nI love that. And then once you have say a keyword, say a green, I guess, it's a green keyword where it's high intent and high volume, what is the process to actually put together an article that works for SEO?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:20:16):\nSo step one is understanding the search intent. Why is someone typing that? What are they trying to understand? And a part of that is going to Google and figuring out, what is Google servicing today? So one of the examples that I always give people of when you type EOR into Google, it doesn't give you employer of record, it gives you enhanced oil recovery, because most of the people typing EOR to Google is looking for that solution.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:20:43):\nNow, if my team blindly went in and said, \"We're going to rank for EOR,\" we're never going to rank for that because that's not what Google gives people because that's not what people have been looking for. So first is understanding, what are people looking for? And creating a content piece that answers those questions. Oftentimes the bottom part of Google where it says, the next questions that you should be asking is a really good place to go to understand, okay, after someone's done with this search, what's the next question that they ask? And the next one and the next one.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:21:11):\nSo figuring out what do people want to get out of this? And then there are a myriad of SEO solutions tools that you can use out there to ensure that the content you've written is in a simple enough language that someone with a fifth grade reading level can understand. That you actually did the right things, you put the right keywords in the right places. I almost think of keywords as like, that's your address, that's how you give Google, please send people my way. So you can use many tools.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:21:38):\nWe use Clearscope, we love it. So those are the tools that you use. And then it gets published. And oftentimes those tools will give you a score to say you're an A plus or you're a C minus, you need to make your language less sophisticated, currently it's at university level and we need it to be at fourth grade reading level.\n\nLenny (00:21:55):\nWhat is the structure of the content team at this point, how many people is it, and what are their rough focuses?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:22:00):\nFun fact about our content team, the person that leads it was one of the earliest employees at Deel, I want to say number two or three. So the person there is just so special to our entire company. And so the structure of the content team for us is, it is led by our director of content. We have one person that is in charge of all of the operations. So that is working with our freelancers, making sure that the briefs are sent out, making sure that the fact checking is done on time, that the articles are published on the website, and tracking and everything, they run the machinery on the backend.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:22:33):\nAnd then we have different people focused on different areas of content because you need to have expertise that you build over time to write properly. So we have one person looking after certain product lines, another person would be focusing on [inaudible 00:22:46] behind different product lines. And very recently we've set out a team for different types of content because content isn't just written article, it's also video, it's also education. There's a lot of different types of content that we want to tap into. So now there's a team that is focused on those new mediums for us.\n\nLenny (00:23:04):\nAwesome. So how many people total full-time that run this operation?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:08):\nRight now the team is about eight people total.\n\nLenny (00:23:11):\nAnd it's like, I don't know if it's exactly 50% of it, something like half of your growth essentially is coming from this team?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:17):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:23:18):\nIs there anything else you found that it's really important or effective for thinking about making SEO work?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:23):\nThe biggest mistake people make is SEO is one of those things that, you can try and automate it, you can do a lot of things that save you time, but it never stops being time-consuming. And to do it well, it is going to be time-consuming. So oftentimes people just get over it or they think it's below them to be going over and doing keyword research and doing all of those things one by one. And that's oftentimes where people lose out is they try to cut corners. And when you cut corners, you just don't create a good quality resource. That's what it comes down to. It's like, is your resource good quality? Yes or no?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:23:55):\nSo when you try to just be like, I want to rank and cut all those corners, your content is not going to be great. Nobody's going to want to read it. And your program is not going to go anywhere. So I think it's one of those things that people as they become more senior think it's below them. And I think that's the biggest mistake.\n\nLenny (00:24:11):\nIt's interesting, and that's exactly the same advice for writing a newsletter, the thing I do. Where if a newsletter isn't working, it usually means the content isn't valuable enough to people. It's such a clear meritocracy of, if it's useful, people will read it, subscribe, share. And if they're not, they won't subscribe. And then Google basically figures that out based on people's behavior.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:24:30):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:24:31):\nTo give people a sense of the operation, how many articles are you putting out a month, a day, a week, whatever you can share there?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:24:38):\nWe used to put out about 10 articles a week, that's net new. Whereas now we are doing more of five new articles and five article updates. Because the type of content we write, regulations change, things change all the time, so we need to make sure that even if something was published two years ago, it's up-to-date. So we have a team that is responsible for continuously fact checking. So we do about five article updates and five net new articles written. And of course we do it across many different languages. So what started off as English only operations is now in other languages as well. So there's no shortage of work to go around.\n\nLenny (00:25:15):\nSomething that I go back and forth on a bit is, if SEO is something every company should be doing and will work for them? And in my experience, there's certain products that are really good for SEO, especially if there's user generated content or there's just a bunch of data like say Yelp or Glassdoor, where they can generate tons of pages in all these different ways. Do you have an opinion on what sort of business and company is best suited for SEO? Or is your feeling everyone should probably be doing SEO in some form? And even if it's not a huge part of your growth strategy, it'll help.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:25:47):\nI don't think everybody should be doing SEO. I think if you are in a space where people are looking for a solution, you should be doing SEO. But if you are a direct to consumer company selling people lipstick, which I'm a huge buyer of, you probably shouldn't invest in SEO all that much because people don't go to Google for that. They go to Instagram, they go to influencers. And even if someone types in the best lipstick of 2023, chances of your website ranking, because you're not a third party objective comparing to other people, is very low. So it really depends on the solution. But if you are in a space which most B2B products tend to be, that you're solving an active problem very specifically, then I would say SEO is a good idea. If you're a consumer good, maybe a little bit less effort should be put towards it.\n\nLenny (00:26:39):\nMakes a lot of sense. Going back to the early days, you were hired as head of growth at Deel, there's a lot of things you could do. I'm curious how you decided where to prioritize your resources and what to do in the early days? Versus what you started doing down the road and what you could almost not worry about early on? What have you learned about that early prioritization exercise?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:26:59):\nYes. So I would say early days, it's very important to just go back to the basics, build the skeleton before you put on the makeup. So the first question I would ask is, do you have a website? Is it fast? Do the search engine knows that it exists? Okay, great. The next step would be, can people find it? If they can't find it, you need to write content to make sure that people can find it.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:27:24):\nOnly after all of those questions are answered, should you then consider, do I have money? Can I put it behind some paid ads to make sure people come to my website? So going step-by-step. But you can't run a successful paid ads program if you have a website that's loading in four plus seconds. So really going back to the basics and starting from a good experience at the core. And then expanding step-by-step from there is how I would suggest everybody starts. And that's what I would do if I was to get hired all over again.\n\nLenny (00:27:54):\nI love that. So what are some of the steps? So step one is, do you have a website? Step two is make sure the website performs and people can actually have a good time when they're experiencing it. I imagine part of it is also, do people understand what you do, like tweaking maybe the pitch and the [inaudible 00:28:07]\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:28:06):\nYes, exactly. And speaking of the pitch, our copy team does an amazing job at this. In the B2B world, it's very easy to come up with statements that could so easily be applied to another business and it would work just as well on their website. And it sounds good and you and your team feel really good about it. But then if your one-liner can also work for another business, please don't let that be your one-liner. Make it so that people actually understand what you do. Because right now there's a lot of statements out there like, 'we do the complex things so you can focus on what you do best', what does that mean? And you can give that to 90% of the B2B businesses out there and it would apply to them, which means it's not good enough.\n\nLenny (00:28:51):\nIs there anything that you remember you changed in those early days in terms of the website or the positioning or anything along those lines that was a big improvement?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:28:57):\nOur website was hard coded, so the first thing we did with the help of the dev team was to move it to a platform that it was easy for me to access and edit, so that we could continuously A/B test things. And outside of that, we worked really hard on testing a lot of value propositions to explain to people exactly what we do, explain problem first, solution first, and time savings, cost savings, putting a lot of those against each other and rapidly A/B testing.\n\nLenny (00:29:24):\nOnce you got past that phase, where maybe you started doing some paid ads and other things, where did you find you could invest more resources?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:29:32):\nOnce we covered the basics of your big four or five ad platforms, we started looking into the long tail places. So those are the platforms that individually never contribute a significant enough chunk for you to individually care about it. But if you add them up, it diversifies your lead flow such that it ends up being about 30% of your overall lead flow that's coming in. Those could be things like review sites or much smaller outlets that could also run ads, newsletter ads, podcast ads, all of those things.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:30:06):\nWhen you run an individual podcast ad, yeah, you're probably not going to get 2000 customers from one podcast. But you run 10 of those and then it starts adding up. So really long tail is where we focused on. And we started going very niche with websites that have maybe 50,000, a hundred thousand visitors a month, which isn't all that much when you're thinking about your paid ad strategy. But all of those places add up and they're oftentimes overlooked because they're not as easy, you have to take the time to set up from scratch to run it on everything. Our paid ads team, they spent just as much time running Facebook and Google ads as they do running those third party, much smaller platform ads. It takes the same effort, but you need to have a diversified source of your leads.\n\nLenny (00:30:54):\nHuge fan of podcast ads over here, and maybe this would be a good time to cue the mid-roll ad, maybe, I don't know, it happens.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:30:59):\nSounds perfect.\n\nLenny (00:31:01):\nHere we go.

Speaking of podcast ads, something that I find is with that sort of advertising, there's a direct response component of like, we will drive leads as running an ad like this, and there's also a awareness, brand building component. I know you're not a big fan of awareness campaigns and marketing campaigns, especially early on, and so I'd love to get your perspective on why that is and how you think about that sort of investment?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:32:36):\nI'm not a huge fan of early awareness campaigns for B2B businesses specifically. So if you are a consumer goods founder, you can skip this part. But the reason I don't like awareness early on is because to do a proper awareness campaign, it takes time. You need to have teams that are doing the strategy, doing the creative work, and they don't always hit. You don't know if they're always going to resonate or not. And then you look back, and you've worked on this thing for a whole month and it hasn't resonated and you've wasted a full month.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:33:07):\nBecause B2B businesses uniquely are started because there's a very real need and there's a lot of people that are ready to convert, first tap into the bottom of the funnel, and then go out and start speaking to the masses. But I promise you it'll probably take you six to eight months minimum to tap into that bottom of the funnel of people that are ready to convert today before you have to start doing awareness ads out there. That's not to say never do awareness ads, but it's oftentimes the shiny, cool thing that you want to do and it just ends up being a waste of time early on. Because people don't really even understand what you're doing, you haven't really even figured out what's the messaging that resonates, but you've done this creative campaign and people are like, \"This looks cool, but I'm just going to go ahead and continue looking for a solution for my problem.\"\n\nLenny (00:33:53):\nIs there an example of a marketing campaign or an awareness campaign that comes to mind that you thought was like, \"Okay, this is ... if you do it this way, maybe it's worth doing\"?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:34:01):\nI've seen Notion do a great job with their out-of-home ads. They didn't do it early on, they started doing it much later in their journey by the time when everybody that was working in tech knew what it was, and it was really to drive home the message continuously rather than to introduce themselves to the world. So by then when you saw that layout on a billboard, it made sense, you're like, \"Oh, I know what they're talking about.\"\n\nLenny (00:34:23):\nSo what is it about Notion that you think was great, it was timing and then also the actual ad itself you thought was great?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:34:30):\nYeah, the ads that I'm recalling right now were showcasing their product interface. So they needed enough time, and this is my obviously hypothesis, if someone from Notion wants to jump in and say that wasn't the reason why we did this, go ahead, but I think they needed enough time for people to get familiar with the interface. Because Notion has a very specific interface that when you see it, you recognize it, it's not like any other product. So unless people built that awareness and recognition, doing an out-of-home ad with that layout wouldn't have made much sense because just with that layout they were able to communicate what product they're talking about. If they did that day one, people would be like, \"What is this thing that I'm looking at?\"\n\nLenny (00:35:07):\nSo we've been working through all the ways that Deel has grown, we've talked about SEO, community, you mentioned partnerships. Is there anything interesting there to mention around just what partnerships have done?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:35:18):\nYeah, I would say it is very important to know who you should partner with. So there's two groups of partners. People oftentimes end up partnering with any company that has a shared audience. Decent place to start. But just because you share an audience doesn't mean your audience goes to your partner for guidance when they have this problem.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:35:35):\nSo in our case, venture capital partners was a huge one because when you get money from a new VC, they ask, they're like, \"Okay, thank you for giving us this money, now we want to expand our team with the money you gave us. What are your other portfolio companies using? What is a platform that you trust that you would recommend?\" So people go to their VCs for that kind of question. But there might be another tech company out there that is tapping into the exact audience that we are, but people never go to them to ask that question. So our partnership with them will likely not work just as well. So it's important to not only recognize the importance of an audience overlap as well as whether or not those people are seen as a trusted resource for the solution you are putting out there.\n\nLenny (00:36:16):\nI really love this idea you keep coming back to, which is where are people asking this question that you can help them answer. And to make that even more concrete for people, what are some other examples maybe of questions people ask that Deel can help them with? So that it could help people think about, okay, maybe our product can help them answer these other sorts of questions\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:36:35):\nSince the early days, and it continues to happen, compliance is a huge question that gets asked. So when you are an HR leader or a finance leader or a legal leader in a company that works let's say in America, but you want to hire someone in another country, you don't know what you don't know. So it's very important to have people that know what they're talking about in context of your country of origin as well as the country that you're trying to hire from. So compliance has always been a huge part of what we did and what we've always answered for people. That's why we have in-house experts that answer those questions, that constantly provide updates if the answer to that question has changed over time, which regulations constantly change. An answer we provided a week ago may change, and you need to be very proactive in communicating that.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:18):\nTaxes is another one, especially in the space that we're in, payroll, hiring. Taxes change from country to country. You need to know when you need to pay what taxes, when you need to not pay them, and what types of work people do. So those are some of the types of questions that get asked.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:34):\nSo for us, they're very nitty-gritty and use case specific. The taxes you need to pay for someone who is an engineer that's a full-time employee might be very different than who is a designer who is a contractor. So those are the kinds of specifics that we get into with people.\n\nLenny (00:37:50):\nGot it. So it's like, how do I pay taxes for an engineer I'm hiring in Turkey? And then you give them, \"Here's the answer,\" and then it's like, \"If you just want us to take care of it for you, then go check out Deel.\"\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:37:59):\nExactly. Rarely the question is what's the best payroll solution? It's like, okay, that's good to make sure what you're leaning towards isn't shit and that other people agree with you. But ultimately it was like you need the best payroll solution because you need to make sure that things aren't going to go wrong.\n\nLenny (00:38:15):\nSpeaking of answering questions in content, something that you told me is that you wrote a blog post that the IRS ended up linking to as the definitive answer to a question. And I don't think this was at Deel, but can you share that story?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:38:28):\nYes, actually it was at my previous role. And the person who wrote that article is today at Deel. So he came over to join us there too. But yes, it was right around when Covid happened and the US government rolled out the PPP program. And there was a lot of questions about, do I qualify? If I qualify, how do I apply for this?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:38:51):\nAnd at the time the company that I was working for had a lot of customers that were like, \"What do I do? I need to gain access to this, but I don't know what to do.\" So the team there took the time to truly understand how the system works, whether you qualify, what to do. And created this resource for our own customers because we just wanted to help them. And then it ended up being such a good resource that it was linked from the IRS's website being like, \"If you have questions, check out this article,\" which was a great moment of pride. And it just went to show that when you do your best to answer questions and other people don't have the time to do it, no matter who it is, they're going to send people back your way. And it was at the time, it happened to be a big moment of growth.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:39:33):\nIt was a very unfortunate instance, we wish we never had to write that, that it never happened. But yeah, that was the story around IRS linking to the company's resource.\n\nLenny (00:39:44):\nThat's the ultimate sign of the question is answered and you're done with it, the IRS decides to link to it. So you're saying that was actually a big driver of growth, IRS traffic. I'm curious how many people actually go read that?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:39:57):\nSo that was huge for that short duration of a few week time when people were trying to apply for PPP. And then it died out, as did PPP.\n\nLenny (00:40:05):\nMakes sense. One last question around paid, and then I want to move on to a different topic. Is there anything you've learned about what it takes to be successful at paid growth from your experience at Deel?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:40:15):\nYeah, so a few things. Our paid team spends a lot of time on both the messaging aspect of things as well as the optimization. So optimization is the technical way in which you set your bids, make sure that you don't go over budget, whether or not you can afford that.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:40:31):\nAnd then messaging is making sure that if someone sees your ad, whether it's on Instagram, Twitter, Google, that it makes sense for them. So creative fatigue is a real thing. When you put an ad out there that works for three weeks, people get tired of seeing that, you need to constantly update that. So our paid team is actually updating the ads we put out there on a monthly basis with the exception of a few Google ads, which need to be straight to the point. So staying ahead of creative fatigue. Making sure that your messaging also keeps up with your product, even if the ad is working really well, you need to make sure that as your product has evolved, so has the messaging alongside that.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:41:07):\nAnd also recognizing, not just looking at the amount of leads that you generated from a campaign, but how many of them actually became a client, and how much money did you actually make from those clients to understand things around payback. Because oftentimes marketers just tend to think about, \"Oh, this is a great lead channel and I get so many leads from it.\" But then you ask that question to sales teams and they're like, \"Yeah, I'm busy, but none of these are converting.\" So it's really important to look at not just the volume that you bring in, but what is the journey of that volume with your business one year out. How much money do you actually make from them to be able to properly decide how much can I spend to win this customer?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:41:44):\nAnd the way that we've done it is we've worked with our data team to set up a dashboard that tracks that in real time. We know an average customer that comes from a Facebook ad, at what rate do they converge from a lead to a qualified opportunity to a closed on.? And then on average, how much money do we make from that customer one year out. So that we can decide, is this a worthy channel for us, do we not want to invest there or are we reaching that peak and we can't continue to invest there.\n\nLenny (00:42:11):\nSomething that I should mention as we talk through this is we're talking about all these ways to grow the product, but at the core is a great product that people actually find valuable and want to keep using. And maybe a question there is just how that plays into this whole growth strategy, actually making the product something people want versus all these acquisition channels?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:42:29):\nAcquisition channels just straight up don't work if you have a product that doesn't live up to the expectation. I think I personally have been very spoiled and lucky because from the day I joined Deel, the product was top-notch. As I was joining an early stage company, I joined right after series A, I was expecting certain things to be duct taped in the back, it happens. And I was like, \"Oh no, the engineers and the product team are, if they say a product can do something, it can do that and more.\"\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:42:59):\nSo early days of my team pitching Deel was people were like, \"I don't think you guys can do all of that. I don't believe you.\" And it was almost like we had to tamper down our messaging so that people would believe us. But you can be the best marketer in the world, if when people come to your product, even if your sales team does a good job at convincing them to become a customer, because you can do that, if the product doesn't live up to the expectations, especially in the B2B world where people aren't going to put up with crappy products, they're going to leave. That's going to get out and people are going to know it's not a worthy product. So that really sits at the core of everything that we do.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:43:35):\nI think it's very easy to take it for granted when you're at a company that has an awesome product, you're like, \"It is like this all the time.\" But one of the things I would encourage anybody looking to join a young company is, ask them what their team breakdown looks like. When I joined Deel, most of the team was product and engineers. So that told me that the core of this business was going to be solid. And then we built out those supporting things like marketing, like sales, like data to surround the product. But if you are talking to an early stage company that's a B2B product and they have six salespeople and two engineers, their product probably isn't going to be great for that much longer.\n\nLenny (00:44:12):\nEspecially if it's an outsourced dev shop doing the product, they're like, \"Oh, they'll take care of the product, we'll just sell it.\" Something else that I think is important to talk about is Covid was an important element of your growth. And so I guess, one, is that true? And then two, just what did you lean into and lean out of in terms of growth during Covid to help people discover Deel when they needed it most, which is basically people going remote in a lot of ways in a lot of companies?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:44:39):\nSo Covid, actually a lot of people think Deel was started as a response to the pandemic, we actually got started before the pandemic and then the pandemic happened. So as sad as it was, it did force people into a pilot program of the vision that we had for the world. It forced people to work remotely, whether that means you're working remotely from someone who lives a block away from you or you are working remotely from someone in Germany. So we did benefit from the fact that everybody was at least forced to test out this hypothesis of, does it work to not be in the same room as the people that you're working with?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:45:17):\nAnd one of the questions that we were getting early on as the Covid was coming to an end was, \"Are you worried, Covid is coming to an end, that people aren't going to use Deel anymore?\" And our response to that has always been, we are not a remote work platform, we're a global work platform. So a lot of these businesses have gone back into offices. We have a lot of customers that asked people to go back to their offices, but now they have offices in Germany and in Canada and in the US and in France. So we were never a remote work company, we were just a global work company.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:45:49):\nAnd remote work, because there was a lot of news coverage happening around it, we just became synonymous with that. So I do think early on we did benefit from being able to provide that solution. And a lot of people saw the reality of like, \"Hey, I work just as well with this person as I did when I was in an office with them. Well, the best person that I'm looking for, the job may not be within my region, so let me go ahead and hire them regardless of where they are.\" People got comfortable with that and more and more companies started moving in that direction.\n\nLenny (00:46:20):\nAnd is there anything that ended up being really important in terms of helping Deel grow through that? Like a channel that's just like, \"Let's go big on this channel because it seems to be working really well\"? Or is it just word of mouth basically and people are just like, \"Oh shit, I really need to solve this problem, my hair's on fire, what's out there? Let me go find an answer\"?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:46:36):\nI wouldn't say it was word of mouth, maybe very, very early on it was word of mouth, but within the first few months of our operation that stopped being true. Or at least the word of mouth stopped being a smaller percentage of the way in which people discover us. But it's always that people needed a payroll solution, they needed a way to hire independent contractors overseas, and we just were the answer to that. So we consistently put ourselves in front of them and said, \"Hey, if you're trying to do this, or if you're already doing it and you're not doing it legally, we can help you do that legally.\"\n\nLenny (00:47:10):\nI want to chat about team building, something that I've heard you're exceptional at. And my first question is, early on when you were building the team, the growth team specifically, at Deel, what skills did you find were most important to look for? And what skills and experiences did you find wasn't as important early on that you could sacrifice and wait until later to get?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:47:30):\nEarly on one of the first questions I would ask people is, what are the KPIs that you're willing to commit to? So if someone's only willing to commit to lead numbers, that's not good enough. They need to be able to commit to closed one revenue KPRs to really show that they care about the business's bottom line. So it was those people that were willing to commit to the full funnel.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:47:53):\nAnd also oftentimes people tend to hire from the big companies that they want to become like because the brand name is appealing. But if you're a team of 35 people, and you're trying to hire the director of whatever from a huge company, you need to ask the question of, when did this person join that huge company? Did they join when the company was already 5,000 people and from day one they had all the resources at their disposal? Or were they actually one of the earlier employees who helped that growth? Because oftentimes the mistake I see people make is they'll hire someone from an amazing company that have accomplished amazing things, but they're not used to operating with 10% of the resources that they had. So they're not willing to get down and do the dirty work.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:48:35):\nAnd at Deel we have this concept called 'little hands'. I think it's loosely translated from French, someone can correct me on that. But it basically means that no matter who you are, where you sit within the organization, you need to be willing to get into the little things and do the nitty-gritty work and not shy away from it. And it's very important too, whoever we hire at any level, it's like, \"Are you willing to do the tiniest of jobs?\" And if the answer is yes, that's great. And some people are like, \"I would build a team for that.\" And of course in the future, maybe you should, but that shouldn't be your first answer. Your first answer should be, \"Yes, of course I'll do that.\" And if someone's not excited about that, then they're not a good fit for at least a company at our stage right now.\n\nLenny (00:49:18):\nThat is an amazing expression, little hands. You talked about how you check that people are willing to commit to revenue goals. Is that in the interview or is that ... how do you ... because won't everyone just say, \"Yeah, yeah, I can commit to anything you need me to commit to, I'm going to go make this work\"? How do you get a sense if they're the kind of person that would do that?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:49:38):\nIt happens within the interview process. So one ways to find out is what are the KPIs that they have committed to in the past in their roles. So if they've never committed to a revenue goal or a bottom funnel goal and they're saying they're willing to commit to it, that's probably not correct. And I always say, if they haven't, I say, \"What are the KPIs that you have today and what are the KPIs that you think you should have?\" Because sometimes they're just not given those, but they still think they should have been given the more bottom funnel. So that's something that I would look for in the interview process.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:50:06):\nAnd a really good way to also test for that is, this is more on the case study process, but asking someone to come up with a strategy with $0, with $10,000 and maybe a hundred thousand dollars to see if they're going to be able to scale with you. And to see how are they thinking about with different levels of spend and what are they willing to commit to at different levels of spend. Because if someone's throwing up their hands and saying, \"At $0, I can only do social media monitoring, we're not going to get much because that's what makes sense.\" Well, you probably know that they're not going to be comfortable committing to those bottom of funnel metrics until you give them all the resources that they need.\n\nLenny (00:50:46):\nAnd it sounds like the way you goal teams within Deel also is revenue, growth teams basically have revenue goals. It's not, like you said, leads or traffic or anything like that.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:50:55):\nYes. That's why we're called growth instead of marketing, we care about the revenue growth. And of course we track leads and SQLs. Those are leading indicators to know whether or not we're going to hit the ultimate number that we all care about. But at the end of the day, that's not what we consider success.\n\nLenny (00:51:12):\nIn terms of team structure, how you thought about structuring the early growth team, what did that look like and what was the reporting lines and buckets of investment?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:51:21):\nYeah, so very early on, we always seek to bring in one leader to manage a part of the organization and then let them grow their teams. We don't love the idea of hiring people based off of a hypothesis that something is going to work. That's a really good way to have to do layoffs because the plans you thought were going to work didn't work. So we always hired one person, prove out a theory, and then let them grow their team.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:51:43):\nSo the first hire we made to the team was actually a product marketing person. To this day they lead our product marketing team, and they were the ones who sit between the product team and the go-to-market teams and really set the messaging. And quickly we realized this person needs more help in setting the messaging, the tone. So then the second person we hired was a very talented copywriter. And that person today leads our creative teams.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:08):\nAnd then the third person we actually hired onto the growth team was a data analyst because the sentiment was we're not willing to spend a dollar if we don't know where that money's going and what it's doing for us. Which a lot of people would assume that's a very early hire for ... data is too early to hire as number three. But I still think that we did the right thing there. Now we have a whole data team, but back then we didn't.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:32):\nSo those were the three teams that we started with on top. And then the content person was already at Deel by the time that I joined, so that was the person I mentioned that was early employee. So that's how we originally set it.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:52:45):\nNow the teams have changed. So now we have a different structure, slightly different structure, which is we have regional teams and functional teams. The functional teams are basically subject matter experts. They're good at what they do and we don't care where they are based in the world. So those are teams like product marketing, content, community, events, paid advertisements, brand. If we are looking for the best graphic designer in the world, I don't care where they are, they can sit wherever in the world. They are basically functional teams.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:53:16):\nAnd then we have regional teams. Because we are selling into a lot of different regions, we need to make sure that we have local expertise as well. So we have marketing managers for different key regions for us that then work with our functional teams to bring the strategy to life. So that's how we've set it.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:53:33):\nI've seen businesses who build out a regional team that has their own paid ads team and their own content team. But what we have found is when you take people away from their group of expertise, so if you take a paid ads person, and if you have a team of paid ads people and you separate those five people and give them to different regions, instead of letting them sit together and be a tight team, the best practice is learning and the leveling up of the skills doesn't happen as fast as they would if all of the technical roles are sitting together. So we are continuing down the road of functional and regional setup.\n\nLenny (00:54:09):\nSo say someone in Turkey wants to run paid ads, they convince the paid growth team to invest in resources in growing Turkey?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:54:16):\nExactly. So they would work with our central paid ads team to say I would like to run paid ads in Turkey, this is the audience I want to go after. And then they work together to execute on that strategy.\n\nLenny (00:54:28):\nHow does that team decide who's going to get their time, is there a rough approach to that?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:54:32):\nSo it depends on the total addressable market in a region, what are the opportunities we're seeing, what's the competitive landscape like. So chances are if a market is what we consider to be tier one, and it's a place that we have seen good growth, we will invest our resources into it. And then along the way we learn and we decide if we're going to double down or pull back a little bit.\n\nLenny (00:54:53):\nAwesome. I want to chat a bit about culture, culture at Deel. We had Jeff from Ramp on, and their culture is described by one word, velocity. Also one of you being the fastest growing business of all time, I'm curious how you'd contrast your culture and broadly how you think about culture at a startup and how you help create the culture at Deel?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:55:12):\nYeah, so I would say culture is made up of two components. One is, what do you bring to the company as a team member, and what does the company give back to you? So what we expect the team members to bring to us is, our version of velocity is something that we call 'Deel speed', is that we want to make sure that we act with urgency. It doesn't matter how big the team has grown, we want to act with urgency on behalf of our customers. If a customer has a problem, they're not going to wait two weeks to get an answer for that. They're going to get that answer within 24 hours. If we need to build out a product because many customers are asking for it, that product is going to get built in one-tenth the time that any of our competitors will likely build it in.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:55:51):\nSo 'Deel speed' is very, very important for us. And that's something we expect from our team members who are committing to it. To say, what's the quickest way I can solve this problem properly? And to repeatedly push themselves to act with urgency.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:06):\nWe also care that we remain positive. We have default optimism because we are in a new space, so if someone's going to come into Deel and they're going to be pessimistic and they're like, \"I don't think that's going to work for X, Y, Z reasons,\" they're going to just slow things down. We need people to ask the question of, \"I think it's going to work for these four reasons, now let's see what are the risks associated with it and let's seek to solve those risks.\" That's again something we expect from our team members.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:31):\nAnd then the last one, well, not the last one, but one of the third important ones is, fully giving a shit about your customer. At the end of the day, the product that we have, we are dealing with humans, we're dealing with their livelihood, the way they get paid, we're dealing with the way companies hire. It's so incredibly personal if someone doesn't get their paycheck on time or if someone gets into legal trouble because their contract wasn't set up the proper way.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:56:57):\nSo recognizing that it's not a software and a platform that we're trying to make it the best, but it's like, no, it's a business trying to pay a human so they can live their lives and the business can continue growing. So that care is something that we need people to bring to the table.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:57:14):\nNow in return of those things coming, what we give back as a company is, outside of obviously your pay, your benefits package, et cetera, is we offer people the flexibility to choose how and when they do their job, they get to decide on where they work from, what hours they work. So we basically give people all the freedom to set up their life how they want to as long as they come to the table giving us what they need. So I would say we do have an intense culture, and that's expected, we share that openly with people. But at the end of the day, that's also what sets us apart.\n\nLenny (00:57:48):\nI love this 'Deel speed'. Are these core values basically within Deel, these are values that you come back to?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:57:54):\nYes, exactly. And these are values that we publicly share as well.\n\nLenny (00:57:58):\nHow early in the lifecycle of the company did you all come up with these values? That's something that a lot of startups think about is, when should we actually crystallize these values?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:58:06):\nSo we came up with them, I believe it was about a year in, but we didn't sit around the table and say, \"What should we call our values?\" 'Deel speed' was something that our CEO would tell people. He'd be like, \"Okay, I want you to do this, but I want you to do it at 'Deel speed'.\" And one of the early jokes was, let's have company swag that's Deel speedo and things like that. It's just like, it was already used so frequently with people that we were just like, \"Okay, we keep saying this, let's also define what it actually is for us and set it in stone and share it with people.\" So we did go through that exercise probably about a year in into the company existing, but the culture happened well before we established that.\n\nLenny (00:58:49):\nReminds me, at Airbnb, there was a team that came up with the core values, I think it was four years in probably, and there were six of them. And then a few years later they realized two of them aren't actually true, they were aspirational. And there was this recognition that values should be who you are not who you hope to be because it just doesn't click. And so they actually cut those values and they ended up having just four values. And maybe one day they'll bring them back. And so I think that's a really good lesson is you want to see who you already are and then just represent them in a really interesting, creative way.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:59:22):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:59:23):\nThere's a version of, what did you call it, default optimism. Airbnb's version of that was 'embrace the adventure', which is just like, this is going to be crazy, just go for it, embrace it, this is what it's going to be like.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (00:59:38):\nExactly. And try and see how can I solve this, how can this be done instead of why it won't work.\n\nLenny (00:59:43):\nYeah, I love that. And this urgency piece comes up again and again in these interviews I'm doing. What I think of is Frank Slootman, I think is his name, the founder of Snowflake, has this book called Amp It Up. All about just how they made Snowflake work. And something he comes back to is just you need to constantly have a sense of urgency because when you don't, people get bored and they actually end up liking their job less because it's just like, I don't really know what I'm doing, things are moving along. And there's actually a lot of value in moving fast. Jeff talked about this as just like, you have less burnout when people feel like things are getting done and out the door.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:00:18):\nYeah, it's incredibly fulfilling. I look back and sometimes things when, for example, when the SVB was going through the issues they were going through, the entire team had to work on a Sunday to communicate with our customers of like, \"No, we're good, don't worry about it.\" But I remember that Sunday I had to miss out on a theater I was so excited to see, but it just felt like, oh my God, we're in this, it was like a war room, we're doing it. And that felt good. I didn't necessarily show up on Monday feeling already burned out, but it was more like, yes, I felt alive. And I think the right people will feel that way.\n\nLenny (01:00:52):\nYeah, and as long as it's not constantly for years just endless late nights and weekends.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:01:01):\nIt can't always be war time.\n\nLenny (01:01:01):\nI find that those end up being the most memorable, meaningful moments is when you're working really, really hard on something that you're excited about. And it has to be something you're excited about and are proud of.\n\nLenny (01:01:10):\nLast question. I saw on Twitter, you shared this photo of your home office, and it was this incredible view out the window, and then you took a photo facing your desk and it was an ironing board. And two questions there. One is just how did that all happen? And then two, I think you mentioned somewhere that you didn't even meet a lot of your coworkers for a year and a half after joining Deel, it was very remote forward. So, I'm curious also just how you made remote work work for you in that environment?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:01:36):\nYeah, so I'll explain the ironing board first. So that was because I was actually visiting my family in Istanbul, and in the setup that we have, there's one desk. So my husband and I go rock, paper, scissors, and we'll see who gets the desk and who gets to come up with a secondary solution. And he won the desk, so I had to come up with a creative solution. And because the view behind me was stunning, of the Bosporus, every meeting I joined, people were like, \"Wow, I love your view, this is amazing.\" And I was like, \"Oh, no, no, you guys, I'm sitting on an ironing board right now.\" And to me that was both funny, and I wanted to do a reality check with people to be like, \"Come on, this is not as glorious as it looks.\" But at the same time, it really in that moment I was like, \"This is awesome, I work at Deel.\"\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:02:22):\nPreviously when I wanted to go visit my family in Istanbul, and I live in Canada, I would have to use my days off to go. And for me it just meant a lot to be able to do my work regardless of where I am. I had a full day of work and meetings and everything. And my work just continued and I was also be able to be with my family. So it was a moment of Deel's promise coming true in a very real way in my life. And I thought it was hilarious. My dad thought it was so unprofessional that I shared that with the public then. He hasn't fully wrapped his head around the startup world. So it was just one of those moments of sharing that, yeah, work can be remote and it can be whatever you want it to be. So that's the the story behind it. In this moment as we're recording this, I am in a proper home office with a desk and a back supported chair. It changes all the time.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:03:16):\nAnd in terms of, going back to your second question of, early days not meeting the team members. As I said, I joined Deel in July, 2020, pandemic was at its peak, me being based in Canada, Canada had very strict restrictions of, you can't leave the country, we won't let you back in. So I had to stay put. And I worked for a year and a half at Deel before for the first time where I met our team members was at a conference in Lisbon. And I showed up and it was this surreal moment because I've worked with them for a year and a half, we'd accomplished so much. Our revenue was already way past $50 million and I was seeing these people for the first time. So that was very funny.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:03:58):\nBut if I look at the early days of Deel, there's a lot of little stories like that, where we forgot to create swag until we reached a billion dollars. And it was actually when our photo was going to be on the NASDAQ and we wanted to take a team picture that we were like, \"Guys, we need to have t-shirts. Can someone please run to a store in New York and print our logo on something?\" So a lot of those things just by the nature of being a pandemic business came a little bit later.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:04:25):\nBut the thing that allowed I think for me in Deel to build the culture early on was, because we all work from home, we've been like that from day one. We have the option to go into WeWorks and co-working spaces if that's something that you choose. But we all get to show up as our very authentic selves. So people have met my pets and my partner well before they would have if I was showing up to an office. So there's that sincerity that comes with being in someone's home that we really relied on early on.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:04:56):\nAnd as a company, I never felt the pressure to show up in a certain way or dress up for meetings or anything. So just being able to show up as yourself, and whether you're an introverted person who never likes to turn on their camera or you're someone who's going to be like, \"Here, meet my dog.\" That just naturally built a team culture and comradery well before we could be together in person.\n\nLenny (01:05:20):\nClearly it has worked out. Meltem, is there anything else that you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:05:26):\nWe had a really good conversation. The one thing I would tell people is, most of growth, people assume is very difficult. I'm not necessarily saying it's easy, but it's relatively straightforward when you go back to the first principles of just figuring out where are the people at? How can I add value? As long as your product is there to actually bring them value. So I would say people should just recognize that it's much simpler than they think it is, it just takes a lot of discipline to execute on it, it's not rocket science.\n\nLenny (01:06:01):\nQuite an empowering statement, I love it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:07):\nI am ready, let's do this.\n\nLenny (01:06:09):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:13):\nFrom the nonfiction world, How Will You Measure Your Life by Clay Christensen, that's one I recommend. He takes the business learnings that he's had and applies it to your life. It's a very short and easy to get through book. Outside of that, I constantly recommend fiction. I think at one point it became uncool to read fiction that every moment you have needs to be productive and you need to learn something. I don't care what fiction it is you read, you can read Judy Blume for all I care, but just read fiction, be creative, do something with your brain other than reading nonfiction and learning things all the time.\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\nI've had to make that shift myself, and it's been great, but I still get drawn to nonfiction. But good reminder. What are some favorite recent movie or TV shows you've loved?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:06:58):\nFavorite recent movie, I think along with everybody else, was Oppenheimer. I thought it was great. I do wish they explored a little bit more of why he was the person that drove everybody to excellence. But overall loved the movie. Did not think I could sit through three hours without peeing, but I did. And favorite recent TV show was The Summer I Turned Pretty. I absolutely love it. I don't care that it's actually designed for teenagers, I enjoyed every second of it.\n\nLenny (01:07:28):\nWhat is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates when you're interviewing them?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:07:28):\nWhat would your siblings say about you? It's very telling. If they have siblings, if they don't, I will say, what will your parents say about you? But it's very telling what you think other people think of you.\n\nLenny (01:07:41):\nWhat do you look for in their answer that gives you a sign that they're a good candidate or not?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:07:45):\nI look for sincerity and self-awareness. Your siblings are never ... I mean, I love my sister, but she'll probably shit talk me a lot. And being aware of that is very important. If someone was like, \"My siblings will say I'm very organized and that I'm the one that brings our family together.\" That's probably a bullshit answer. But if they're like, \"Oh yeah, they'll say these weird things about me,\" that shows a little bit of self-awareness and humbleness that I want to see in a person.\n\nLenny (01:08:11):\nWhat is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:14):\nOh, this is a dangerous one. So two, one was NuStrips, they're caffeine strips. I find caffeine pills and everything or when I drink coffee is like, accidentally I'll have 300 milligrams and then I'm buzzing. But these are 50 milligrams each, so it's very easy to stop yourself. And they don't taste bad. So those I like for when I just need a little boost.\n\nLenny (01:08:32):\nSo they're just strips that you put in your mouth and they give you caffeine?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:32):\nLike LISTERINE strips.\n\nLenny (01:08:36):\nWhat?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:37):\nAnd you put it on your tongue and then it also doesn't give you the jitters and it's just 50 milligrams, which is a very mild cup of coffee.\n\nLenny (01:08:45):\nMicrodosing caffeine.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:46):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (01:08:47):\nBeautiful.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:08:48):\nAnd the second one is, I recently was gifted a personalized library stamp, which I love. Because I love to give books away, so I stamp them with my library stamp. And I like to think that one day in a secondhand bookshop I'm going to run into it.\n\nLenny (01:09:03):\nThat's amazing. There's a camp at Burning Man that's a library, and you can borrow books and you have to return it in a year, the next year when you come back to Burning Man. Which is amazing. And then there's a guy that has a megaphone, he is just like, \"A book has been returned.\" Makes a whole scene about it. What is a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with other people, either at work or in life?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:09:27):\nThe world is run by insecure overachievers. I used to think my insecurity was a downfall and I would just hide it and try to pretend it's not there. And then someone that I really look up to told that to. I'm like, \"Okay, so I'm not the only one.\" And it's just, I do think world is run by a bunch of people that have something to prove for a good reason or not, but it's better to embrace it than to pretend you're all confident and you're just doing this because you're brilliant.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nOh my God, so good. Final question, what is your favorite Canadian food? You live in Canada and thus the question.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:02):\nOkay, it's not particularly food, but Caesars, they're basically Bloody Mary's with clam juice.\n\nLenny (01:10:08):\nOh, Bloody Caesar, is that what they're called? Or just Caesar?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:10):\nThey're called Caesars.\n\nLenny (01:10:11):\nJust Caesar.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:12):\nBut the American equivalent would be a Bloody Mary. It's so much better than a Bloody Mary. It's not vegan. And then the reason I qualify it as food is when you order it in Canada, it comes with pepperoni strips and pickled asparagus, and they'll shove a whole meal in there. And it's just amazing and something that America should definitely adapt too.\n\nLenny (01:10:28):\nI think I've had one, I think I prefer Bloody Marys, but a good pitch for the Caesars. Meltem, thank you so much for being here. We talked about growth strategy, team building, 'Deel speed', default optimism, so many things. Really appreciate you making the time. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:10:49):\nSo they can reach out to me on Twitter at MeltemK, I'm the fastest to respond there. Please don't reach out to me on LinkedIn, I never respond there. And the way readers can be useful to me is if they, one, we're always looking for feedback on Deel. If you see something out there that you think could be better, let me know, and I'll make sure to communicate it to the team, whatever that may be. And also, if anybody has tips that they think I would benefit from or any good fiction book recommendations, I'm always open to them.\n\nLenny (01:11:19):\nAmazing. Meltem, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nMeltem Kuran Berkowitz (01:11:23):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny (01:11:25):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

I've always been such a fan of yours from afar through your writing and your Twitter. We've interacted a bit on Twitter. We've never really had a deep conversation. And so I'm really excited. And so, welcome.\n\nMerci Grace (03:18):\nThank you. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (03:20):\nI'm excited to chat. You have this incredible background. You're a founder, you're a game designer, you're head of product, head of growth at Slack. Then you became a VC. Now you're a founder again. Such an impressive and unusual journey. I'm curious how you got into product initially, and then just how did you work your way up to head of product and the head of growth at Slack?\n\nMerci Grace (03:42):\nYeah, I got into product accidentally. I was first a game designer and actually started a venture-backed game studio right after college when I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I got my first term sheet as a founder before I knew what venture capital was. Purely accidental. And it's funny because my career arc went founder, game designer, product management, VC, CEO of your own startup, something that people try to do on purpose now, and I was not trying to do it on purpose at all. I was just following my curiosity and my love of how thinking works and how people make decisions. And so that really went from games, to product management, to venture, and then back into product.\n\nLenny (04:32):\nHaving been in VC now, having your own startup, what did you learn in that time that maybe surprised you now being a founder that, \"Oh, wow. That was useful to learn and experience\"?\n\nMerci Grace (04:42):\nOh, yeah. So many things. I think one of the things that is quite obvious from the get-go, when you have had a few months under your belt, you've been seeing a bunch of pitches, and seeing the one-on-one pitches and then seeing the partner meeting pitches, is how different really great CEOs and startup leaders are at storytelling, at coming up with a pithy answer, at owning the room. The fundamentals of their businesses might not even look a lot better, but when you're in that room, you feel so differently about it. So I think how much really the founder matters.\n\n(05:21):\nAnd then the other thing, and this is my surprising thing about venture that I tell people that I didn't expect to learn, which is, especially on Twitter and even in the media and the press, some merger happens or doesn't happen, some deal happens or doesn't happen, and there's a lot of armchair quarterbacking where people are sort of filling in, \"Oh, that happened because this fundamental shift in the market for X, Y, Z, because this research division and blah, blah, blah,\" a lot of things that seem really objective and really rational, but deals happen or don't happen typically because of interpersonal dynamics and sometimes even just personality clashes or petty holdouts from years before. And so I think how personal it is and how it's not always necessarily about the fundamentals of business. It's oftentimes because people just can see you as a founder, or CEO, or can see you running something like this. And so it's very subjective, more subjective than I thought it would be.\n\nLenny (06:32):\nIt's interesting. In both examples it comes back to the founder and how they present and how they behave. On the first point, presenting storytelling, being someone that VCs respect and want to invest in, is there anything that you have learned how to get better at that sort of thing, or is it just do it for a while and you'll get better? Is there something that folks can do to get stronger at that?\n\nMerci Grace (06:54):\nYeah. When you have the opportunity to tell the story, when you have a pitch, when you're writing a blog post, when you're speaking at a conference, really, it's your stage. You get to manage the narrative and to say things in a certain way, position things in a certain way. And so that's where writing is really important. So even for a pitch or a conference talk or something like that, always start with an outline, always get really clear about, what's the arc of the story that you're telling?\n\n(07:25):\nAnd honestly, looking at things like movies and TV shows, every pitch should start in the middle of the action, like a thriller or like a drama, like Mission Impossible movies always start with Tom cruise doing some crazy shit in the middle of the job right before the job that the actual movie is about because it gets your attention. And so I think that's one of the things that people often try to fit whatever the template they think is. And often in business, it ends up being, \"Oh, what's this more staid, boring way to say this?\" And in truth, great storytellers are not boring and they don't seem businessy.\n\nLenny (08:09):\nI love that very tactical piece of advice. Start with the action and the climax and work backwards from that, almost. Are there any examples of that that you recall of a founder doing that or a story that does that, just to make it even more concrete?\n\nMerci Grace (08:21):\nThat is how great pitches always go. So oftentimes, and this is just every sort of mediocre pitch, mediocre pitch deck that you see will start with, \"Oh, here's the market,\" or something like that, right? Which is like, this isn't a presentation about the market. This is a presentation about you. And so if you are going to say that you're the only founder that could start this company, or you have this really unique insight, start there. Even though it feels like you haven't built up to it yet, or anything like that, you don't have to, you'll backfill all of that later. But getting their attention so that they close the tab, they put down their phone, that's the most important thing. You can still lose them later in the narrative, but getting attention, just going to market and getting attention for a startup is the kind of P0 for any of those interactions.\n\nLenny (09:16):\nI love that. So start with the insight. That's a really good piece of advice. I could see a lot of decks improve having done that. And I know a lot of VCs look for, \"what is the unique insight this founder has?\" And so that's a really good idea to start with that and blow people's minds a little bit.\n\nMerci Grace (09:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (09:32):\nSpeaking of amazing founders, I want to segue a bit and to talk about Slack and your experience there with Stewart. What's something about Slack that maybe most people don't know?\n\nMerci Grace (09:44):\nOh, yeah. It's funny, especially now, many years later, but Slack internally in 2015 kind of timeframe, it wasn't totally clear to people that the social aspect of Slack wasn't something that was important or meaningful to Slack internally. And so people would email us or talk to us at parties about, \"Hey, have you seen Discord? They're coming for you.\" I'm like, \"It's similar. It's not going after the same market.\" And people would actually join the company with some very concrete ideas or expectations about the social use case for Slack. And so, one of the best things, honestly, that the early founding team at Slack did and were able to give to those of us who followed them was the understanding that this is a tool for work. And that made thousands of small decisions instant and obvious.\n\n(10:47):\nThere was this internal campaign that was very irritating to me at the time from people saying, \"We absolutely need to allow people to block each other on Slack.\" All these people who are using open source communities, all these different sort of use cases for it. And I went on a bit of a rant, I would call it in... I think it was our culture channel, which was just its own sort of total shit show, but this channel where people would this meta thinking about Slack, and there was this consistent question about blocking. And so I went on quite a little tirade about how blocking is a tool. And so, yes, if someone is, you feel, harassing you and you would like to block them in the immediate moment, it will make you feel better. It'll make you feel a little more safe.\n\n(11:41):\nBut businesses have an HR function and they should absolutely know. You're first of all sort of brushing it under the rug and letting this person go off and treat other people in this negative manner. And then the sort of counterpoint that I also provided is that blocking isn't always used by people to protect themselves. It could be used by people who don't like you at work to exclude you from important meetings or discussions. Your performance drops off. You eventually get put on a PIP or you have issues continuing to perform your job at work because people singled you out and multiple people blocked you and excluded you from the conversation. And I think that argument eventually made headway with people, but the fact that it was such an open conversation at the company really helped me see that it wasn't obvious to everyone that Slack was a work tool because it feels so social and it feels so fun.\n\nLenny (12:45):\nI love that reversal and coming back to why this might hurt you versus why you may think you really need this feature. What this makes me think about is I actually use Slack for social feature in a big way. My newsletter subscribers, there's about seven, 8,000 people in a Slack.\n\nMerci Grace (13:01):\nWow.\n\nLenny (13:02):\nAnd it's the use case that you don't believe Slack should have done. I'm curious, and no hard feelings, do you feel like they will focus on this in the future? Or should they, maybe in the future? I'm guessing there's just not a lot of money to be made there. And so I could see why that's not a focus, but do you think that'll change?\n\nMerci Grace (13:21):\nYeah, it's interesting. So you are participating in this creator economy that wasn't around at the same level in 2015. The kinds of communities that were happening on Slack would be a Burning Man community, an open source community that was massive and everyone had a weird Linux set up, and so it was usually time-consuming for our support team to help get people's machines working and things like that. So I don't know, because what you have is a little bit of a prosumer use case, right, where people have a personal but also very much a professional community with you as well. And I think that Discord is moving more in that direction. It's a little bit more of a natural step for them to take, I think. And it's funny, because for me, Slack doesn't exist anymore in the way that it did even a few years ago. It's not an independent company anymore. And so I think the question would be whether it aligns with the long-term interests of Salesforce.\n\nLenny (14:20):\nYep, that makes sense. We don't have to get into it too deep here, but I really like Slack for my use case because my subscribers are generally already in Slack. They're at work. Discord is just such a noisy thing and such a new product for people to use. People often love to hate on Slack because it's this big old thing and they're using it for work, but it's actually amazing for my use case, and so I'm going to keep using it. And Discord-\n\nMerci Grace (14:44):\nI know I still have the Women in Product community on Slack as well for that same reason and because it's professional and adjacent and it is tied into your professional identity as a person, but also, yeah, you're already on it. So reengaging your community is more a question of an app channel or a mention than it is having to reengage using an email campaign or something like that in order to get someone's attention.\n\nLenny (15:09):\nGoing in a slightly different direction and into growth, correct me if I'm wrong but Slack was one of the early innovators in this whole product-led growth movement. Is that accurate?\n\nMerci Grace (15:21):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (15:22):\nOkay, cool. So what I'm curious to hear is what was it like early on helping figure out how to grow this thing that became this behemoth massively successful company and figuring out this idea of product-led growth? And then I'll ask a couple questions as we chat through this.\n\nMerci Grace (15:37):\nYeah. So early on, I mean, I definitely got the job that I got at Slack because I had been a game designer. And Stewart Butterfield, the CEO and founder, and I knew each other from our shared time having both run, it turned out, very unsuccessful gaming committees, and being people, I think, who have the same weird taste in indie games and things like that. And so he knew, and this was part of our discussion, that I would bring a familiar sensibility to the role I was hired to, which wasn't called growth at first, it was new user experience. So it was the onboarding experience, signing up, getting started. And that's really where we started with it, was coming at it from not trying to do a specific number or anything like that but a belief that this is a great product and we had product market fit, that was pretty obvious at the time, and so how do we help clear away the fog of war and let people see the map that is, \"Here's Slack, and here's where everything is, and here's how you can get started using it\"?\n\nLenny (16:50):\nThat is so interesting that so much of that was rooted in game design. I had no idea. That's so interesting that you both had that experience. It definitely shows in the experience. So at that point I imagine product growth was not a thing. It was just, \"How do we grow this thing?\"\n\nMerci Grace (17:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (17:05):\nWhat did you learn from that experience of just how to grow a thing like Slack that is user first and the way that a lot of companies are trying to grow these days?\n\nMerci Grace (17:13):\nYeah. I think one of the best things that we did is that we really started with curiosity first, and we weren't like, \"Okay, here are all of our baseline metrics. We already know what's important. Let's just do this.\" Because April Underwood, former CPO at Slack, had this great line that she would say internally, which is, \"No one has built Slack before.\" I really loved that as this kind of mental starting place where it's like, there isn't going to be this cookie cutter thing. And it was funny too, in the experience of building out onboarding and running all these experiments at Slack, to see people copy things from the product that we knew were not working.\n\n(17:59):\nAnd so I think when I first joined early 2015, we had an onboarding experience that had these little circles that would animate. It was very light, too light. There were too many of them. I remember my first few weeks doing customer support in Zendesk, and I would get screenshots from people reporting some unrelated bug and notice this person has been a user for six months and I can see they still have these little throbbers all over the place. Okay, this is not working. People don't understand that they're supposed to click on them. I think Discord has a similar design, but they use the little World of Warcraft style exclamation point, which I'm sure is much more effective. But it was hilarious and also kind of sad to watch people trying to replicate things in our product that actually weren't even working for us, but they had no insight into that.\n\nLenny (18:52):\nI had the same exact experience at Airbnb. People just sit there, copy everything Airbnb's doing and have no idea. There's so many failed experiments that haven't been unlaunched, and we're just trying to figure things out.\n\nMerci Grace (19:04):\nYeah, exactly. Yeah. We're all trying to learn. I think it is very dangerous to say this specific metric is a North Star for every business. I think one of the most surprising things, and of course when something's true it becomes obvious and not at all surprising, but we had thought of Slack as a sync but also async kind of a platform, but then over the course of a bunch of experimentation and user research saw that a bunch of the things that moved the needle for us were about getting people into their new Slack team at the same time. So, Jules Walter, PM on the GRIF team, did some experiments around push notifications on mobile, just getting people in. It's still live in the product today because it was, it turns out, massively successful. It really matters that someone is there to greet you when you join.\n\nLenny (19:57):\nDid you have a rule of thumb how many people needed to be in a Slack for it to start to take off?\n\nMerci Grace (20:02):\nWe had a activation metric that we got to through some initial regression analysis, and then we tested the hypotheses that we developed from that regression analysis and made it into the product. And so for us it was three people, real human beings, not bots, and 50 messages, real messages, not people, because that was our real messages, not bot messages. Three people ended up being the lowest number at which things do start to break. So having a one-on-one conversation is a lot easier, having one-on-one text message or email, any other thing is going to be more straightforward. There's almost nothing, and especially when we were comparing ourselves so actively and successfully at the time to email, there is nothing broken about a 35 message one-on-one email conversation. It's totally fine. It's a series of letters back and forth. As soon as you add one more person to that, it gets a lot messier.\n\nLenny (21:08):\nI forgot about that initial vision of Slack, trying to replace email.\n\nMerci Grace (21:13):\nI know.\n\nLenny (21:13):\nThat's not even something we talk about anymore. Interesting.\n\nMerci Grace (21:14):\nWe never talk about it. Yeah. And now it's funny. I'll see some of the media that gets created or the television commercials and I'm like, \"What is...\" Balls moving around and little grooves and stuff. And I'm like, \"I'm not sure what they're supposed to be comparing themselves to. Maybe just themselves.\"\n\nLenny (21:34):\nRight. I think Slack is Slack now, and you don't need to replace email. I think they found a niche.\n\nMerci Grace (21:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (21:40):\nThat also reminds me, I actually tried using Slack with my wife. It was just me and my wife in Slack. We tried to use that as our main communication hub, and it was a little much. We moved away.\n\nMerci Grace (21:50):\nYeah, it is. It's funny how it's just a little too much architecture, a little, yeah, too big of a house for two people, kind of.\n\nLenny (21:59):\nThat's right. Yeah. But it was fun. We had channels for events and love. We had a love channel. Anyway.\n\nMerci Grace (22:05):\nNo.\n\nLenny (22:07):\nSo you mentioned this push notification feature being really effective. Is there anything else that just stands out to you as, these are just lessons I've learned in how to grow a product that's kind of prosumer product-led bottom-uppy, things that stick with you that you bring to future products?\n\nMerci Grace (22:22):\nOh, yeah. One of the big ones in that regard is the understanding that there are people who are just more social, right? I'm sure you're this kind of person. You're a connector and you know a lot of people, you love introducing them, bringing them together. We are who we are, fundamentally. And so within any population, including a user base, there will be people who are more likely to invite other people to the product or to bring people around into it, especially if it's something like a collaboration product. And so I thought it was much easier to get those people to share the product with bigger groups of folks than it would be to get someone who's just not like that, who never is the host, who doesn't invite people to stuff. It's a lot easier to get someone to send more invites than it is to get someone who's a little shy to even send one.\n\nLenny (23:16):\nSo what that makes me think about is just pick the right persona, an ICP. A person, especially for a social oriented product, will invite people into the product. Is that how you think about it?\n\nMerci Grace (23:27):\nYeah, exactly. It's knowing the persona and then it's also doing things like making sure that someone has multiple opportunities to invite, even though it's a counterintuitive thing. Across many types of products I have seen user interviews where people are going through an onboarding experience, and they come to the invite screen and they say, \"Oh, I would never invite someone. I haven't seen the inside of this product. I wouldn't do this,\" et cetera. That is advice to not listen to. You need to have invites early and often so that you catch people who want to share it, are social people. And then for the people who would never participate in that, they can ignore it or skip it. But that doesn't mean that it shouldn't be all over the entire product.\n\nLenny (24:17):\nAnd it's optional at that point, right? It's just like, if you want to invite, invite, but you don't have to.\n\nMerci Grace (24:23):\nYeah, yeah. I'm never a dark pattern person. I think it was Marco Polo, the async video chat app, did a bunch of dark pattern stuff, I remember, maybe three or four years ago where they would auto-select a ton of people and send them a text message that looked like it was from you. It was really awful. So I'm definitely not a dark pattern growth at any cost kind of a person, but it is like have the invites there for the people who will want to and the people who, even though they sound pretty offended in their tone of voice when they talk about, it's not enough for them to not engage with your product.\n\nLenny (25:00):\nI find the same pattern effective with credit cards for a subscription app and B2C subscription. Just like, \"This is a trial. You can enter your credit card now if you want, or you could do later.\" I find that drives a lot of growth in revenue because a lot of people are just like, \"Yeah, I'm ready. Yeah. Let's just do it.\"\n\nMerci Grace (25:15):\nYeah, exactly. I think people often, and this is probably even a larger statement about human beings, but we're so focused on ourselves, right? I think that's one thing that parents tell middle schoolers is, \"I know you feel really awkward right now, but so does everyone else. No one's thinking about you. They're just thinking about themselves and how they come off.\" And then we'll do that to our own detriment in business where you'll set up something like a timed trial and say, \"Okay. Well, I want to start getting revenue as soon as possible. So we'll just let people have this for a week.\" But the truth is for every week that you continue to let people use it, you get incrementally more people who do convert because their timing on buying your product has nothing to do with your schedule or how quickly you want revenue and everything to do with, where in the quarter is it for them? Do they have a new project that they can use to try out your product?\n\nLenny (26:12):\nI love that advice. Just step out of yourself and recognize people have different motivations and are in different stages of the journey and may just be ready to go. And if you give them a chance it may actually work out really well. I wanted to chat a bit about onboarding. You mentioned that you initially started working on onboarding and that kind of turned into this growth team. I find onboarding often ends up being one of the biggest levers for retention, obviously for activation, and then just broadly growth. Is there anything that you've learned over time of just how to think about onboarding and how to optimize onboarding, how to approach onboarding as a growth team and maybe just as a startup?\n\nMerci Grace (26:49):\nYeah. My thoughts and feelings about onboarding really go back to my experience designing games where I would design the game from the onboarding experience. So there wasn't a sense of, okay, here's exactly the game and all of the game dynamics. But how you introduce something, how you frame something matters a lot. How will someone discover this? And so if you can think about even an online product that you're working on from that first introduction, \"What will it be like for someone to come in here? What will I be asking them to integrate with? Will I be asking them to upload something, to invite someone else? What are the steps between the user and the full value of your app?\" is something that's very useful to think about literally from the first days that you're designing the product.\n\n(27:46):\nUnfortunately, many people think about onboarding at the last minute and it ends up being the final piece of product work, or, and this may be a little bit controversial of an opinion, but I'm not a fan of the plug and play frameworks for onboarding for that reason. I've seen them advertised actually using, \"Here's how to replicate Slack's onboarding in using our tool,\" and things like that. And I'm like, \"Oh God, don't do that because what worked for Slack won't necessarily work for you.\" And it certainly won't be native and feel deeply tied into the product experience, which it absolutely should be.\n\nLenny (28:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I ask product managers and designers on Twitter what software they use most, Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, whiteboarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs, and that includes thousands of built-in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer. Visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up. That's whimsical.com/lenny. For somebody that's trying to improve their onboarding and think about onboarding, are there examples of companies and flows that you think of that are really good, maybe other than Slack?\n\nMerci Grace (29:25):\nYeah. The ones that I really find a lot of delight in tend to be ones that are deeply intertwined with the product. So throughout the course of using the product you learn you get onboarded to the value of it. Probably the clearest tools in which you can see this dynamic are things like to-do lists, where there will be an item on the to-do list that says, \"Click the square next to this to mark this task as complete.\" And now you've just completed your first task and it's really in there, and it doesn't feel like this fake kind of veneer on top of it. I really like something that is not pasted on top of the experience but something that uses the product to teach someone else how to use the product.\n\nLenny (30:13):\nYou're telling me there's no easy plug and play silver bullet solutions? God damn it.\n\nMerci Grace (30:18):\nYeah, I'm sorry. It turns out it's just hard work. The other thing that people don't do enough is stay in touch with the real human experience of what onboarding is for your product. So it's very easy, especially if you work at a company that has a high volume of signups every day, to just always look at the conversion number and that anonymized pile of people winding their way through your actually made up benchmarks for them. It is messier and way more awkward to have to talk to human beings, but absolutely necessary. You want to hear the tone of voice. You want to see the expression on their face. So once a month, ideally, you should just have some sort of a schedule for yourself where if you're at a larger company and you have a user researcher who can recruit people for you, that's great, but if not, just go find people who either fit the demographic for your user or even are your user and have them sign up for an account and walking through it. And it is embarrassing, but very educational.\n\nLenny (31:26):\nThat's awesome advice. It makes me think about Teresa Torres and her framework around continuous discovery habits, where she has this whole framework of setting up count leads, where people could just book you and you automatically talk to a customer every week. And we're going to have her on a different episode, maybe before this, maybe after this. I'm not sure how it's all going to play out. But yeah, that's a great reminder to invest in actually talking to customers. And that's a good segue. I wanted to come back to the whole idea of product-led growth, especially because it's so popular and hot and everyone wants to be product-led these days because it's cheaper and grows quickly and there are big sales teams. So first question is what have you found in looking at companies, talking to companies, advising companies, what are the most common mistakes would you say startups make when they think about figuring out product-led growth?\n\nMerci Grace (32:13):\nOh, yeah. So one of the most common things that I see folks do when they haven't had much experience really simplifying onboarding down or something like that is they'll often have an idea of, \"Okay, here are the seven things that you have to know about our product.\" And one of those is usually some power user feature that an executive really likes or something. They'll have this idea that they want to have a carousel that meets you when you open up the product and it takes you through all of these informational panes. And what's funny is that then if you were to talk to those same people in a usability study for some other product, they'd be like, \"Oh, yeah. No. Click. I'm not going to read that.\"\n\n(32:58):\nBut again, that's that sort of, we have this expectation of our users that they're going to give a shit, that they're going to read the text, that they're going to be at the level of investment in our product that we are, which is just categorically false. You have to understand that people have really limited attention and no one cares about your product the way that you do. And so it can feel like you're dumbing it down or oversimplifying. And if you don't feel that way about your onboarding, about the growth work that you're doing, it's probably too complex.\n\nLenny (33:34):\nDo you find that if you have a carousel, something's gone wrong? Or are there times when a carousel and a little guide makes sense?\n\nMerci Grace (33:41):\nIf the carousel is in a product where that's the modality of the product, so I could see a carousel, honestly, working for something like Tinder, where that's basically what the product is, right, you're swiping through it, sure, you can use a carousel for that, right? But only because it matches the user experience of the core product. But most apps that use carousels at the beginning, it is actually this pane that's built to be dismissed quickly.\n\nLenny (34:15):\nInteresting. So what should people do when they're just like, \"Oh, you're going to create this whole introduction carousel\"? Is your advice simplified such that you don't really need that, broadly?\n\nMerci Grace (34:26):\nIf you haven't been able to talk someone out of it, you can always show them. So I'm a huge fan of learning without shipping and building paper prototypes or building prototype in Figma, or ProtoPie, or something like that, and just do a bake off and prove the point, not with you saying, \"Hey, CEO, you're wrong about X, Y, Z. We shouldn't have this three image carousel.\" Just come up with some different alternatives, like tool tips that are embedded in product, things that are obvious next steps that you can guide people to within a sort of constrained user experience, and then you'll just be able to actually compare whether people understood it, experience A, or whether more people understood experience B. And it can be shockingly clear.\n\nLenny (35:18):\nAwesome. Yeah. I think in that you can probably tell people aren't going to want to sit through a carousel and check every step. They're just like, \"Leave me alone. I'm going to figure it out.\"\n\nMerci Grace (35:26):\nYeah. Or even ask someone, \"Oh, what was the last carousel that you remember?\"\n\nLenny (35:33):\n\"That you finished?\"\n\nMerci Grace (35:34):\nYeah. Just like, \"What was the last one?\"\n\nLenny (35:36):\nRight.\n\nMerci Grace (35:37):\n\"Oh, that's right. I always close them.\"\n\nLenny (35:40):\nI love that. Coming back to product-led growth and figuring out how to do that well, what are signs that your product and just general business can be product-led versus like, \"Okay, we're going to try it. It's probably not going to work out. We're probably going to have to hire salespeople quickly\"?\n\nMerci Grace (35:56):\nIdeally, that's something that you've thought about pretty deeply before you even started to code the product, because whether you thought about it consciously or not, you have already decided whether it is going to be product-led or sales-led. If it is the type of a solution that you need buy-in from the head of HR to use because you need to integrate with systems that have a lot of PII in them and no IC has the keys to that system at any size of a company, boom, you know have a sales-led motion. That is what it is.\n\n(36:32):\nAnd so I think just having that sort of objective distance to your own product is always a fruitful kind of place to begin. If you have a product that even if it's for a specific function but anyone at any seniority level in that function could pick it up to use it, so DevTools are probably the most successful product-led growth companies that we don't talk about being product-led, but that's totally how they grow. A junior engineer or a really senior engineer can pick up some dev tool and play around with it and start using it, decide to take it into work or not.\n\n(37:09):\nSo anything that you can pick up without needing to have the keys to Dad's Porsche in order to test out can be product-led. More and more I'm also seeing companies that have a enterprise sales motion to capture the customer at the point of adoption, but then they want to use product-led growth frameworks or tools to expand their usage to either drive up retention or to actually expand the number of seats and the number of departments that are using that tool. And that's actually a very good use for all of the same sort of frameworks and user experience concepts.\n\nLenny (37:53):\nWe're throwing out a lot of these terms, and I realize it might be helpful just to try to set a little context. I don't know if you have a clean definition of these things, but how do you define product-led versus bottom-up versus sales-driven, I think is pretty obvious, but how do you define these terms and think about them?\n\nMerci Grace (38:10):\nYeah. For product-led, I think about it being something that anyone can get value out of your tool immediately and that the tool doesn't need to be augmented by a conversation, or a webinar, or anything like that with someone else in order for them to get to a certain threshold of value. Often you learn a lot as a business from doing a white-glove onboarding for certain personas, and they didn't need you to do that, but you wanted to do it. So, that's still really product-led.\n\n(38:46):\nAnd then it's funny, bottoms-up is often used in exactly the same way, but I would think of bottoms-up as being not just product-led but also something that can be adopted by anyone at any level within the organization. So there's tools for people managers, like a range, and a bunch of other ones, whereas a manager is running their one-on-ones, getting feedback from their team, et cetera, using this tool. That's a product-led tool often, but that's not really bottoms-up, because in order to grow that tool, you need to do a very good job of finding where managers are in businesses, targeting them, retargeting, and doing things to specifically reach out to someone in that particular function. Whereas, bottoms-up should be literally anyone at a 500 person company could start using this.\n\nLenny (39:40):\nGot it. That's really helpful. I imagine the Venn diagram overlap of product-led and bottom-up is very overlapped. But in theory, you could have a sales-driven bottom-up strategy or a product-led top-down strategy. Is that right?\n\nMerci Grace (39:57):\nYeah. Mm-hmm.\n\nLenny (39:58):\nVery cool. Okay. So we've talked through the context and just definitions of these things, when a company can be product-led. It sounds like the main thing you look for is can an individual adopt this product at a company? That's like a sign that this can be product-led.\n\nMerci Grace (39:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (40:14):\nIs there anything else that you think is important that if these things don't exist, you should probably not try to be product-led?\n\nMerci Grace (40:23):\nYeah. The other one that I don't hear people talk about very often is whether there's really day zero value in the tool. This is something that came up for me a lot when I was looking at a lot of these sort of video apps. So both the Presence app, where you're replicating a kind of office experience, or pre-pandemic, now I think this use case is a little more obvious, but pre-pandemic, getting on video chat with someone. And what it does is creates an automatic transcript of your meeting.\n\n(40:55):\nThere isn't necessarily a lot of day zero value from doing one meeting on a tool like that, but often the pitch would be, \"Hey, in six months or three months, you'll be glad that you recorded the transcripts for all of these interviews that you did because of X, Y, Z reason.\" That is not something that is valuable if they've been using it for months. It is not something that can be product-led because there's product-led in one direction, there's product-led back out in that same direction. And that can be the frustrating part about product-led growth is that the easier you make it to come in, also the easier it can be to leave.\n\nLenny (41:37):\nGot it. So you're finding that it's really important for people that adopt it to stick around. And basically, finding value immediately is a way to increase retention and keep people around. And you're finding that if people don't stick around, it's not really going to work. And you need people there, salespeople, basically, keeping them on the product and using it.\n\nMerci Grace (41:55):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (41:56):\nVery cool. Eventually most companies end up hiring a salesperson. I was doing some research on this, and I found 100% of product-led growth companies hire a salesperson and a massive sales team eventually, like 100%. Do you have any thoughts, insights, experience on when it might make sense to bring in that first salesperson?\n\nMerci Grace (42:13):\nYeah. So founders are always selling. So even from the time that you have your very first alpha customers. And it's funny, because I often reference actually the post that you did about how to find your first fast B2B customers.\n\nLenny (42:28):\nHow recursive.\n\nMerci Grace (42:29):\nYeah, I know, and here we are again. It's all in that initial network, right? So the founder is always the first salesperson. So in that way it is often the case that one of the first three or four people who work in a company is actually a salesperson. But the point at which you should start to hire someone else to do that is when you, as the founder, absolutely cannot meet the demand even though you're getting up really early and staying up really late and building your investing deck on the weekend instead so you can continue to meet with customers.\n\n(43:01):\nAnd then the other time to do that, apart from just being maxed out, is when you are moving in to and usually up to a customer that both wants and expects to meet with a salesperson. That was what we went through at Slack, was moving from that engineer-driven SMB motion to then getting adopted at companies that really wanted to have a conversation with someone before they continue to spend a lot of money on their product. I think that's one of the things that maybe younger founders or people who haven't worked at enterprise companies before can discount is the customer preference. And then actually there's a whole set of customers that literally have to talk to someone before they can buy anything or just really want to.\n\nLenny (43:51):\nI've never heard of it put that way where the customer is looking to talk to a salesperson and pull the sales team out of you. Interesting.\n\nMerci Grace (43:58):\nYeah. And those are, of course, the salespeople's favorite person to talk to. It's like anyone, it's like you want to talk to someone who actually wants to talk to you.\n\nLenny (44:07):\nI like that. So the advice is high-level. Wait until you just can't do sales as a founder and/or wait for the fact that the companies you're selling to are just expecting a salesperson or a sales team to support them.\n\nMerci Grace (44:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (44:21):\nAwesome. So that reminds me of another topic I wanted to make sure we chatted about, which is hiring. We were tweeting a bit about this, about the team that you built at Slack and how epic that alumni class is. We're going to have Fareed on here, who worked for you for a while. And so I wanted to get your insights on just, what do you look for when you're hiring people? How do you find/select/keep amazing talents on a team when you're building a company like Slack?\n\nMerci Grace (44:46):\nYeah, I think a lot of it is the approach is not an exam that I'm proctoring, right, when I'm hiring a role. I'm not sitting in an ivory tower in the seat of judgment. What I'm trying to do is to make sure that whoever I offer the role to wants to take it and will thrive at the company, that they're the right kind of person for the role, especially in product where someone who's a super successful PM at Lyst is not necessarily going to be a super successful PM at Slack, or at Airbnb, or at Pinterest, even though if you think about that class or that cohort of companies, we would've all applied to each other's companies. In fact, I think I actually got rejected by Airbnb on three different occasions throughout the course of-\n\nLenny (45:40):\nOh, boy.\n\nMerci Grace (45:40):\n... different years. Because I love travel and it's a great company. But I think there was just something about, I probably would not have been successful in the same way I was at Slack if I had had one of those roles. So I think understanding that it is a two-way street, and when a hiring manager has that vibe, they're going to end up, I think, hiring people who are just positioned to thrive at that company, because you're not saying, \"Oh, here's someone that I can get and I can pop them into this power structure that means something to me.\" It's finding someone like Fareed and saying, \"Okay, I could see you having a long and really successful career at this company because of your curiosity, because you're a great communicator, because anyone who's ever worked with you would immediately work with you again.\" And those are things that I think if you're like, \"Let's do this whiteboarding exercise and I'm going to talk down to you,\" you never end up finding out about someone.\n\nLenny (46:38):\nGot it. So a lot of it is particular to the company, understanding the culture, how they work and finding that fit for person, like person, company, product market fit.\n\nMerci Grace (46:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (46:47):\nAre there any universal things that you look for that maybe other people may not look for, things that you've learned of just like, \"Oh, I'm going to make sure these habits/traits/behaviors exist?\"\n\nMerci Grace (46:58):\nYeah. I always ask people to do, for an ICPM... World's different if you're hiring a director or a VP. For a standard PM role, I always make people do work. I think we've gone back and forth on Twitter about this. And it's funny, it's definitely something that it's just in the last, I don't know, five or six years, I feel like people are really pushing back on doing what they I think unfairly characterize as free work for a company. I treated this out, but I mean, if you don't want to even do three hours of free work for a company, you probably don't want to work at that company. It's this weird, if you need to be paid for every second of effort that you're putting in, I mean, you probably shouldn't be near a startup in that case because, I hate to break it to you, but the startup that you're at might not be successful and then you will have done all of this work for \"nothing.\"\n\n(47:57):\nAnd so I really use that as a way to see into how someone thinks, the quality of the solutions that they bring, how they communicate. There's just so much bundled up in giving someone an actual problem, ideally to pick, not one that's assigned to them, but, \"Here's three different problems.\" Because you learn a lot about someone from every choice that they make. I think that's probably my most controversial hiring topic, but I've found a very direct relationship between the people who just really kicked ass on this, went on to be very successful and lead organizations at Slack.\n\nLenny (48:32):\nAnd you're specifically referring to the project that they do, right, on their own time?\n\nMerci Grace (48:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (48:36):\nWhat did you look for in their results of their project?\n\nMerci Grace (48:40):\nThe quality of the solution. Something like Slack is not a deeply technical product, but I was a little bit surprised to see a number of smart people who'd worked at good companies who decided that, \"Okay, it's magic wand time.\" And now assuming that, for instance, Slack bot was a state machine that had a bunch of contacts and would have this almost NLP-driven conversation with you. So that was a big red flag to me, for someone just not... And it's funny because I'm not like an engineer and I wouldn't even think of myself as a \"technical PM.\" But PMs have to know basics of how the tools work and what would work in the tool. So, that's a big one.\n\n(49:34):\nWhether someone was able to tell a compelling story was huge, especially at Slack, which was a very product-driven company, a very narrative-driven company. If you were going to present data, it needed to be within a very specific context. And it wasn't a company where the number always won. It was a company where the story always won. And so if someone did a great job of structuring a narrative, they had technically possible but also creative solutions and they picked one for good reasons, they would know how to measure it and how to build something like that, they were just going to be much better than someone who didn't hit literally every single one of those things at a high-level.\n\nLenny (50:21):\nI like your point about Slack being story-driven and how people with a great story often win. Is that a part of the Slack culture and how Slack works?\n\nMerci Grace (50:31):\nI think it's still probably that way. It was a huge part of the culture when I was there, when it was the initial founding team and an independent company as well. So who knows what will be successful for them within Salesforce? I think it's quite literally a different company now.\n\nLenny (50:49):\nWhoever has the best CRM wins. That's really the point.\n\nMerci Grace (50:54):\nYeah, exactly. The good leads.\n\nLenny (50:55):\nYeah. So we've been talking about hiring, and I want to come back to the growth element. So you built the growth team at Slack. How did you think about building out a growth team? And I'm also curious, just when should a company bring in a first head of growth?\n\nMerci Grace (51:13):\nYeah, yeah. It is time to start working on growth when you feel like you have product market fit. It doesn't have to be totally perfect because you absolutely use a growth team to really accelerate and improve your product market fit. That is a part of the value of the growth team. But you do need to feel like, \"Okay, once we...\" Even if it's do a white-glove onboarding with people, if I spend 20 minutes with you and I show you my tool and I explain how it works, wow, you really get it. You want to pay me money for it. You're still using it six months later, you're ready for a GRIF team. You don't have to have all of your ducks in a row. You don't have to have everything instrumented.\n\n(51:59):\nAnd then what I often tell people is that, \"Your first PM to touch growth or just engineer or PMM to work on, it should be someone who has a lot of trust at the company and who really loves and understands your customer.\" Because a lot of the growth stuff is pretty straightforward. It's a funnel, right? There's a lot of fantastic classes like Reforge. There's a lot of writing on the internet about how to do it. But to a certain extent, everyone is inventing the specific things that work really well for their customer and their product.\n\nLenny (52:35):\nSo you co-founded Women in Product, which is an organization as an outsider I've been incredibly impressed with, and I'm trying as often as possible to collaborate with the community. There's all these local chapters, and everyone I've ever met that's in the community has been incredible. And so I'm curious as a product leader, as a founder looking to bring in more women and have a more diverse product management org, or just org in general, what are one to two things that folks can do? The obvious answer, I imagine, is hire more women. Is there other advice you could share with folks that are trying to have a more diverse company and product team?\n\nMerci Grace (53:08):\nYeah, it's funny, I don't think it's always hiring more women because not all women are friends to other women, and they may in fact relish their position as the only girl. I think on Reddit it's like the, \"I'm not like the other girl's name,\" or whatever. You could easily get someone in like that and she can actually actively turn off other women.\n\nLenny (53:31):\nOh, wow.\n\nMerci Grace (53:31):\nOne of the interesting things that I've seen about hiring women is that women do tend to be less aggressive and risk seeking than men do. I really didn't want that to be true, and I think I'm an outlier in being a multiple time founder and things like that. I have a risk profile that I have been bummed to see is not something that's widely shared by other women. And so I think part of it is that you, if you're just looking at passive inbound or through referrals or things like that, you're just going to end up with fewer women in your pipeline and you are going to close women, I think, at a lower conversion rate than you close men, especially if you're an earlier or riskier business.\n\n(54:21):\nAnd so in order to offset that, you just need to go interview a lot of women and not blame it on the pipeline. You need to actually go seek them out and find them. And then once you do, it can be this really self-reinforcing mechanism. The way that a lot of diversity initiatives that companies work is that it's one thing to have a team of all white men, but if you have two African American people in your first 20 people, you could have a lot more diversity and not even amongst just that one group. Women want to work with other women, but men of all races I think look at an organization, but let's say it's all white people, but there's a few women, they may look at it as just a more diverse, more friendly place and be less intimidated to be, for instance, the first person of color who works there.\n\nLenny (55:16):\nThat makes me think about Slack. Early on, it was one of the most diverse teams that I'd seen. Is that relatively accurate?\n\nMerci Grace (55:22):\nYeah. We spent a lot of time on that pipeline, making sure that there were a lot of people who got interviewed. And it was never like an excuse as to not find someone. Then that kind of inertia that can make you end up with a company of 50 white men because they referred their friends, the people who they naturally feel comfortable with and things like that, that can also work in your favor if early on you just hire more women and you hire more people of color. They'll feel more comfortable because they're not the only one, and then they'll refer their friends as well.\n\nLenny (56:01):\nSo especially important when you're just starting out to put a lot of time into this. It sounds like that's the core of this is prioritize it, put in the time, especially early on, because that'll create this flywheel.\n\nMerci Grace (56:12):\nYeah. It's funny, I've often been the only woman on a team at a startup or literally at the startup entirely. And there is a huge difference, I've found, between being the only woman and being one of even two women. The tone really changes. People then are like, \"Oh, now we have women coworkers.\" It's not just Merci who also plays D&D and curses at the office or whatever. It is women as this more general class. And so they start to honestly be more respectful and kinder to each other and treat each other better too. And so I think that's like the other thing. It's not like it's better for anyone to be in a homogenous group. I think it's actually better for everyone to be in a more diverse group because the sort of baseline for how you treat each other goes up.\n\nLenny (57:07):\nSpeaking of founders and startups, you're working on something now. For people maybe interested in working with you or maybe even potential customers, is there anything that you want to share about what you're working on, where it's going, anything there?\n\nMerci Grace (57:20):\nYeah. So we're really early, and I'm not exactly sure when this podcast is coming out, but if you go to panobi.com, it's P-A-N-O-B-I .com, there is either a real landing page there, or today there is just a Google form for you to fill out that will ask you a few questions about product-led growth, which is the area that we're building in. And if you're someone who is curious about product-led growth, if you're head of growth at a company, if you're a CEO, or a founder, or an investor who's interested in finding out more, picking up maybe even a tool to help you be successful at it, go to panobi.com, and you can also just DM me on Twitter.\n\nLenny (58:02):\nSpeaking of that, where can folks find you online? How do they reach out? And then also just how can the audience be useful to you?\n\nMerci Grace (58:11):\nOh, that's nice. So you can find me online. On Twitter, I think, is probably my best sort of public inbox. My DMs are open. I do respond to them, especially if it's something direct that I can be helpful with. If you are a woman in product management, go to womeninproduct.com and you can apply to join our community. We've been going since 2015, and there's many people who are in it as well. And then, yeah, if you're interested in growth more generally go to panobi.com.\n\nLenny (58:40):\nAmazing. Merci, thank you so much for joining me. I had a ton of fun. I learned a ton, and thank you.\n\nMerci Grace (58:46):\nLikewise, Lenny. Thank you.\n\nLenny (58:50):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening.
