It was just this heartbreaking moment where in the feed you were seeing all these people, by no fault of their own, starting to post that they've lost their job. We started seeing in our data is you had some areas like maybe hospitality was really getting hit, but some areas like customer service that just couldn't hire enough. You'd think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly. You'd think, okay, maybe these people will start moving to other jobs, but it wasn't happening.\n\n(00:00:24):\nA large reason behind this, people are used to looking for certain particular titles, and they didn't start realizing other people could do this job. We made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system. I think that the job market is rebalancing, but it's being done, the pathways are being done in a very different way that seems to be maybe a change that holds through these ups and downs. That'll be very interesting to see.\n\nLenny (00:00:57):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today, my guest is Hari Srinivasan. This episode has a hilarious story.\n\n(00:01:11):\nOn Twitter, an account called The Curious PM tagged me with a request to have someone from LinkedIn come on the podcast and talk about how they operate and what they've learned about building products that serve so many different types of customers. I replied asking for any suggestions for who he thought I should specifically talk to, and he suggested Hari Srinivasan, by doing some research on LinkedIn. I reached out to Hari, told him about this tweet and he agreed. Here's the episode.\n\n(00:01:39):\nHari's been at LinkedIn for eight-and-a-half years and he leads the Talent Solutions Product Team as VP of product, which is also LinkedIn's biggest business, and includes all of the hiring and learning products, which you'll hear about in this episode. In our chat, Hari shares what he's seeing change in the hiring market, what you can do to improve your odds of finding a job through LinkedIn, what he's learned about building and maintaining really complex systems like LinkedIn, tips for getting into product management, and some lessons from his own course on product management. Plus, we also talk about how LinkedIn has been able to become a real source of valuable content and a lot less cringe over the past couple years, which I've definitely noticed and I share in our chat.\n\n(00:02:20):\nWhat a fun series of events that led to this episode. Big thank you to Jatin, hopefully, I'm pronouncing your name correctly, the guy behind the Curious PM account, for making this all happen. With that, I bring you Hari Srinivasan after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:35):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing-up template, that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team.\n\n(00:03:05):\nI've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people have published in the Miroverse. When you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wire frames, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. I actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's miro.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:45):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage.\n\n(00:04:11):\nBrave Search is the fastest-growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high-quality data from real humans, and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave Browser. If you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to become harder to afford these challenges.\n\n(00:04:38):\nThe Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web-scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring, and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's Podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.\n\n(00:05:04):\nHow are you? Welcome to the podcast.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:05:06):\nThanks for having me. Been a big fan for a long time.\n\nLenny (00:05:09):\nI really appreciate that. What a fun story behind this conversation. Let me just ask you, how did you feel when I cold-DMed on LinkedIn, asking you to be on this podcast because of a random tweet?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:05:20):\nI felt very honored. Again, I really have followed your work for a while. It's been really amazing to see what you've built, and I'm a huge fan of different builders. Also, it was a little bit of an honor that someone ... I know we're going to get into the story in a little bit. When you work on something, oftentimes jobs and learning, it's rare I think that it's in the influencer conversation. It's not necessarily something you or other people are properly experiencing on day-to-day. Sometimes, I don't know if we get to tell some of these stories, and I really appreciate you reaching out for that.\n\nLenny (00:05:50):\nYeah. Absolutely. I guess let me just give a big thank you to Jatin Rajvanshi, also known as The Curious PM, who tweeted about this concept and then is like, \"Hey, talk to Hari about LinkedIn.\" Thank you, Jatin, for making this happen. It was all thanks to you. Usually, when this happens, someone tweets a recommendation of someone, they know each other. I'm like, \"Eh, I don't know. This is some promotion of some other person.\" But you guys don't know each other, right?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:06:15):\nWe don't, no. I'm looking forward to meeting you. Thank you, again, for putting in the word.\n\nLenny (00:06:20):\nAbsolutely. Also, thank you to Jatin for recommending a bunch of questions that I'm going to ask you.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:06:26):\nThat I didn't know. Maybe I should've known. That I didn't know. Thanks, again, Jatin. It's very kind of you.\n\nLenny (00:06:32):\nYeah. Okay. Let's roll into some stuff. I actually want to start with LinkedIn as a platform broadly. I know you don't work on all parts of LinkedIn and don't necessarily know everything that's going on there, but something I've noticed that's pretty major is, it feels like LinkedIn's really made this move from being a very cringey place to post and spend time to, it's actually now interesting.\n\n(00:06:55):\nThe feed that I see on LinkedIn is interesting. Oftentimes even more interesting than Twitter, which is crazy to say. Also, it's become the biggest source of traffic for my newsletter, more so than Twitter, which I never expected. My question is, as far as you know, what is it that y'all did right in the past couple years that has allowed for this shift to happen? Because this is very rare.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:07:18):\nWell, first, I'm glad you're having a good experience with it. That's really, really kind to here. First of all, it's very interesting you hit on it. Everything at LinkedIn is a very connected ecosystem. One of the things that we always think about is how the whole system fits together. I'm sure we'll get into it more and more about how we build at LinkedIn, but how you make decisions based on the very complicated ecosystem is actually not very difficult because we're all here to help people connect to economic opportunity. Every time there's a discussion, something I'm really, really proud about working here is, everyone knows how that decision is going to be made. It's all about how we're connecting people to economic opportunity.\n\n(00:07:55):\nNow, it's funny. Just the other day, I was driving. I was in an Uber with the person who runs a feed. He's this guy, Kamesh, who's just phenomenal. We were just talking about this and one of the things he mentioned to me was, \"If you think about what a feed is when it connects someone to opportunity, it's got to do a couple of things really, really well.\" We've done a ton of member surveys on this, a ton of thought behind it. The first is, as you make relationship connections across the way, that is a real way by which people get opportunity. They keep in touch with those people. They learn they might follow someone, and hopes in getting knowing them and getting that knowledge. We got to make sure that that content is getting to them.\n\n(00:08:29):\nThen, when you think outside the network, we have to make sure that the things that people really want, which they keep saying are knowledge and advice and ability to get the real perspectives they need to get there, those are the things out of network they want. We've really, really been focused on driving those two systems. How does someone connect to opportunity both through the people and through the content that they actually want? As you know, when you do a feed, there's so many decisions that go into that complex system, so many decisions. But we've been really, really trying to make sure that we don't lose sight of that and start tuning all those knobs into that direction.\n\nLenny (00:09:04):\nIf we're trying to get even more specific with what has changed, clearly there's been a focus internally. Is that true? There's just like, \"Hey, let's make this feed a lot more interesting\"? Or is this just a never ending and then it's actually started to work investment as far as?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:09:19):\nWell, there's always been a focus on connecting people to opportunity. There's always been a focus on that. I think what's happened over time is we've gotten more and more clear with what our members really want, which is this ability to feel close to those relationships and the ability to really get that knowledge that they need. As we've gotten better and clear in that understanding and we've been able to dial the knobs in the right way, I hope it's landing in the right place. I don't think it's any place near declaring victory in any part of this product.\n\n(00:09:46):\nI think one of the beauty of working with that vision of connecting people to opportunity, there is always some piece of friction. There is always something we could be doing better. I'm always hesitant to say we've ever hit that bar, and I know there's probably people who listen to you who probably maybe have not had that experience. I always encourage you to reach out and let us know ways we can do better. But I'm glad you're having an experience with it. And then to your point, I always feel that as long as we stay focused on that and each of our decisions start moving in that direction, hopefully the product will continue to deliver.\n\nLenny (00:10:14):\nDo you know if there's any product changes that have most contributed to that feed becoming much more interesting?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:10:21):\nWell, there's a couple of things that I think are very special that we're working on and it's hard to say which is most, because a lot of these things obviously accumulate and compound over time. But certainly, there's a lot of machine learning and algorithms that go behind these systems. Many of them, as we start understanding that these are things that people get value by, it's about how do we make sure that we're giving people that interesting knowledge? As we've gotten crisper on what that means, I think we've been better able to build towards it.\n\n(00:10:50):\nThe other one, which is new, but I'm just particularly excited about, we're starting to do a lot of things which are gen AI-assisted. You basically can come in and get some prompts and people can bury their perspective on that. I think that combination, it's very early, but it's very exciting on how we might be able to help people unlock knowledge. There's almost a billion people now on the platform, knowledge of those billion people in a way that people can find and see.\n\nLenny (00:11:12):\nAwesome. Again, I know this isn't the area you spend all your time on, but maybe one more question along these lines.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:11:18):\nYeah, please.\n\nLenny (00:11:19):\nYeah. Do you have any sense of the kind of content that works best on LinkedIn in terms of the algorithm you talk about? The algorithm is probably one of the bigger impact things that have changed.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:11:29):\nIf there's anything with knowledge or advice, I think that's what a lot of people are looking for. Every time we run these surveys, every time we talk to people on what they want, those are the things that really when you connect opportunity that people seek after in our system. You're a great example of that. You're able to give knowledge and advice in an area with a lot of depth. I think that maybe that's why you're having some of the success you're seeing on the platform, which is wonderful to see.\n\nLenny (00:11:53):\nI think I'm actually not getting as much success as I could because I don't put in the time. I usually just post a simple thing with a link and I think I could be, if I really ... I just don't have time to do this of just like, post a lot more stuff within the actual post. I think that would do better.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:12:09):\nThat actually makes me happy. My guess is what you want to be doing is learning and creating and not spending a lot of time managing. Maybe that's actually a good thing. It's actually another wonderful thing to hear.\n\nLenny (00:12:20):\nYeah, absolutely. Okay. Let's move to your sweet spot, which is the talent solution product? Is that what it's called?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:12:29):\nYeah. It's basically any product on LinkedIn that helps you get a job or learn a skill. We have products for recruiters and hires, jobs. We have products for job seekers. We have LinkedIn Learning and then certainly, we run a pretty large creator ecosystem for instructors who post content into LinkedIn Learning.\n\nLenny (00:12:47):\nIs it true that this is the biggest business within LinkedIn?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:12:50):\nIt is a very big business between LinkedIn. It's certainly hopefully something that, again, if you go back to that vision of connecting people to opportunity, it's certainly something that I like to think is very, very core to that, how people get jobs and learn skills.\n\nLenny (00:13:04):\nThe feed gets all the glory and you guys are making all the money?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:13:07):\nI would not say that, but again, we joke about those things. It's so hard at LinkedIn to separate one product from the other. It's really the way we run. It's the way we think about the product. It's really the way we build. Let me just give you a super concrete example of that. Certainly, if you have someone coming in and looking at the feed, one thing we might do is suggest a job recommendation based on what they're looking for in that feed. Part of what we have to do is think about how someone who's looking at something in their interest might be driving their job-seeking experience as well.\n\n(00:13:38):\nAnd then when they're looking for a job, it's very important that they know how they can actually get connected in that job. The relationship, the network you build are very much part of that flywheel that go into it. And then even as we start looking at this, you might be looking at a subject and then you want to go deeper on, and there's a course that comes into it as well. All of this to me is a very, very connected ecosystem on how those items work together in order to give people opportunity. We might think of it from the outset as very different things, but inside, even the way we operate and the way we think about it, it's a very, very connected ecosystem.\n\nLenny (00:14:15):\nWhat are the components again of this part of the org?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:14:18):\nWe think about it as two different marketplaces. There's a hiring marketplace, which is, how do we connect job seekers and recruiters and hiring managers? And then there's a learning marketplace, which is, how do you connect learners to instructors?\n\nLenny (00:14:29):\nGot it. And then within hiring, are there subcomponents?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:14:33):\nYeah. Again, we really think about it as a marketplace. We're generally organized around seekers and hires. There's a team that's working on a Recruiter, which is probably one of the more flagship products that LinkedIn has always been around, a team working on jobs, which is, if you ever post a job on LinkedIn, and then a team working to always help job seekers make sure they connect. And then on the other side for learners, instructors, the team working on LinkedIn Learning, which is one of the bigger enterprise learning products in the world. And then a team working to help instructors.\n\n(00:15:02):\nMany people don't know this. We actually have two large film studios. We bring in instructors. We film a lot of content. One's in Europe and one's in Santa Barbara. It was all started with the Lynda acquisition. We have a large team of content creators and teams, everyone from makeup artists to script writers, that we get to use over there.\n\nLenny (00:15:22):\nWow. It's just marketplaces all the way down as you talk about this. Hiring marketplace, learning marketplace, the feed itself. Probably more I'm not thinking about.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:15:31):\nYeah. It's very much the one model that we sometimes use internally as well is, how do we operate as marketplaces inside an ecosystem? I think it speaks to the complexity again of the product and hopefully somehow of how we might operate it.\n\nLenny (00:15:46):\nI think with your vantage point at being at the center of hiring, a lot is changing within the hiring marketplace in the past, I don't know, year at this point, where it used to be very candidate-oriented, where they had all the power and they salaries were crazy. Everyone's bidding and trying to get people to join their company. Now, it's completely opposite. So many people looking, companies have all the power. I'm curious what you've seen, if that's roughly it, or what you're seeing basically in the hiring market these days.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:16:15):\nYeah. Well, first of all, the balance that you're talking about, it is shifting in the sense that there are more seekers in the marketplace now and there are fewer open jobs in the marketplace. Of course, that changes how many applications you get for the job and how you have to look through. I think there's a model where people think it's drifting dramatically to exactly the way it was. I actually think some of the changes that occurred during the last couple of years are actually sticking around. Let me give you a couple examples of where things I think are really changing.\n\n(00:16:44):\nThe first thing that happened was, and maybe in my opinion, one of the big changes to the world that no one's really talking about it to my degree is the impact of it, but there's been a real move to skills-based hiring. For the longest time, and I'll give you actually a really concrete example, it was March 2020 and we were just watching COVID hit. It was just this heartbreaking moment where in the feed you were seeing all these people, by no fault of their own, starting to post that they've lost their job.\n\n(00:17:09):\nWe started seeing in our data is you had some areas like maybe hospitality was really getting hit, but some areas like customer service that just couldn't hire enough. You'd think the marketplace would balance pretty quickly. You'd think, okay, maybe these people will start moving to other jobs, but it wasn't happening. A large reason behind this, people are used to looking for certain particular titles, and they didn't start realizing other people could do this job.\n\n(00:17:31):\nWe made a pretty big push in something we call skills-first hiring. This was the idea that we could translate people's experiences into a set of skills, and by that we could help them really start balancing the marketplace with a much different system. But instead of saying, \"I need to have this talent,\" you can say, \"I need someone who can do negotiation, and I need someone who can really help me understand how to deescalate a customer situation.\"\n\n(00:17:54):\nYou find a lot of people in hospitality have about 70% of the skills you need for customer service and of course, you could train off the rest. We started seeing the skills-first hiring really start taking off. At this point, roughly 47% of our recruiters will come in, explicitly use skills when they start looking for candidates. That's a pretty big change that we're actually seeing hold. I know it's early in some of these changes, but it's a change where I think people are still continuing to start looking at skills.\n\n(00:18:20):\nAnother one was this concept of, there's a lot more people who are starting to look for jobs by values. They were saying, \"Look, most job sites work by you come in and you look for a job and a title, and that's how you navigate the world.\" We started realizing a lot of people wanted to come in and instead of look at it like that, they may say, \"Look, I really want a job. This aligned with my purpose.\" Or even by an interest, I may want something in AI. We started launching collections in the way to filter in these things. We're still seeing some of that usage today.\n\n(00:18:47):\nI think that the job market is rebalancing, but it's being done, the pathways are being done in a very different way that seems to be maybe a change that holds through these ups and downs. That'll be very interesting to see.\n\nLenny (00:18:58):\nWhat's interesting is it's not like this would change on its own. You're the biggest jobs marketplace in the world, right?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:19:08):\nWe have a lot of professional jobs on our platform and a lot of professional seekers.\n\nLenny (00:19:11):\nHopefully, mysterious. I imagine it is. I don't know. I guess Indeed might be a competitor, but okay, let's say it's one of the bigger job markets. You influenced the way jobs are sought and posted and how people find jobs; so in a sense, designing. Sounds like basically, there was an internal decision. Let's focus on the skills approach. What's cool about that is that changes the way hiring happens in the world.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:19:33):\nIt's one of the things that I think is so interesting about building products today is, it has to clearly be something people want. If we had just said we're going to go like this, and every hire was like, \"I don't want to do this,\" or every job seeker said, \"I don't care about it,\" I don't think anything would click. We also have to be receptive enough to amplify that signal and allow it to work through a system so that it could actually be easy to use.\n\n(00:19:56):\nI don't think we said that, \"Hey, we got to go and do this value-based thing.\" I think we started feeling it and hearing it from members and then as we adapted, these things start amplifying as they come through. I do think that's hopefully something that I think about a lot is, let's just make sure that we keep a pulse on what people want and we make sure that we can get that through a system at a pretty fast pace. Because then, we will hopefully continue to be a place where people want to go look for jobs and make hires.\n\nLenny (00:20:25):\nWhat I was thinking about as you were just chatting is this open to work feature that LinkedIn has. I remember days before that existed and people used to just like jury-rig, \"Hey, I'm hiring,\" or, \"I'm looking for a job.\" There's always this sense that if you're open to work, you're not as good. Because why would you be amazing and open to work and not hired? I'm curious if you were even part of this experience. Just, what was it like to come up with that approach to how to communicate that you're open to work?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:20:51):\nIt's been through phases and I think those phases really reflect on the perception of how it's changed. In the beginning it was, you could say you're open to work, but it was a secret signal to recruiters if you will. That certainly still exists, but now we said you could more publicly say it and maybe it'd be a feed post. And then we started launching it. Actually it was around COVID when a lot of the stigmas of unemployment changed dramatically, because everyone started understanding you're in this different situation. We started putting it the frame and that's the more iconic way I think people associate with now.\n\n(00:21:22):\nIt's funny. Just this week, we tried something new and I feel like it's almost the same journey. There are many customers as you can imagine, that have LinkedIn Learning and LinkedIn Learning is typically an enterprise product. It works across your employee base. We're trying to do Open to Internal Work where you can say, \"I'm actually at the point where I may want the next play internally in my role,\" and an internal recruiter can see you. As you can imagine, I would actually even maybe argue more stigma about being concerned about upsetting your manager. Certainly, there's different cultures and companies about this.\n\n(00:21:52):\nI have a feeling in sometimes we like to think five, 10 years out, I think it's going to go on the same journey. That's one hunch I have, that there'll also be an employment-driven way internally for people to find their next play. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, but already you can feel a little bit of that tension right when we launched it and knowing. Let's see how this goes.\n\nLenny (00:22:13):\nYou were talking about how hiring is changing. I'm curious how PM hiring specifically is changing. A lot of people listening to this podcast are product managers. Is there anything unique you're noticing there?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:22:22):\nMaybe a couple stats that could be very helpful. If you're having a hard time finding a PM role, let's start with this, you're probably not alone. We publish it. You can go to Economic Graph data. This is all public. We publish this. But if you look at tech, it's down about 50% year-over-year. We look at hires over total population on LinkedIn. You can go to Economic Graphs and you can see how it compares trends industry. We don't look at the functional data as much, but the PM data seems to be trending just slightly even maybe below software engineers and data as well, which is maybe a comp for this. I know not everything is perfect industry to function cuts.\n\n(00:22:56):\nIt is a difficult place, but I'll give you a couple tips because I imagine that may be helpful for a couple of the listeners. It's certainly one of the larger inbounds of things I get. The first is, in those markets, you do want to make sure that the more you can do to form relationships and say that this is what you can do, which is always helpful. Now, I know that not everyone has relationships, but you can always try to develop those at different places and across LinkedIn as well. But that's one thing I would really, really start to look for.\n\n(00:23:24):\nThe second thing I would really do is we have launched the way now to come in and signal obviously that you are interested in a role. We have those open to work capabilities, but then each job has a set of skills that they're looking for under it, like we talked about in skills-first hiring. Against each skill, you can actually add different kinds of credentials. I would really encourage people to add work products if that's something that they're actually building. You can add different kinds of recommendations or other things they can associate with that skill. Those credentials against it I think are becoming much more interesting for people to say, \"Oh, this is someone I'm actually looking for.\"\n\n(00:23:55):\nAnd then the third thing I would really encourage PMs to start looking through is, this is probably more personal than anything in data, but every PM job is different. If you have experience in that industry and you're able to show that you have experience in that industry or some kind of understanding of it, I think that's a way to separate. I'd really start zoning in on roles where you might see if you don't have the functional experience, the industry experience. I think that would go a long way as how to help you differentiate from yes, what's probably more candidates, or more applications going into each role.\n\nLenny (00:24:30):\nWhen you say industry experience, what's an example of that?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:24:32):\nImagine that you are applying for a PM role, but that particular software is in, I don't know, automotive tech. If you happen to have worked in automotive before, have a knowledge about cars, that's a very helpful way to get in. I think if you're able to show that you can show an industry knowledge and an understanding of it, I think it's a real nice way to think about how to position yourself against some of the other candidates.\n\nLenny (00:24:55):\nWhat else can that person looking for a job do to improve their chances of a recruiter basically finding them? I feel like that's probably the best tactical thing they can do because a lot of LinkedIn is recruiters reaching out and finding you.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:25:08):\nThere's two things that anyone who's hiring is always going to look for. They're going to look for your skills and capabilities and they're going to look for your intent and interest in the role. A lot of our products and the pathways we try to do are making those things simpler. Maybe we'll just start with interest and we'll move back to skills in a minute. A couple of things we've launched recently, and I think they are symbolic of other ways you can connect. If you go to a company page and you're looking at the company, and I think they have to opt into this in some degree, look, you can say you're interested in that company even though they don't have roles. When the next role comes up, they'll have a signal that this person is actually very interested in this role.\n\n(00:25:42):\nThat's an easy way to signify from an early stage that you have interest in them. That way, when they open up a role, as you can imagine, they start looking through, they'll have a spotlight on recruiter and they can click out on it and come through. Certainly, you can go into open work and say that this is something that I'm open to work right now, and you can signify to the whole population that this is an area that you want to go for as well. I would encourage both of those in some ways. If you're looking for a role, be open about it and tell the companies that you're looking for it. Those are really high signals of intent.\n\n(00:26:09):\nThe other thing you can do on LinkedIn is you can actually go through when you say open to work and you can specify particular kinds of jobs and things you're looking for. I think that more detailed intent helps make sure you're showing it to the right place.\n\n(00:26:21):\nOn the skill side, we talked about it a little bit, but I do think there's a big change. When you were just looking at title, I think you only had one way to really prove that you had the skills. You had to have that title, which is very hard to break in. In a world where you're looking at skills, you can go through and say, \"Look, I can do these things and you could put evidence behind it.\" I'd really encourage people to do that. If you just go to any job post, you can see the skills, you can say add and you can see all the evidence and how you can add it. I would really encourage people to do that because when people are in recruiter and they're looking for skills, profiles pop up and you can scroll over a skill and you can actually see all those evidences.\n\n(00:26:56):\nBasically, a recruiter could say, \"Oh, this is why I'd recommend you to this hiring manager.\" I think you will find that that's hopefully a very useful way of doing it.\n\nLenny (00:27:05):\nI'm going to lob this question like a fishing line, to see if it catches anything. And if not, we'll move on. Are there any stats that you've seen of just like if you do X, Y, Z, your chances of getting hired or getting people reaching out just go significantly higher?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:27:20):\nOpen to work certainly has a high signal to noise. As you can imagine, when someone's looking to fill a role, that's one they want. We are early in company commitments, but we are seeing some signal there that we got to move through it. Skills has a pretty high signal as well, when you're able to come through and show and demonstrate your skills. We're seeing some correlation to basically people getting a role.\n\n(00:27:41):\nAnd then the final one that is harder for us to look through, but it's certainly important. I do think we show the hiring manager on a lot of the roles. We show these people through. It's harder for us to trace that because of the way the outcomes work, but I would really encourage people to look through that and see if you can get in front of those people.\n\nLenny (00:27:58):\nIs there a max seniority that you find works effectively on LinkedIn to find a job? I imagine CPOs aren't finding jobs on LinkedIn. If I'm looking for a job, do you have a rule of thumb of, if you're at this level, maybe you're not going to have a lot of luck? If you're below the-\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:28:15):\nWe certainly have CPO jobs that are posted, but the difference often is job posts versus recruiting. More and more senior roles are often recruited. We find that people will use LinkedIn in order to connect to a CPO and many people who are senior will say, \"Oh, I got a message on LinkedIn and that led to this,\" or they made a long-term recruiting contact. But it may not happen through you finding a job and hitting the application button.\n\nLenny (00:28:38):\nLet's talk about LinkedIn as a company to work in, the culture maybe for a bit. You told me that you have a story about your first product review when you joined LinkedIn and how that was wild. Can you just tell that story? I haven't heard this yet.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:28:51):\nYeah. I came through a small acquisition that they made of our company, and I thought it was such a telling moment in this first product review. I went in and as you can imagine when you join a company, there's a lot of advice on how you should make that product work. I didn't know anything. I'd never been a PM. I remember taking a lot of that advice and putting together a presentation and just getting destroyed during that review. I think Jeff was the head of product and CEO at that point. In a very kind way, it was basically like, \"Wait, this doesn't make any sense.\"\n\n(00:29:23):\nI just remember driving home and calling my wife and like, \"I think I might be fired.\" I'm not sure if I was fired, but he was very kind about it. He's like, \"Just come back and exit.\" I think five, four weeks. I remembered at that point I was like, if you're going to go in and you know you only have one shot, just do something you believe in and make sure it works. We started from that point and we worked backwards from there in this concept of, \"Hey, I do believe that the most important thing is connecting to opportunity and we should really understand how to do that. Let's just start from there.\" It went very well.\n\n(00:29:50):\nTo me, it was another way of you're in these large systems, you're in these large companies, you're in these large ... I think LinkedIn is very special because no matter what it is, it's got a very good North Star. It was a moment for me to really hammer that home, that as long as you get that North Star ahead of you, you're going to be just fine. I never worked at a place like that before, and I think a lot of times people wonder. You can imagine. The way we're talking about, we certainly have an engagement ecosystem. We have the hiring business and we have a marketing solutions business. We have a big premium business.\n\n(00:30:24):\nYou can imagine when you're trying to make decisions across that, it could get very, very complicated. I think when people ask me to describe LinkedIn, I often start with that story because I feel like it helps cut through how decisions are made and what is seen as success here.\n\nLenny (00:30:39):\nJust to clarify, so that North star is that phrase that you used of just connecting people to economic opportunity?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:30:45):\nThat's it. That's it. I know it sounds bigger than it seems, but I can probably ... Time example again. You can understand when someone's driving on it. Having been here for a little bit now, you can understand when someone knows that and when someone doesn't. It's a hard thing to lose track of.\n\nLenny (00:31:00):\nYeah. It does sound vague and a nice, fuzzy, warm thing that people can say. What you're saying is that it's actually brought up in meetings constantly and product reviews. You're saying in this product review, everything changed when you came at it from that one perspective?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:31:16):\nYeah. My first product here was the profile. You can make a profile that does a lot of different things, as you can imagine. You could think about how identity could be used in many different phases and what you should prioritize and not. But if you can explain why this is the thing that you should do that would help someone really do what they want to do, maybe it's have an incredible podcast and send that out there, maybe it's helping someone connect to a job. But if you can understand intent and how this is unblocked and why you want to prioritize that item, all of a sudden the world gets a lot simpler.\n\nLenny (00:31:51):\nHow does that actually get operationalized at a company? Is it just the leaders remind people of that? It's painted on the walls? How is that a thing that people come back to over and over?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:32:01):\nI do think it's a lot of repeat, repeat, repeat. I do think that's it. I do think the culture has a pretty high immune system now in the sense that when you aren't operating by that, people can see it and they operate against it. I think when Jeff was CEO, and Ryan, they are just exceptional at continuously repeating that. It's been so consistent for so long that I think it's just the DNA now. I do think it's exceptional. I think it's exceptional leadership, and I've learned so much from watching it and how it gets operated.\n\nLenny (00:32:34):\nIs there a metric associated with that when people use it in a way of like, no, that's not actually what we mean? Is there some way of making it even more concrete in goals, metrics, ways to understand if people are actually achieving that?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:32:46):\nYeah. Totally. I think at the next level of operation, what we think about is, when we run these marketplaces throughout this ecosystem that connect people to opportunity, what are the outputs that they measure? I'll just give you mine for example. We think a lot about number of hires, converting hires. How many people did we match? Which is a real tangible way of looking at opportunity.\n\n(00:33:04):\nAnd then number of people who learned a skill, which is usually in this world measured more by time than anything if you learn. Spend time for X amount of minutes. We do that skill because oftentimes skills don't have a direct outcome as you can measure to go through. We basically look at those things more than any other to say how successful that we are operating that marketplace.\n\nLenny (00:33:22):\nGot it. Those make total sense to me.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:33:24):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:33:24):\nAre there other core values of LinkedIn that are public that you can share?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:33:28):\nYou can Google them too and so they're very, very public, but probably the one that I think is most important to talk about in this world is, there's this concept of members first. I think anytime you run an ecosystem as complex as we do and you think about it, even if you're trying to connect people to opportunity, there's two people, how are you going to decide right now who needs it?\n\n(00:33:49):\nI think having clarity on which piece of the ecosystem is going to be where the focus is, it helps us make sure we establish a relationship of trust first, make sure to understand who's getting access to data, make sure we understand how decisions are being made. I always love that as a principle that we've stuck by.\n\nLenny (00:34:05):\nYeah, I see it on the page here. We put members first.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:34:10):\nStory checks out is what you're telling me.\n\nLenny (00:34:11):\nChecks out. Checks out. What's interesting is the connecting people to opportunity, economic opportunity is not one of these values. It seems like it's even broader. They should at the company basically.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:34:21):\nThe company, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:34:23):\nGot it. Okay. I love that. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\n\n(00:34:52):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform, where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding knowing prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics and instead, use your North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscription, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, on the back end, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo geteppo.com. That's geteppo.com and 10X your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:35:32):\nYou've touched on this idea of a complex system and I want to spend a little bit more time there. LinkedIn is, as you said, very, very complicated. There's all these marketplaces within marketplaces. There's so many customers you got to make happy. They all have to work together. I'm just curious what you've learned about building and maintaining a complex ecosystem like that.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:35:55):\nIt's a fantastic question. I just openly think first of all, just career-wise, I've always been drawn to that. We talk about product as a whole. We always talk about it as a whole, but there's many different things you can build, many different types of things. And then we go, maybe there's hardware and software consumer goods. I actually try to think about products by their complexity curve a lot.\n\n(00:36:17):\nI think that the skills you need to manage a complicated ecosystem versus maybe the skills you need to design something that's less interconnected are quite different. I will get to the details maybe of what I mean in a minute, but I do think LinkedIn's a particularly complicated place. And I do think that the skillsets that you think through and you try to manage in a complicated ecosystem are quite different. Maybe some tactics that can help if it's something along those lines.\n\nLenny (00:36:42):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:36:43):\nOne of the things that I often think about is this concept of cause and effect. If you have non-interconnected things, it's actually quite easy not to have to think about that. You made something people love. I wrote a children's book not too long ago and it was fun. It was awesome to write. Once it was done, it was done, and it was out there and it was able to go. That's a little bit different than here. If you make a change, like open to work, all of a sudden you're thinking through the perception of someone on the other side. What is that going to do? Are they going to use the platform less or more? You're thinking about customers. What are they going to do with that data? Are they going to, to your point, perceive someone in a different way or not?\n\n(00:37:21):\nYou have to think through second and third and maybe even fourth effects and manage that as you go through. I think that is something we really pride ourselves on is, how do we start thinking through these different things, and how do we start measuring them as we go? That is one.\n\n(00:37:35):\nThe second thing I actually think is it does lead to your point a lot. You need a different kind of decision-making mechanism because there's a lot more ties in the ecosystem, a lot of people who just need a way to break it. We've put in things like we have something called RAPID, which is a really easy way to know who the decision-maker is. Just, you line up who's a recommender, who has to agree, who's a decision-maker. We have something called a five-day escalation rule, which makes sure that those items are in. I think you lead a lot more of those fuse, I don't know what they're called, fuse limits, or just systems in place in order to manage that complexity so that things get done. I think that those processes are actually really, really important to make sure that the ecosystem can run.\n\nLenny (00:38:10):\nLet's talk about these two processes. RAPID, and what was the other one? Five-day-\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:38:14):\nYeah, five-day alignment. They've both been around LinkedIn for a little bit, but they're great. The RAPID is just a question of oftentimes to your point, if you're running two, three marketplaces, several different business model here, there's a question of who has the decision? Who can make the decision in this situation? Making sure that you have a single person's name with the decision and that person is ... That is really, really important because it gets the clarity real fast.\n\n(00:38:36):\nIt's more of a personal rule, but one thing I love to say is, if you had three back and forths in an email, you got to pick up the phone. And if you've been on the phone for 20 minutes, it's time to just write that decision-maker and go. That way, you can make sure the concept of an hour, you should be able to get a decision. It doesn't always operate like that. I'm sure there's many PMs on LinkedIn who are operating here maybe, who may have some feedback from me on that, but that's the intent behind it.\n\n(00:38:58):\nAnd then a five-day alignment is, you should hold your managers accountable. That in five days if someone has something that they haven't been able to escalate and solve, that's probably then on the next level of person. But as you run that ecosystem and there's so much complexity around it, I think you need some of those processes in place in order to start answering some of those tiebreakers, if you will.\n\nLenny (00:39:17):\nOoh, I like that five-day rule. Basically puts the clock on a manager to get to unblock, basically?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:39:23):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:39:25):\nWith RAPID, I don't know if I totally understand. Is that an acronym for something? Or is it just-\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:39:29):\nIt is.\n\nLenny (00:39:29):\n... make decisions rapidly?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:39:31):\nNo, that's a great question. The D stands for decisions, but the R is for who's recommending it. The A, who has to agree. The I is for other people who may be able to be putting in an input. It's basically a list of people who need to be in the decision chain.\n\nLenny (00:39:44):\nGot it.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:39:45):\nI would argue the most important thing is to have a single name on that decision line, because that usually makes sure that you can get a decision very quickly.\n\nLenny (00:39:51):\nAre there any other really common frameworks or processes along these lines at LinkedIn that you find really helpful?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:39:56):\nThe third thing is just in how we think about talent, especially in the product organization. I often really do try to suss out during interviews or in how we promote people, just their ability to see systems. Because again, I do think it's a different skillset and a different capability of how we map those things out on a complexity curve. Oftentimes, I think those talent systems will ... those who are able to see the whole, make decisions at the whole, that's rare actually.\n\n(00:40:24):\nI think most talent systems are, \"Hey, how did your division grow or your product grow, your era grow?\" We've tried our best to understand that it's not just about that. You want accountability in the ecosystem of course, but how well does this person work across? I think as we've created telemetry around that or organizational understanding of that, how we've understood ourselves, just, \"Hey, this is the skillset that's really important here,\" I think that's quite rare in driving that kind of complexity system as well.\n\nLenny (00:40:52):\nOne more question along these lines.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:40:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:40:54):\nYou've been at LinkedIn for a long time. It feels like historically, LinkedIn as a product team, the external impression was it's very optimizey-oriented and everyone there is just micro-optimizing all the little features of LinkedIn. Everyone I've worked with from LinkedIn, they're just really good at just optimizing things.\n\n(00:41:16):\nIt feels like a lot of new stuff is happening with LinkedIn these days and I'm curious if that's been a real intentional shift of let's not focus so much on making emails work better and all the click-through rates of everything and more just, let's innovate more, let's do some bigger bets.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:41:34):\nI do think there's two things to acknowledge. First, there's an incredible growth team, and I think a lot of people that go on from LinkedIn in incredible roles are growth. I think there's an influencer change that a lot of people you meet might be growth-oriented. The second thing is, especially when LinkedIn started, and like you said, I've been here a little bit of time, but growing the network is probably a very, very important thing to get the scale out. I think a lot of things people interacted with at first were maybe more growth mechanisms than other systems.\n\n(00:42:02):\nI do think there's always been, at least for the last several years, an underlining line that value is what's going to carry this ecosystem, and value is ultimately what makes the day. To your point, I like to think that they may not be the most, I don't know, the glittery items, but I'm really proud of what we've done with skills. I think that's one of those invisible systems that no one really knows. Like, oh my gosh, that's a huge disruption if people can now get ... That's a huge language that people have created. That's a huge way that people have changed.\n\n(00:42:32):\nWe're really proud of what we've done with values. Even open to work and commitments, these are major social systems that we've wired through. I'm really proud of what we've done with LinkedIn Learning. I would argue it's one of the bigger creator systems in the world. It's these incredible instructors and the ability to take someone who teaches, maybe is not great on camera, and move them to the studio and give them that capability and take their voice out there.\n\n(00:42:55):\nI think there's a lot of different things we've done that maybe because they're more invisible, if you will, or they're hidden in a marketplace that necessarily maybe a lot of the influencer voices may not actually need an access every day, I don't know if they get as much visibility. But I like to think that's been part of the DNA for a while and we've been really thinking through it.\n\nLenny (00:43:17):\nLet's actually talk about LinkedIn Learning. I know this is a big passion of yours. You have your own course within this that I want to talk about. But broadly, just what is LinkedIn Learning, just so people understand? Because I don't know if a lot of people know this exists within LinkedIn.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:43:29):\nGreat question. LinkedIn Learning is basically a way to learn professional skills. We entered the business in 2015 and the thesis was, we think about it as a marketplace again. You have seekers and job and oftentimes, seekers may not have all the skills in order to get the job. We're moving now towards the skills model, but without question, this other second-order impact. I don't think any of us wanted to, if you will, uberize the world. I don't think any of us wanted to make everyone there. We wanted to make sure everyone had the skills in order to learn the skills, in order to get there. Getting the learning business was really, really important for the vision and the mission. Basically, the idea was that we'd have ways to teach people skills that was very much tailored to professionals.\n\n(00:44:12):\nNow, that was the vision. The way the mechanism works is, we go and get the best instructors in the world. We will bring them into a film studio. We will do it at home or in a way that makes the content extremely ... We help write the scripts, we obviously have incredible graphic, in a way that makes a teacher and someone who's an expert who may not always have the capability or the time to go and make their own online course and get them in the studio and go from there. And then the vast majority of people will probably have access to it through their company. The vast majority of the usage and the business runs through enterprise and is a large enterprise learning product.\n\nLenny (00:44:47):\nAwesome. Yeah. I'm just as a, I don't know, armchair quarterback strategy person, I could see where this came from of we're trying to help people connect to economic opportunity, find jobs. How do we help them? Oh, they don't have the skill? Let's help them build the skills. Makes a lot of sense. Okay. Within this, you have your own course on product management.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:45:05):\nWell, it's funny. I'd been thinking about a course for a while, but largely it was this concept of, I wanted to make sure I tried our own product and I understood the instructor pain point. But it's a very scary experience. It's like first, I don't know if I had anything to teach. My own concerns about that. But about four or five years ago, one of the things we started at PM internally was product university. We had our own internal university, which was basically we got some survey, we sent it out. I think everyone told us, well, it's literally the most negative one was people said, \"I don't have the skills to do my job.\"\n\n(00:45:40):\nI remember looking around and I'm like, \"Well, it's pretty obvious. We hired a bunch of people, there's no PM degree, and we've done nothing.\" What we started doing is internally creating a product university. It was a bootcamp coming in. We tried to get from different models and one of the things we really learned was, you can't teach this just through frameworks. You needed to have a series of case studies. You need to have a real series examples. But luckily, we had a bunch of things we'd done at LinkedIn, so we started putting a curriculum against that. And then just recently, a few of us got together and we filmed the actual course for it. It's basically taking our product university bootcamp and opening it up to the world.\n\nLenny (00:46:14):\nYou opened up some of your internal use cases as a part of this course?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:46:17):\nWe do. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:46:18):\nThat's awesome. I always say that one of the things you don't realize you have as an advantage working at a bigger company is access to tons of strategy documents and vision documents and stories of this. Because once you're out, no one's going to be able to share those with you because they're so private. I don't have access to any of these anymore. That's a really cool perk if you're working at a company like LinkedIn.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:46:39):\nThanks. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:46:40):\nQuestion about your course. What are some of your biggest lessons that you teach? Can you just give a preview of some of the tidbits that you might learn in this course of yours?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:46:48):\nWell, again, a lot of it is case studies and use cases in the same way we teach it here, but a couple of things that we do talk through. When we started doing our own product university, we realized a couple big pain points that people hit. The first was, it's actually really hard to know how to validate and what the bar is for a new idea in any organization. I think it's really hard to say that. We provide a lot of framework. Simple things from, \"Hey, you got to prove to the world why there's duct tape in here.\" There's someone actually physically going out and trying to do it.\n\n(00:47:19):\nHow you can prioritize a list of ideas against a pain point, like how to make a simple expression, and how to look through what's an acute pain point and what's a wide range of people use, how we'd expect data in order to be used in order to validate this. Tools you could use to say if this is a good idea or a bad idea. More importantly tools to make sure you've went through the process and how you can communicate it. That's one framework set that we talked through.\n\n(00:47:42):\nThe other is a lot about Damian, who leads our growth team. He comes in and he starts talking a lot about thinking in loops. How do you make sure that when you're building something you can have the fuel in order to cascade and grow? I think just the framework of doing that, how you measure that, how you monitor that, is also something that at least when I was starting and doing my startup, it was quite something I wish I had had access to. Those are maybe two good examples of frameworks and tools that we come through.\n\n(00:48:09):\nAnd then of course, trying to overlay that with real cases. Not always successful ones, of course, too. We talk about a lot of the failures we've had and where we probably went wrong if we had to diagnose them in postmortem.\n\nLenny (00:48:19):\nA lot of the people listening to this are people that want to get into product management and aren't PMs yet. I imagine you get asked this a lot, how do I get into product management? What is your advice that you often give?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:48:29):\nYeah. Well, let's start with how we look at the world, which is this idea of skills. We have a diagram that I think about, which is skills are on a triangle. You might have heard this one before. I don't know if you have. Skills are on a triangle, and I think you need three different skills to be a great PM. You need to be a Steven Spielberg type creator. Something around data science and the ability to really look at data and see patterns and then see the future. And then especially get more senior. I think it's a lot of general management. You have to basically be able to shine and innovate across the team, understand the budget, understand how companies differently work.\n\n(00:49:01):\nI've actually never seen a great PM who's in the center of it. I find the great PMs live on the edges. There's always someone who's this exceptional data scientist and the ability to maybe be a great GM and lead and inspire, or maybe someone who's so creative, who can lead a team in a different way. I think that one thing I would really, really encourage people to do is understand where they fit on that graph and gravitate towards those kinds of roles. Because a lot of times, I think what people do is they think they have to make up for the other pieces of that graph, and it leads them to a path where maybe they're not playing to their strengths. That's one thing I always encourage people.\n\n(00:49:38):\nThe other thing I would say, and I know it's a little bit of luck in how this works, but I think about my journey, one thing I've really found was really helpful is, I was on the first team that did a hybrid SUV in the US. At the time, it was the Hybrid Escape at Ford. I came from the Midwest and it was one of those products where people would really drive out for hundreds of miles and see, and really a community gravitated around because it was a very special product. Being able to work on something that people loved, really loved early on, and see what that felt like and look like and that success was, it created a bar for what I would hope my products could do. It would.\n\n(00:50:17):\nIf you're able to get into something that people really love and feel that and experience that, and really understand what that looks like and what it takes to get there, I think that's actually been a really valuable lesson throughout my career because you can understand the whole path on the way up. I look back at that as really something that I would hope other people if they can do it. I know you're making world decisions on many different criteria, but try to find something people love and really experience what that feels like.\n\nLenny (00:50:40):\nTo build on that, with PMs that work for you and work with you, when they're looking to get better and build their skills, other than go take some courses on LinkedIn Learning, what do you often recommend they do to help become stronger and better at their job?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:50:56):\nFirst, it is that feeling of, you got to own your product and you got to speak up and say this is where I want to drive it. Because a lot of times I think people are scared to do that, or worried about doing that, or don't feel that's their actual role. One, it's extreme clarity on hey this is your role. It's to own this and take this to the next level. When you start molding the clay, people want to come and help. When you start building something cool, people are like, \"Oh.\" They're gravitated to it. But until you can start doing that, that's really tough. One, it's letting people know that's what's expected of them.\n\n(00:51:26):\nAnd then two, I would tell people to just build. As crazy as it sounds, I spend a lot of my time on the side, just trying to build different things. Try different clay, think through different ideas. I think that is a really important skill to have, to just being able to say, \"Okay, I'm going to start with a blank sheet and make some art,\" or whatever it is you want to do. I encourage people to do that because it's a muscle, like anything else. It can atrophy. I really do think no matter what the heart of PM, in is that ability to be a builder, and you do got to make sure you can keep doing it.\n\nLenny (00:51:57):\nYeah. That's actually a great segue to where I was going to go next, which is, you say you build and you like to build stuff, but you're legitimately building a lot of stuff. You have the site, mindofhari.com, where you share all these side projects. Can you just talk about what's going on there and some of the stuff that you've built?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:52:12):\nYeah. Arguably, the only thing I've ever been good at in my life is just building things and creating things. I get a lot of energy from it. Yeah, I have a site. It's called Mind of Hari because it is really whatever's top of mind. I try to do my best to completely separate it from business. I know there's always a draw as a good PM to say, is there a business here? But I try to keep it as art. It's completely art and it's what I want to build. I take on new subjects. I have two little kids and it's fun to ... One of them was a book me and my oldest wrote, and it was a set of bedtime stories we did. And then one day I was like, \"Hey, we should just make this a notebook.\" And we did it. I think it's got about half-a-million readers now. It's been fun to see it take some life and go through.\n\n(00:52:57):\nWe made a board game recently that I know Stanford Design School or some professors there have been using, and it was called Parallel Universe. It's, how do you have a card and then be able to see maybe the card says there's no windows in this world anymore, and then what would happen in that world? You got to list 10 different things that would happen. That ability to think ahead, the fun sci-fi stuff. I make healthy gummy bears. I just try to take something completely new and have that. I don't know, it's probably one of the more fun moments in this world where you can sit there and just create something and have some new clay. Yeah, that is what that website is about.\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nWait, so you made actual gummy bears?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:53:36):\nYeah, we are doing something with gummy bears. Lenny, I know you're expecting a new addition. Congratulations, again. But one of the things I found when I had kids is, no matter what I was trying to do, there was candy and sugar everywhere like any Halloween, any birthday party, et cetera. You can't get rid of it because it was just hard to do. So we were like, hey, we're going to sit down and make our own gummy bear. What I found is, this is just a fun tidbit for your readers, if you open a Twizzler or one of those, about 80% of what's in there is sugar because they're optimizing for shelf life. They're optimizing for what's in the store.\n\n(00:54:07):\nWhat we were able to do is basically create a gummy bear. About 40% of it is sugar. It's just got five ingredients. Honey is the sweetener because I don't want to give my kids some alternative sweeteners. But we have a small commercial kitchen and we produce some gummy bears. If you ever want to try them, to any of your followers, I'm happy to send some gummy bears and hopefully you can check them out.\n\nLenny (00:54:27):\nWait, is there a way to buy them somewhere?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:54:29):\nWell, you can go to Mind of Hari. We stock them seasonally. One of the things that we found out is there is different laws on how they can be shipped, and obviously we're not optimizing for long storage. But they'll be on Mind of Hari. You can always reach out to me and I'll find you and tell you which farmer's market we're at or whatever and you can come swing by.\n\nLenny (00:54:48):\nWell, I don't see it on Mind of Hari, so maybe by the time this comes out, put it on here. Or if you're trying to-\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:54:53):\nPut it on there?\n\nLenny (00:54:54):\nYeah.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:54:54):\nYeah, it's on the homepage. And then when they're stock, we put them in the shop.\n\nLenny (00:54:57):\nOkay. That means they're out of stock? All right, we're going to sell you out. Let's get all your gummy bears. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:55:06):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:55:07):\nWhat are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:55:11):\nThe first one is called Thinking in Systems. It's the one I give the team every now and then. It's just a really good book about how I think sometimes people see systems. Can we talk about it? It could be abstract. I think it goes into real detail on how people can intervene at various parts and how to take actions at different systems. I really enjoy that book.\n\n(00:55:31):\nNot directly maybe a book I recommend, but a book that I just read that I thought was phenomenal, just to give it to readers if they want something good, it's called Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow. It was recommending by a friend. Have you read it? You read it?\n\nLenny (00:55:41):\nYeah. I honestly didn't love it, but I liked it a lot.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:55:45):\nFor some reason, I've been-\n\nLenny (00:55:47):\nIt was sweet.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:55:47):\nI thought it was very well done and there's a couple chapters I reflected on. I just finished it. I thought it was well done. That's one that I'll throw out there.\n\nLenny (00:55:54):\nYeah, it was very sweet. I feel like it got hyped too much for me. I'm like, okay.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:55:54):\nOh, I didn't actually know it got-\n\nLenny (00:55:54):\nI think that's the key.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:56:01):\n... much publicity. Okay, that's it. The third one that I just downloaded because I finished it, I'm actually going to open up my audiobook and tell you because I'm about, I don't know, an hour into and I'm really enjoying it, it is An Immense World. I don't know if you've read that one yet. It is about animals and how animals have different senses out there. It goes through a set of different animals and how they see the world.\n\n(00:56:24):\nJust one of those reminders that we're so limited sometimes in our own perception and how dogs, for instance, they can breathe in and take in sense even when they're breathing out. It's like vision almost, and it's just phenomenal to me just to think about all the things they're probably sensing as my dog and I are going on our walk.\n\nLenny (00:56:42):\nI've learned dogs shoot air out of their nose first before they smell, to clear things out.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:56:48):\nIsn't that wild? They can probably see so much more of what happened in the history of a little walk than we're able to just because of that.\n\nLenny (00:56:57):\nIncredible. Next question. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:57:03):\nOne thing we try to do is watch TV as a family. It brings us together a little bit. We are doing Star Wars with the kids, which is for the first time, which has been a really enjoyable experience, just being able to witness it through them. And then we've been going a little bit back in time. We watched ET. It's fun. It jogs your memory. These are phenomenal movies that we go through. I think your question is on recent TV shows that probably came out more recently.\n\nLenny (00:57:27):\nThose work just as well.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:57:28):\nYeah. The other one I did like, it's not a TV show but I ... God, what was it called? It was that podcast that came out. Case 63 I think it was called? Anyways, I hope that's the right name of it. But it was a sci-fi podcast. It was like 10-minute shorts. The premise of it is someone comes from the future and there's a little bit of speculative fiction and is at a psychologist. It's just a phenomenal piece. I'll have to get you the real name. Maybe I can get it for you after for the show notes or whatever.\n\nLenny (00:57:56):\nYeah, we'll edit your words and add that-\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:57:59):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:57:59):\n... whatever's in the show notes, that's the one you meant. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:58:06):\nI do like to ask people what the most complex thing they ever built was. I just love to understand mostly, what do they gravitate to? Is there something you gravitate to? And two, are they able to simplify it? I think those are two really important skills.\n\nLenny (00:58:19):\nWhat is it that you look for in their answer that tells you it was a good answer?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:58:23):\nBoth of those things. First, did they take on something that was super complex, really, really hard? Because I think there's only a particular group of people who gravitate to those kinds of problems. I do think more and more openly. I think that's a lot of, in my opinion, the ways the world is going to get better by the things that are really, really hard to solve. Intimacy doesn't scale. When you think about how people are going to feel more connected, it's going to be a lot more difficult to solve. When you think about healthcare, it's going to be very, very difficult to solve. Education is a very difficult interconnected space. I think people who gravitate to that, know those problems are hard, have a very special gift. It's hard to replicate that passion. So one, did you do that?\n\n(00:59:06):\nAnd then two, I think people who really understand systems are able to, somehow this is truly, especially people probably way smarter than me, they're able to simplify it. They're able to explain it and say, \"This is how I looked at it, but here's how I modeled it. Here's the lovers and how I went after it.\" Even if it's nonlinear, they're able to say, \"This is how the cause and effects works.\" I'm really looking for once you did it, did you really understand and were you able to crack it? Or at least, did you understand why you weren't able to crack it? I usually find this to be also the most rewarding conversations.\n\nLenny (00:59:35):\nAwesome. Thanks for sharing all that.\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:59:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:37):\nNext question. What is a favorite recent product that you've discovered that you love?\n\nHari Srinivasan (00:59:42):\nI'll give you one more dad one. My youngest just hates brushing his teeth. Just was like, it was always a thing. I should actually find the name of the toothbrush, but you can just Google or Amazon this and you'll figure it out. Basically, it's like it was this Baby Shark toothbrush, but it's a game. You play that game for two minutes and you can try to pick up different prizes, you brush your teeth.\n\n(01:00:02):\nWhat I loved about it, because I think it's what all great products do, it turns a moment of annoyance to a moment of joy. It went not even just like you solved a pain point. It was an unreasonable experience of like now he loves it. It was just so well done. It's like 10 bucks, and it was 10 bucks extremely well spent. So much delight. Whoever made that toothbrush, thank you.\n\nLenny (01:00:23):\nDamn. Is it playing Baby Shark? I hope not.\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:00:26):\nWell, it can. It has that feature. It has that capability, but it is a small price to pay for me to get out to enjoy.\n\nLenny (01:00:35):\nGood times. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in your product development process that has had a big impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:00:44):\nI do like to change things relatively. Every quarter or six months, sit down and say, what can we get better at? The two areas I find myself innovating, if you will, innovating or tweaking the most, one is around planning. I think every company struggles with this. You get bigger, it probably becomes a more different ... especially when we talked about the complexity of the ecosystem. We started this thing where just basically we call it orange and red priorities. Which is, then a lot of times what people do is, teams will plan bottom-up.\n\n(01:01:12):\nThey'll come into a manager or a leader and then the leader may shift things around or say, this is what ... I think we've really started shifting it in a different way. We said, these are the big rocks we got to get done. We're going to get those things done first. We're going to be upfront and honest with you, and these are the things and these are price. And then you can plan from there. I think it's relieved a lot of the progress. I think there's an honesty that comes within and that's been a big change.\n\n(01:01:34):\nThe others just are the way we review products. That's always been a thing. My read is, when we keep our product review process live too long, it gets a little institutionalized and people start making long documents and stuff. You always have to change that every quarter. Basically, I think it always comes down to the same thing, which is, how do you get their problem statement quickly? And then how do you design from there? But the lever that we basically put in place for that was to really shorten the time.\n\n(01:02:00):\nI'm trying this thing, I don't know if it's going to work. But could we get to 15-minute reviews basically instead of an hour and see if that alleviates some of this? I'll let you know how it goes when we chat up next, but I'm very curious to see if this is going to be a different kind of system where we might be able to get to clarity quicker, or realize we're not at clarity and then break and come back.\n\nLenny (01:02:21):\nReminds me of a tweet I think I just saw. Maybe it was an Instagram post of teams that do stand-ups while doing a plank, to keep the meeting really short.\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:02:29):\nThat's interesting.\n\nLenny (01:02:30):\nCould be the next one.\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:02:30):\nI haven't tried that one yet, but it might be something we try next.\n\nLenny (01:02:34):\nLast question. You've been at LinkedIn for a long time. I imagine you use LinkedIn a lot. Is there just a pro tip that you can share of how to be more successful with LinkedIn, find more value in LinkedIn, enjoy it more?\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:02:47):\nThe first is, I do think certainly there's ways, and the majority of ways that skills work is we infer skills. But I think that there is a skills section on the profile. I think a lot of people ignore it because they don't realize that there's value in it. That's changing, but I'm not sure if it's changing for everybody. I would pay more attention to skills as we get more into the skills-first stuff.\n\n(01:03:05):\nThe second thing I would probably do, I don't know if it's that hidden, but I would check out LinkedIn Learning. I do think LinkedIn Learning is a gem. I think because it's sold largely through enterprises, a lot of people miss it. I would hope you check it out. But more importantly, tell me areas that we could get better on there as well. I hope that people will find value there.\n\nLenny (01:03:22):\nWhat's the best way to find out about LinkedIn Learning? They just Google LinkedIn Learning and they'll find the-\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:03:26):\nYeah. Or go to LinkedIn/learning. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:30):\nLinkedin.com/learning? Okay. Great. Hari, I feel like we've opened the Mind of Hari up on this podcast. I appreciate you being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:03:42):\nWell, you can find me on LinkedIn. That's an easy one. I do really, really, really appreciate product feedback. I promise you I take it well, for those listening. And two, going back to the heart of this conversation around complexity, it is really hard to know sometimes what everyone's experience is because you're living in a very abstracted ecosystem. The more you could just say, hey, this is working or not, and the intentions are coming from a good place, and if you have a moment and you're not having a great experience, or you are having a great experience, you could write it. I really would appreciate to hear your perspective.\n\nLenny (01:04:15):\nAmazing. Hari, thank you so much for being here.\n\nHari Srinivasan (01:04:18):\nThanks, Lenny. It's great meeting you.\n\nLenny (01:04:20):\nYou, too. Bye, everyone.\n\n(01:04:23):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The art and wisdom of changing teams | Heidi Helfand (Author of Dynamic Reteaming)\n\n## Transcript\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:00:00):\nReteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer, so let's focus there too.\n\nLenny (00:00:25):\nToday my guest is Heidi Helfand. After two decades in the tech industry, Heidi became fascinated with how teams are organized, how org structures change and how to set teams up for success through that change. She now teaches workshops and runs courses and consults on how to effectively reorganize your teams. And in her book Dynamic Reteaming, Heidi delves deep into why change is actually good for your teams, why you're better off not having super stable teams, how to effectively execute reorgs, and through that, how to reduce attrition, stagnation, and knowledge silos. In our conversation, Heidi shares the five types of reteaming, anti-patterns to avoid when making org changes, what sort of team structure is most conducive to creating totally new products, why being transparent about your reorg plans is definitely worth considering. Also, how Heidi became such a great listener with a lot of really interesting insights and advice there and so much more. Huge thank you to John Cutler for introducing me to Heidi. With that, I bring you Heidi Helfand after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by productroadmap.ai and Ignition.

Great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:47):\nIt's great to have you here. So I had this colleague at Airbnb, her name was Jana, and she always had this joke that she shared that if it's been six months and she hasn't switched teams or hasn't moved desks, she knew there was this reorg coming, there's something happening, something was coming to change everything. And you wrote a whole book about this general idea of teams changing, reorgs, you call reteaming. I have the book right here. It's called Dynamic Reteaming: The Art and Wisdom of Changing Teams. I feel like just people underestimate the opportunities and benefits of change, and I think that we see it as a scary thing. So I'm really excited to spend time with you and chat about this topic. Before we get into the meat of it, I'm just curious why you decided to spend so much of your time researching this area of team change, reorgs, reteaming.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:04:35):\nYeah, that's a good question. It wasn't necessarily planned. I had been working in a variety of different fast-growing startups for most of my career in 20 years in software-as-a-service companies in particular. And I read a lot of books to try to get better at my work and what we're doing in our teams. I have a lot right over there as you can see, and a lot of the books I would read on teams and the advice that I would get from people would be, you really want to keep your teams the same. You want to go for that forming, storming, norming, performing kind of thing. And I had thought about that and I was like, wait, well it wasn't really possible for us when I was at a startup and I was the 10th employee and we grew to 900 people and now thousands of people, our team's kind of morphed and changed.\n\n(00:05:28):\nSo I feel like if you're in a fast-growing company or a shrinking company, look there, don't look at trying to fight the natural evolution. I was just trying to prove a point and to illustrate that teams change. And I was also curious to see, well, was that just my experience and the experience of my colleagues in Southern California? What is it like for other people? So I was just curious.\n\nLenny (00:05:56):\nYou have this code in your book where you say something like, sure, we deliver software on time, we make products people love and want to buy, but there's this people layer that happens that people may not be thinking enough about. Is there anything more you can say to that?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:06:11):\nYeah, I think a lot of the things that I would read about teams just are naturally focused on, well, you want to build things that customers love. You want it to be an enjoyable experience, you want to deliver on time. There's a reason we're there as a business, but there's also a lot of company building that happens in building the people structures and just when you go from one to many to a multitude, there's a lot of work that goes into it. This is enablement type work and it's where I focused a lot of my time and my career helping make teams and organizations successful. So there is this people layer, however, I've thought about this a lot over the years and I think it would be highly convenient if we could just focus on building products that people love and getting product market fit, talking to customers.\n\n(00:07:06):\nIt would be great if it could only be that, but the reality is we're humans together and there's a lot of opportunity to build companies that delight people where they're excited to be included in decision-making about how the organization grows and changes or shrinks. So yeah, there's this whole kind of other area of work that I think just doesn't get enough attention and I guess that's where I live and breathe.\n\nLenny (00:07:38):\nAwesome. Okay, so I definitely want to get into the five types of reteaming as you described, but before we get there, what I find with reorgs and change is that it often leads to the biggest career opportunities because there's new roles to be filled. If things aren't changing, there's not going to be all of a sudden, \"Hey, we have this new role that we want for you.\" I don't know. A lot of the leaders that move up quickly are the ones that seem to take advantage of change and think ahead and get involved and position themselves in a way where like, \"Okay, cool, there's a new position. Oh, clearly it's going to be Heidi.\" Is there anything you can share there? Any advice for people that maybe see reorgs coming and what they can do to help themselves in that pending change?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:08:21):\nI really like it when there's transparency in reorgs. There's a story in my book from Christian Lima at Spotify about how they reorged a large infrastructure team. They visualized it on whiteboards and brought people over to the whiteboards to see the future team structure that the leaders wanted and they got input into the design. We did this at Procore as well inspired by Christian and his story and we had... I think there were 80 people involved in this platform organization that was splitting from two large clusters of teams into three. And I remember when we rolled out the whiteboards from a back office where we were talking about this change for a few weeks and it was scary to roll these whiteboards out because it impacts people's day to day. It's like when somebody is suggesting that maybe you do something different or that something different happens, sometimes it can be kind of triggering. You want to know what's going on. So anyway, but we had courage together.\n\n(00:09:31):\nSo we rolled these whiteboards out and it had the team structure with everyone's names on it. It had the name of the team, the mission of the team, how many open slots for hiring across all of these different teams, and then people's names in their existing team positions. And people were invited to look, give feedback. They identified mistakes that we had in the design, \"Oh, this team might be better over here and here's why.\" And people had the opportunity to see opportunities within their own company that they might say, \"Hey, I'm interested in this, might I be considered for this?\" And then they could have their discussion. So I really liked that the opportunities were shared and presented, so it wasn't some sort of thing that happened in some kind of back room for the whole time. We unearthed the beginning of a plan.\n\n(00:10:31):\nI think sometimes when you convene people for a meeting to talk about anything, it's good to have a starting point. So we had this starting point, we had a variety of different things and I call it whiteboard reteaming in my book and I write about that. And there's even structures that are more open than that. Redgate Software in Cambridge UK. Chris Smith is a colleague of mine and they do regular open self-selection reteaming activities when they're changing their strategic priorities. He talks about this globally very interesting space and it's even more open than putting the names on the whiteboards. They have teams give pitches and this is what they're looking for and they have a whole method for enabling people to say, \"Hey, I'm interested in this.\" I think that really helps because sometimes you might think, \"Oh, no one's going to want to work on this.\" But people can be delighted by working on things that another person doesn't think are particularly interesting.\n\n(00:11:38):\nSo giving choice is important. And again, there are different grades of transparency. We weren't up for doing this kind of open reteaming self-selection event, but we were open to the whiteboard variant.\n\nLenny (00:11:56):\nI imagine individual employees hearing this of just being involved in the reorg strategy sounds amazing. Executives and leaders hearing this are probably really afraid and feel like there's no way this can work well. And so what I want to understand is how do you actually set this up for success? What I'm imagining when you do this is many people disagree. There's teams people want to join, there's teams people don't want to join. It seems like there's a consensus challenge where do you wait for everyone to agree? Does someone end up making a decision? Does it distract everyone from the work they're doing when you're kind of involving everyone in the reorg? Versus what typically happens, it secretly is planned amongst executives. No one knows it's coming. And I think the reason they do that is because they don't want to distract anyone and they don't want anyone to start freaking out until it's like, \"Here's the final plan. Here's what we're doing.\" So what other advice do you have for people that want to practice this way of reteaming and reorging where they involve the actual team in the plan?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:12:58):\nThere's a book by William Bridges called Transitions: Managing Life's Changes. I have it right here. Making Sense of Life's Changes. He talks about endings, neutral zone, and new beginning. Ending: you're going through a change, your team is changing. Neutral zone: the period of kind of liminality where you're like, \"Gosh, I don't know how this is going to go.\" You're not quite comfortable. You're not quite in that new reality yet. You're still thinking about what it was like before. And once you're in that new reality and leaders can paint the vision and picture about the benefits of the new reality and the purpose and why we're here and anchor to that to try to raise positivity. But once I learned about that transition framework, going through any subsequent changes myself became a lot easier to grasp and it really kind of makes changes in any part of your life. I mean, his book is not written about software development or product development.\n\n(00:14:00):\nSometimes we're going to have a say, we're going to be able to participate, sometimes we're not. And being clear on who the decision maker is in a change is really important.\n\n(00:14:11):\nThere's another framework that I really like. I don't think it's in my book, but I've written about it in my new book, but it's called RIDE. And we had a chief people officer at Procore and she's now at UKG, Pat Wadors. She taught us the RIDE framework for decision making clarity and it's who's requesting the change, who can give input to the change, who's the decider on the change, and who's going to execute on the change? So it's like R-I-D-E. And I googled this for a while; I couldn't find anything on it. I encouraged her to write about it and I credit her to that, Pat Wadors. She's awesome.\n\n(00:14:53):\nSo a lot of the times it's like, what's the problem you're going to solve? You have a current state and a future state and that future state might be up to discussion, but maybe it's not depending on what it is. You're getting acquired, you're probably not going to have a standup meeting and talk about should we get acquired or not? No, you're not part of that decision. And then how's the change going to get rolled out or how are we going to do it?\n\n(00:15:22):\nIn other cases at the team level, maybe you have a retrospective and you determine, \"Hey, I think we'd be a bit more effective and we'd be able to deliver at a better cadence if we were two teams instead of one team.\" And if teams have the ability to talk about that and impact and have some agency into how their part of the org evolves and change, I think that could be really cool. I think that could be really empowering. I think that could help us feel more ownership in that company that we're in. It doesn't always have to be like decision making equals hierarchy or the person at the top. It doesn't have to be like that.\n\n(00:16:01):\nBut again, reteaming is hard. Reorgs are hard. You can't lump them all into one thing with, oh, it's all great all the time. No, it's not. It's not. But anyway, we need to focus there. We got to focus on this people layer because reteaming is inevitable. We might as well get better at it because we're going to have to deal with it. If we could just build the software, deliver to the customer, get the product market fit, hey, have we delighted them or not? If only it could be that easy. No, we have the people layer. So let's focus there too.\n\nLenny (00:16:37):\nOn this transparent collaborative reteaming, final question here is just would you recommend time boxing this so that it doesn't suck up everyone's brain power for weeks and weeks and weeks? Or is it very dependent?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:16:48):\nYeah, you got to time box it.\n\nLenny (00:16:52):\nOkay. Is there advice you have on how long?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:16:53):\nMake a schedule biased towards shorter as opposed to longer. You don't want to deliberate on this forever, because especially as you include more people, it can be distracting. So you want to proceed as expediently as you can.\n\nLenny (00:17:10):\nOkay, let's talk about the types of reteaming. This is kind of the core of your book and we haven't even gotten there yet. So you've identified there's five ways teams change. Can you just walk through them, help people understand what they are. And then also, we use this term reorg a lot in this conversation. I think that's the way most people think about change. After we go through this list, what does reorg refer to when it's maybe from the perspective of these five ways of teams changing?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:17:32):\nSure. Okay, so the five patterns of reteaming. One by one, someone joins your company or someone leaves your company, grow and split. It's a growth pattern. Teams grow bigger and then they split into two or more teams. Opposite of grow and split is merging. Sometimes two or more teams merge together. It's more of a shrinking pattern. We might be seeing more of this these days as companies downsize. Things merge together and consolidate. Isolation is, or innovation by isolation. Start a new team off to the side, a beneficial silo, give that team process freedom, great for catalyzing new product lines within your existing company. Also great for emergencies and they just happen anyway if we have incidents and people have to come together, solve an incident and then go back to their teams. And switching. So switching is moving from one team to another team. You can do this at a variety of cadences, short term, long term.\n\n(00:18:36):\nAnd then difference between a reteaming and a reorg. I think reorg is a word that has very traditional baggage and connotations. And when I was writing Dynamic Reteaming, it just didn't feel like an appropriate word to use for, well, Sue is looking to learn a little bit about how our web operations work, she's going to move to that team. It didn't feel appropriate to call that a reorg because Sue's moving and switching from one team to the next. I think reorg again... Reorganization is a traditional word. It implies on the large, it implies top-down changes that you have say no. It's something different than what I consider reteaming, which is these five patterns that happen at different levels.\n\nLenny (00:19:30):\nAwesome. So let me just repeat back these five. So one by one, basically people joining your team, leaving your team, something very natural. People do all the time.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:19:37):\nYour company.\n\nLenny (00:19:39):\nOr your company, yeah. Growing, splitting a team gets really large and then it's like, okay, let's just split this into two, focus them on specific things instead of this one team trying to cover too much. Merging teams, the opposite of that. Isolation. I want to chat about that one a little more where you just have a team off to the side and they're just dedicated to something that you find really important. So with isolation, you have this awesome story of your time at a company called Expertcity, which turned into something people know most likely and ended up being a great outcome because of this reteaming into an isolation team. Could you talk about that?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:20:14):\nYeah, so I've been at different startups that have grown bigger and one of them, I was the 15th employee. I started as a web editor and became an interaction designer. And we were going to change the world and it was very exciting. We were in Santa Barbara, California. So the company's called Expertcity. And we were working on our first product, which was a marketplace for tech support. So imagine you have a problem on your computer, you can go to our website and then you can select an expert to see and control your screen to help you solve your tech support challenge. And so we had the screen sharing technology that we were inventing in the company. We had the web-based software to manage the interaction between the customer and the expert. We had the experts. We had in-house experts and then the vision was global worldwide experts. You were going to be like this marketplace, this eBay of services is what we talked about in the early days. I was really into this.\n\n(00:21:17):\nThis was my first job in tech and I became an interaction designer working on kind of front-end UI flows with engineers. It's actually before the word interaction designer, my title was navigation designer. We made this up. So I was very into... It was before the words like UX and other things. People were talking about information architecture and other sub-genres of design. And we had individual offices. I had all the interaction flows on my walls. I was really into the words and one day I was in there and we were working on a new flow. We had all these hopes and dreams for this product and the CEO came into my office and he said, \"Heidi, stop working on the marketplace. We're not going to do that product anymore. We're killing it because nobody's buying it and made six bucks or something last month.\" And he said, \"Go to the beach.\" We were by Santa Barbara. I'm like, \"What do you mean go to the beach?\" He's like, \"Well, I don't want you to start any work that you're going to have to maintain later as we figure out our next step.\" And I was like, \"Okay.\"\n\n(00:22:29):\nI remember that day and I'm looking around my office and all these flows on the walls. So really these were domains like domain-driven design. It was all these web domains and which user interactions were going to happen and all these hopes and dreams and it was the first time in my career where we were told not to work on something. It wasn't paused. Some people say, \"Oh, we're going to pause this,\" and then they never get back to it. This thing was like [inaudible 00:22:59]. And I didn't get it. I just didn't get it. I cried, I acted out, I sent this email like, \"How can we kill the marketplace? It must live.\" It was quite an experience.\n\n(00:23:14):\nBut then, and I don't know what the timing was, I was invited to be on this team off to the side and there was market validation going on. Our founders and product and others became students of market validation, Four Steps to the Epiphany. So we had built this thing, we spent all this time on this marketplace, but nobody would buy it. And so it was like do or die. We had to shift. This was before lean startup. So Four Steps to the Epiphany was the book, it was the manual, it was guiding the way. And so there were people that had a ton of conversations with potential customers about this new thing that we were going to build.\n\n(00:23:58):\nAnd so I was invited to be at this team off to the side and there was a small team and we didn't have to do waterfall software development. We were freed from that. We were liberated from that. We got to work in other ways. And I remember working with an engineer and we were figuring out how to create a forgot password flow because none of these patterns existed back then and we got to do this stuff. We got to deploy more frequently and the product was called GoToMyPC where you could see and operate someone's computer from a distance. And that was essentially the pivot that I feel like saved the company. Later we went on, we got folded back into the teams and we built GoToMeeting and GoToWebinar as a technical project manager at that time. So taking a team off to the side, giving that team process freedom. They didn't want us distracted from the drag.\n\n(00:24:58):\nWhen you're working on an existing product line, you get this cadence and it can become a mature cadence. Maybe people work in two weeks or one week now, but when you're working on something new, you need faster iteration loops. And our founders knew that need. So it was a privilege and I was delighted to be part of this other team and it was really, really exciting. So then looking back over the years, I was like, yeah, isolated teams, beneficial silos. Again, it's going against green of what some of these books say, oh, you want to desilo everything? No, sometimes there's a reason why you have a problem. You want to solve the problem. This was like, I mean, was this company going to go under? I didn't think of those kind of things at the time because I was just super into the work and very passionate and motivated about what we were building. But yeah, isolation pattern came up and we used it at another startup as well ever since.\n\n(00:25:59):\nSo yeah, that's the story of Expertcity and from my perspective. Ask different people at different vantage points, but that... If we would've stayed within our teams and we would've had to develop with pixel-perfect mockups done in Photoshop like, \"Here you go,\" I don't think we would've been fast enough. That was not good for the innovation that we needed. So it's also like innovation by isolation. It's good for emergencies. I was at another startup, we had performance issues with our first product. People left teams, brought a consultant in, went into a conference room for a couple of weeks, figured out some major changes that needed to happen, solve them, went back to the teams. This is not a new concept. The Chicken McNugget was saved by an isolated team, SWAT team.\n\n(00:26:57):\nThere's a book called Teamwork. It's an old book from, I think the '70s, I have in my bookshelf here, and there's a story of the Chicken McNugget that you can read about where they brought in a consultant and had a very small team who worked in a different... They didn't work in their same plant where they were developing the product. They worked in a different plant. They reported straight up to one of the executives at McDonald's. And yeah, the Chicken McNugget lived on because it was like having challenges in the test marketplace in Indianapolis. So we didn't make this up. It's just like some of these things are kind of like, \"Oh, it's like a noticing,\" and then you're like, \"Oh, that's pattern.\" So it's collection.\n\nLenny (00:27:39):\nThere's this idea of a startup within a big company. Everyone's like, \"Oh, it's just like the startup within a big company. We have all the resources that we need. There's no less risk, but we can innovate and try new things.\" Rarely does it feel like it work out. You're sharing stories where it does. Is there anything you found or any advice for how to actually be successful in this idea of having a team off to the side doing something innovative and different?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:28:00):\nAt AppFolio we did this. So there's a company called SecureDocs; it branched off into its own company and it was just acquired, I believe in 2022. When SecureDocs was happening, I was not on that team. I was on the other teams and I was watching, and again, same pattern. A team was created off to the side and they were given process freedom. They worked in more of a daily sprint style as opposed to the two-week sprint style that our other teams were doing at the time at early AppFolio. And so, one, isolate the team or put them in a different area. We could still see them. We were in this big open room, but it was their team area. I mean we had these impermanent walls between some of the teams. It was their region and they claimed it and they named themselves.\n\n(00:28:58):\nAnd so, one, separate location. There's another story in the book about a team that incubated a product idea within Citrix and they were in a garage of all places, so they were really isolated. But just put the team in a different region, make it that area. That's number one.\n\n(00:29:17):\nNumber two, tell other people not to disturb this team. That's key. And hearing it from a leader is really, really important. No, you're not going to pull them into something else. They're working on this other thing. So people need to shed their skin of the other things that they're working on. If you take a bigger picture, kind of forest through the trees picture, you want people pairing and switching pairs so they're not single owners of the system. So when they have an opportunity to do something that could be really important to the company beyond one of these isolated teams, they can fade out and not be the only owner that has to transfer knowledge and then field questions for two years on how that system works. You want to build this redundancy in your teams. So that's like if you really want to plan ahead, do that first. Have that as part of how you operate, building this team redundancy and switching, because then it frees people to not be the only owner of a system and chained to a system.\n\n(00:30:15):\nAnd so isolate them. Tell people not to bother them. Do pairing and have shared ownership so it's easier for somebody to switch into something like this. Process freedom. Again, they can do things differently. Ideally they report up to someone that really has decision-making authority and decisions won't get reversed. Or they have to go through some complex web of like, \"Is it okay if we do this?\" No, you need a clear decision-making structure. They saw that at the McDonald's case study as well, which is not in my book, but it's in [inaudible 00:30:52] book called Teamwork.\n\n(00:30:53):\nAnd then that group, having that senior leader that they report into, getting the clear lines of communication there is also really important. So not having this heavyweight bureaucracy of, I don't know, quarterly business updates where everybody's making a slide deck for two years before they go to that meeting, trying to relieve the team of things like that and make it lighter.\n\n(00:31:25):\nAnd some of these teams, like SecureDocs became another product at AppFolio that was very, very successful. At one point, I think it was before we went public, it branched off into its own separate entity. I think maybe they shared a board member or something. I don't know how that worked, but it became its own entity. SecureDocs became separate and then it grew from there. And then it became this wonderful successful product that was recently acquired. People come and go at companies and companies grow and change and morph, and that was one case of departures that it's like bitter, sweet. You're happy for your friends and colleagues say, \"Oh, he's going to be a CTO. He's going to be the CTO.\"\n\n(00:32:14):\nThere's this entity. I remember visiting their office in Santa Barbara. It's great to see your friends succeed and thrive. And we developed other companies in that way.\n\nLenny (00:32:28):\nAwesome. I think it's really nice to hear there's many success stories of this idea of a mini little startup within a company, and these are really good tips.\n\n(00:32:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Ahrefs. Many of you already know Ahrefs as one of the top tools for search engine optimization. It's used by thousands of SEOs and companies like IBM, Adidas and eBay.

That's A-H-R-E-F-S.com/awt.\n\n(00:33:27):\nI feel like to me one of the most important ones you've talked to. And this is having an executive essentially sponsoring this team and supporting and protecting it versus some managers just like, now we're going to go do this off to the side, because otherwise no one's going to really take that seriously.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:33:43):\nYeah, I think that's really, really important. I'll also say that things don't always succeed a hundred percent. I've seen isolated teams within companies where someone has the opportunity to sell something, they talk to their friends who are the engineers who build the feature for them, but then it leaves something for other people to maintain later and they weren't involved in the decisions. And it can be a big mess for all of these patterns there. It's like kind of like balconies and basements. You can screw it up too. It's not all stuff is hard. That's why I like to lean into it and I've written about it. Things take effort. The tree is going to drop the leaves and you got to sweep them up. Everything takes work and effort.\n\nLenny (00:34:33):\nWe've talked about the isolation pattern. I thought it'd be good to talk through the rest of the patterns real quick and share maybe one or two tips for how to be successful or make it work well or better.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:34:45):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:34:46):\nBefore you start, actually, I think I missed a nuance and you corrected me, but I think I missed it, which is for the one-on-one pattern, it's actually describing joining the company specifically not joining a team. Is that right?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:34:56):\nYeah. And in the book it might be a little blurred because this is like some of the... Switching and one by one sound very similar, and they do have some Venn diagram overlaps, but I'll distinguish them as I talk about them.\n\nLenny (00:35:11):\nCool.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:35:12):\nSo one by one, someone joins your company or they leave your company. So the tip with one by one is when someone joins, help them feel a sense of belonging, and you can do that through not having their first day be them sitting over there alone. You could have someone have a first pair. There's a chapter in my book about onboarding. This is in the space of onboarding. Also with one by one, when people join, you also need to pay attention to the people who are already there and it's good for them to know when someone is joining the company; that it shouldn't be a surprise. So visualizing the hiring and the opportunities is something that I think is a really good idea. It could be challenging for someone if somebody joins and they become their manager, but what if that person wanted to be the manager and then they brought in someone from the outside to become the manager?\n\n(00:36:08):\nSo you need to pay attention to the new hires that are joining, help them feel a sense of belonging, get them to talk about themselves, which is said to increase their sense of connection and retention. There's some research in the book The Culture Code by Daniel Coyle, which talks about that. But then it's also important to coach the people through change that are already at the company, especially if they weren't involved in the particular decision, bringing on this new leader that comes in and brings in all their people. So you got to pay attention to different people.\n\n(00:36:45):\nGrow and split is a natural thing that happens when you're like startup scale up and growing bigger and bigger. The first team probably grows bigger and then splits into two or three. So when the team gets bigger, facilitation and communication tends to break down. So some signals that teams might bring up when they feel like a change might be helpful is the meetings are taking longer. You're in that case where it's harder to make decisions. It was easier when there were like five of us, but now they're 13. The work becomes divergent. They're working on this one thing, they're working on something else. No one's paying attention in the standup so much anymore because this work has diverged. And those are a few of the signals. And then someone typically brings it up. If you normalize the idea that it's okay for teams to have input into their future structures, maybe they'll bring it up and decide that, \"Hey, it might be better if we split.\"\n\n(00:37:52):\nSometimes splitting though can create dependencies that weren't there when you were together as one team. So you inherit other problems or you might inherit challenges like, all right, the team decides it's far effective if they split into two or three, but we just have one product manager, we just have one designer. We just have one person who helps us anticipate quality challenges. So it's a lot of problem trading when you do a lot of this stuff. Like anything, you have a challenge, how might we solve it? Well, there's option A, option B and option C. So that's grow and split and it's very common I think when your company is growing and changing, kind of like that.\n\n(00:38:37):\nMerging is the opposite of grow and split. Two or more teams combine together. Or at a higher level, a company acquires another company and then there's a merging that happens. So merging I think is related to when companies downsize or shrink, things consolidate, come together, or again, when at the company level companies combine, one acquires another, gets acquired. How that goes down varies, but there's this concept called panarchy that I write about in my book that a lot of these changes is changes at the individual level, the team level, the team of teams level, department level, the company level. So yeah, merging. So there's a business decision that the companies merge together and then changes might ensue.\n\n(00:39:28):\nSo maybe the company wants to get ahead on building and having another vertical in their SaaS company. We acquired a company at AppFolio to bring us faster into workflow software for law firms. So we acquired a company based in San Diego, and that got us a couple of years ahead. I remember one of the leaders saying that. So again, we weren't involved... I wasn't involved in this decision as an IC at the time. So it could be a business decision for merging at that level. It could be that people leave, there are departures and teams and responsibilities consolidate together. That's merging. So it could be that kind of shrinking that we're seeing. It could be that the company is having one leader instead of three and there's a consolidation and the teams kind of merge together. So it's the opposite of grow and split.\n\n(00:40:23):\nOne activity I do like to do with teams that merge is called story of our team. That's in chapter 13 of the second edition. So with story of our team, each team makes a timeline of... They stand in order of when they joined their team and they make a timeline with milestones of when they joined their team, when people left, and significant events and things they created that they're excited about and that they're proud of. And that they branch together with their newly merged team, and then it's good to get a shared sense of history. So you have these teams or companies that come together, they make shared timelines, they share their milestones and things that they built that they're proud of. They tell each other about it and then they have a sense of like, \"Wow, we didn't know that. Oh, I didn't know that you had built a system like that. We did too.\" Or, \"We've never built anything like that. That is so cool. What did you learn from that?\" We get to learn about each other and then we're together. We're like, \"All right, we're this merged entity now. What's next?\" Looking out to the future so we have the same shared vision. So I love doing that. There's different tactics you can do before, during, and after each of these patterns. Yeah, that's merging.\n\n(00:41:46):\nIsolation we talked about before. Put the team up to the side, give them process freedom, have them report up to a decision maker, tell the other teams not to bother them. Let them work at the cadence that they want to work at. That makes it easier. If you are doing a short-term thing, you got to work it out with the larger entity so you don't create something in isolation that other people have to maintain. There's ways that this can be messed up.\n\n(00:42:15):\nAnd then switching. Switching pattern is really tied to learning and development and fulfillment. It could be that you want to work with other people. Like forming, storming, norming, performing, Tuckman's model, he forgot the phase called stagnating. Sometimes it feels like we're in a team for too long. We're tired of working with these people. We want a little variety. We want to work with that person over there. Or maybe we want to work on a new system. We don't have the opportunity to do that in our current team, but what if we could work on that system over there with those people? It could totally refresh us. It could be like having a new job within our same company. It could extend the lifespan of the amazing employee in your company. So switching is tied to that kind of fulfillment, which is one of the reasons why I made it separate from one by one and tied that to the company.\n\n(00:43:11):\nThe other thing with switching is that you could create safety nets in your company through switching. I just wrote a newsletter post about this yesterday because maybe we're going to have some more changes this year. Maybe companies are going to be hiring less. I don't like the thought of companies downsizing or having layoffs or anything like that, but I think to myself, well, have multiple owners of a system. So not only one person is that tower of knowledge that owns that one system. There's some stories in my book where I interviewed Richard Sheridan, who is the chief storyteller and co-founder of a wonderful company called Menlo Innovations in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They built their company Menlo to have people work in pairs. Not just the software engineers; team members work in pairs and they switch pairs at a regular cadence. And you know that when you're joining the company because you're involved in some kind of pairing. So there's parity from when you're interviewing to when you're at the company.\n\n(00:44:14):\nBut switching also helps build that knowledge redundancy in your company. A little more about tolerance. So if someone leaves, they don't leave with all the information in their head. We had that. At that first startup Expertcity, we had some single owners of systems and when they left, it just becomes a challenge and a setback. And at AppFolio we shared a founder between the first startup and the second startup. Many of their early engineers from that first startup went to the second startup.\n\n(00:44:50):\nI was 10th at AppFolio. I was 15th at Expertcity. So we wanted to work together. So it was that global idea of switching one by one or similar. But anyway, at the second startup we had the chance to do things differently. So we had pairing and switching pairs and test-driven development. We had help to do that, but this kind of redundancy built safety into our systems, especially when AppFolio is processing a lot of rent payments. There's a lot of money. There's ACH going through. Those are critical systems and it's very important that things are safe and secure. You don't want to haphazardly switch people around. You can screw this up, again, that balconies and basements concept. You don't want somebody over here, they will switch every two weeks and have no say in their team. There's ways to screw all of this up, but there's other ways to do it well.\n\n(00:45:48):\nI remember when we were at our first team at AppFolio and we did a grow and split. It grew and it split into two or three teams. I remember there was a loss for some of the engineers who wanted to pair program with some of the other engineers, and they started a regular rotation themselves from one team to the next, and that brought fulfillment. It brought joy. I mean they would see each other in the workspace every day, but they wanted to work together. It brought them learning joy and fulfillment, and I love that. For those who are like keep the team stable and the same forever, I'm like, \"Well, what about that?\" It brings me satisfaction and joy when I see my colleagues. It's like autonomy, mastery, purpose, like Dan Pink's book Drive, when people are really given some agency and the opportunity to work a little bit differently than maybe that traditional boxed version you might see on my bookshelf. You can really create not only products that people love, but companies that people love and want to be at.\n\nLenny (00:47:03):\nAll these stories of team changes and reorg, it made me think about a quote that one of my managers always used to say about reorging and changing teams is that there's no perfect org structure. There's only the best idea you have at the time for what the org could be. And then there's the issues with that org that you identify as you're putting in place and then set up processes and systems around to try to catch that dependencies, as you said, or overlap of ownership. Is there anything along those lines that comes up of just things you found of just like, there's never going to be the perfect way to do it. This is just our best idea at the time and here's how we deal with the downsides of this approach?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:47:41):\nYeah, I think there's a lot of wisdom to what your manager said and your colleague there because yeah, I mean as time goes on, conditions change. We evolve and change. We're subject to different influences. COVID happens. We weren't dealing with that 10 years ago. We grow and adapt and morph. We try to get together and make the best decisions that we can when we're faced with challenges, and a lot of it is problem trading. We have this challenge today. We decide, oh, there's a few ways we could handle this. Pros and cons of each solution. It's like the Toyota Kata, like grasp the current condition. You'll experience you have challenges. What's the next evolution or the next target condition? How might you get there? And then you're there and you're like, okay, grasp the current target condition. What's it like? What are you experiencing? Oh, we might try this. We're always transforming from the current state to the future state.\n\n(00:48:54):\nSo to that, I would ask people, well, how do you want that to be? And how do you want to show up and be as a leader? You want to just be like, \"All right, I've got to get this done. The reorg is done by an email and we're just sending it out, or this small team change. And here it is; it's done. Goodbye.\" Or is it a little bit where you get people's input? And that in itself, you got to weigh what you're dealing with, again. But I like to think about that. What kind of leader do you want to be? Leaders need patience. It's hard to be a leader. It's challenging, but what kind of an environment or vibe do you want to cultivate in your teams and what do you want the people to be like?\n\n(00:49:42):\nI have a degree in teaching English and applied linguistics, and I remember studying Paulo Freire and other educational problem-posing methods of education. We have these teams that solve these complex problems and challenges and build these really cool things for customers. Let's involve them in some of the org decisions that are going to be part of their daily life. Really, you like that idea. Again, it's not perfect. You can't involve people on everything, especially if they're wide-scale changes that you just can't.\n\nLenny (00:50:19):\nAlong these lines of doing things badly sometimes, you have this whole section on anti-patterns of reteaming. I think there's about five of them. I don't know if you have these all top of mind, but if you do, I'd love to hear some anti-patterns.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:50:34):\nYeah. Well, one of them is people always think that reteaming is, you have a pool of people and you're assigning them to a bunch of different projects like, \"Okay, you'll work 10% on this one, 5% on this one, 20% on this one. We are going to allocate the resources from our component-based teams into these different projects.\" We did that in Waterfall like many years ago, but that doesn't really work. A lot of the times the percentages don't add up. It's very hard for people to multitask and be involved in multiple efforts at once. It's hard for the brain with all the context switching that needs to happen in that case. So I call that the percentage anti-pattern.\n\n(00:51:15):\nThere's also, I probably wrote about it like, poof, they're gone or suddenly they're here. Reteaming or having people suddenly show up and you weren't expecting them or suddenly they're gone and there's no communication around it whatsoever, that's another anti-pattern.\n\nLenny (00:51:32):\nOne of the ones I love is this idea of spreading high performers. This idea of we're going to spread the high performers across other teams.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:51:38):\nThat's an AppFolio story. Jon Walker was telling me back in the day that... I mean, he did this experiment. He had this thought that many of... There's one team that was like, I guess they were delivering at this cadence that they loved and they were building this stuff and there's this energy and you can almost feel it. Like let's just spread the people from that team across the other ones and then we'll have that. And it didn't work. He didn't have that. It didn't happen. And that was a visceral learning for him that it doesn't essentially work. And people are like, what does it take to be a high performing team? What does it take to have that magical team experience where there's that chemistry and the people are together? And there's stories in the book. Damon Valenzona was telling me one about how it's like's a band and we're with off each other. We're creating this music together. So John felt like he essentially destroyed that when he split up that team. So that's the story that inspired that anti-pattern.\n\nLenny (00:52:49):\nThe reason people are worried about reteams and reorgs is this... A lot of times it's exact reason that you just shared, which is our team is amazing. I don't want it to change. I don't want to split. I don't want to add anyone. I don't want to remove anyone. I guess is there anything else along those lines to help people feel better about, no, this is actually going to be okay and/or it's inevitable. It's not going to last.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:53:13):\nI think sometimes you have that awesome team situation. It's an enjoyable experience. People are learning. You're looking forward to it every day. You're delivering the stuff that people love. You're telling people what's going on. You have that matched expectation where people aren't breathing down your neck because it's late or something. Sometimes you want to keep that team together. You don't want to destroy that dynamic. But the thing is, maybe that's a small startup that grows and you need to grow because you have a bigger vision and it needs to be more than these 10 people. And so there is sometimes this feeling of loss, like, \"This is our company. This is my experience at this company of 10 people, but suddenly we're 20 people. It doesn't feel the same like it did anymore and it feels different.\"\n\n(00:54:05):\nAnd people, they always ask the question, \"How do we maintain our culture? It feels different than it was before.\" The thing is, it is different, and our companies go through stages. The company of today is not the company it was a year ago. The people turn over and change, what we work on turns over and change. The whole world and industry and global events change and put different pressures on us, and we got to live in this global context. So nothing lasts. Sometimes I have a picture of myself holding an ice cream cone that's melting. Not to be a total downer, but appreciate it when you're on a team and you love it and it's amazing because these are our lives and we have to have gratitude and appreciate what we have because naturally things evolve and change. It's just inevitable. So we appreciate what we have.\n\n(00:55:07):\nA lot of us can look back on our careers and remember those times when we were, in my case, skipping through the halls because I was so happy. And I was like I couldn't even tell you. Well, why was I skipping through the halls at that moment? What was it? Well, it was the people and the conditions and what we were doing and the time, the era almost because yeah, it does change.\n\n(00:55:30):\nThere's a book by Ichak Adizes called Managing Corporate Lifecycles. It's one that many of us read for years at AppFolio, maybe the previous company as well. The Adizes Institute influenced some of our leaders and they influenced us with this. And it talks about the different stages of companies from birth. There's go-go stage, maturity, death of companies. These are like lifecycles. The company grows and changes and morphs and changes. The people in the teams do that as well. I have an ecocycle in my book where I talk about that kind of aging and changing. Then there's a disruption and you have a new beginning. We're part of these stories that are in progress. This is not an unchanging, unmoving entity that we work in. So just be kind to each other, enjoy your experiences and learn as much as you can.\n\nLenny (00:56:30):\nIt reminds me of advice Sheryl Sandberg shared when she came to the Airbnb offices. Someone asked her: \"What advice do you have to deal with all this constant change?\" Like the quote I shared at the top of the episode of every six months, there's a massive reorg. Our culture's changing. Teams keep changing. It's constant flux. What is your advice to deal with that? And her advice was: That is good. The fact that you're growing so fast and having to change is the best case scenario because the alternative is you are not growing and it's much harder and much more painful because the changes are much harder. People get let go. Your business may go away. So her advice is just, this is good. Change means things are... And growth leads to change, especially hypergrowth, and that you should appreciate this time versus be afraid of it and think that it's a negative.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:57:23):\nAnd it seems like she had such a wide vantage point and could see the forest through the trees of the fact that, well, this company's doing well and this is why we're growing and changing. And I remember one of my leaders, CTO Jon Walker, AppFolio, he told me that once too. He was like... I'd be having a problem or something and I'd come to him and he'd always say to me, \"It's always great to be at a successful company, Heidi.\" And it's like, well, yeah, sometimes you don't think about the finances when you're in your day to day and you have a problem with another person or they come to you and they have a problem with this other person. But in the grand scheme of it, how is the company doing? It's really a critical vantage point that we need to remind ourselves of. But yeah, I wouldn't say all change is always good. Your mileage may vary there, but the general idea that the company is doing well, you're growing and changing, you're trying to make things happen, I think is definitely the space I'd rather be in than the opposite.\n\nLenny (00:58:31):\nAnd I think it's especially true for people that haven't worked at a company that didn't work out where they think this sucks when really this is pretty good compared to all the things that could be happening.\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:58:42):\nYeah, yeah, definitely. So we coach and help each other as we go along.\n\nLenny (00:58:48):\nFinal question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Used to work with John Cutler, who was a previous guest on this podcast, and he had a question that he wanted me to ask you. He said that, \"Heidi is one of the best listeners I've ever worked with.\" And so the question is, what's your secret to being a good listener?\n\nHeidi Helfand (00:59:07):\nWell, listening is a muscle to build and to always work on. You got to put your attention out. Focus on the other person. Sometimes if I'm looking down, maybe I reconnect and look at them. You got to read body language and other things. I'm trained as a co-active coach, which involves different levels of listening. So you have level one, which is internal listening. Like if you and I are talking, but I'm thinking about what am I going to have for lunch? I'm in level one. I've got to redirect it out to you and focus on you. So when I focus on you is I'm in level two listening. I'm putting my attention out and I'm really anchoring towards you. It's a coaching skill.\n\n(00:59:47):\nAnd then level three is global listening, environmental listening. If a marching band suddenly walked behind you, I'm going to point that out because it's in my field. I'm not going to ignore that. I'm going to bring that up. So we pay attention to the vibe and the feel in the room and where we're at. But then also if you're talking about something and suddenly you go like this or you have this kind of sudden pain in your neck when you're talking about this one thing, I might notice that you're doing this and touching your neck because that's information. That's a kind of listening, and so I might ask you about that. Or if the face turns red or you look down or away, it's another kind of listening. So Co-Active Training Institute, coactive.com is my co-active coaching training, so I learned it from them, Henry Kimsey-House and-\n\nLenny (01:00:48):\nWow, that is an awesome answer. There's a lot of depth there. So coactive.com, I'm going to check that out. So you actually got trained in this skill. Okay, that's great. That'll make people feel better. They're like, okay, amazing. I'm going to check this out. I'm going to try to be a better listener through the rest of this podcast episode from these tips.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:01:08):\nI will say that sometimes I'm not a good listener though.\n\nLenny (01:01:13):\nYeah, so it goes. Heidi, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:01:22):\nI don't think so. I really appreciate your questions and talking with you.\n\nLenny (01:01:28):\nWell, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:01:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:34):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:01:39):\nLeading Intelligent Teams is one, Liberating Structures is another one, and of course, Transitions by William Bridges. I also like the Leader's Guide to Participatory Decision-Making.\n\nLenny (01:01:53):\nIs there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:01:57):\nI did like The Bear, the cooking-related show, the restaurant-related show, and gets into the hospitality industry. I really like that. Movies, there isn't really one that stands out. I always look forward to being on an airplane to see what movies are playing, but no movie for you.\n\nLenny (01:02:21):\nWhat is a favorite interview question that you like to ask people that you are interviewing?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:02:27):\nI always like to ask people, \"Well, why do you want to join our company? What is it about working with us that would be exciting for you? Why our company as opposed to another one?\"\n\nLenny (01:02:39):\nWhat do you look for in their answer that is a good sign?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:02:43):\nThey have some knowledge about what we do, what we build. Maybe they bring up that they've noticed something on one of the websites or a product launch that we just announced, just that maybe it's part of their story in their career. They're going in this direction, and they heard about us and they thought, \"Wow, I would love to work on that.\"\n\nLenny (01:03:08):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:03:11):\nI'm very into vintage clothing and specifically real wool cashmere, not synthetic blends. I also like vintage blazers. A lot of the times where I'm giving a talk, I'm wearing a vintage blazer. I really like the clothing and design, and I kind of really, really love unusual vintage pieces that I could find, but they do need to... A lot of the fast fashion that's out there today is a lot of these blends with these materials that you've never heard of, but there's something special about vintage cashmere, for example.\n\nLenny (01:03:56):\nDo you have a source for some good stuff? Is it like eBay? Is it stores locally? Is there a site? Is there somewhere you're finding some good stuff?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:04:03):\nI travel around the world and I give talks on reteaming. I do workshops. And usually I go to vintage and antique stores. I was just in Berlin. I was doing that. I was doing it in London. And yeah, I love thrifting, Salvation Army, Goodwill, any of these places that we have in many of the US cities, the Humana line of stores that I've been to in Europe and other places. I try to find the small, unusual antique places as well. My aunt's an antique dealer in Michigan, and she doesn't specialize in vintage clothing, but I just love that idea of discovering unique and unusual things that maybe they remind you of times in the past. Maybe you find that, \"Oh my gosh, we had that mug back in the '80s or whatever, or in the '90s.\" Things can kind of remind people of other times. So I like that. I think there's information stored in unique items.\n\nLenny (01:05:12):\nBeautiful. I bet Berlin has some really cool vintage stuff, really wacky stuff.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:05:16):\nYeah, there's a lot of really interesting places to explore, and I think it's just so much more interesting than some of the brand new kind of stuff.\n\nLenny (01:05:30):\nAgreed. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to or sharing with friends or family, either in work or in life?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:05:41):\nI like asking people how can you be kind to yourself?\n\nLenny (01:05:47):\nSay more.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:05:48):\nI ask myself that too. I used to run a lot in Santa Barbara at Ellwood, which is a beautiful trail that you can go down to the ocean, you come back up. It's like More Mesa in Santa Barbara, and I would run and then I'd be like, \"God, this is so hard.\" And then I would walk for a little while and I'd think to myself, \"Well, how can I be kind to myself? I mean, what am I doing here? Does it have to be fast? No. I am here to decompress and enjoy, so how can I be kind to myself?\" I think sometimes I get hard on myself or have very high expectations kind of achiever mentality, and I've learned through the years that it's okay to slow down. It's okay to not go, go, go the whole time. So I would ask other people that as well, especially if they're going through a challenge or burning midnight oil or whatever. It's like, \"What about self-care? How can you be kind to yourself?\"\n\nLenny (01:06:56):\nBeautiful. Final question. I was scouring your LinkedIn and I saw a quote from the CTO of AppFolio in his endorsement of you. Said that you were the unofficial director of fun at AppFolio. Is there a story that comes to mind of something that you did at AppFolio that created a lot of joy and fun for the team?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:07:15):\nWe had these hack days, and I think they do that to this day. So twice a year we'd bring people together and we copied and learned from Atlassian. I remember we had calls with some coaches from Atlassian for how did they do their ShipIt Day, or they originally called it FedEx Day, changed it to ShipIt Day. We followed their model and we'd had this two o'clock on Thursday at two o'clock on Friday where we'd build whatever we wanted and we'd have a theme, and then we'd have goofy prizes at the end that were like traveling trophies. One of them was like a clickety-clack keyboard that we spray-painted gold by the railroad tracks, but people could work on anything. There were teams that formed... We did it with a self-selection marketplace. People formed their topics and teams, and one team hid geocaches throughout Santa Barbara. They're there to this day because we registered them with the Geocaching website. Another team built a vintage video game machine, and it was in the dev room. Another one they catapulted. They built this... Is it a trebuchet?\n\nLenny (01:07:16):\nYeah.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:08:27):\nThat catapult this fruit in the parking lot. I don't know how we got away with that, but we were in the early days. We did a lot of fun stuff like that, and you could work with different people, build these larger relationships, which later makes it easier for reteaming, because then later if you reteam, you're not strangers with people, so you want to cultivate the community. So we had this department of fun. We would plan the fun in a variety of other ways as well.\n\nLenny (01:08:56):\nSo fun. Heidi, you're awesome. I think we've helped a lot of people feel better about the endless change that they're probably going through right now. Two final questions. Where can folks find your book, find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:09:10):\nYou can go to heidihelfand.com or Google my name and I come up. Heidi@dynamicreteaming.com, heidi.helfand@gmail.com you can find me. I'm out there. And yeah, I love to work with companies and teams going through change, and I do that in a variety of ways. Teach workshops, do talks. So if any of this is interesting, reach out.\n\nLenny (01:09:33):\nAnd then do you also consult and work with individual companies or not?\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:09:37):\nI do. Yeah. I do that now. I like to work on a retainer basis or I'll even join a team, so looking for the-\n\nLenny (01:09:37):\nAll right.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:09:45):\n... next one.\n\nLenny (01:09:47):\nAmazing. And we'll link to all this stuff in the show notes. Heidi, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nHeidi Helfand (01:09:53):\nThanks so much, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:09:54):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:09:57):\nThank you so much for listening.

Always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. So when you give away your free product, what you want to get in exchange are two things. One is a broader reach because free product spread itself is lower barrier to entry. Two, you want to understand you usage behavior of those free users, which features do they use and which features kind of correlates with a higher conversion rate, retention rate, all of that. If you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing.\n\nLenny (00:00:44):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Hila Qu. I've heard some listeners have been doing listening parties with this podcast where their team listens to an episode all at the same time over Zoom and shares their insights and lessons in a shared chat. And I would say that this episode is a great candidate for that. It's incredibly packed with advice on how to start and optimize your product led growth motion. We talk through common pitfalls that you probably run into or to get started, feel us favorite tools, what you recommends for an initial PLG oriented team, how to audit your existing funnel, plus tangents on how to improve your activation and retention and some foundational overviews of product like growth and some of the core concepts associated with it.\n\n(00:01:34):\nLike I say at the end of the episode, this episode delivers tens of thousands of dollars in value. Something you won't find for free anywhere else. I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Hila Qu after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Amplitude.

I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/Lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on.\n\n(00:02:48):\nFor example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, live reactions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's sprints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wire frames, dry ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board and with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all the aim Miro. Head on over to miro.com/Lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/Lenny.\n\n(00:03:26):\nHila, welcome to the podcast.\n\nHila Qu (00:03:29):\nThank you Lenny for having me. I'm so excited.\n\nLenny (00:03:32):\nI'm excited as well. I don't know if you know this, but you have the very unique distinction of having two posts in my top 25 most read post of all time in my newsletter, which are the two parts of your series on how to add a product led growth motion. And so I'm really excited to dig into product led growth and help more people be successful product led growth.\n\nHila Qu (00:03:52):\nAwesome. I should have made it three posts, three part.\n\nLenny (00:03:57):\nI like that ambition. There's always more. Yeah. Well I think the next milestone is get into the top 10, get two into the top 10.\n\nHila Qu (00:04:06):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:04:06):\nOkay. Maybe this podcast will... Oh, okay. This podcast will be in the feed of the newsletter, so maybe we'll get there. No pressure. No pressure. One question I wanted to ask you is anything come out of writing those guest posts? Has anything good happened as a result?\n\nHila Qu (00:04:21):\nI always take a very long-term view for writing. I enjoy writing myself. Spend actually four months on that one. After it's published, I see a lot of shares kind of and people writing very long summary of it. That's always very encouraging and also many people I didn't expect reading it reach out to me, let me know, \"Hey, I read that.\" For example. I think Ravi, he is also on your podcast. I didn't know him personally, one day he's like, \"Hila, I read that. That's awesome.\" And a bunch of friends in VC and they kind of read that. They told me it's great. I even have a advisory client kind of landed because of that as well. So it's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:05:10):\nAmazing. It makes me really happy to hear all that. I was also curious, has anything, and we're going to get into the details of all the stuff you wrote about and even beyond what you wrote about, but is there anything you're thinking has shifted on having after having written that series in terms of PLG?\n\nHila Qu (00:05:25):\nI wouldn't say it's shifted completely because I always believe you don't need to be a PLG purist. Meaning there are kind of people who are like, \"PLG is the future. It's only thing, you don't need sales.\" Right? I was never like that, but recently by working with a few of my clients, I witnessed in reality many startups actually are having both. They have a PLG motion, they have a sales team as well. PLG motion is perfect for lowering the barrier for more people to try, broader the reach. It's a kind of volume kind of game. And then the sales motion, you can have very targeted list of big customers you go after, you close them and it's a big order. Usually revenue, a very strong foundation for a company. And I've seen actually a lot of my clients that are doing, they have both. They're doing that. They try to get the benefit of both from their early stage and it's super cool.\n\nLenny (00:06:29):\nIs the simple way to think about this trend that eventually every one will need to do both. It's not one or the other, it's just both. And it's just a matter of when you add the other.\n\nHila Qu (00:06:40):\nI would think so because let's say if you are in the sales motion dominated kind of traditional B2B software industry, your competitors will be adding PLG, as soon as they add it they will have a benefit of attracting more end users and end users become case to the employer, to the clients. And you lose that. And if you are only in PLG somewhere else may go after the big customers. It takes time for PLG to go to the big customer and close them. So you lose a little bit of time there as well. I think eventually you need both.\n\nLenny (00:07:19):\nCool. That's kind of the way I've been seeing it. I did a few series on traditional product led growth companies, [inaudible 00:07:28]. All those guys, and they all add sales teams eventually last famous for being product led only. And so everyone ends up adding sales team. I think more recent trend is sales led enterprise E products are all just realizing they need a product led growth component. So that's kind of what I've been seeing too.\n\nHila Qu (00:07:43):\nYeah, exactly. But I would say it is easier if you have PLG from early on. If you are pure sales led, you try to add PLG, that's the harder thing to change basically.\n\nLenny (00:07:56):\nInteresting to set a little foundation. Before we get into a lot of this stuff, it'd actually be helpful just to explain what is product like growth, just simply, because people hear this term a lot and it'd be helpful just to understand it broadly. And then also just like why is it so popular? Why does everyone want a product growth component to their business?\n\nHila Qu (00:08:15):\nJust use a simple example in B2C product. When you think about Facebook, when you think about a lot of the products you use every day as an end consumer, it's always by default product led growth because there's no sales team [inaudible 00:08:32]. The LTV of the product doesn't support that. I think PLG the term become popular because traditionally in B2B, word sales is the main motion. You need a sales team to close the deal After the contract is signed, the end users can now finally use it.\n\n(00:08:51):\nBut nowadays, it's not necessarily a case. You can have your B2B SaaS product developed in a way to allow end users to try before you buy. So that's the reason I think this has become being more popular. And the fundamental driver behind this is the user of B2B softwares are also human. It's the same human using B2C softwares and we're already trained to use product, try, and before we make any decision. And we demand that in B2B as well. So it needs to happen. And more and more companies are capturing that trend basically, and they're trying to utilizing that as a entry point to either disrupt existing B2B players or build something really awesome for end users. So that's why it's becoming more and more popular.\n\nLenny (00:09:42):\nTo pull on that thread a little bit more even to help people visualize a product led growth product, what makes it product led? There's a self-serve component, what are attributes or just kind of common elements of something that's product led versus sales led? Let's say.\n\nHila Qu (00:09:59):\nYeah, definitely. I think maybe we can use a product as a example, right? Think about Zoom how me or you, maybe everyday users, how we get to know Zoom is not necessary through a sales team call me code or email me code and introducing me this, showing a demo of Zoom, and I get to know Zoom, right? It's because maybe Lenny, you hosted a webinar I joined and I get to just use this software already without even knowing it's Zoom. And then afterwards I may one day think about I want to do this myself and I just do that in a sign-up and I already create a host a webinar and I can pay if I need a paid plan or I can use a lot of more advanced features when I, let's say hit the 40 minutes limit, I can already click that and pay and become a paid customer already.\n\n(00:10:53):\nSo I think the key properties also of PLG products, think about it should have a very low barrier to entry. Usually it has a free version, free trial. You don't need get approval from your boss to use it. You can use it today and then it has some sort of a self-service checkout flow. If you need a better version, you can buy yourself as well. And this product, basically the free product will spread on its own in some way or another.\n\nLenny (00:11:24):\nOkay, perfect. I think that was really helpful. I think we dive into some of the meat of the discussion that we have planned and where I thought it'd be fun to start is the common pitfalls that people fall into when they're trying to add a product led growth motion. And so what are the most common ways people fail when they're trying to figure out product led growth?\n\nHila Qu (00:11:45):\nThe first of all, as I mentioned, you need to have some sort of vehicle. A lot of the companies, if you go to their website, especially B2B companies, you'll see the biggest CTA is called book demo. They don't have anything else. The first step for you to do is submit a form and kind of basically explain yourself to this company, I'm from who and who company and I want to use the tool, can you come back to me and allow me to see a demo of your product? That means the entry point to PLG is cut off. Instead, the first step is you need to either have a free product, free trial, some sort of a low barrier entry for anyone who stumble upon this product to give it a try. A lot of companies don't have that. That's the first I would say hurdle or peaceful.\n\n(00:12:38):\nAnd especially if you are a sales lead and you already have all those things figured out, you try to go to add PLG, it's not as easy as just say, add a kind of free trial CTA on your website. You need to build this free experience. You also need to convince your sales team, your existing product team, your marketing team, \"Hey, let's try this out.\" Because before this process is super clean. Everyone only get only selected future leads and sales work on those. But now you need to allow more people in and there need to be more understanding of their behavior data, the process need to change. So it's actually a whole process. So I would say that's first one. And along with that is some companies didn't think it thoroughly and they are just kind of saying, \"Oh, PLG is cool, let's do PLG.\"\n\n(00:13:34):\nAnd then they maybe spend three months build kind of some sort of a very basic free trial and then they think that's it. They think the leads will come, conversion will come, self-service revenue will come. It's not that easy. It's not that simple. It is definitely a entire motion. So I would say you need to commit to it. Maybe you can do some thinking, collecting some data, build your conviction, but to a certain point you need to commit to at least a year or even two years kind of roadmap to build this entire thing out and change the process internally sometimes as well to support that. The last one, I would say a lot of times the company's committed, they want to do this, but they don't know the right way or they don't have the foundation, they don't have the expertise of PLG.\n\n(00:14:27):\nTheir internal team, they're really good at sales or maybe really good at as the traditional motion, but they don't have this part of expertise and foundation. A common thing I see is that company want to do PLG and they have no usage data at all and they're like, \"I will just doing PLG. But PLG I always say is actually fundamentally DLG, data led growth. So when you give away your free product, what you want to get in exchange are two things. One is the broader reach because free product spread itself is lower barrier to entry. Two, you want to understand the usage behavior of those free users, which features do they use and which features kind of correlates with a higher conversion rate, retention rate, all of that.\n\n(00:15:20):\nIf you don't have a foundation of data and understanding of how to analyze those data, you are giving a way of free product for nothing. Like you are really not being able to utilize all of that to build your PLG motion. So I think data foundation and expertise in terms of how do I design that user journey, that journey is very different from the sales user journey. Those are sometimes missing in company when they just begin to doing this. And in those cases I think it's super helpful to maybe either find someone who have done this as an advisor or hire someone like you need to have that expertise or through advisor to support your PLG motion.\n\nLenny (00:16:06):\nThis is great. We're going to talk about the data piece more in depth later, but on the commitment piece, I thought that was really interesting. I imagine many times founders or leaders think they have commitment and then they realize maybe not so much. Are there any kind of flags that tell you that, \"Oh, you're not actually committed to working on this for a year or two years, whatever it takes.\"\n\nHila Qu (00:16:27):\nThe red flags I've seen basically sometimes, first of all, they think about PLG equals launch of free version or launch of free trial. They made this assumption in their head, \"Oh, I already have a product. I already have a software that's working, customers are using. Now if I add a free version, if I open a free trial, that's it.\" Like that's basically PLG, and I will have conversions. I will have people becoming a product qualified leads just because I have it. \"Hey, I open this for you, just come and use it and [inaudible 00:17:07].\" And I think that's one red flag. Basically they are not thinking about the entire thing through understanding the implication, not only the free product, it's really just a start. You need to think about how to activate, how to design the upgrade path, how those teams, those new growth teams work with other sales and marketing teams, all of that.\n\n(00:17:29):\nSo that's one. The other one is they don't have a dedicated team. They just basically assign one person to the thing. They are imagine, \"Hey, you already have this. It's not that big of deal. You can just figure this out by borrowing resources from everywhere and try to coordinate all the stakeholders from sales, marketing, product.\" That person need to be a magician in order to be successful in that basically. And I think the third thing is basically they are really doing this because it's trendy. They didn't think about the deeper strategic reason why this is a good fit for their business. Do you have a product that's relatively low complexity, doesn't require a lot of customization for the customer to see value.\n\n(00:18:19):\nTime to value need to be relatively short or you can figure out a way to make it short. And then do you have a lot of potentially end user S&B business? They are interested in the solution. They want to try that out. If you do not have both, if you for example, develop a software for the [inaudible 00:18:42]. Companies like [inaudible 00:18:44]. Or defense companies, only three target customer exist in the entire world, you don't probably want to do PLG, right? So think deeper about the fit and then commit. And I would say those are the red flags.\n\nLenny (00:18:59):\nOkay. So on that last point, I thought that was a really interesting, we talked about how every company probably should add a product led growth piece, but I think what you're also saying is actually not every company, there are some companies like defense contractors that are probably going to be sale led.\n\nHila Qu (00:19:15):\nI think it's a spectrum. I would say the defense company, defense software company is a pretty extreme example. And of course in those case, I don't think it makes sense, but I think majority of B2B software, I've seen, you've seen, we've used even some more complicated ones. Like Salesforce used to be this example of sales motion. They're the pioneer of SaaS and they do this so well, but they begin to add look into sales service portal and all of that. And even a lot of the bigger players are looking into that. So I think majority of the B2B software, probably they are in the middle of the spectrum rather than the defense company.\n\nLenny (00:20:05):\nYou kind of shared some of the attributes of what allows you to be product led, like quick time to value. If you have this in your head, what are some of those bullet points of what you need to figure out for it to be successful potentially as product led?\n\nHila Qu (00:20:18):\nThe first thing is that have a... And you mentioned you are able to have a vehicle, have a free version, have a free trial. Sometimes it's a open source product. A lot of developer products start as a open source product. It has its constraints, but it is also a great kind of vehicle for PLG or if none of those are option, you can build a really realistic kind of experience. For example, I remember Amplitude, they are pursuing PLG now, but they used to have a lot of barrier. As an end user, it's hard for me to put that code into my product and see my data, but they build a really realistic interactive demo that's getting closer to PLG. So it's not PLG, but it's getting closer and you can already see the value and play with it yourself. So that's the first step. Have a vehicle.\n\n(00:21:18):\nThe second step step is time to value. Basically, just because you have this vehicle doesn't mean people will come and use it and see the value. So you need to figure out how do you give your users a warm start and help them get started. I was talking with a kind of company today, they just realized we have this tool and when people come in into the free trial, they are asked to do some action, but nobody know how to do that. They may not have everything ready to take that action. So we're like, \"What about we gave them some sample video or sample action they can try.\" Right? It's not the same as they do it themselves, but it's better. It's getting closer. And after that you can ask them to try the thing on their own and they need to do more work.\n\n(00:22:07):\nSo kind of think about all the ways you can reduce time to value. It doesn't need to be this big aha moment in the first five minutes, but at least give them some mini aha moments, right? So that's the second thing, third thing is think about from there. If they get aha moment, if they want to buy, you need to have this self-checkout flow ready, self-service flow. It's the foundation, if you have it, it doesn't mean they won't buy immediately, but at least it gave them this option to do that themselves. And the fourth thing I would say, between this kind of activation usage, aha moment to this conversion moment, actually there's a big gap. And what is the gap? How you can understand the gap, how you can guide people around that journey is basically you need to have a very good grasp of data.\n\n(00:23:03):\nYou need to have the foundation to understand their usage, their behavior, and then you can design a user journey in the product, in email, in all those tools to guide user to the next step. So have a very strong data foundation there. I would say. I think those are the main thing. And there are other things like your pricing need to be relatively simple. If your pricing is super complicated, they need to... Whenever they pick, for example, they try the product, they love it, they have a self-checkout flow, but in order to decide how much they need to pay, they need to send your sales some information, you need to do a quote, then that's broken, right? Or they're already confused about this process. So that is another kind of important thing as well.\n\nLenny (00:23:54):\nCool. So just to summarize, I took notes on this kind of the things that you got to get. If you want to add a product led growth component, there needs to be something free and kind of self-serve that you can-\n\nLenny (00:24:00):\n... growth component. There needs to be something free and kind of self-serve that you can just start using on your own. There needs to be a quick time to value, there needs to be a self-serve checkout experience. You need a data foundation. I really love the way you phrased it where one of the benefits of product growth is the data component that'll help you understand what to build on, how to monetize these folks. And then the last piece is pricing that's simple, that people understand.\n\nHila Qu (00:24:23):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Just imagine you are building, selling something on e-commerce side. You need all of this, right. Just in order for the B2B buyer to buy your software in PLG motion, you need to make all those available to him. It doesn't mean if you view this, it'll happen, again, right. That's the data experimentation. A lot of that need to be there to support a lot of iteration and make this work.\n\nLenny (00:24:52):\nAwesome. Okay, so we've been going in a lot of directions. We started with pitfalls and things you probably will... You'll run into that may set you off track. But let's zoom out again and let's get into, just say you're convinced we need to invest in adding a product-led growth motion to our product. What's the first step that you recommend for people to go down?\n\nHila Qu (00:25:12):\nI think the first step actually, I would recommend founders and leaders to just understand what's PLG funnel, what's sales-led funnel with SLG funnel. Because I remember when I begin to work on PLG at GitLab, it was not that clear to me. There's a lot of things you can read, but they're not all super clear. What is PLG? How is that different? And through working on that myself, I begin to develop this conviction and kind of this clear picture. The biggest difference from SLG and PLG is that the sales funnel traditionally work like something... You have marketing team working on the top of funnel, bring visitor and then they need to have a process to turn the visitors into lead. And leads is something, it is basically very popular and vitally used in the B2B business. And you go through some qualification process and leads need to be from your target kind of customer, target industry.\n\n(00:26:23):\nThe company need to meet certain size, but they also need to show interest. And how marketing team historically gauge interest is how much they interact with your marketing campaigns. Do they open an email? Do they read three white papers? Do they go to this webinar? That's how they gauge interest. And for each positive action you did as a buyer, they add some points to you. And once you reach certain points, you become this marketing qualified leads. Basically those are the better ones we featured through that process and we gave that to the sales team. And sales team has more process, but then they choose some of them, work on them, and they close some of them. So that's kind of traditionally B2B sales-led motion works. And then product-led funnel is different. It's much more similar to B2C. Basically you can still have people visit your website and they sign up for free version or free account or free trial.\n\n(00:27:21):\nThe most important thing, the biggest difference, is now you want them to use the product. You can still send all the marketing emails, all of that, but those are supplemental. Those are kind of trying to get them to the product to use, to try, and the usage, product usage, is almost like the leading indicator for success for PLG, versus in the sales funnel, it's almost like how many do you get and do they interact with the marketing campaigns, which in the old days it's what you have because nobody can access your product unless the contract is signed. But nowadays that's almost like an artificial barrier. It's not there. You can totally build a product in a free version to allow people to use. So usage becomes so important. And that's the biggest difference from the usage that you have two potential conversion paths.\n\n(00:28:18):\nOne is that if this product is not that expensive, the price point fits in most companies' budget. Some companies may just use their credit card and they buy online. That's also, you then don't even need sales team to be involved. And it's very similar to the B2C product, e-commerce product, buying process. And it's awesome because it's automated, you don't need to have more sales team involved. It's low cost, it's efficient, it can happen on its own every day. It will just add up to your revenue. And then the other potential conversion pass is where the product usage is high, but also this customer, this potential prospect, fits into your ideal customer profile. It's from a Fortune 500 company or it's from a target industry that you know they need your solution. Then this customer worth more of your time and you should actually not, even if they may want to buy on their own, you may want to still have your sales team or have your customer success team to reach out to them to understand a little bit more of the situation and give them some white glove service. Hopefully you can even close a bigger deal than if they would have buy on their own. So that's another pass. I call that PQL, PQA, like sales pass.\n\nLenny (00:29:47):\nAnd that stands for product qualified lead, right?\n\nHila Qu (00:29:48):\nProduct qualified leads, product qualified account. So the first step is for you to understand those two funnels and then think about if you want to add PLG, right? What is this journey? What are the steps along that funnel you need to establish for your product in order for your user to be able to convert in that funnel?\n\nLenny (00:30:12):\nSo you talked about these two funnels. One question is, are they basically the same for almost every product or should you try to figure out what's really unique about my funnel? And then second, is there an example of product that you think about like, here's the sales led funnel for them and then here's the product-led version of that, just to make it a little more real even?\n\nHila Qu (00:30:30):\nMaybe I can give an example first and then we can talk about the other question. So I can use GitLab as an example since that's where I'm most familiar. GitLab actually have a enterprise sales team, very strong sales team, from the very beginning. But the company also we started from open source product.\n\nLenny (00:30:50):\nMaybe describe what GitLab is for folks that aren't super familiar with it.\n\nHila Qu (00:30:53):\nYeah, so GitLab, we are a developer platform, DevOps platform, basically engineer teams, developer teams. They use this product to manage their entire DevOps process, from storing their code, kind of managing the version control, releasing CSAD, like security scan, all of that. It's an all in one platform for that team. So for the sales-led motion, like I mentioned, the teams, our marketing team, were working bringing a lot of visitors to our website and they sign up for free trial, for free accounts. And then we have this lead nurturing and lead scoring process to surface which are the good ones for our sales team. In our sales team, we have SNB, we have the mid-market, we have enterprise, and they each kind of took their buckets of leads and work on them and close them. They become revenue.\n\n(00:31:52):\nAnd then how the product led funnel work for us is someone, maybe as a developer, I heard about GitLab, I go to website, I see, \"Oh, I can actually sign up for a free account.\" I may use it for my personal project. My company may be using another solution, but I have some side project I'm doing as a developer. I want to use GitLab to host that. And I did that. And so you begin to see this, individual users having some usage but nothing to do with his company. And then one day maybe this person's employer, \"We want to look into some other solutions. We have way too many point solutions for each step of DevOps. Now we want to potentially consolidate them. So what are the options?\" And this engineer raise his hand, \"Hey, I have been using GitLab for a very long time and I really like it. I think we should check them out.\" And then this team, maybe this engineer manager or CTO depending on the size of company, they're like, \"Okay.\"\n\n(00:32:55):\nHe went to their website and he kind of signed up for a free trial because that allow him to test some more advanced features. It's 30 days, but he already has... This person knows how to use it. This person already set up the foundation with the free version and they started the free trial. They use their 30 day to do a proof of concept, the entire company already using it for part of their process. And they're like, \"Oh, awesome. I tried this feature, that feature, that feature. It's a great tool. It can support our workflow and I'm pretty sure we should be able to get ROI from this product.\" And then in this case they are like, \"I only need five seats. It's cheap. I will just go to the pricing page and check out the pricing and buy from there.\" Or in some cases, this is a big company and we see this big company is using our product, our sales team get that data signal, they may send an email and reach out and say, \"Hey, I saw you were checking it out. How can I help?\" And that may start a sales conversation, eventually become a contract from there.\n\nLenny (00:34:07):\nGreat. Thank you for sharing that example. Maybe a last question on this first step of mapping out the funnel. Do you recommend people just get in front of a whiteboard and just sit together and like, \"Here's what it would be potentially if we added a product-led growth motion?\"\n\nHila Qu (00:34:20):\nYes. Yes. And I think it's not that... The devil is in the details. Just mapping out the big steps is not that hard. You think about, \" I have a marketing site already. I can build a free version.\" And then they use the free version and I build a checkout flow and that's it. That's the story. But that's the first step. If you don't even have those components, mapping out the funnel will allow you to see a missing checkout flow, a missing free version, you already identified that. But the devil is in the detail one layer down. How do you design an experience for each of the step? What do you say on your marketing side to drive free signup? In the free signup, how do you guide them to use the three most important features? And in the checkout flow, which payment option do you offer so that customers from everywhere can buy very smoothly? So that's the next layers kind of detail that actually has so many opportunities for optimization, maximization and all of that.\n\nLenny (00:35:29):\nThat's actually a really good segue to the next question, which is just, okay, you've mapped out the funnel, what do you do next?\n\nHila Qu (00:35:35):\nIf you don't have the foundational components, you need to build all of that. But if you have something, if you already have this funnel exist, right, it's just not working perfectly at least, but it's working, it's there. I think the next step is you need to pick a starting point. Where do you want to focus first to drive the maximum impact? Personally, I'm a big fan of finding leverage. I think doing growth is always about finding leverage. If you can always find the area that with relatively small investment can give you the biggest results, that can be such a kind of momentum, can empower you through future experiments and more work. And just finding leverage is a beautiful thing in my mind. So I always want to do that. So when I think about pick a starting point, one thing I actually do with a lot of my advisory clients as a first step is, we do a full funnel audit, full PLG funnel audit.\n\n(00:36:38):\nThink about, we go through me as a kind of end user, go through the entire journey, pretend I am interested, semi interested, and I want to buy from the website. Does that kind of attract me? Is it super clear the value proposition? And then from there, going through the sign up of the free account or free trial, is that smooth? And when I begin to use the product, do I get to my aha moment fast or I am very confused and frustrated, abandoned at that moment? And from there, if I'm like, think this is good, right, I hit my aha moment, I want to buy. Can I even buy? You will never believe, like when I do this audit,, there are so many low hanging fruits usually in this process. For example, one client, when I go to the checkout flow, the kind of checkout form is so confusing.\n\n(00:37:38):\nThey ask a bunch of questions that only let's say UK customer need. Every other places they don't need to answer, but they ask the question anyway. And I as a US based person is very confused and I drop off at that point. And then there are other things, for example, the aha moments like I talk about. I don't know what to do when I land inside a product for the first time, I'm super excited and ready, but I don't know what to do. I'm so lost and confused. That's usually a pretty big focus area and opportunity area. Just getting your users to aha moments. They are already over so many hurdles here, but don't just turn down them and they leave because it's so confusing.\n\nLenny (00:38:25):\nIt might be helpful just to explain an aha moment. I know people hear this term a lot. What's a simple way to think about what is an aha moment?\n\nHila Qu (00:38:32):\nI think it as a moment, as a first time a user experienced value of your product. So it gets popular because Facebook has this example from the early growth days. I think you added 10 friends in seven days, you hit your aha moment. But there are many layers under that. The reason why Facebook used that to define its aha moment is because in early days, if you add these friends, you begin to form some connection. You can see an interesting feed, you can interact with your friends, and that social interaction, it's the core value of Facebook, and Facebook leaves by looking at a lot of data. If you meet that data metric criteria it's kind of very likely you will hit that aha moment. But I think for a lot of, especially we're talking about many SaaS product, B2B software, the value of such product is usually either you see a workflow can be supported by this, it can save your time, it can save your money, it can help you make more money, or it just solve this pain point that you never get to solve on your own without a software product.\n\n(00:39:57):\nSo at GitLab we actually did a bunch of analysis. We're trying to understand what is the aha moment for our new users. We ended up have something along the line of two users, two features used in the first 14 days. So it's very similar to Facebook's kind of format. But deep down, because we are a platform, we are a team product, two users is talking about the team components. Whatever the first user is trying and using that is so valuable, he or she is confident to invite another coworker to come in. That itself is very, very valuable action and indicates this first user is seeing value. And if together they use two or more features, that means we are seeing the collaboration, the platform components of the product. And within the first 14 days, because it has to be reasonably quick but not unrealistic, because we are a complicated product, we're not Facebook, we're not Zynga or a game app, it's hard for you to figure it out in the first day. So yeah, I think it's a very important concept for any PLG company to figure out because that's often the biggest opportunity area I see.\n\nLenny (00:41:24):\nAha moment and activation is often interchangeable, right?\n\nHila Qu (00:41:27):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:41:27):\nSo those are kind of two things you'll hear. And just to reframe, re-say what you say, so GitLab's activation slash aha moment milestone was two users using two features in 14 days.\n\nHila Qu (00:41:38):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:41:40):\nAnd I imagine the way you got to that was you looked at what point does retention improve if they got to a certain milestone, right? Is that roughly how you [inaudible 00:41:48]?\n\nHila Qu (00:41:47):\nYeah, exactly. So there are how you can get to that, right? First of all, the internal team, our growth team, actually we did some brainstorming. We think about what are the potential action or behavior that indicate they're getting value. We ideally want to do something like they maybe successfully merge their first PR or they successfully run their first pipeline. All of that. There are some potential high value actions we can think of. We just list all of them. And then the next step is, we did a correlation analysis to understand, hey, those are the 10 high value actions we believe we want to look at. If a new user did this action, what's the maybe 30 day conversion rate and... Not 30 day, 90 day conversion rate. What's the 30 day retention rate? Because we look at both. Sometimes you only look at retention or you only look at conversion, it doesn't give you the full picture.\n\n(00:42:52):\nSo we look at if you did this action, let's say if, Lenny, you are trying our product, you are able to successfully merge the PR in your first 30 days. Does that improve your likelihood to convert? Does that improve your likelihood to retain? And we compare across those 10 high value actions, compare with the average. And we begin to see, oh, some actions actually if you do that, it lift your conversion, lift your retention much bigger. And those are the candidates for potential aha moments. And from there, the reason why we ended up not picking one single action... For some products, actually you can pick a single action. If one action really stands out, I don't know, for Airbnb [inaudible 00:43:39] is probably, you book a hotel, you go to there, you are so happy, you leave a high star review. That's the key action for this platform.\n\n(00:43:49):\nFor GitLab, we have so many different workflow components. Teams are here for different reasons. Some are here for security, some are here for like CSAD. So that's why we ended up combining like two action. It can be any of the two high value features. The next step is actually you need to launch some experiments to try to get more people to do those high value action. And you then see, do I see higher conversion? Do I see higher retention? Because in data you are only isolating correlation. You are not proving causation. You just saw people who are doing this are more likely to convert. But it doesn't mean if you get people to do that, they will convert. So experimentation is the step. You will finally kind of validate that.\n\nLenny (00:44:37):\nHila, this is amazing. This is like a mini podcast on activation. We should do another one just on this. And then in the show notes, I'll link to a couple posts that I've written with a bunch of advice on setting activation milestones and improving them. I forget if you've contributed to that post or not, but if not, we should add some of these stories. But let's get back to our core. We have enough to talk about on just product led growth. So just to summarize the audit that you do, I wrote some notes as you were talking, and maybe we can keep going from that point. What you look for when you're auditing a product to see where they may pick a starting point, what I wrote down is, one, are you just excited to try it? Is the landing page pulling you in? Two, can you actually use it on your own and just try it? Three, do you get to the aha moment where you're like, okay, I get it, [inaudible 00:45:25] it, and then can I actually buy this on my own? Is that roughly the audit? Is there anything more to that?\n\nHila Qu (00:45:30):\nExactly. And I also look at their initial first few emails they send to me, because sometimes the email magically can help a lot. If I'm frustrated the first time... The other day I'm trying a product, I'm frustrated, I'm like, I will give up. And then in the night I saw an email, I'm like, oh, maybe I just click the CTA and give it one more try. And that time actually I figured out I get to the aha moment.\n\n(00:45:57):\nSo I also look at the email, the first initial emails, and then when I map this out, I ask the company to give me the data at very high level for each of the step. How many people are on your website? How many people go through signup? How many people hit this aha moment? We need to define that. We need to... Usually a lot of discussion, like how many people get to the aha moment, how many people started self-checkout and being successful. And then like that between my experience from a user perspective and the data, we usually immediately begin to see, oh, this is the biggest opportunity. Usually activation and conversion are two of the common starting places.\n\nLenny (00:46:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by Ahrefs. You probably know Ahrefs as one of the leading all-in-one SEO tools, used by companies like Facebook, Uber, Shopify, LinkedIn, Pinterest, and thousands more. But Ahrefs is not just for big companies.

Visit ahrefs.com/awt and start improving your website's visibility. That's ahrefs. com/awt.\n\n(00:47:31):\nOkay, so let's get into that then. So you've done this audit, what other advice do you have for folks to figure out where they should start and invest in that part of the product to help launch product-led growth?\n\nHila Qu (00:47:42):\nYou can do a audit like this yourself, right. Just imagine if you are a B2C user trying to buy a product, you want it to be easy. Ideally, PLG for B2B can be that easy as well. So go through that process and identify, where is confusing, where do you get stuck? If you find-\n\nHila Qu (00:48:00):\n... where is confusing. Where do you get stuck if you find that you have a problem with activation, meaning if you enter into the product you are like what do I do, I don't know what should I do, and maybe I just left. And then, if that's the biggest opportunity, activation, then you need to think about find the right aha moment metric as the first step, as we just talked about, because that's the success, that's the goalpost. And then, design a product experience to help more people together. And I usually think about do is better than show is better than tell, meaning you want to remove all the frictions and somehow give them a warm start, give them some sample template, give them some sample thing they can play with initially in that very moment already, and you can supplement that with your email to bring them to the product if they don't do that. So that's activation. If activation is okay, but your conversion, your self-check checkout flow, usually there are also room for improvement. Many company I work with, when I try to buy, I cannot even find where to buy. It's very hard to find where do I click to start this checkout process, or they may have some frictions in the checkout flow where it's not localized. One company, when I look at their data, they find that India has very low success rate, which is expected, but we begin to say it's because the payment solution they choose actually doesn't support that market well. And they added another payment solution, immediately they are seeing much better success rate. And if they're already in the checkout, you don't want to lose any of them, right? Just do a hundred experiments to get to as much higher kind of commercial possible, because you don't want to lose any of them. So activation, conversion, usually are two great place to start.\n\n(00:50:08):\nAnd then from there, I would say think about your PQL/PQA, motion, which is the other conversion pass, which is if you also want to have sales blended into this, right, product-led sales motion, how do you set up the structure, the foundation so that you can know what are some data signal to tell you those are better leads? And what are some customer criteria, in terms of size segment, you should set up, how do you get those data, and then how do you hand this to your sales team, how they can close using those data, use this knowledge? That's another very big opportunity area. That's a bigger effort, compared to those two low-hanging fruits.\n\n(00:50:53):\nAnd the last thing I would say, product-led acquisition is a great place to start. If your product is a collaboration software, think about Airtable and it's Figma, right? As part of my workflow, I invite my team to join, I spread this out. If you have that use case, you can build that into a product that's awesome, that's very powerful.\n\nLenny (00:51:18):\nSo there's a lot there. So let me try to summarize what you just shared and how it connects. So you have a self-serve product, you've gotten to a point where you can sign up and try something for free?\n\nHila Qu (00:51:28):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:51:29):\nAnd then you do this audit of where along this journey do we think the biggest opportunities lie and the most leverage lives? And you have these, I think, four buckets of opportunity?\n\nHila Qu (00:51:40):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:51:40):\nAcquisition, which is top of funnel, do you want to double down and invest there first, or activation, which is help people see the value more quickly?\n\nHila Qu (00:51:48):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:51:49):\nBucket three would be, you called it conversion, which essentially help them buy it more efficiently?\n\nHila Qu (00:51:56):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:51:56):\nAnd then there's a bucket of retention, of just keeping them around longer, which I don't know if you mentioned this, but I know that's probably not where you want to start, so it's even not worth chatting about too much.\n\nHila Qu (00:52:04):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:52:05):\nCool. And so the question, basically, a founder or product team has to decide is which of these three buckets do they go in on when they're trying to add product growth, acquisition, activation or conversion?\n\nHila Qu (00:52:16):\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:52:17):\nIt'd be cool, maybe just one example of each of these three buckets, like what's a product that did a good job here? And then you also talked about how to know which one to start with. Maybe just again, just a quick summary of you should probably start activation if this, if you have something like that?\n\nHila Qu (00:52:32):\nYou should probably start with activation. Activation is actually a common good starting place for most B2B software.\n\nLenny (00:52:32):\nAwesome.\n\nHila Qu (00:52:40):\nBecause usually B2B softwares are not designed to really get you to use quickly, historically. A good example, there are, I think, all the best PLG companies, they do a awesome job. That's almost like my criteria to say whether this is a great PLG product or not. Think about Miro, as an example. If you go through their activation experience and sign up to usage, they ask very limited questions, very targeted. They drop you, kind of, they ask you about your use case, what are you here for? Are here to do a brainstorm session? Are you here to develop a roadmap? And they quickly gave you templates to get started. Just like in maybe five minutes, you finish the entire journey from go to the website and sign up, answer a few questions, and you are already using the template they provided to do the thing you want to do. That's time to value. That's a success. I think that's a really great standard for all the PLG, like a B2B product, try to follow. So that's activation is usually a good place. If you don't know where to start, do that.\n\n(00:53:54):\nAnd then conversion, I would say, is a place, again, worth investing, but there are two layers. One is the self-check-hub flow, just do some experiments there. You can actually go to any E-commerce website, like, I don't know, go to Lululemon, go to Amazon, make your conversion process as easy as theirs. That should be your goal. The consumers shouldn't be confused about complicated pricing, where to find all of that, so that's a place always worth investing, testing more, because that's revenue so close to be added into your book.\n\n(00:54:39):\nAnd then the PQL/PQA part, the other more-complicated path, I would say that's something you want to figure out activation and self-checkout a little bit, and you want to have some reasonable user number and then invest there, otherwise it can be a little bit jumping too fast and jumping too ahead. And the acquisition, a product-led acquisition is a great place to invest, if you have a collaboration workflow, you have some inherent, internal viral components in your products. Think about Figma, think about Calendarly even, right? It can spread. This product is so easy. You can build something to allow it to spread on its own.\n\nLenny (00:55:24):\nOkay. I'm hoping that was really helpful, because I think a lot of people are like where do I start, what do I do to help start moving down this road of product growth? And what I'm hearing generally is just activation is probably where you want to focus, which is essentially getting people to your value quicker. And what's cool about that, and we had a podcast with Lauryn Isford from formerly Airtable, now at Notion, talking about all the ways to do that. And interestingly, one of the biggest levers for retention, and moving retention, is often onboarding and improving activation, so win-win.\n\nHila Qu (00:56:00):\nYeah, definitely. And I could talk a little bit about retention expansion, if you think that's helpful as well?\n\nLenny (00:56:00):\nSure, let's do that here.\n\nHila Qu (00:56:08):\nYeah, I know that I didn't talk about that in the post, and there are people asking, hey, do you plan to write another post on this specific topic? So the reason why I didn't cover too much retention expansion is, as you mentioned, it's not usually a first place to start. I call retention the messy middle. It's actually a messy part of the entire funnel. A quick activation, conversion, those are fast. Those are almost sometimes shorter time span, right? You have a lot of never, and you can test very quickly, and that acquisition is a very big leverage. You need to get more users, always.\n\n(00:56:48):\nRetention is super important, but it's a little bit messy. It's over a very long period of time, and your customers can be, at any given moment, they can be retained or not, like if they just cancel or they just decided not to use anymore, you already lost them, so it's a very messy part. But how I think about retention, there are two steps. One is how to build a habit in their usage pattern, so that they are using this maybe every week, every day. The key to do that is, first of all, your product need to have a high enough frequency. If you are using this once per month, it's not likely you can build this into a habit.\n\n(00:57:39):\nBefore GitLab, I worked at Acorns. We started as an investment app, and the whole thing is passive investment, passive investing. You bought some ETFs, and then you basically don't even need to check, and you just keep adding money and it will grow, and after 10 years is awesome. It's actually the right investment philosophy, but when I worked as a head of growth, it made a big challenge for me, because think about set and forget it. They don't even need to go back to a product to be successful. And that make it very hard, as a head of growth, to drive engagement, drive retention. I don't even know whether they're retained or not, if they are not coming back, right? I can only gauge from other indicators. So I think one thing I would say about building habit is think about how to build those habit feature or collaboration feature into your workflow already, into the product already. That is the reason they can retain, fundamentally, if it's high frequency, if it involves collaboration with other people, if it's part of their workflow. So that's the first step. You can obviously use a lot of the looks to reinforce that. You can send them an email if they take certain action, and get them back, and to repeat that action, but fundamentally you need to build that into your product.\n\n(00:59:09):\nAnd then the next part around retention is I actually think extension is part of retention. Basically you already have a steady usage flow. You are using this habitually every week, every day. What are the right moment to prompt you to think about maybe buying more? And there are three buckets of product-led extension. The first one is up upgrade to a higher tier. The second one is buying more seeds, buying more license. The third one is if you have some sort of a consumption add-on component, just consuming more, right? Like for GitLab, you can go from bronze tier to a silver tier, you can go to a higher tier, and then you can buy more seeds, and you can also buy more CSCD minutes to consume. Those are all the different moments. How you can do that is really understand data, understand usage, and trigger a lot of the right conversation at the right moment to the right person.\n\n(01:00:17):\nAnd you can, again, a lot of similar tactics you use in activation conversion actually can be beautifully applied in expansion, because it's almost a combination of getting people to the aha of that feature, use that feature, try that feature, getting them to convert.\n\nLenny (01:00:34):\nYou're leaving all these gold bricks that I have to resist not following and getting off track with, because there's so much, and like retention is its own conversation. We could have maybe just one question along those lines. What's something that you've launched that had a tremendous impact on retention? Is there an example of just like, wow, that really had a big impact, you talk about frequency maybe, but what comes to mind?\n\nHila Qu (01:00:56):\nI can share some of my example at a course my-\n\nLenny (01:00:59):\nYeah.\n\nHila Qu (01:01:00):\nI think there are two things. One thing is actually very similar to what you just said. When I was asked to work on retention, I did a bunch of analysis. The biggest leverage for me is actually activation. So I ended up doing tons of experiments in activation. I identified what are the features for users to take experience value quickly so that they are more likely to retain. For us, it's a feature called recurring investment, which makes sense in hindsight, but at that time nobody's caring about that. We have some other very cool investment features called roundup investment, so nobody is really paying a lot of a attention on this, but when I look at data, I saw recurring investment has a high correlation with retention. So I did a lot of work trying to get more people to set this up, and which has been a great success, actually, in a very short period of time.\n\n(01:01:58):\nAnd then from there, I would say we begin to add more use cases that has a higher frequency, like I mentioned, right? If you only come here once per month to check our investment, it's very hard to retain you. We don't have any lever to engagement with you as well, if you are not in the product. So we ended up adding IRA account, retirement account. We ended up adding spending account, like a debit card, like more high-frequency use cases. Those use cases come with higher frequency and better retention by nature, so now you change the problem from how do I improve retention to how do I drive adoption of higher-frequency use cases? So I did, again, a bunch of experiments how to drive more adoption of retirement account. Once you have a retirement account, an IRA, there's tax consequences, all of that. There it's very hard for you to leave. So you flip the question into, again, adoption/activation problem in that case as well.\n\nLenny (01:03:04):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing those. Oh man, there's so many other things we could talk about retention, but we have enough to talk about on product-led growth. So there's two other areas that I want to touch on. One is data and infrastructure, and what people should know about how to set that up for success, and the other is hiring your team, and how to build out your product-led growth team. So starting with the data piece, maybe just as a big picture, just like what are the buckets of data and infrastructure people should be thinking about that they're going to have to invest in or should start thinking about early?\n\nHila Qu (01:03:36):\nI think there are two big buckets. The first bucket is product usage data. As I mentioned, a lot of B2B software, they're really lacking in that, because when you sell via sales team, you don't need to know so many details, so granular usage data, all of that. The second bucket is I call this customer 360 database, because product usage data is one component, is the most essential. In order for your product-led gross motion to be successful, you also need to connect that with your marketing teams, marketing campaigns, your CRM, your sales force, who are the customers, prospects, what their stage. So those ideally need to be connected so that you have a 360 picture of your customer. If I have an Airbnb as a potential, like a target account, do I know there are users from Airbnb that are using my product, which features are they using, and do I send any marketing campaigns to each of them, do they respond, all of that. All of those ideally need to be connected, but in reality is all over the place. It's all in its own tools in most of the B2B companies.\n\nLenny (01:04:57):\nWhat are just some tools that you think people should check out, start with maybe? What's Hila's recommendations on an initial stack or areas to explore, in terms of tooling?\n\nHila Qu (01:05:08):\nI say there are two piece. One is infra, the other piece are some tools that are kind of secondary. So from infrastructure perspective, on data tool, my first tool usually, one is some sort of data hub segment, right? This next one is some sort of a product analytics tool. Think about Amplitude. I know PostHog is actually a pretty popular one. It's an open-source product analytics tool. There are Mixpanel, Pandle, all of that. So have some sort of data hub, data collection tool, and have some sort of product analytics tool. That's the data infrastructure.\n\n(01:05:49):\nAnd then you need to have an experimentation tool because, like I said, you cannot just imagine you build everything and everything works perfectly. So you need either like Optimizely, I know Amplitude has some experimentation components. Eppo is a new and upcoming one. You need some tool to allow you to do experimentation.\n\n(01:06:12):\nThe third piece I think that's pretty essential, I counted in the infra, is some sort of a lifecycle marketing tool. I know many B2B companies, they use HubSpot or they use something for their email marketing, but those are usually least nurturing. And it's very different from lifecycle marketing tool, meaning you need to connect with Segment, Amplitude. You know what customers are doing your product, your design, your email, your in-app, your push notification, based on their behavior, at the right moment, to the right person. And you measure success by do they take the right action in a product, versus the lead nurture email marketing tool is do I get them to read the article, open the email, I add 10 points to their lead score, and they are a next step further in their list funnel? So, data tool, experimentation tool, lifecycle marketing tool, those are the infra.\n\n(01:07:10):\nAnd then from there, there are a lot of PLD tools you can add on top to make your day-to-day much easier. Just to start, as so like that are most essential for acquisition, you need to have some sort of a like a data enrichment tool. Think about ZoomInfo, Clearbit, because the biggest difference between B2B and B2C is that you still need to know about their company. You want to know this person, but you also want to know this person's company, right? That's a very important thing, and you can get a lot out of those data enrichment tool, and then you can design your journey differently based on that.\n\n(01:07:52):\nFor activation, a lot of my clients are finding a lot of value in those tools like Appcues, User-Led, basically the tools that allow you to build onboarding flow quickly in a product without engineer kind of resource. So you need to do some initial integration, but as soon as you did that a marketing manager, a PM or someone, can just build some customized onboarding step-by-step flows himself. I think that's quite neat, because you need to test the tongue in that area.\n\n(01:08:27):\nAnd in terms of conversion, I would say there are many product-led growth, product-led sales tools. I think those are great. If you want to build out your PQL/PQA conversion pass, think about Endgame, Pocus, Tableau and Pace. There are a couple of them.\n\nLenny (01:08:47):\nWow. Amazing. That was an awesome list and really well-structured. Is there anything else along the data or infrastructure piece that you want to touch on before we move on to hiring and the team?\n\nHila Qu (01:08:59):\nI just want to go back to the point, as I mentioned, product-led growth is data-led growth deep down. So in most of the situation when I see a company want to get started, where they are really missing or they need to invest more, is data. So if you identify you have a gap in this area, don't feel bad as well. A lot of pretty big companies are in the same shoes, and if you can't invest the time, money, the team, the tool, to figure this out, the benefit of this, right, the data collection, understanding usage data, can not only power your PLG motion, it can really power your entire product team, even your customer success team. Now you gave them the ingredients they need to develop the next feature, based on not only what your top customer asked for, but also what everybody's using, right?\n\n(01:09:59):\nYour customer success team can take a much deeper view in understanding what the clients are using, rather than just talk with the executives from the client and get a rough gauge of the situation. So I think it is a area worth investing, and every B2B company should be investing in.\n\nLenny (01:10:21):\nI'm trying to channel what listeners might be thinking right now, and I imagine some people might be like what if I pick the wrong tool? I'm kind of stressed, I have to do all this research. I'm kind of worried about starting, because it'll set me up for failure later. Which of these buckets do you think is most important to get right, right from the beginning, and any advice on how to just avoid messing that up?\n\nHila Qu (01:10:41):\nTo get started, I would say probably a product analytics tool is the first step, and maybe the data hub, such as Segment. So if you have Segment and particle tools like that, it allows you to plug into so many different tools. You can basically try all the different tools, and if it doesn't work, you just flip a switch, you can try another tool. So there is a benefit there, but it is expensive, so I know companies may just go right into the product analytics tool. I would say it's hard to get it wrong completely, right?\n\n(01:11:19):\nIn order for a product analytics tool to be meaningful, the first step is you need to collect the data, you need to do some instrumentation, you need to have the foundation. And then, because it's garbage in, garbage out, if you send a bunch of garbage data into your product analytics tool, your analyst will be just even more confusing, right? It's like he doesn't know whether to trust the data, what to use. So a lot of company I work with, the first step is maybe not looking into tool, but do an audit of your data instrumentation situation, to understand how many of the key actions are intact, is the format correct, is the data, what are the gaps? And you may need to do some re-instrumenta ...\n\nHila Qu (01:12:00):\nRight, what are the gaps? And you may need to do some reinstrumentation, reformatting and things like that before you even plug into a product analytics to make it useful.\n\nLenny (01:12:10):\nFor someone that may want to do that audit, is there a thing you would point them to, or, I don't know, a blog, a course, something to help them understand if they're doing it right? Or is it like, \"Bring Hila on,\" and you need someone like you to kind of help them through it?\n\nHila Qu (01:12:24):\nNo, you can bring me, but you don't have to bring me. I think there are, if you search on Google just the data dictionary, or data product usage, data audit, a lot of companies published template and spreadsheet you can use. I can even send you a few afterwards.\n\nLenny (01:12:43):\nThat'd be amazing.\n\nHila Qu (01:12:44):\nAnd then you can just scroll through. Basically the key idea is go through your product experience, identify the key actions, and go through your data instrumentation and see, \"Do they match?\"\n\n(01:12:57):\nAnd the success of this is you identify the gaps and eventually you want to establish something called the data dictionary. I basically do that for a lot of my clients. And the data dictionary will include, here are all the key actions, what's the event name for each of those, and what are the property and things like that.\n\n(01:13:17):\nBut you now know, \"Hey, I have this action track, this is the name. If I have a new product manager or analyst, we can all refer to this.\" And everyone know the same definition rather than people are interpreting differently. So that's a very important part to success even before the tooling.\n\nLenny (01:13:39):\nAwesome. It also reminds me a previous guest, Crystal Widjaja, has a awesome post on why most analytics efforts fail. And she talks a lot about this, of how to set your events up for success. So we'll link to that as well.\n\nHila Qu (01:13:50):\nMm-hm.\n\nLenny (01:13:51):\nMaybe one last thing here, I'm trying to think about what would screw people up most, and it's probably not having a data warehouse and ETL sorts of tooling in place, because that feeds a lot of this.\n\nHila Qu (01:13:51):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:14:01):\nIs there anything you want to add there about just the importance of a data warehouse and how to set that up?\n\nHila Qu (01:14:06):\nSome of the early stage companies I work with, when they just get started in the very beginning, they don't have data warehouse. They just basically have their product and they have some sort of a Google Analytics or Amplitude, and that's it. It's pretty wild, but it's working and they can get to someplace from there.\n\n(01:14:25):\nBut as soon as you begin to have data user, it's time to get serious to establish a data warehouse, have some ETL solution. I think there are the most common best practice ones, like AWS and things like that. There are also some startups that are doing this and you can utilize as well.\n\n(01:14:49):\nBut again, as soon as you become a serious business, you should invest in that. Otherwise, it's pretty wild and it's pretty fragile as well.\n\nLenny (01:14:59):\nAnd when you say AWS, you mean at Redshift, I imagine?\n\nHila Qu (01:15:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:15:02):\nCool. Awesome. Okay, final area that we have time for, which is awesome, which is around building your team. So maybe just two questions here. What is your advice for starting the initial team investing in PLG? How does that usually look and what do you think people should do? And then later, how does that evolve over time?\n\nHila Qu (01:15:21):\nHow I see most companies started is the founder or the leadership team realize that they need to do PLG. And they build a conviction. Maybe initially there isn't even a dedicated team, but they did something here and there, they decided to invest in this.\n\n(01:15:40):\nAnd the common place to start is to hire a head of growth, or it can be a lead growth PM, but someone who has a little bit of experience in this area. And then they begin to build this core growth squad as the first growth team. And I think that's a very common place to start.\n\n(01:16:01):\nThe other place to start that's less common, but I also think it happening in reality, is maybe they will start a cross-functional, almost like a tiger team. Because if the initial focus area is, let's say, they want to do a product qualified lead, or basically add that funnel. That involves not only product team, that will involve data team because you want to know what are the usage pattern that indicate these is better leads. You also need to bring sales team in because they need to work on those leads to close them.\n\n(01:16:39):\nSo if that's the initial starting area, a cross-functional tiger team is also possible option. But the most common way is hire a head of growth, usually a growth PM, and then start a team with engineering, design, data to support that core growth squad.\n\nLenny (01:17:00):\nAnd the main difference between these two. One is dedicated, \"We are going to dedicate full-time people to helping us grow.\" Like I say we talked about earlier, let's say they're going to focus on activation and that's their whole job. Versus tiger team is basically they're borrowing resources from other teams and this is kind of a side project for them.\n\nHila Qu (01:17:18):\nYeah. A little bit, for a period of time. So it's temporary. It's kind of they almost to want to get into... I would say usually the cross-functional team, the tiger team, is a little bit prior to a full commitment. They're pretty much committed, but they still want to try this out and get a final conviction, and then they begin to dedicate resources.\n\n(01:17:43):\nAnd you ask about how do they evolve from there.\n\nLenny (01:17:46):\nBefore we actually get there, maybe one more quick question. Which would you recommend? I imagine you'd recommend a dedicated team, if you can do that.\n\nHila Qu (01:17:54):\nMm-hm.\n\nLenny (01:17:55):\nWhen would it make sense to go the tiger team route? In what cases?\n\nHila Qu (01:17:59):\nOne situation I would recommend is that if the initial focus area is, like I said, product qualified leads, the sales conversion path. Because if you think about you have a head of growth or a core growth PM, that person usually has a growth PM background and is in the product organization. And they're awesome if the initial focus areas are activation, conversion, those kind of involve a lot of experimentation. But activation and conversion are relatively confined, it's something the growth PM and engineer design data, they can work on.\n\n(01:18:39):\nIf your initial focus area you felt like, \"My biggest bit is actually do this PQL thing,\" it is a little bit harder for the growth PM to socialize all those cross-functional resources, because he need to get pretty deep into data. He need to have a counterpart in sales, even in marketing. So in that case, I think it's possible that maybe you start a tiger team.\n\n(01:19:03):\nYou can combine both. You can have a growth PM dedicated, but have some tiger team to be working with him or her on this PQL project as well.\n\nLenny (01:19:14):\nGot it. And I like this term tiger team, by the way. I haven't heard that before. It sounds like a lot of fun. Very dynamic. Okay, cool. And then yeah, what happens next after you have this initial team?\n\nHila Qu (01:19:24):\nOnce you have this initial team, it's important to give them the resources they need, and give them an initial focus area, give them support and a little bit time, allow them to try things out and get some early wins. And early win is the biggest thing I would say for, and whenever you start a new growth team, try to look for some opportunity, try to get some early wins in whichever focus area you choose.\n\n(01:19:53):\nAnd from there, if you get some of the wins, the team has some momentum, there are more confidence from the organization in PLG, right? It's time to potentially extend and formalize. So fundamentally I think you should not only think about the PLG team, you should think about the PLG org. Because PLG is a motion, it's cross-functional by nature, it's not just a product team or growth team.\n\n(01:20:24):\nEventually you need to get to the place basically there is a head of growth product, that's the center of the PLG org. But there's also need to be a head of growth marketing, that's his or her counterpart in marketing organization. And then a head of product led sales, that's the counterpart in the sales organization.\n\n(01:20:47):\nExactly where they sit, how they sit, it's different company by company. The most common one is head of growth product report to product org, head of growth marketing report to marketing, head of product led sales report to sales. But they have some sort of a very strong collaboration, because they are working in the same motion and same funnel. But I think that's next step, think about this org.\n\n(01:21:11):\nOnce you have those counterparts in product, in sales, in marketing, the next step is think about what are the metrics they own to make sure you can manage this funnel, this motion, in the data-driven way. Because the PLG metrics are very different from SLG. The top of funnel is more about high quality signups. You don't want a lot of traffic, you want free signup, free trials. But it need to meet certain quality bar, it's not just anyone.\n\n(01:21:46):\nAnd then the head of growth product, he or her top KPI is about usage, activation. Activated teams is a very common metric. And then maybe number of PQLs, that's another. You want to get those teams to certain usage threshold basically.\n\n(01:22:07):\nAnd then the head of product led sales, he will be focused on converting those PQLs into revenue. So he will focus a lot on conversion rate, efficiency and maybe revenue, things like that.\n\nLenny (01:22:23):\nGot it. And you're sharing a lot of org design verbally in the post, which we'll share obviously in the show notes. You can actually see a diagram of what these look like, to help kind of make it super clear.\n\n(01:22:36):\nI have maybe just one more question. Going back to the initial team, what are the functions you recommend they have on this like MVP PLG team?\n\nHila Qu (01:22:45):\nThe most important one is have a growth PM to be the lead, right? Head of growth, director of growth, lead growth PM. And then the growth PM, as you know probably very well, growth PM, he is a PM but has a much stronger skill set in analytics, experimentation, very data-driven. Think about metrics.\n\n(01:23:06):\nThe growth PM's way of working is similar to other product manager, but his KPIs is actually more similar to the sales and marketing work. He's very focused on the conversion rate, the journey, the funnel versus the feature specifically itself.\n\n(01:23:23):\nAnd then the other functions you need to have for sure, I would often say actually a data analyst needs to be the very first hire. Sometimes even try to find a growth PM who can do analysis if you're really small, you can find that type of unicorn person.\n\n(01:23:43):\nOr even before hiring growth PM, hiring analyst, I would actually go as far as that. Because without insight, without a lot of foundation, your experimentation, your effort is really directionless in a sense.\n\n(01:23:58):\nSo growth PM, analyst. And from there definitely you need some dedicated engineer, you need a designer. Designer can be somewhat not dedicated in early days, but engineer needs to be. Some sort of user research support as well, it doesn't need to be dedicated. But those are the core growth squad.\n\nLenny (01:24:18):\nOkay. Real actual last question here for the growth PM. In your experience, are they most often coming from within the company already and they kind of shift to this role? Or do you recommend they find someone externally?\n\nHila Qu (01:24:30):\nThat's an excellent question. I have seen both. I actually recommend if you can find someone internally, maybe he's a PM, he want to do growth. Or he is an analyst who want to become more like a product role.\n\n(01:24:48):\nI even have a one client, the head of growth I work with used to be a investor relationship, like head of investor relationship. And he reports to the CEO and founder. He's very analytical. He hasn't been a PM before, but he can socialize the resource within the company to launch experiments in product, in marketing, in all of that. And I, as an advisor, will come in, guide him in the area he's not familiar with. And we actually drive pretty good results together.\n\n(01:25:20):\nSo I think prefer hiring internally if possible. If not, if you really don't have anyone internally with that knowledge or with that interest, you can look outside. I would say map the initial growth PM hire to your starting point. If we already decided activation is the biggest focus area, try to find some growth PM with that experience. And if the conversion is a focus area, acquisition is the focus area, try to find someone with that experience.\n\nLenny (01:25:54):\nI love that advice. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got actually seven questions for you, the most ever we've had for a lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nHila Qu (01:26:04):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:26:06):\nOkay. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nHila Qu (01:26:10):\nThis first one is called The Almanack Of Naval. Yeah, I don't know whether we read that one. I really love that one. That's kind of a life-changing book for me. I have it-\n\nLenny (01:26:22):\nDo you have a favorite Naval-ism that comes to mind?\n\nHila Qu (01:26:26):\nI learned finding leverage from him. He talked about there are four type of leverage. It can be your writing, it can be code, it can be capital, it can be team. So the reason why I invest a lot in writing is I felt like that's my leverage. And I love that.\n\n(01:26:44):\nThe second book is called How Women Rise. I really love this one. I gifted this to a lot of my female team member and I really learned a lot from them.\n\n(01:26:56):\nAnd the third one is my book, it's called [Chinese 01:27:01]. It's only in Chinese, if you don't read Chinese you cannot read it. But I heard, my friends told me, if you are launching an email campaign, if you're doing experiments, have this book by the side, it will help with conversion rate just by its appearance.\n\nLenny (01:27:18):\nThat's amazing. Is there an English translation or is it only in Chinese right now?\n\nHila Qu (01:27:22):\nIt's only in Chinese, so you have to learn.\n\nLenny (01:27:25):\nAll right, I see. All right. There's an advantage there, if you can speak Chinese your email conversion will go up.\n\nHila Qu (01:27:29):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:27:30):\nAnd then just to the first book, it was called The Almanack Of Naval, right?\n\nHila Qu (01:27:34):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (01:27:35):\nIs that right?\n\nHila Qu (01:27:35):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny (01:27:36):\nOkay, cool. Sweet. And we'll link to all these. Okay, favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nHila Qu (01:27:41):\nI watched a movie, it's a sci-fi movie from China, it's called The Wandering Earth 2. It's by the famous author, Cixin Liu. He's the author of Three Bodies. I don't know whether you heard of it?\n\nLenny (01:27:53):\nMm-hm. Oh my God, love that.\n\nHila Qu (01:27:54):\nThat movie is awesome. It's kind of really cool. I really highly recommend it.\n\nLenny (01:28:00):\nI have to go check that out. Oh my God. I heard they're bringing Three Body Problem to Apple TV or Netflix. There's like a show coming.\n\nHila Qu (01:28:06):\nYes, yes. I look forward to that as well. I watched many versions already kind of film, none of them are good. So-\n\nLenny (01:28:17):\nThat's the problem it's so hard to do well. Oh man, I'm not optimistic, but I'm excited anyway.\n\nHila Qu (01:28:21):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:28:22):\nFavorite interview question that you like to ask.\n\nHila Qu (01:28:24):\nWhen I interview a growth PM or analyst, I will always ask, \"What is a experiment you launched that has a very unexpected result? And what did you do after that?\"\n\nLenny (01:28:37):\nWhat do you look for in an answer there that makes you feel like they are strong?\n\nHila Qu (01:28:41):\nSo first of all, they have to be launching a lot of experiments to get very unexpected answer. So if you are only... Many people remember their success for the interview, they prepare that very well. I don't want to ask, \"What's your successful experiment?\"\n\n(01:28:58):\nSecondly, I want to know just why it's unexpected. That reveals the deep, deep level of their thinking, how deep they are thinking. If they should expect that based on what they described, then they are not thinking deep enough, they are not understanding customer enough.\n\n(01:29:15):\nAnd what they do afterwards is also awesome. Like, \"How do you face a failure or unexpected result? What are the clues you can pursue? What are the actions you can take? How do you learn something out of it?\"\n\nLenny (01:29:28):\nI love it. What's a favorite recent product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nHila Qu (01:29:33):\nI would say, similar to everyone, ChatGPT. But also Lululemon yoga pants.\n\nLenny (01:29:43):\nAmazing. Great. What's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a tremendous impact on a team's ability to execute?\n\nHila Qu (01:29:51):\nYeah. At first I added basically a section in the dock, in the ticket stack. Ask the PMs to write the success metric ahead of time. As well as adding which of the growth lever this is helping. Is this contributing to acquisition, activation, retention, monetization? And it forced them to sometimes think through deeply, \"Why are we even doing this?\" Sometimes they ended up not doing that by just writing it down.\n\nLenny (01:30:23):\nI love that. Next question. I know you're big on children's books, do you have a favorite children's book?\n\nHila Qu (01:30:29):\nMy favorite children's book is called Someday, and I recommend everyone to check it out. And basically it's talking about how our children used to be our baby, become our kids, and when they are taller and more stronger than us and they will remember us.\n\nLenny (01:30:51):\nI'm going to need to check that out now. And final question. I know you're big on growth concepts, you have all these frameworks and concepts. And so what is your favorite growth concept?\n\nHila Qu (01:31:02):\nI would say north star metric, because I find it's not only valuable to growth, it's valuable to just everything.\n\n(01:31:10):\nWhen I think about what do I want to do with my career, does that fit my own personal north star metric? When I think about how I want to raise my kids, I think about what's the north star metric for successful education for my kid?\n\n(01:31:27):\nBecause it forced me to think long term. It forced me to think about what's valuable to me, to them, not only by the society standards, ARR revenue, like salary. And also what's my vision for myself and for my kids.\n\nLenny (01:31:43):\nI love that. It reminds me of a recent guest where she always asks, \"What are you optimizing for?\" Whether she's talking with her kids or her husband or her team, and it's a similar concept.\n\n(01:31:54):\nHila, this was incredible. I think we've shared tens of thousands of dollars of value, and it will probably lead to millions of dollars of revenue for a lot of companies. And it's everything I hoped it would be. Thank you so much for being here and for sharing so much wisdom.\n\n(01:32:08):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHila Qu (01:32:15):\nYeah, they can find me on LinkedIn. Just search Hila Qu, H-I-L-A Q-U. You can find me. I have a personal website that's under development, but I contracted it to my kid, to my 12-year-old. So he need to wait until summer and hopefully this summer he can finish it.\n\n(01:32:32):\nYeah, if you are a founder, you are looking for a growth advisor, feel free to hit me up. I'm always happy to just have a call with founders and leaders, get to know more people. And I'm a growth nerd, so I always want to nerd about growth anyway.\n\nLenny (01:32:51):\nAmazing. Hila, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nHila Qu (01:32:54):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:32:55):\nBye, everyone.\n\nHila Qu (01:32:56):\nBye.\n\nLenny (01:32:59):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to build a team that can “take a punch” | Hilary Gridley (Head of Core Product, Whoop)\n\n## Transcript\n\nHilary Gridley (00:00:00):\nProduct leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):\nYou spend a lot of time thinking about how to help your team learn to take a punch.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:00:10):\nIf they come to me and they're upset, I try to focus them less around how you litigate another person's impression of you and more on what is the action that you can take to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you. What are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nYou have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:00:31):\nI would really love it if more people were like, \"Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail. It's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nIs there something you've learned about when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:00:41):\nPeople think that the game is all about influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them. You come up thinking like you're the protagonist. But in the story of work, you are probably not the protagonist. You're not special.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:53):\nToday my guest is Hilary Gridley. Hilary is head of core product at Whoop. Previously, she was a senior director of product at Big Health and a senior product marketing manager at Dropbox. Even more importantly, she wrote what is now the sixth most popular post of all time in my newsletter, How to Become a Super Manager with AI. She's also the first ever cross over guest between this podcast and our sister podcast, How I AI with Claire Vo.\n\n(00:01:17):\nAnd not just that, her episode with Claire is on track to be the most popular episode of the podcast. So all that to say, Hilary is incredible and I'm so excited to continue learning from her. This conversation is packed with advice that will make you a better product leader, builder and also just a better human. If you know what's good for you, you don't want to miss this episode. A big thank you to Sam Propis, Danielle Reynold, and Kelvin Wong for sharing suggestions for this conversation.\n\n(00:01:42):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. Also, if you become an annual subscriber of my newsletter, you get a year free of a bunch of incredible products, including Superhuman, Notion, Linear, Perplexity, and Granola. Check it out at lennysnewsletter.com and click bundle. With that, I bring you Hilary Gridley.\n\n(00:02:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features.\n\n(00:02:27):\nToday, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.

Hilary, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:04:39):\nThank you, Lenny. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:41):\nI talked to a bunch of people that I work with you about what we should talk about and what you're amazing at. First of all, every one of them loves working with you so much. One of them is like, \"I joined Whoop just to work with Hilary and to report to her.\"\n\n(00:04:53):\nAnd of that, there's this theme that emerged that I think is a good overarching theme for our conversation, and it's something that you spend a lot of time thinking about, and it's how to help your team and how to help people within your company learn to take a punch. Essentially, how to help them deal with hard stuff and do hard stuff and build hard things. So I guess just broadly, does that ring a bell? Does that resonate?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:05:16):\nYeah, absolutely. It's something I care a lot about. I've been, I think, pretty lucky in my career. I've been very drawn to working on hard product problems, regulated areas, really hard business models, things with pretty high emotional stakes for the users of the products. You're really likely to run into a lot of setbacks along the way. And I think this is really relevant today because I look out and I talk to a lot of people and I hear fear and I hear uncertainty, and I think it comes from a few places.\n\n(00:05:50):\nI think obviously I'm really excited about AI and how it's transforming the way we work, and I think a lot of people are, but I think a lot of people are scared too. And they're embracing these tools, they're learning these tools, but a lot of them have a question in the back of their mind, what does this mean for the future of my job? And in many cases, what does this mean for my identity?\n\n(00:06:10):\nI think it makes people question even just how we provide value as humans in society. And I also think people, especially young people, today haven't even necessarily been in a career environment where there wasn't always a thread of layoffs or things like that. And I think that's taken a real psychic toll on a lot of people. And so I think all managers now really need to be able to lead their teams through uncertainty, through fear, through hard things.\n\n(00:06:37):\nAnd I love the concept of taking a punch. I've got a couple other tools that I like to use, but I think it can teach people how to thrive in these environments. And it's really important to me because I would love if more people took on hard things. I think there's so many really hard challenging problems out there to solve.\n\n(00:06:54):\nAnd the more people are fearful about the future of their careers or the future of work, I think the more they gravitate toward things that they feel like they're likely to succeed at. And I think that's wonderful. We need that too, but I would really love it if more people were like, \"Screw it. I'm going to do something that's probably going to fail and it's important and it's worth doing and I'm going to do it well.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:15):\nThere's so many Venn diagrams of why this skill is so important, especially today. One is it feels like the easy stuff is done. The stuff left to build is hard. It feels like hardware, deep tech is where things are heading. Also, just machine learning, AI skills, just stuff that's really hard. And then the other is just AI is just changing so much. It's just such a stressful time and hard time for a lot of people.\n\n(00:07:40):\nLet's actually walk through some of the things that you have learned about how to help people get good at these things, about how to help people learn to take a punch, AKA do hard things, deal with struggle. The first is you actually actively teach them. You have specific tactics that you teach your team to deal with hardship and to take a punch. So what are some of those things? What are some of the things that you teach your team and help them develop a skill?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:08:05):\nSo at its core, when I say take a punch, what I mean is you're going to run into situations where something has gone wrong. Maybe you have misstepped. Maybe you are just hearing someone speak critically about your work. Whatever it might be, you're going to feel like you have taken a punch.\n\n(00:08:21):\nIt's a very physical feeling. And I think as managers, you spend a lot of time teaching your team how to be successful. You want to prepare them to maximize the chances of good outcome. But if you don't also prepare them for what happens when that outcome isn't as good, you're going to run into some problems.\n\n(00:08:41):\nAnd so when I think about how to take a punch, what I say to my team is if they come to me and they're upset because something has happened, maybe they said something in a meeting that wasn't received well, or again, they're hearing somebody else talk about them in some way, whatever it is, I try to focus them less around whatever happened and how you litigate another person's impression of you based on something that has already happened, and more on what is the action that you can take next to counter program the narrative that you are afraid that this other person has of you.\n\n(00:09:15):\nAnd I think the counter program piece is really important. Because whenever we feel our egos injured, I think it's very natural for all of us to say like, \"Well, that's not fair. I want to correct the record.\" When you do that, I think more than often, more often than not, you come off as just looking defensive and you start obsessing over things that you don't actually have control over, which is what another person thinks of you. You don't even necessarily have that information.\n\n(00:09:41):\nAnd so I always ask myself in these moments, what is one thing that I can do, small, that will demonstrate the opposite of what I'm afraid this person thinks of me? And so I'll give you an example of this. I was in a meeting a while ago, and we were talking about different things that we wanted to start tracking in the Whoop Journal. And our chief technology officer suggested ketamine tracking.\n\n(00:10:06):\nAnd I thought she was making a joke and I laughed, and she looked at me very seriously and was like, \"This isn't funny, Hilary. This is a serious issue for a lot of people, and it's an emerging problem in some cases. And I think we should take it seriously. I think there's a lot of value we could provide here.\" And I was completely humiliated. Humiliated because I actually take this stuff really seriously. I take addiction really seriously. I have a ton of empathy for people who struggle with it.\n\n(00:10:36):\nAnd I also think of myself as somebody who embraces new ideas and wants to be on the forefront and would never laugh off something that seems like a fringe issue that's I think becoming actually more and more a big part of what's happening today. And so I realized that in that moment I was having that reaction because of the feeling that it gave me about who I am as a person, and I became so worried that this other person had the wrong impression of me.\n\n(00:11:06):\nAnd I wanted to follow up with her after and say, \"Let me explain myself. Let me explain why I didn't mean that,\" or whatever it is. But as I said, I think usually you're fighting a losing battle when you're trying to do that, and it draws attention to the thing that you did poorly. And you don't really want to draw more attention to it. You want to move on, take action, move forward. And so I thought about, well, what am I afraid that she thinks of me?\n\n(00:11:32):\nI'm afraid that she thinks that maybe I don't take some of these health issues seriously. I'm afraid she thinks that maybe I'm somebody who laughs off emerging trends. And so I thought about what's something that I could do to demonstrate the opposite of that?\n\n(00:11:49):\nAnd I did some research very, very quickly on what are some emerging public health concerns that people really aren't talking about that would be interesting to track? And I found some interesting research about sports betting, and especially young people in sports betting, and it's becoming this thing that a lot of public health experts are very worried about.\n\n(00:12:08):\nAnd so I very quickly just sent her a note that said, \"Wanted to build on this idea you had today. I really liked that idea, by the way. I saw this article, I saw this research about this other emerging thing, sports betting, and I think it'd be really interesting for us to start tracking that because we could maybe draw some correlations between people stress. We have a stress monitor in Whoop. We can track their stress. We could draw interesting correlations between betting behaviors and stress levels.\"\n\n(00:12:36):\nAnd so that's all I did. It took me five, 10 minutes total. But I think it's a great example of showing this idea of counter-program that narrative, don't fight about the narrative. And so when I teach this to my team, I'm always doing the same thing. They come to me. They seem agitated about something and I say to them, \"It seems like this is really bothering you. What's going on in your head? What are you afraid of? What are you worried about?\" And often it will emerge, \"I'm worried that this other person thinks I'm bad at my job. I'm worried that this person thinks I'm an idiot,\" whatever it is. And I challenge that. I think this is really important for managers too to challenge this negative thinking when you see it happen and not just validate it and allow them to go down these negative spirals.\n\n(00:13:17):\nI challenge it and I say, \"First of all, I don't think there's evidence for that. Is there evidence for that? And even if there is, it doesn't really matter. What's something that you could do to show them that it's not true because you know it's not true?\"\n\n(00:13:31):\nAnd I think giving people that power to focus on the next step they can take and the action that they can take that helps them feel more secure in their identity in who they are because their action demonstrates that, it just gets them out of that negative thinking and it gets them through that trough of despair that comes after you feel like you took a punch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:52):\nSo the idea here is when you're afraid somebody that matters in your career thinks ill of you, of something that you did, of you're not good at something or you think something that they're not happy about, this is a version of getting punched basically is you just feeling like someone thinks you're not doing a great job. And so the tactic here is how to change their mind almost about you and give you something tangible to do.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:14:16):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:17):\nOkay. And so the question to ask, and I wrote this down as you were talking, is, and this is what you ask of your reports, what is the one thing that you can do that demonstrates the opposite of what you think this person thinks about you?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:14:32):\nExactly. This comes up all the time. There will be narratives that emerge, some are good, some are bad, about you and your career. And I think especially when people get to a place where they're putting themselves out there more, they're talking in more presentations, they're talking in more meetings, it's very natural for them to become concerned with the perception themselves.\n\n(00:14:52):\nAnd it is scary because it feels like something, as I said, you don't have control over. And so exactly. If instead of focusing people around what do these people think of me, you focus them around, well, what are you going to do next to demonstrate that you are the person that you know yourself to be, I think that can just be incredibly effective at giving people more of a sense of agency.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:12):\nI guess talk about the balance of I'm just going to prove everyone wrong against what they think versus here's who I am and I know this is me and this person is mistaken. And instead of debating them, I'm going to show them who I am. Just not overstressing about everyone thinking things about you in different ways.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:15:30):\nThere is some value I think in having a little bit of a chip on your shoulder. You see that people who are really successful, they do have a little bit of like, \"I'm going to prove them wrong.\" And so I don't want to say that you shouldn't think about it at all or you shouldn't care. Of course, it's natural to care, and of course, it's fine to care, but I do want to just help my team build this habit of doing the things that you know to be right and having conviction in that.\n\n(00:15:57):\nBeing open to learning along the way and calibrating as you go, but not becoming overly concerned with your fears of what other people are going to think of you. Because I think especially for otherwise really thoughtful, really the people who are hard on themselves, I think that that just holds them back from being the person that they can be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:21):\nSo a key part of this is, this is going to help you stop just spiraling on thinking about what they think about you and gives you something to do that will change that. And then the other key point here is don't try to convince them otherwise. You're not going to go to your manager like, \"Oh, I really think ketamine therapy and addiction is really important, and I didn't mean to say it this way,\" and that kind of thing.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:16:45):\nI'm not interested in litigating the things that happened already when we can move forward. And I'm certainly not interested in litigating what another person thinks about a thing that happened. I feel like I've spent so much time talking to people in meetings, whatever it is, where it's just this ruminating on something that has already happened. It's very anxious thinking pattern, I think, and people can just get stuck in it. And so let them do it.\n\n(00:17:16):\nIt's like when you get bad feedback or critical feedback and you naturally have this reaction of, \"Oh, well, that's not fair because they don't understand. I actually have numbers I have to deliver on, or I only had 10 minutes to do this, so of course, it wasn't perfect.\" You naturally come up with these reasons why you are actually not wrong, and that's fine. I don't want to say you should feel bad for doing that.\n\n(00:17:45):\nLet yourself have the pity party, let yourself feel those things, but then you got to move on as quickly as possible because those feelings, they actually do tend to spiral and get worse if you're not actively working against them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:58):\nOftentimes these sorts of lessons come from the person experiencing this themselves. Is this something that you dealt with when you're starting your career or even now?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:18:08):\nOh, absolutely, 100%. And I think it is more than just my career, but just my general mental health and my life. A lot of where this comes from is a concept in cognitive behavioral therapy called behavioral activation. And in my former job, I was working for a company called Big Health and we make digital therapeutics. So those are mobile apps that have been clinically validated to treat behavioral conditions like insomnia, depression, anxiety.\n\n(00:18:39):\nAnd I was working on a new depression therapeutic, and so went very deep on this and was working with a really wonderful clinical team full of clinical psychologists who helped me understand the techniques that therapists use when they are working with people who have depression. And so much of depression is characterized by these negative thinking patterns and this feeling that I feel bad and I just need to wait until I feel better, and then I'll start doing the things that are good for me.\n\n(00:19:09):\nI don't feel like responding to this text, so I'm just not going to do it, but I'll respond when I feel better. I don't feel like working out, so I'm not going to do it, but I'll do it when I feel better. And the truth is that doesn't go away on its own, especially if you have depression. Again, the idea of behavioral activation is you have to identify these actions that you can take that will reverse that negative spiral and will improve your mood.\n\n(00:19:41):\nAnd so the misconception is I'll feel better and then I'll act. And the thing that therapists try to teach people, they're working with them in therapy is I will act and then I will feel better. But acting is hard if you are in the furrows of depression. And so easier said than done. And a lot of the work is in how you help people identify specific actions that they can take that will reliably lift their mood.\n\n(00:20:06):\nI mean, I have a list of myself. I've got a list on my phone of my behavioral activations, and it's things that I know I can do if I start feeling like the walls are closing around me, if I feel myself getting sucked into very low mood or negative thinking, or whatever it is. You can see how effective that is at just getting you out of there versus the instinct to just go and lay in bed and feel bad for yourself, which I understand very well.\n\n(00:20:35):\nAnd so understanding that concept, which is at its core a therapeutic concept used in cognitive behavioral therapy, but it changed how I see the entire world and how I see, especially as a manager, the ways that people on my team think and behave and how easy it is to get stuck in some of these downward spirals that you really need to actively push back on. And as a manager, I want to help them do that.\n\n(00:21:03):\nI want to help them, A, see that, see the ways they are in some ways sabotaging themselves, getting in their own ways with whatever is going on in their head. And then I want to help them counter-program it in themselves. And also, as I said, counter-program the things that you are worried about out there as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:22):\nSo interesting. So the core of this technique is what's an action, and you said this, it could be very small.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:21:28):\nVery small.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:29):\nThat you can take that in this case shows someone else you're not who they think you are. You're worried they think about you in a certain way and you want to take an action that helps them see you're not that.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:21:40):\nSo yes, that's the taking the punch concept. The behavioral activation could be anything. It can be picking up a piece of laundry off of the chair and putting it away, and that's just enough to get you out of the downward thing you're in. So behavioral activation just conceptually is, how are you taking action to reverse the downward feeling or the negative feeling that you're feeling? And then the take a punch concept is that applied in the context of I'm in a working environment.\n\n(00:22:10):\nI am very conscious of how I'm being perceived by other people. That's causing me a great deal of stress. I think especially for product people who are... So much of their self identity is wrapped up in having the answers, being competent, getting things done. And so many of them have been people who have been really good at that for most of their careers, which is how they got into these jobs in the first place.\n\n(00:22:32):\nI think that can be an extremely stressful thing for them. That in many cases can be the driver of burnout and the driver of I can't really handle the stress of this job anymore. And so I think the take a punch concept is more just applied to that specific problem of I'm struggling at work and I'm struggling largely because of my perceptions of other people and I want to feel more agency in that situation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):\nThis is so cool. On the idea of the specific take a punch concept, what kind of impact have you seen this have on people's mood and careers? How big a deal is this specific tactic?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:23:13):\nWell, I think it's a big deal on two levels. One, it's a big deal because it can help you in a crisis or a minor crisis. But I actually think it's a bigger deal because I see so many people who don't put themselves out there because they're afraid of how it's going to go. And so I think of the classic example of I'm often trying to encourage people to speak up in meetings more, to practice the skill of how you move a conversation forward in a way that can contribute value, both because doing so I think is important because nobody wants to be in bad meetings, but also because it will help with your career.\n\n(00:23:52):\nThis is how you get on people's radar as somebody who's like, \"Oh, that person's got great ideas, thinks about things the right way,\" whatever it is. I think it's one of these things that I talk to people about it and they are interested in coming to the meeting and hearing about these big decisions are getting made, but they just want to sit there and observe. And I'm like, first of all, every additional person in a meeting has a cost, because every additional person in a meeting makes the people in that meeting less candid than they would have been if there were fewer people in that meeting.\n\n(00:24:23):\nAnd so one key piece of a meeting is you usually have a problem you're trying to solve collectively as a group. And it's really hard to do that if people are being overly cautious about what they're saying because there's too many people in there. So when I tell people this, I'm like, \"It's really important that you earn your place in this meeting and let's work on how to do that.\"\n\n(00:24:46):\nAnd the core piece of that is you've got to say stuff that's valuable. And people always come up with all these excuses for why they can't do it. And one thing I've learned is that I think people are really good at coming up with very rational sounding reasons to not do things that just make them uncomfortable. But in their head they're like, \"Oh no, I'm too junior.\n\n(00:25:07):\nNobody wants to hear what I have to say. Or everyone was already thinking it. Or I like to process things internally. And by the time I say them, the conversation moved on,\" whatever it is. So much of that skill, it's like a communication skill at its core, it's just how to express yourself verbally, but so much of the blocker of that is I think fear. Fear of saying the wrong thing.\n\n(00:25:30):\nFear of looking stupid. Fear of just the discomfort of everyone in a room turning and looking at you as you're trying to formulate a half-baked thought. And so if you can help people be less afraid of that, that's 90% of the challenge of actually improving some of these skills. And so I think when you give people the skills of taking a punch, you are helping them feel less afraid of getting the punch in the first place. And that's why I think it's so important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:58):\nThat's profound, the second order effect of the skill. There's something you mentioned when we were chatting earlier that stuck with me with this idea that too many PMs and too many people are playing on easy mode and not trying hard things.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:26:10):\nUh-oh. Maybe we'll get ourselves in trouble here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:10):\nOkay, let's do it. Say more.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:26:16):\nOh, I think this is my hot take. You hear people talking about craft and taste and product management, and it's all very wonderful. And I'm totally on board. I love it. I'm a sucker for that kind of thing, but I'm like, well, if you are really in it just for pure love of the game, you just love product management, why are you building products for people exactly like you who have all your exact same at a company that sells to other companies that doesn't worry about pricing?\n\n(00:26:50):\nThere's no real... I mean, I don't want to act like I think this is easy, to be clear. But in the grand scheme of things, I wish that the people who have this pure love of product management and have this pure love of building things that you would see more of that applied to building for low income people, building for social services, things like that, that really, really need that kind of work.\n\n(00:27:16):\nAnd I think there's a level of prestige obviously associated with working in certain companies, and you get less of that in other industries. And so people would naturally gravitate toward that. I totally get it. I totally get it. You get paid better. No real judgment from me. I wish I saw more, but I wish that you would see more people. And I'll say this, I know there's a lot of you out there.\n\n(00:27:37):\nI know there's a ton of people out there doing really, really important work in really, really hard spaces, and I see you and I appreciate it and shout out to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):\nAwesome. Okay, I'm glad you shared that. Thank you. I think this will resonate with a lot of people. I want to move on to another trait/habits/skill that you are good at and help people learn, which is being very transparent in what's happening within the organization, within your thinking. You almost help people think the way you think and see the way you think so that they can operate at a higher level. Just talk about that, what that looks like and why that's important.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:28:13):\nIt's interesting, I think another thing I hear a lot of people complain about in organizations is the why do 10 people have to sign off on this email before I send it kind of problem. And I think the answer to that is because those 10 people all have different information, different context, and in many cases, completely different working models for how the CEO of the company and other strategic leaders in the company think.\n\n(00:28:42):\nAnd it makes things super inefficient. I think people will often say like, \"Oh, it's a process problem.\" It's not a process problem. It's not approval problem. I think it's a transparency and it's communication problem, like downward communication, outward communication. And what I mean by that is when I think about artifact-based communication, so reading a strategy document for...\n\nHilary Gridley (00:29:00):\nAbout artifact-based communication. So reading a strategy document, for example. Everyone at the company reads the strategy document. Great. Everyone is working from the same idea of what the strategy is. But then things change, right? Especially if you're working in a really dynamic space, new competitive threats emerge, new opportunities emerge all the time. This is especially true now with AI. Obviously everyone is lighting their strategies on fire and trying to figure out the best way to sort of transform their organization. And so if the way that you understand what's going on at the company is from reading a document that was written six months ago, you're going to be working from outdated information and you're not going to be able to think and respond to new things that happen.\n\n(00:29:44):\nAnd so what is much more helpful than understanding what your CEO thinks is, I think understanding how your CEO thinks. And that goes for all sorts of levels of the company. I want to understand how all the strategic leaders at my company think, and I want my team to understand how I think. And when I feel confident that people on my team understand how I think, I don't need to read their emails, I don't need to approve things. The times where I feel like I need to do that is because I'm working with people where I'm like, I don't have confidence that these people understand how I think, or I don't have confidence that they understand how this email or whatever it is, is going to be received by this important person.\n\n(00:30:28):\nAnd so I try to teach that to my team. And the way that I do that is a few ways. First, I'm in meetings with people, important people at the company. So I'm constantly hearing the things that they're saying and paying attention to sort of the note behind the note. Why do I think they're saying this? What insight do they have that they're bringing to this conversation that might not be obvious? And I try to make an effort every week. I don't always do it, but I try to send my team just a quick rundown in Slack of, \"Here are the most important conversations or the most interesting conversations I had this week. Here's what that person said verbatim.\"\n\n(00:31:07):\nAgain, I write a lot of notes so I've got it. If you've got a transcriber, maybe that'll help you. \"And here's what I interpret that as. Here's why I think they say that. Here's where I think that's coming from and here's what I'm going to do differently as a result.\" And these aren't long. And sometimes if I don't have time, I'll just, in a team meeting, I'll literally just go through my notes from the week and sort of voiceover stuff and editorialize it as I go. And over time, I think my team has a pretty good sense of what people are saying and how to think about the thinking behind it and how this person thinks, how this person thinks and how I think. And I think when you get an entire organization working that way where everyone's working from the same models of what the CEO thinks matters, what level of risk tolerance the company has, things like that, then you can actually start to move much, much faster and communication becomes much, much, much less painful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:04):\nSo the tactic here is to help your teams kind of build a mental model of everyone in the company that matters so that it's... The way you put it almost is when they're emailing them or asking for something, they already know how they're going to respond. Is they're an example you could share of something like this, of just something a person at Whoop of how they think? I don't know, maybe you could keep it anonymous just to make this a little reel of the kind of mental model you might want to build around someone.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:32:29):\nSo our CEO, Will, is somebody who obsesses over pixels in a way that is challenging to get things through design review, but I think results in a product that is a thousand times better than it would be if he were accepting of small excuses here and there for, \"Oh, well this, we had to cut scope here. We couldn't quite do what they wanted here.\" He sets a high bar and he holds it and he doesn't compromise. And I think this can sometimes get misconstrued, and I think a lot of people might think that he just wants maximal scope on everything. And I think that is a misunderstanding of what he cares about.\n\n(00:33:18):\nWe often get feedback from him that's like, \"This doesn't feel like the future and everything that we're building needs to feel like the future.\" A lot of people hear that and they're kind of like, \"Oh gosh, we're never going to get this thing done on time. We can't make any sort of sacrifices to scope or anything like that.\" But when I hear that, what I hear is more that we have this AI coach in the product, we have all this amazing data in the product. We're tracking every single one of your heartbeats and we're pulling at all this other data and we have every screen is a moment to show that to people in a way that feels like something that has never existed before.\n\n(00:33:59):\nAnd there are small ways to do that, right? It's like how you pull in. If you're explaining a concept like VO2 Max, which is a measure of your cardiovascular health, you can explain that to people with static content or you can explain that to people by bringing their data into the method of explanation that you're using. You can make it really conversational because you're using this AI coach. You can make it feel more like you're talking to a person and a person who by the way has all the data about you, which doesn't exist today.\n\n(00:34:29):\nYour doctor doesn't have that, your coach doesn't have that. And that's not like, \"Oh gosh, we've got to blow up the scope on this thing and make it a hundred X as big.\" But it's finding these little touches to say, \"Wow, that was really magical, that was really thoughtful and this feels like the future. This feels like I'm very conscious of the fact that this product knows so much about me and is able to sort out the signal from the noise on that in these really small and elegant ways.\" And so for something like that, I would get that feedback in design review or I'd hear that in a design review and maybe one of my PMs would be in that design review.\n\n(00:35:05):\nAnd so I bring that to the team. And I hear of things like that in a few different design reviews. So I bring those back to the team and I'm like, \"I've noticed that recently we are consistently getting this type of feedback. Here's why I think it's really important to Will, because I think he's really focused on building the health company of the future. And I don't want you all to think that this just means we have to just throw AI at everything and we have to just throw maximum scope at everything.\n\n(00:35:32):\nI think the key is understanding on the matrix of cost and effort for impact, what are those high impact but low cost ways that we can just find and sprinkle through the experience and really try to make that magical?\" So I'm connecting the dots for my team. Right? I'm saying, \"You weren't in all these meetings, but I saw it. Here's what I heard. Here's my interpretation of what I heard, and here's how I'm thinking about how this other person thinks about it. And so as a result, here are some things that I think we can do across our product going forward.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:06):\nEssentially these are principles, values, or tenets per person of what matters to them.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:36:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:12):\nSo for Nick it's, \"This needs to feel like we're living in the future.\" It can't just be like another heartbeat dragging out.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:36:18):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):\nThis is so cool. And there's so many trickle-down benefit to this. One is people feel like they're aware of what's happening. That's one of the most common, I think, piece of feedback people have with big companies. Like, \"I don't know what's happening.\" So there's so much visibility to all the secretive stuff happening in the meetings. \"I don't know what people are deciding my fates and all these discussions.\" So I think just even knowing that you're sharing all this is so powerful.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:36:40):\nWell, and on that note, when I approach these conversations, I always try to think of them as, even if I don't agree with the feedback, if I don't agree with the decision, what is the insight that I'm missing? How am I wrong about this? In ways like, what would be true for this other person to be right? And I'll go through that thought exercise and I might not get to the other side and agree with it. I might still think I'm right or whatever. But oftentimes it forcing myself to think that way forces me to think about how this other person thinks it. And if I do that enough, I will be like, \"Oh, this makes sense. I think this makes sense if. I think this makes sense if, and oh, maybe this other thing is true.\"\n\n(00:37:18):\nAnd I think when I hear the people, the people who are like, \"I don't know what's going on with this company,\" I think they do the opposite. I think they look for reasons to disagree and they look for holes to poke in, \"Well, this decision doesn't make any sense because I came up with something that might be wrong about it.\" And I think that's another thing, by the way, in terms of just sort of helping your team have the emotional maturity to exist and thrive in an organization is helping them think that way, helping them understand you have a point of view.\n\n(00:37:44):\nYour point of view is important, but on some level, you do kind of have to have respect for these other points of view and have the humility to think that maybe they're onto something that you're not onto. And it's amazing how much you can learn into it without having to have all the facts just by doing that. If you're like, \"Well, this person's behavior makes sense in a situation where X, Y, and Z is happening,\" oftentimes you'll find that X, Y and Z is happening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):\nI'm glad you went there. I wanted to actually follow this thread, which is kind of a different direction, but I think a lot of people are always struggling with this as a leader. When your leader disagree, it does say something that you completely disagree with, but you still need to represent that as, \"Here's the thing we're doing.\" But you don't want to be like, \"Oh, just because Nick said so.\" Because you lose power as a leader. Is there something you've learned about how to do that well when your leader tells you to do something you disagree with and you still need to get your team to do it.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:38:39):\nFirst, I do try to go through the what if I'm wrong exercise. I think a lot of people just sort of expect that if you ask somebody a open-ended question like, \"Why are we doing this?\" You're going to get a straightforward answer. And oftentimes the answer is not straightforward for various reasons. Maybe there's confidentiality reasons, maybe there's just somebody is acting on a hunch, but that hunch is informed by years or decades of reps of developing judgment, and they're probably really onto something. And it's not just this kind of arbitrary gut feeling. But whatever it is, I really try to get to the bottom of, let me really make sure that I have done my best to understand this person's point of view.\n\n(00:39:23):\nAnd I have some sort of tools for doing that, which I can also talk about. But if I've done that, and I still disagree, I'm relatively candid about that, but candid in a way where it's still respectful. I think what you want to avoid is a situation where as a manager you're like, \"Ah, I have no control. This sucks. This decision is so stupid, but that's a job, so we have to do it.\" Obviously that's not going to set your team up for success or make anybody happy about it, but you do hear that, you do see that happening. And so I think what I try to do in those situations is separate out my opinion from it, from the, \" Well, what is the insight that makes it make sense to this person\" and explain their rationale.\n\n(00:40:04):\nEven if I'm comfortable saying, \"I don't necessarily think this isn't how I would do it,\" or \"I don't even really agree with how they're thinking about it, but from their point of view, from their perspective, their professional experience, whatever it is, I could see how this makes sense. And they might be right. I don't think they're right, but they might be. Let's find out. We're not going to find out if we are all squabbling about whether this is a good idea the whole time. The only way we're going to find out is if we give it the best shot that we have and try to do it. And if we're wrong, that happens sometimes and we try again.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:40):\nI like that this comes back to your mental model orientation of, \"Here's their mental model, here's what their experience has been like, here's how they see the world, the trends, and then this is why they think the way they think.\" And so instead of encouraging your team or yourself even to be like, \"No, no, you're wrong here.\" It's more, \"Okay, here's their data set, let's try this, and this will inform that data set and maybe change their mind.\"\n\nHilary Gridley (00:41:03):\nYeah. Because I think in product, I like to joke, there's no right answers. Right? There's only wrong answers, and you're just trying to execute well on the least wrong answer that's available to you. And so I think it is the sort of reasonable people can disagree about this stuff at all of this is what I think, and this is how I would approach it. I think this is what they think and I think this is why they would approach it this way.\n\n(00:41:27):\nAnd again, the only chance we have of succeeding is not being torn apart on that. And so at the end of the day, if it's not a obviously terrible answer, and sometimes even if it isn't obviously terrible answer, you're still more likely to succeed if you just sort of reorient yourself around a world where it's not a terrible answer and then just try to will that into existence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):\nYou said that you have some tools to help you understand someone's point of view. I can't help but ask more about that.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:41:56):\nI talk about what I like to call the magic questions, but the thing about magic questions is they're not actually questions, they're statements and they end with, \"Do you agree?\" Or \"Is that right?\" And so I have found this, the most helpful way for kind of trying to understand a person's mental model is to just put facts in front of them and see what they say no to and what they say yes to. And then if you can get them to explain, great. And if they're good communicators, they often can, but if they're not, you don't have to let that stop you view. And so I mean, I'll do this even just as an example in a non-leadership context with if I'm working with legal teams or compliance teams or things like that, they're often working from a literal set of rules. Right?\n\n(00:42:40):\nThere are laws, there are regulations, and you are trying to understand if we were to take this path, would that be okay? Would that not be okay? And sometimes that's not straightforward. Sometimes there's regulatory areas that are up to interpretation. And so when I first started working in a regulated space, I would find this kind of frustrating and confusing because I would say, \"Can you just give me the rule so I can understand what's right and what's left of it?\" And they'd be like, \"Oh, well, it depends. It depends, it depends.\" And so I learned that if I kind of flip that and approached that, \"Well, what if we did X, Y, and Z?\n\n(00:43:22):\nWhat if this is what it looked like? What if this is what the copy said? Would that be okay?\" No, yes. If no, why? If yes, why? And so I'm sort of teasing out the mental model rather than asking them to explain it to me. And this is what I tell my team all the time to do this to me. When they come to me and they say, \"Well, what do you think I should do?\" Or \"What could I have done differently?\" I'll say, \"Rephrase that as 'Tell me what you think you could have done differently.' And then ask me if I agree.\" And when I do this, I think it has a few benefits. One, it helps them kind of calibrate their judgment over time.\n\n(00:43:58):\nSo they're actually forcing themselves to make this assertion. And then they're kind of calibrating how close that was to how I would think about it, which will get you much faster, much further than just asking open-ended questions and getting the answer. And then the second part of it is they don't become reliant on me for answering these questions. I think that's kind of a trap that a lot of managers fall into is people come to you with questions, you want to help them, you answer the question, and then you find that they come to you with all their questions and you're kind of like, \"Yeah, you got to solve some of these on your own.\" So again, I think the magic questions to me, is that right? Do you agree? And anytime you find yourself tempted to ask an open-ended question to somebody whose brain you're trying to understand, stop yourself and say, \"Let me just say that. Let me say as a statement what I think,\" and then try to calibrate based on their reaction. And I think that's the fastest way to understand how another person thinks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:51):\nIt makes me think about a lot of people, it could come across as it's a weird manipulative way of asking someone stuff, but it turns out that we're not good at really knowing what we think or know a lot of times. And you need someone almost to interview you in a really effective way to get out all this knowledge. And this is just a really simple way of getting that idea.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:45:10):\nIt's funny because when I talk about this, I get that reaction a lot where people are like, \"Well, doesn't it feel coercive?\" And I'm like, \"Well, you got to go in pure of heart.\" You've got to go in open to being wrong and even expected to be wrong. And you have to make that clear to them. Right? If you're coming in and you're like, \"Here's what I think. You agree? You agree?\" Of course you're not getting the answer you want. Or you might get the answer you want, I might get a yes. If your goal is to get to yes, that's not what I'm talking about.\n\n(00:45:36):\nIf your goal is to understand and you are coming from a, \"Help me understand how I'm wrong, help me understand what I'm getting wrong here\" and approach it with that sort of curiosity and humility and make sure that you're caring yourself and presenting yourself to this person in a way that shows that, that you're not coming in hostile or forceful or something. Yeah. Because there are absolutely circumstances where you're doing that and you're going to get bad intel because you're making the person uncomfortable, so they're going to lie to you. But that's I think, a whole set of interpersonal skill that we probably don't have time to talk about today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:09):\nI wanted to come back to, you said this interesting insight about your CO that he wanted to build something that felt like the future. I just wanted to share, there's a story that has always stuck with me at Airbnb. There was a big launch coming up and there was a designer sitting late in the office trying to update the website to include this new product. It was a launch of Airbnb Neighborhoods, I don't know, 10 years ago. And she was just like, \"Hey, Joe.\" And this is Joe Gebbia was walking around the office. And she's like, \"Hey Joe, what do you want the website to be?\n\n(00:46:41):\nWhat do you want it to look like? What should we try to...\" And it was going to launch in two days. He's like, \"Build something the internet has never seen before.\" And now this makes... It's interesting because when I always think about that story and tell that story, it's like, this is a crazy ask. And now as you share an approach for how to handle something like that, it really changes my perspective to like, \"Okay, what's Joe's worldview? Why is that the way he saw the world and why we needed to build a site like that,?\" Which I could start thinking about, but that's a really interesting way to just handle things that sound absurd and out of nowhere.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:47:18):\nI agree so much. I proud former English major, and so I'm a huge proponent of reading fiction and reading in general. And I feel like that's where so much of this comes from for me. It is just a curiosity for in what world does this make sense for this person? And it's so easy to look at another person's behaviors, another person's actions and what they say and just be like, \"That doesn't make any sense.\" And I find that, I don't know, your relationships become so much richer, even just in a work context, when you approach it with that, \"What is the world of this person where the thing that they're saying makes sense?\"\n\n(00:47:58):\nAnd I feel like in my life, honestly, a lot of my frustration has come from being frustrated with other people. And so this is something that I've had to learn over time. Because when I come home from work and I'm just like, \"Oh, this person said this and it didn't make any sense, and this person's totally out to lunch and leadership doesn't know what's going on.\" All I was doing was making myself miserable.\n\n(00:48:21):\nAnd actually worse than that, I was making myself miserable and I was making myself pretty useless to the company. And so I would get frustrated because I was like, \" No, nobody appreciates my perfect, unique, beautiful insight and all these other people have no unique, beautiful, perfect, concise, just wrong opinions.\" And so I feel like that's been a big area of growth for me, honestly, is learning to approach people that way. It's not just like, \"Oh, this is a nice thing to do,\" but I think it genuinely makes me a happier person. And yeah, I think a lot of it comes from reading fiction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:55):\nI love that we're just unpacking the onion of the power of this very specific habit of just helping you learn the mental model of the people around you. And-\n\nHilary Gridley (00:49:05):\nI feel like this is just making me sound like a crazy force.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):\nNo, there's so much power to this. As you talk, I'm like, \"Wow, there's so much value here.\" Because not only is it, you talk about how this is the source of a lot of burnout for a lot of people where they're just so frustrated, the CEO or the chief product officer, designers just like, \"I hate this.\" Why are they just asking all these ridiculous things, keeping the bar way too high? It's just nothing's ever good enough.\"\n\n(00:49:26):\nBut not only does it help you feel better about their asks, because you can understand where they're coming from, it also helps you be more effective and helping them change their mind potentially and see a different perspective because now you see the data that informs their perspective and you could help adjust that or kind of poke at it like, \"Hey, are you sure this is true? Are you sure I don't know, they're a competitor and this is how they see it. Maybe it's not. Let's look into that a little deeper.\"\n\nHilary Gridley (00:49:54):\nYeah, it's really interesting. At my last company when I started reporting to the CEO, they found various coaches for me to work with, and one of them was the former chief product officer at Coinbase who's gone to found Bridge, which is just that apart by Stripe for a ton of money. One thing that he said to me that really stuck with me is when you're reporting to the CEO and as a chief product officer, the big mistake that people make is they think that the game is all about getting what is inside their head and influencing the CEO, influencing the people around them to make it so, and if you go into the role trying to do that, you're going to fail because actually what your job is to do is to understand what the CEO's vision is and what they care about, again, sort of how they think about things and figure out how to operationalize that in a way that results in the best possible manifestation of it in the form of product.\n\n(00:50:56):\nAnd that was just such a radically different way from what I ever thought my job was. Again, to go back to sort of the fiction example, you kind of come up thinking you're the protagonist. And you can be the protagonist in your life. You can be the protagonist in the story of your family, but in the story of your work of a company, you are probably not the protagonist. And as much as it can feel kind of weird to say that I genuinely think some of the best advice I've got in my life in terms of things that have just not only transformed how I see the world and how I act in it, but just my own sense of happiness is you're not special. And I used to spend so much time and energy just being like, \"Oh, people don't see it my way and I have to convince them.\n\n(00:51:49):\nAnd when you're in an organization, it's an ecosystem. Right? It's an organization full of people who are all trying to work together to get a thing done. And if every single one of those people is operating from their own protagonist viewpoint of \"This is how I actually see the world, this is what I think we're here to do and I need to convince everyone around me at all times,\" it becomes extremely inefficient. It becomes extremely painful, because everyone's just fighting all the time. And so in some ways it feels like you're kind of, it sounds almost defeatist.\n\n(00:52:20):\nI'm always worried about the sounding. I'm just like, \"Yeah, just do whatever the boss says.\" And that's not how I feel at all. I think it's incredibly important to bring your skills and your talents and your perspective to the job you have and really your taste and your craft and all of these things. But I do think this idea of understanding how to build a shared mental model of everyone together that definitionally cannot be defined by your own narrow perspective, actually just makes work a lot better for everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:49):\nSo then a lot of people, like you said, I love that you went there, is just like if you're, because it could sound like, okay, your job is just to execute what the CO tells you. There's no value to your insights and perspectives, and you're just get out of the way. You're just get everyone to do the thing the CO wants. Where do you... I guess, in your experience or just advice on where's the fulfillment for you then as a CPO or example or a director of product where it's not that fun just to be there executing a CO's vision and not have any input?\n\nHilary Gridley (00:53:20):\nWell, and I think there's so many decisions all the way down and there's so many micro places where you can zig where others would've zagged. And I think I personally, a lot of where my fulfillment comes from is from feeling like if somebody else were in this job, it would be done differently. And something about the product is different because I was the one who worked on it because I was in the job. And that comes from my unique perspective, my unique point of view, the experiences I've had in the past, my various influences. And I think it's trying to figure out the right level for it so that you're not pushing against an immovable force.\n\n(00:54:03):\nIt's almost like if you're playing Jenga and you're sort of trying to feel around to find, okay, well, where are the pieces that can move? And when you know how somebody else thinks A, you can find that there are immovable forces. Those are not the battles worth fighting. But there are also areas where maybe they don't know as much, and there's also areas where maybe they're actually kind of scared because they don't know as much. And maybe that's an area where you have an interesting point of view. And so you can step into that role and be tremendously valuable and being tremendously influential.\n\n(00:54:33):\nBut you can only do that if you have a good frame for kind of what the model is and where are the things where it's like, okay, we are operating on a person's insight here that is itself extremely unique and extremely valuable, and it is the reason this company even exists in the first place. But that, I mean, there's millions of decisions have to get made, you know what I mean? And there's millions of different places that you can put yourself. And so I think it's just kind of constantly feeling out for where are the places that I'm really spiky? Where are the things that I think I do really well? Where are the gaps? And again, you can only find those if you're engaging really good faith and engaging earnestly and really understanding how other people think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:19):\nThere's two really interesting thoughts that I have as you're talking that I think will even further crystallize what you're saying. One is that you're just saying, this is the way the world works. It makes me think about Jeffrey Pfeffer, he was a guest on this podcast. He teaches this class at Stanford Business School about how to gain power in the world. It's like the rules of power. And he talks about, and it's all these ways to influence and win and achieve and gain status and all these things.\n\n(00:55:45):\nAnd he's like, this part doesn't sound fun and great, but I talk about here's the way the world works and is not the way you wish it would be. And what you're describing is the way a company works is the CO in charge and your job is to, they're the boss. And the sooner you understand their vision trumps your vision, the easier everything gets. You're not there to tell the CO, \"Here's what we should be building.\" Right? Their job is to own the vision of the business and the company.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:56:18):\nYeah, I think that's true. And if you disagree with it, you probably shouldn't be working at that company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:22):\nYeah. The other piece is, it's just the vision. Here's the vision of the future of where we're heading. If we win, here's what will be true and the world will look like. But there's so much more that you need to figure out that is to achieve that vision. And that's basically the role of the CPO and director of products, all those sorts of folks-\n\nHilary Gridley (00:56:41):\nAnd of everyone at that level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:41):\nEveryone at the company.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:56:43):\nAnd I think how you said it there is so right on, because it is like, the vision is in many ways, I mean, in some ways it's execution base, but in many ways it's a vision of what the world is going to look like in five years, in 10 years. And so in some ways, I would say your job is, if you can understand that and you can understand here's what this person thinks the world is going to look like, assuming all that is true, what are the things that I can do to maximize the chances of that and becoming the actual future?\n\n(00:57:18):\nAnd then also, what does that mean for a product? What does that mean for if it has to be true? That take Whoop, for example, if there's a vision of the future where you have all of your health data in one place and we're able to detect health issues before you even know you have them and we're able to do really hyper-personalized coaching to help you understand how your behaviors today are impacting how healthy you're going to be in decades, what does that mean for what Whoop needs to be today and what does that mean for how it needs to evolve in the next couple of years in order to both make that a reality but also win in that world. And I do think that's exactly where the people in the right.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:58:00):\nAnd I do think that's exactly where the people in the rank and file can be tremendously influential. It's that level of, \"I'm going to fight with you about how the world's going to work in five years,\" where I think you're just fighting a losing battle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:13):\nAnd if you don't like the vision, you could leave, right? It's like, or try to change it. Those are two options.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:58:18):\nAnd I think, to your point about pushing back, because you asked about this. Again, I never want it to sound like I'm just defeatist, \"just accept it.\" I'm a very opinionated person.\n\n(00:58:28):\nI go to the mat for things that I think are true, and so, I teach my team, \"You have to be really good at forming arguments, and that can show up in different ways.\"\n\n(00:58:40):\nSome people are really good at doing that with data. Some people are really good at doing that with the qual and the quant, and moving it together. But you have to be able to advocate for what you think is true in the most compelling way possible. And you have an obligation to do it.\n\n(00:58:56):\nAnd if you have done it, and you've done it well, and it didn't work, that's when it's time to say, \"Well, maybe there's something here that I wasn't seeing previously.\" And that's where I think it's time to have some humility around it.\n\n(00:59:09):\nBut it's a journey. You don't start from, \"Well, I got nothing to say here.\" So I think knowing where you are on that journey is important, too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:18):\nThis reminds me, there's a PM leader at Airbnb, who ended up leading a new initiative, and they ended up doing a bunch of stupid stuff. And he's like, \"I'm realizing that it's me that needs to be pushing back on stuff, now that I'm in charge of this product team. I'm the person that needs to convince the CEO this is a bad idea.\" And I am just realizing, that after doing a bunch of stuff, that it was stupid.\n\nHilary Gridley (00:59:44):\nYou will see that idea is that you do have an obligation to try to convince them that it's a bad idea. And you're going to be right sometimes, and you're not going to be right every time.\n\n(00:59:51):\nI think that that's why it's so hard to talk about these things in absolutes, because sometimes you're right, and sometimes you're not right. And it is important to get really good at knowing the difference, and knowing where you go from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:03):\nThis episode is brought to you by Attio, the AI native CRM.

You mentioned that WHOOP now does VO2 Max, and this is not a promotion for WHOOP, but that's so cool.\n\n(01:01:12):\nThat's a huge thing to track, that this is the thing that Peter Thiel and all these guys are always saying, \"This is the thing you want to track, to understand your health and progress as your VO2 Max. It's like your blood oxygen level.\" I don't know exactly what it's, but that's cool. The new WHOOP lets you do that.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:01:28):\nThere's so much cool stuff we're doing right now. I'm like, I don't know if I want to get into it all right now, but I can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:33):\nWe'll get back to it. We'll get back to it.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:01:34):\nAll right. Let's get back to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:36):\nOkay, cool. Yeah. Okay. So another habit/skill that you are really good at, that I've heard from folks is, and you've mentioned this a couple times, is just building habits, helping your team build good habits.\n\n(01:01:49):\nAnd coming back to the CBT stuff, just like behavior loops and things like that. Talk about just what that is, why that's important, what you help your team learn there.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:01:58):\nYeah, I'm obsessed with habit formation, and reward loops and behavior change, and all of these things. And when I think about trying to change behavior on your team, or just trying to encourage your team to do more of the behaviors that you believe are associated with success, I think a lot of people think about it more of an education model, where it's like, you teach the thing, you assess the thing, and then there's some accountability around the thing.\n\n(01:02:27):\nAnd I think, if you think about it more in the context of behavioral psychology, it actually works a lot better. So I'll give you an example. Many leaders have been trying to think about how to drive AI adoption, AI upscaling on my team, and what that can look like.\n\n(01:02:48):\nAnd when I talk to people about this outside of the company, I'm always surprised like, \"Well, how do you measure it, and how do you enforce it?\" And I don't really think about any of that stuff. I'm thinking about, \"How am I creating habits around using this?\"\n\n(01:03:05):\nAnd for me, there's a couple of things there. So it's consistency. How are you getting someone doing something every single day? And to do that, it has to start small. It has to start super easy. You have to give them things that take no more than a minute or two to do.\n\n(01:03:21):\nAnd actually, I have a 30 days of GPT, I call it, of a list of 30 things to do, one every single day, that I don't know anyone who has gone through this, and not come out the other side, feeling a hundred times more confident in their skills, and actually using it every day as a habit, because it's built as a habit formation tool, and not an education tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):\nAnd this is using a specific GPT build, or building their own GPT, or what's the habit there?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:03:45):\nThe habit is using ChatGPT, or Claude, or any of these tools-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):\nOh, okay. Okay, got it. I got it.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:03:50):\n... [inaudible 01:03:50] tools, to get their work done, in just a generic and get work done way. And so, I have this little tool, if you sign up for my newsletter, I'll send it to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):\nWhat's the URL of the newsletter, as you mention that?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:04:03):\nThanks for asking. It is hils.substack.com, H-I-L-S, substack.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:08):\nSweet.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:04:09):\nBut basically, it's one little thing you can do every single day. And the key with this is, again, consistency. So you need to get people doing this thing every day, reducing friction. I think a mistake a lot of people make when they start thinking about how to drive adoption is, they're like, \"Oh, we have to show people how to do their work with these tools.\"\n\n(01:04:27):\nBut I'm like, \"Well, work is hard.\" And if you are on a deadline for something, you've got to get something done, the last thing that you ever want is more friction associated with getting it done. It is so annoying when you're trying to get a thing done, and your tools are being changed on you, and you don't know how the thing works, and the hot keys are all different, or whatever.\n\n(01:04:50):\nSo I actually think, using it in situations that have nothing to do with your work are way easier, because you're removing all of that friction of, \"Oh wait, I got to go think about, 'All right, what's a project that I'm working on? Oh, I put this into ChatGPT, and I didn't really get a good answer.'\"\n\n(01:05:08):\nOr, \"Now I'm frustrated, because this thing's taking longer than I need it to take, or whatever.\" I start with things that are just fun, simple use cases. It might be coming up with times to take a vacation, or places to go on vacation.\n\n(01:05:24):\nOr it might be uploading your calendar into ChatGPT, and asking it for ideas, for talking points for the meetings, or things where the person doesn't have to think, because it's all just spelled out.\n\n(01:05:36):\nAnd things where there's no external work pressure, that you have to apply this to, that's going to make it an unpleasant experience. So consistency, reduce friction. And then, most importantly, designing reward loops.\n\n(01:05:48):\nAnd this is something, that when I'm talking to people about designing for behavior change, the number one thing I always tell them is, \"You are not thinking enough about the reward loop.\" The reward loop needs to be powerful, it needs to be immediate, and it needs to be emotional, so that when this person does the thing that you want them to do, they feel like a million bucks.\n\n(01:06:09):\nWhen I think about any kind of habit I'm trying to build on my team, that's something that I'm always thinking about, is how can I make sure that when a person does this, they feel really great?\n\n(01:06:19):\nAnd part of why I like Custom GPTs as a tool for helping people learn to use LLMs, and I talk about this on the podcast I did with Claire, on how I AI, is because if you put in the prompt, you as the person building the custom GPT, you write the prompt, you put it in, you design it such that somebody can upload a specific document. And then, they can get a specific output, like feedback on that document, or maybe something more fun than feedback, an improved written version of that document.\n\n(01:06:50):\nThey get the joy of like, \"Oh, this helps me. This was cool,\" without any of the despair of, \"Oh, I'm not very good at prompting, and this didn't really work, and I'm frustrated.\" And so, I just always think about that in general. If I'm trying to build any kind of habit on my team, it's less about the accountability of how I'm enforcing this, and more about how I make it so rewarding for people to do it, that they do it naturally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):\nI wrote down notes as you were talking, so kind of, the four parts of habits, and I'm going to ask you for an example, to help people see how this actually works in real life. But basically, to help people build an actual habit, the three steps are the three things you want to focus on, consistency, friction, and reward loop. And within reward loop, you want it to be powerful, immediate, and emotional. What is an example of this?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:07:40):\nYeah, I can give some, actually, examples of how we do this in product, if that would be interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):\nAbsolutely.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:07:46):\nBecause I think there's something WHOOP is really good at. So I think one of the most interesting kind of anti-reward loops on WHOOP is around alcohol. WHOOP has this recovery system. You get a recovery score every morning. It's red, yellow, green, and it's basically how recovered you are, and how ready you are to take on the day.\n\n(01:08:05):\nAnd if you drink, and you're on WHOOP, you will very quickly learn that any time you drink, you get a red recovery. It's so interesting, because it's not like people who were drinking weren't getting hangovers before, or they knew that it was disrupting their sleep. None of this is news for people, but there's something about seeing that red score that just feels like, it just feels bad. It has this really profound emotional impact on people.\n\n(01:08:38):\nAnd when you see the green score, it feels great. It's like, \"Ooh, I'm doing something well, I'm taking care of myself. I'm a healthy person.\" And I hear this when I talk to members all the time, and I hear people say, \"I've had problems with my drinking for years. And it wasn't until I got on WHOOP, that I was really able to get a handle on my drinking.\"\n\n(01:08:58):\nI'm always, again, amazed by this, because I'm like, \"You had all the information you needed before,\" but there's something about the, you wake up, and you get that red score, that's just, it manages to override whatever was driving people to do it in the first place.\n\n(01:09:14):\nAnd then, I think, continuing to have that data, where you can look back at your data and see, \"Oh, that was the red day, that was the day that I did this thing.\" And it's something that we've actually been trying to find ways to do this in a longer term way.\n\n(01:09:28):\nBecause when you have these short reward loops, it's easier, where it's like, \"I did a thing.\" And then, I immediately either got a reward, Green Recovery, or got an anti-reward, Red Recovery, and that is changing my behavior as a result.\n\n(01:09:40):\nAnd we have this new feature, Healthspan, that we just launched with our new hardware. And basically, what it's trying to do is help you have this reward loop, between your behaviors and activities that you're doing today, and what means for how healthy you're going to be in 20, 30, 40 years.\n\n(01:09:59):\nAnd so, we have something similar where we have this, we call it the Amoeba. It has your WHOOP age in it. It has colors, and moves around, and that changes, based on how your behaviors and your activities change, every single day.\n\n(01:10:12):\nAnd the colors change when you're doing better, and when you're doing worse. And you can kind of see it all broken down, how you sleep, your VO2 Max, the consistency of your sleep, how much time you're spending in different heart rate zones, how much time you're spending in strength training, things like that.\n\n(01:10:27):\nAnd we found that, again, it's just this incredibly powerful reward loop, because we're taking something that historically has been really, really hard, which is, \"When I make healthy changes today, not only do I not see the results of those for decades, but the short term reward loop of those often feels pretty bad, because change is hard, and it feels bad before it feels good.\"\n\n(01:10:46):\nAnd trying to build that reward loop that is more rewarding for people to see those numbers change, and to see those colors change, so that they're actually able to make those changes, and see that progress, and feel really good about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:59):\nI love that you're using all these habit building tactics that folks have been using historically, to get you to check your Instagram likes, and your Facebook posts for actual good, for helping people live longer and happier. That makes me very happy.\n\n(01:11:14):\nIs there an example of doing this sort of thing with your team, of helping them build, and you talk about AI learning to use Claude, ChatGPT?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:11:21):\nYeah, I think with AI, I think a lot of it's just shouting people out, right? When somebody is using AI to solve a problem that they wouldn't have used AI before, give them a shout-out in the team meeting, let them demo that.\n\n(01:11:37):\nAgain, make them feel like a million bucks for doing the thing. And people respond to that, people will see, I mean, maybe it's because I work at WHOOP, and we're all obsessed with reward loops, so we're all choosing them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:46):\nOr reward looping each other. \"Here's your reward.\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:11:50):\nNo, exactly. But no, people see that, and people respond to it. I think another example is something that I think about a lot, and is relevant to our conversation about, just how you build teams that can do hard things, is how you encourage people to take care of themselves outside of work. And it's something that I'm always trying to model for my team, and make it really visible the ways that I'm doing this, and sort of having my hobbies, and my other various things.\n\n(01:12:18):\nAnd as a result, I also try to reward, have these reward loops, when I see people on my team doing the same thing. Because I think people, bosses often inadvertently create reward loops for, \"Oh, this person, they had to stay up till two o'clock to get it done, but they got it done.\" When you create those reward loops, that's the behavior that people start mimicking.\n\n(01:12:38):\nAnd so, I try to do the opposite. I try to find ways that I really am impressed with my team, and the ways that they take care of themselves outside of work, because I think that makes them better at their jobs, frankly, and just happier humans. So there's a PM on my team, Emily, who teaches at Handlebar. She's a fitness instructor in her spare time.\n\n(01:12:59):\nAnd so, whenever we have a long meeting, I'll be like, \"Oh, Emily, why don't you lead stretches, to get the energy level in the room up? Just nothing serious, just for a minute, before we start the meeting.\" And it's kind of fun. Everyone has a laugh about it, \"Emily's doing her thing,\" and I'll be like, \"Everyone, come check out Emily at Handlebar in Charlestown this Saturday, 10 a.m.\"\n\n(01:13:22):\nAnd by the way, you all out there in the podcast world should do that if you're in the Boston area, she's great. Shout-out to Emily. But it's things like that. It's just finding these small ways to, because people are already laughing, people are already smiling, we're doing this silly thing, everyone's in a good mood, and I'm like, \"Boom, perfect time to give someone a shout-out, and make them feel like a million bucks for doing something, that in many cases, they might think, 'Oh, am I allowed to have this other job outside work? Is this okay?'\" And so yeah, you got to proactively build those reward loops.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:50):\nI love the reward loop of Emily getting this shout-out right now. This is so meta.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:13:56):\nUltimate reward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:56):\nYou have a full class coming up in Boston. Is there anything else along those lines? Because that was really interesting? And also, people, I know managers already kind of do this, just promoting.\n\n(01:14:06):\nBut so, I think the core lesson here is, focus on things you want to encourage more. Less so, \"Hey, they worked the weekend, they got it done, so awesome. Thank you for doing that.\"\n\n(01:14:16):\nYou're saying that's almost an anti-pattern, because you don't necessarily want that as a habit. So it's more like, shift your reward announcements to things you actually, intentionally want to create, in a new team.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:14:26):\nYeah, and just be really, really thoughtful about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):\nYeah, okay. So let's come back to the taking care of yourself, because that's something else that came up, almost everyone mentioned this. So you're doing a good job with this, of finding time to take care of yourself, and modeling that for other people.\n\n(01:14:39):\nSpecifically, a lot of people commented on how you create space for creativity. And I think, to a lot of people, a lot of PMs, especially, is just, \"I have no time for anything. I just have meetings, back to back, all day. I barely have time to go to the bathroom or eat.\"\n\n(01:14:53):\nAnd I'm curious to hear just how you do this. How do you create space in your day for creative work, and deep work, and thinking outside of the meeting?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:15:02):\nYeah, it's funny. I'm glad to hear people think I'm good at this, because I'm terrible at organizing events. My team's always, \"Oh, we should do a fun event.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, that's a great idea.\"\n\n(01:15:10):\nAnd then I don't organize it. So I like to think, I do this in other ways. And I do think one of them is just in modeling, how to carve out space for things, and a couple of things. I think there's the creativity, which for me is probably more outside of work. For me, it's creativity.\n\n(01:15:29):\nBut again, it's a big part of me as a manager, what I think I can help people with is, back to the point of behavioral activation, understanding what the things are that a person needs to be happy, to be their best self, to be a high functioning person. That depends on their values, it depends on a lot of things about them. So for Emily, it's fitness, it's teaching, it's these things. For me, it's having my crafts that I do, my illustration, my writing, my reading, all of these sorts of things.\n\n(01:15:59):\nI think that that's the first step is just, as a leader, understanding what those are for people on your team. And then, as I said, modeling it.\n\n(01:16:09):\nI try to always tell people, \"Here's how I'm doing these things.\" I talk about them, so it's really normalized, because I think a lot of PMs are like, \"Oh my gosh, I'm so busy. I have no time. I'm in meetings all day.\" But that's a little bit self-inflicted, I think.\n\n(01:16:24):\nAt some point, you have to be the one responsible for getting yourself out of the weeds, and it's hard to do, but it is doable. So I think, just showing people that it's possible, showing people that you can do these things. And I talk about them, I bring them to lessons.\n\n(01:16:43):\nI have a book club that I sometimes require at work, and then I say, \"Maybe I don't need to require this anymore,\" but ways to just make it really visible, make sure people know that I'm doing it, and then ask them about it.\n\n(01:16:56):\nIf I, in my one on one lens, and I'm checking in with people, I'm asking them, \"What do you do for joy? Are you doing something every single day that's bringing you joy in your life?\" And if they say no, I'm like, \"That's a problem. What are we going to do about that? And do you even know what those things are?\"\n\n(01:17:13):\nBecause I think a lot of people don't, and a lot of people, it's great. They're like, \"Oh, I need to be getting X number of hours of exercise, X hours of sleep. I know I need to eat lunch right at 12:00, or else I turn into a pumpkin.\"\n\n(01:17:26):\nIf it's somebody who knows what all those things are, and you're just there to kind of help them carve out time, that's one thing. But I think, and a lot of times, people don't even know. Then you kind of behavioral activation them, where you're like, \"All right, well, why don't you try some things, and get back to me, and let me know what seemed to work, what seemed to make a difference?\"\n\n(01:17:43):\nBut I do think so much of it is like a permission structure, because people feel the pressure to be like, \"Oh, I'm so busy, I'm so busy, I'm in meetings all day.\n\n(01:17:50):\nI can't decline these meetings. I can't not do these things.\" So in many ways, I think just modeling, it gives them the permission structure to start to take back their life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):\nI could see why people love working for you. Being asked in your one on one, \"Have you done anything today that brings you joy? And if you haven't, that's a problem.\" Wow.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:18:09):\nIt's important. It's what life's all out. Why are we here, if it's just to toil, and be miserable?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):\nAnd also, they will be better people at work, and they'll do better work. I think that's, tell me, correct me if I'm wrong, but it feels like that's an element of this.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:18:24):\nWell, and it is so funny, because so much of this stuff, it's obvious when you apply it to an athletic context. And obviously, I talked about the recovery score. This concept of athletes need to recover is very obvious. No one, I think, would argue with that.\n\n(01:18:39):\nIf you're just pushing yourself at 100% of your physical capacity all the time, not only are you going to burn out, but you're literally going to suffer performance decline. And in the same way, I think in the athletic world, there's so much more, just acceptance of, I don't even want to say limits, but just like, you have to take the time to do the things you need to be your best. And that's not just running into the wall all day.\n\n(01:19:11):\nAnd I think we forget that at work, but I think the analog is 100% there. I also think about this with, in terms of being able to have creative breakthroughs of any kind, it's just so important to have active rest. It's so important to have heads downtime. This stuff is all very well documented. We know it all, but we just come up with excuses to not give it to ourselves. I think it's kind of self-sabotage, at a certain point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:36):\nI definitely come up with excuses not to do that, and work all the time. So I could use this advice myself.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:19:42):\nAnd that's why, here's the thing, here's the thing. The Reason I'm so regimented about this is because, if I'm not, I will fall apart. There's this quote, I can't remember where I saw this, but I love it. It's like, \"I have exercised the demons from my head, but they are outside and they are doing pushups.\"\n\n(01:19:59):\nThe threat of the demons coming back is always there. And so, I take this stuff really seriously, because I know, if I let myself start to slide into, I'm not doing the things I need to do to take care of myself, I'm going to have a bad time. The walls are going to start closing in around me.\n\n(01:20:18):\nAnd I'm not shy about that. To me, there's no point in torturing myself, and just working so hard, and having no room for joy, and having no room for creativity. Even just from a practical standpoint, I'm just not going to succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:36):\nThis comes back to your point about, I think it was called behavioral activation, doing the thing. Instead of waiting for you to feel a certain feeling, do the thing that will make you feel that way.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:20:45):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:46):\nOkay. As maybe a final area, but I have a few more questions after this, so maybe not. The final area is AI. I am happy that we waited this long to get deep into AI. We're not going to spend a lot of time here. You wrote a whole guest post about this. You did How I AI to talk through some of this stuff.\n\n(01:21:03):\nBut when we were talking earlier, you said that you think people still are completely undervaluing the power AI could have on their ability to learn, and improve themselves. And I know you spent a lot of time on this, with all these GPTs you've built.\n\n(01:21:17):\nJust talk about the sense of how much you think people still under-appreciate how much power there is in AI, and helping them become better.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:21:25):\nYeah. I think we are not being nearly creative enough, when it comes to how to think about learning with AI. And I think, you hear people worry about entry level jobs, and when you think about an entry level job, it is sort of inefficient by design, because you have taken analyst, sort of a classic entry level role.\n\n(01:21:49):\nThey're doing grunt work, they're doing really tedious work, but they're getting a lot of reps in, because that's exactly how you learn the judgment to do higher level jobs well. And I hear this in creative fields too. I hear this from every, I certainly feel this way.\n\n(01:22:05):\nThe work that I did in the beginning of my career, it didn't feel like it was all that important, in terms of the impact it was having, but it did feel like it was transformative, in terms of my own judgment and my own taste, and how I think about just making very quick judgment calls.\n\n(01:22:27):\nNow, I just wouldn't have been able to do that, if I didn't spend years learning. I used to do social media, the skill of having to condense something that I want to say into 120 characters, or whatever it used to be on old Twitter, 240, I can't remember.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:47):\nI forget, actually, isn't that crazy? I forget what the original was. I think it was 140. Okay, 140 characters, yeah.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:22:50):\n140, I think. It was short. And if you had to get a link in there, good luck to you.\n\n(01:22:55):\nBut oh my gosh, my ability to just look at something written today, and just cut it, that text in half, third, whatever it needs to fill the space, I can do that in my sleep, because I got all these reps very early in my career.\n\n(01:23:10):\nI think people see the way that there's a threat of companies not wanting to hire as much entry-level talent, because it's like, \"Oh, this is the kind of work that AI can do.\"\n\n(01:23:24):\nThe fear that I hear, at least, is if you're not getting those reps early in your career, maybe it's not contributing so much value to the company at that moment, but it's how you learn to be great later on.\n\n(01:23:38):\nAnd so, there's a fear that in five, 10 years, we're just not going to have that class of people, who have learned to do the jobs well, and who have built judgment in that way.\n\n(01:23:48):\nBut what I think that misses is, it assumes that you go and you do this analyst job for two years, and at the end of it you have a person who knows how to make models really well, knows how to do a few things really well. But why does that have to take two years? Why does that model of you grind over this thing?\n\n(01:24:12):\nYou wait for feedback. Eventually, you get that feedback. Maybe that feedback's good, maybe it's not. You go back, you try again. It actually is really inefficient, when you think about it.\n\n(01:24:22):\nAnd the sort of learning applicAttions around AI that I get really excited about are, how do you shrink that loop? So in my podcast with Claire, I showed her how I build these GPTs, that kind of think like me. And the purpose of that is so that my team can get feedback that is at least 80% close to the feedback that I would be giving them.\n\n(01:24:44):\nBut instead of having to wait until I get to their message, or until our one on one, they can get that on demand as many times as they want forever. And I think there's a lot of things like this, of ways that things that require other people, just naturally slow things down, require getting feedback from other people, just naturally slow things down.\n\n(01:25:06):\nWe can build AI tools that, in my view, there's no reason why the amount of reps that you get at whatever task you're doing, you can be a film editor, just sitting there, poring over the film, deciding what to edit, what to cut, what to put into the trailer, or whatever it's making. That's an incredibly tedious job that takes forever.\n\n(01:25:29):\nAnd I think there's no reason we can't make that way more efficient with AI, that make the learning more fun. And so, I think that that's sort of my hot take is yes, there is this threat of, a lot of these jobs that are things that seem like you can just automate them away, that might happen.\n\n(01:25:52):\nBut we absolutely still need to be investing in people's skills. I just don't think we need to be investing in them historically in the way that we always have. And I think in the future, we'll find that those ways actually seem quite inefficient, compared to what's possible today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:05):\nThat's such a powerful point. And we're already seeing this. I imagine you've seen these studies, I think it's in Nigeria, where they give students AI tutors, and they just zoom to the next, they accelerate so quickly in their progression of just reading and math.\n\n(01:26:21):\nI think we're already seeing it. And it's harder to measure in PM and product, and all these things, but in school, it's a lot easier to measure, and we're already seeing results there.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:26:28):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:29):\nAnd to make this very real for people, you have this specific GPT, I think it's called Socrates, or what is called?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:26:34):\nOh, Aristotle, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:35):\nAristotle? Okay. No, we're going to edit that out. Aristotle, where it gives you scenarios in a product scenario.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:26:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:43):\nGive an example, just to give people a sense of what this can do.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:26:46):\nYeah, so this came from, I was talking earlier about learning how to make a really strong, logical argument, or just a strong argument for your point of view, in general. And the sort of fundamental skill for that, in my view, is logical thinking, logical reasoning. And when I think about the best way, we have to test that today, at least ...\n\nHilary Gridley (01:27:00):\nThink about the best way we have to test that today, at least the best is maybe not the right word, but the standard way we have to test that, the LSAT, the test that you take to get into law school, that is what that tests. And it sort of gives you these different scenarios and we'll try to say if a is true, then which of the following is true, is not true? Sort of testing some of these different logical relationships.\n\n(01:27:26):\nAnd so what I did was I made a GPT that I basically told it, \"Create LSAT style questions to test logical reasoning, but put them in the scenarios of things that a PM would encounter.\" And I have a version of this that's very specific to WHOOP and working in consumer health, but you could do it for anything or you can just do generic, however you want to do it.\n\n(01:27:49):\nAnd actually it's kind of fun because it gives you the scenario and it's like, \"The sales team is telling you that we need to invest in feature A and the, I don't know, the engineering team is telling you that we only have time to do feature B and the metrics are telling you that people who get this feature retain better.\" It just sort of gives you these little things and it's like, follow that logic, which is the logically best path from this? And it gives you a little multiple choice answer, you select one and it explains why you're right or wrong.\n\n(01:28:29):\nAnd so I think that's just another example of, you can't create those hyper personalized learnings, where I can make one that is literally so specific to you and your life, but is testing and training you on this broader skill set. And I think you can make things more fun that way, even in just the school context, in terms of doing that in a way that's just relevant to a person's interest, relevant to the things they care about. I think there's a ton of really interesting potential there too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:56):\nSo we're going to link to this GPT that you're talking about that people can try it out. And once you see it you're like, \"Holy shit, I should just be doing this all the time,\" because you just get so many reps as a product builder.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:29:06):\nAnd we were talking about a similar one with understanding engineering benchmarks. I don't have an engineering background, so this was really hard for me when I was moving into product, is just getting an instinct for what types of things tend to be easier or harder for engineering teams. And so we can have one similar that's saying, \" Here's the scope that's being proposed. If you had to t-shirt size this, which one would you choose and why?\" And you can say, \"Oh, this sounds, small or whatever.\" And it'll say, \"Oh actually these types of integrations tend to be complex for these reasons. So it's probably going to end up being more like a large.\"\n\n(01:29:49):\nAnd it doesn't have enough context to really inform you in the way that your tech stack at your company is. Although I guess could build it and give it that information and then it would, that would be cool. You should do that. But again, it's like you do that as a PM, you might get a chance to do that, I don't know, a couple times a week, maybe, maybe less often than that. And when you have this little tool, you can do it infinity times. You can spend an afternoon doing it. And so again, both the speed of those loops and the number of those loops that you're able to get is just radically different with AI compared to just when they come up in the course of your job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:33):\nI think this is extremely cool. We're going to link to it. People should definitely play with this. Okay, I'm going to take us to two corners, recurring segments, of the podcast and then I want to talk about WHOOP before we get to a very exciting lightning round. So this is a new segment I'm trying out, I'm going to call it Pivotal Corner. And here's the question, what's the most pivotal moment in your career?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:30:54):\nI mean I think it was at my former company, at Big Health, when my former boss left the company and I started reporting to the CEO. And again, I think it was my first time working with a CEO so closely, and it just, definitely trial by fire. But it made me understand so many things that seemed like they didn't make sense to me before, when I was just in the rank and file of a big tech company earlier in my career. You get in the room and you talk to these people and you're like, \"Oh, this actually makes sense. I understand why this person has come to these conclusions.\"\n\n(01:31:36):\nAnd some of it's understanding the pressure they're under. Some of it's understanding, again, the way they view the world. But I think that was, to get to our earlier point around the humility of understanding that maybe this person is right about something that I don't see and maybe I can start by... If I start by giving them the benefit of the doubt, it is not only a nice thing to do, but it is also, it will help me understand why they're doing the things that they are. And I think I would've been so much less frustrated earlier in my career if I understood that instead of just being like, \"Oh, this doesn't make any sense from where I'm sitting, so therefore it must not make any sense.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:13):\nIt's so cool that this connects back to your habit of doing this, having seen it, and being like, \"Oh, I see, this is why...\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:32:20):\nYeah, I guess I hadn't realized.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:21):\nMaybe I'm wrong, maybe I could be wrong.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:32:23):\nWell, I mean that's what it is. I feel like I've had so many of those times where I don't know, when I was growing up, I felt so confident in how I felt about everything. And then you get out there and you're just like, \"Oh, I was missing some things.\" And after a while you're kind of like, \"Okay, maybe I should approach these situations a little differently with the possibility that maybe I'm missing something.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):\nSo I actually asked your boss Kelvin, which is an awesome name by the way, Kelvin, about this moment. When I asked him what to ask you, and he brought this up actually, and here's the way, described it, \"She may describe it as being thrown into the deep end or baptism by fire, but the reality is that she had the core skills and this was simply an opportunity for her to let those shine even more. She was an incredible first principles thinker, quick to tune the framing of problems as she learned more context. It's a great example of luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:33:17):\nThanks Kelvin. That's really nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:20):\nHe also said, \"I wonder if she remembers how terrified she was now, because she absolutely knocked it out of the park and it felt like it was an inflection point that grew her confidence significantly.\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:33:29):\nOh, I was terrified. Yeah. Big time terrified. And then, I mean this is also what I was saying about why it's so important to be regimented about having these things outside of work that allow you to continue to thrive, even in the face of just utter feelings of failure, of, \"I am not doing a good job, this is not going well. I don't know what I'm doing.\" A lot of it was that time. Kelvin actually gave me some great advice that, this is maybe kind of scary advice, but when I asked him what his advice for me with the time was, and he said, \"Product leadership is the type of role where if you are not in control of the voices in your head, they will eat you alive.\"\n\n(01:34:16):\nAnd I think it's right. As I said, it is so often this feeling like there is not a clear right answer and not even necessarily a good answer. And everyone is looking to you for clarity and everyone is looking to you to make the right decisions and everyone sees the errors, or at least everyone can spot the flaws in whatever decision you make or whatever recommendation you make. And as I said, every path forward has flaws that can be poked in it. And so understanding that the existence of potential ways to be criticized about something does not warrant criticism in a way that can, I think often result in a lot of negative self-talk for people. So yeah, I mean it had a tremendous impact on me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:05):\nIt's interesting you have so much of these habits and skills you've built seem to, it's clear where they come from, from all these experiences that you had.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:35:12):\nWell, and to the point of when you start talking to people and you start trying to build this mental model of how they think, that's exactly what you learn, is well, I can see how this person worked at this company at this time and I can see how this person had this kind of relationship with this other person. And all of these things shape the way that we approach problems and the way that we try to just move through the world. And it is understanding those types of things that allow you to understand how a person thinks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):\nI wonder if you could ask ChatGPT to build, or Claude to build, these mental models. Like, \"Here's their LinkedIn, here's their bio, here's a few things, how do they see the world?\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:35:49):\nI will admit that I have tried this. And I think it's a great idea. I think it does help. I have not gotten to a point where I'm comfortable sharing it with other people, nor have I told anyone that I have tried to do this for them, but I've certainly done it for myself. And I think it would be helpful. Because you could say things, you could upload a doc or whatever and be like, \"What are the three questions that this person's going to ask me about it?\" And then you could be prepared for the questions that person's going to ask you and that's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:23):\nIn this hypothetical example, what context do you share with this model to help it be good?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:36:30):\nGreat question. Hypothetically, I told you that I take all these notes on, here's what this person said and here's how I interpret it, and LLMs are really good at pattern matching and sort of spotting the... You could feed all of those in and just say, \"Come up with the 10 criteria that this person is most likely to use to assess a possible recommendation or path forward,\" or, \"Give me the top 10 ways that this person is likely to pick apart an argument or object to something,\" and you're going to get a good answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:05):\nMore reason to build this habit of taking notes and sharing with your team. On the other hand, this might also be a good use case for Granola or something like that where you have all these meeting notes and you could just feed it, \"Here's all the things Hilary said,\" and, \"Oh, what is she probably going to say about this?\"\n\nHilary Gridley (01:37:19):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:20):\nWow, so cool. Okay, next corner, I'm going to take us to Fail Corner. And in Fail Corner, the idea here is people come on this podcast, they share all these wins and success, everything's up and to the right and amazing, but in reality things don't always go that smoothly. So the question is, is there a story you could share of failure in your career where things didn't go the way you hoped and what you learned from that experience?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:37:45):\nI mean I think the one that probably looms largest in my mind is, I mentioned this depression therapeutic that I spent about a year working on, and ultimately the company ended up acquiring a different depression therapeutic. And we kind of ended up merging the two of them. And a lot of the stuff that we had initially built that I had really loved about this product we were working on didn't really ever end up seeing the light of day beyond the kind of testing that we had done around it. And it was heartbreaking because I wish this product existed. I look at it and I'm like, \"This was a great product and we put so much heart and soul into it.\"\n\n(01:38:28):\nAnd I think the lesson that I learned from that is, I think there's always a shot clock. When you're working, especially on a zero to one product, I think it can be very easy to feel like you have the luxury of time, of just like, we got to take the time to figure this out and get it right and that's what's most important. But the sort of build versus buy question is always live and it's always fair. And whether you want to admit it, if you're the one working on it, and you probably don't, I didn't want to admit this, there is a point at which it makes more sense for the company. If it is taking too long to develop something and there is a solution out there that works, it is the right decision to acquire that.\n\n(01:39:15):\nI mean I worked at Dropbox where I saw this happen all the time where we would acquire products that other teams internally had been working on and it's just like, it's heartbreaking when it happens. But I think there's an urgency that that has instilled in me that I think is actually really good and healthy, especially again working in this era where there is kind of this AI arms race and everyone's trying to move really quickly of, yeah, there's always a shot clock. And you might not be aware of it, but it's there, and you got to build your heart out and you got to ship and you got to get things out because at any time, that clock might run out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:49):\nSpeaking of shot clock, not necessarily, but I want to spend a little time on WHOOP, you guys just launched something that feels like a really big deal. I'm excited. That's the reason I got it. There's all these really cool new features. I think you call it WHOOP 5.0. What should people know? What's the newest, coolest thing that's happening with WHOOP?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:40:08):\nYeah, I'm really excited you got it. I know you tried it before and...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:11):\nThat's right. That's right.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:40:12):\nPeople who have tried WHOOP in the past maybe felt like it was very focused on elite athletes and that is...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:18):\nYeah, that's exactly what I felt.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:40:22):\nSort of the lifeblood of the company. And I think what we've done with our new experience is we've really built something that can help everyone be healthier and live better. I would say we're no longer just for elite athletes. We're really now a health and performance companion for anybody who wants to feel their best.\n\n(01:40:41):\nFor the first time in our company's history, we've updated our mission, so we're now saying that WHOOP exists to unlock human performance and health span. And health span I think is, and I mentioned earlier this feature I'm really excited about, because I do think it is kind of the most powerful version of a longevity-type feature I have seen because it is so focused on your behaviors and your habits today.\n\n(01:41:06):\nAnd we built it to be super, super actionable. So rather than just giving you a score that you're kind of like, \"Okay, that's nice,\" if you start sleeping even 20 minutes more, 30 minutes more tonight, you're going to see how that changes your case of aging. You're going to see how that changes your WHOOP age. And I think that, as I mentioned earlier, I think is really rewarding.\n\n(01:41:25):\nWe also have a lot of personalized coaching through our AI in terms of actions that you can take to improve your WHOOP age, to improve your sleep, to feel better, and it's all part of our broader aim to make health more actionable and accessible. I think one thing I'm really excited about is we have a bunch of new women's health features, so we have hormonal insights with improved menstrual cycle tracking. I'm actually pregnant and I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:51):\nWhat? I didn't know that. That's a big announcement. Wow. Congratulations Hilary. That's so exciting.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:42:00):\nBut actually part of how I found out I was pregnant was in seeing my WHOOP data.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:04):\nWhat? What? That's insane.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:42:07):\nIn my WHOOP data, which is pretty remarkable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:08):\nWow.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:42:08):\nAnd the way that we have this cycle tracking now, you can see the way that your different, your HRV, your resting heart rate, things like that, that's your heart rate variability and your resting heart rate, fluctuates throughout different times of your cycle. And even in the time leading up to that, I had a not straightforward pregnancy journey, and having these tools to really understand what was going on in my body was tremendously helpful and tremendously empowering for me and honestly really has changed my life. So I'm really excited about that.\n\n(01:42:40):\nWe have a lot of great new heart health features. We have a heart health screener with blood pressure insights and ECG. That's really cool. We got a lot of great stuff cooking. So even if you tried WHOOP in the past and thought it wasn't for you, I think the new experience is a real upgrade and it's something that I'm deeply proud of having worked on and really excited to have out in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:03):\nI am genuinely very excited about this. You could do, you said blood pressure and VO2 max?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:43:03):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:10):\nAnd I know the battery is even longer too. There's just so much stuff.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:43:12):\nOh, we have a 14 day battery life. I didn't even say. We have these beautiful new leather bands which I love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:15):\nOh wow.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:43:17):\nOkay. 14 day battery's life is insane. I'm going on vacation tomorrow and I don't even need to bring a charger. This is fantastic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:25):\nOh man. This sounds like a WHOOP ad, but I'm very excited about this.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:43:28):\nI'll say one more thing, which is we've opened a wait list for Advanced Labs and so pretty soon you're going to be able to have comprehensive lab work in the app, and I think we talk about the future of health, of having control of all of your health data in one place, and then being able to not just sort of find the signal in it and understand how your sleep is impacting your metabolic health or things like that. But again, get really actionable coaching on actions that you can take to feel better and be your healthiest and just pushing the limits of all the data that we're pulling into the WHOOP ecosystem. So really excited about that too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:06):\nI'm hoping the WHOOP can actually take my blood and labs. Is that where this is going? Because that'd be so convenient.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:14):\nNo comment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:15):\nOkay. It'd be weird but also awesome. I don't have to go anywhere to do that. Hilary, we covered so much ground. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on? Anything else that we haven't covered that you think, or last nugget you wanted to leave listeners with?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:29):\nI don't think so. I feel like we covered everything\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:31):\nWe did. We covered so much. In the best way possible. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:31):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:40):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:45):\nBuddy, you can't call something a lightning round and then ask me about books. We could go for a whole other podcast where I'm like...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:53):\nLet's recreate a time box for it.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:55):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:56):\nLightning round.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:44:57):\nOkay, I'm going to, hearing what I'm going to say, I'm going to go full fiction on this. I'm going to say if you're going to read a book, don't bother reading a business book. Even the business books I love the most that shaped how I think I'm like, \"I kind of got the gist of them part way through,\" but fiction, I'm like, everybody should read East of Eden by John Steinbeck and everybody should read The Sun Also Rises by Ernest Hemingway, which is my comfort book.\n\n(01:45:22):\nI think what I love about fiction is it teaches you how to sit inside tension. I think so much of working in product is, as I said, you're in this fog and you just have to provide clarity and you have to be really good at providing structure to ambiguous things and finding the way forward and to succeed at the job, you have to be able to do that. But I also think to succeed as a human in the job, you have to be able to sit in the mess and sit in the ambiguity. John Keats, the poet, talks about this concept of negative capability, which is the ability to remain in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts without any irritable reaching after fact and reason. And I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:04):\nThat sounds like a perfect quote for all PMs to...\n\nHilary Gridley (01:46:06):\nExactly. And you got to be both, right. Again, fiction, I love dualities. There's a lot of dualities in fiction, a lot of warring forces within people that can be so driving for people but can also be the source of so much anguish. I think it is important to live in both. In the, \"I'm going to break down this problem, I'm going to structure it, I'm going to get out, but also I'm going to sit here and I'm going to accept that there is no right answer and there is no perfect answer.\" And that's life. You don't learn that from... To the extent that you learn that from a book at all, which maybe you don't, but I think you can learn it in fiction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:46):\nI don't know how you feel about this book. I think you'll be proud of me. I'm reading Anna Karenina right now.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:46:51):\nOh, literally that's the book that I'm bringing on vacation with me tomorrow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:54):\nWow. You've never read it?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:46:56):\nI've never read it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:57):\nCool. Me neither. Okay, we'll exchange some notes. It's very long I'm realizing. Because I'm reading on the Kindle, and only 12%. Okay.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:07):\nNow I really have to read it. I was kind of wavering. I was like, \"Is this really what I'm going to want to read when I'm sitting by the pool?\" But no, I've committed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:12):\nYou got to do it. Another guest recommended it and I saw it on some lists recently and then like, \"Oh, I should read that.\" So yeah. Okay, great. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:24):\nI've been watching The Rehearsal with Nathan Fielder. Have you seen this show?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:28):\nI saw the first season. I've been a huge fan of Nathan Fielder for so long. I don't know if you saw his previous thing that he did, I forget what it's called.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:33):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:34):\nOkay. He's so hilarious and such a genius.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:34):\nNathan for You.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:36):\nNathan for You? Oh my God. I haven't seen the new season, no.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:40):\nThe man is a freaking genius. Just when I thought that I had a good sense of all the human emotions that exist out there, I watch the show and I feel things that I'm like, I feel like 10 different things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:40):\nDuality.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:47:55):\nAnd I'm like, \"I have no words for any of the things that I'm feeling right now.\" It's weird. It's weird stuff, but I'm enjoying it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:03):\nI got to watch it. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really enjoyed? Other than the WHOOP.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:48:08):\nI love my Zwift. It's like a program that you can hook up a smart trainer to for an indoor cycling situation. And you kind of bike around like you're in Mario Kart and you're sort of in these virtual worlds biking with other people. It's I think for very serious cyclists, I'm not a very serious cyclist. For me, it's been amazing as somebody who actually really struggles to find time to exercise.\n\n(01:48:33):\nThey have, speak of reward loops, they have one of the most amazing reward loops, which is you're biking along and you get into this track and a ghost of your previous self breaks out from you and starts racing alongside you at your personal best for that track. And you have to beat your personal self, or you have to beat this ghost version of yourself. And nothing has ever motivated me more in my life than past Hilary being like, \"I'm coming for you.\" And I'm like... I don't get that competitive with other people, but past Hilary comes for me and I'm like, \"This, I can't let happen.\" So I think it's a great product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:08):\nI'm thinking about how to use that, I don't know, mode for other use cases, like the ghost version of something to motivate you essentially. Interesting.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:49:17):\nI've been in so many product meetings where I'm like, \"Can we make a ghost version of yourself?\" [inaudible 01:49:21]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:20):\nYeah. They're like, \"Shut up about the ghost.\" Okay, amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:49:33):\nI'll say one that's been top of mind for me recently, because I was talking about the high brow fiction. I also have to go low brow. I saw this clip of Beavis and Butthead online recently where they were watching a music video for Creep by Radiohead. And it starts off really slow and one of them, I think maybe Butthead, is like, \"Oh, this sucks.\" And then the chorus comes and it starts getting all hyped and they're like, \"Oh, this rocks, this rocks.\" And then, I'm not going to do my Beavis and Butthead impression. So then it gets back to the slow part and they're like, \"Oh wait, this sucks again.\" And then Butthead is like, \"Why don't they just play the cool part the entire time?\" And Beavis is like, \"Because if they didn't have the part of the song that sucked, the cool part wouldn't be as cool.\"\n\n(01:50:20):\nAnd I was like, \"That is so profound.\" That is what life is all about, is just if it didn't have the parts that sucked, the cool parts wouldn't be as cool. And we're always chasing the cool parts. We want it all to be the cool parts, but it can't. So thank you Beavis and Butthead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:36):\nThank you Beavis and Butthead. Okay, final question. I love that you're talking about fiction books. This is where my question was going to go. What's a fiction book that most impacted your product building approach or career or the way you think about product?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:50:52):\nCan I give a poem?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:54):\nAbsolutely. Even better. Poem, extra credit.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:50:58):\nThere's a poem by Derek Walcott about, it's called Sea Grapes, and it's about Odysseus, and he talks about Odysseus being driven by the ancient war between obsession and responsibility. And I read that line when I was 18 years old and it has always stuck with me. And I sort of mentioned earlier, I think about these dualities that drive us. And I think as a product person, I always feel like I'm living between these two, the obsession and the responsibility. I want to go so deep on this and I want to spend as much time as I possibly can just sorting every little piece out.\n\n(01:51:48):\nBut we live in a society, we exist in a business. I am trying to create value for shareholders and trying to bring these two things together, I feel like a, has been the kind of defining struggle of my career, I think of many people's careers, is how you have something that you feel like you can really obsess over and have that flow over, or have that flow when you're working on. But then it's got to kind of work in this broader system as well. And I think that's sort of been the thing that I think of as the guiding post for what I want to do with my career and with my life. So I think it's got to be Derek Walcott.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:30):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Hilary, two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on stuff that you talked about? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHilary Gridley (01:52:39):\nGreat, thank you. So as I mentioned, I have a newsletter, it's hils.substack.com. That's hils.substack.com. I'm also teaching a Maven class on being a super manager with AI. So if you were listening to all this and you were like, \"Oh Hilary, that sounds so great, but I don't have time for any of that. How do you have time for all that?\" Honestly, hyper-leveraging myself with AI has been a big part of how I find time to do any of this stuff. And so I share a bunch about how I do that, how I use AI as a manager, building on a lot of the stuff that I shared on Claire's podcast as well, How I AI. So you can find me on Maven there. We've got a couple of cohorts coming up.\n\n(01:53:23):\nAnd then, yeah, I encourage everyone to try out WHOOP, you can get a free month on me at join.whoop.com/hilary, that's Hilary with one L. And you can post at me or tweet at me on X and let me know what you think of it. And I would love everyone's feedback because we're really excited about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:44):\nAs you were talking, I looked up your course just for make sure people can find it. So you go to maven.com, you just search for Hilary Gridley and you'll find it.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:53:50):\nYep. And you can also, I realize that if you Google super manager, you will find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:54):\nWhoa.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:53:54):\nSo that is my new claim to fame.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:54:00):\nOh my God, that's so great. 4.9 stars. Holy moly. There we go. Okay, Hilary, thank you so much. This was incredible. Covered everything I was hoping to, this was everything I wanted it to be. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nHilary Gridley (01:54:09):\nThank you. Thank you for having me. This was so fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:54:11):\nSo fun. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:54:14):\nThank you so much for listening.

If you can't, then you should find a buyer and then if you really care about this mission, go and start the next carnation of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nOr people that work for you, how have you adjusted what you expect of them to help them be successful?\n\nHowie Liu (00:00:18):\nIf you want to cancel all your meetings for like a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every AI product you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:27):\nOf the different functions on our product team PM, engineering design, who has had the most success being more productive with these tools?\n\nHowie Liu (00:00:33):\nIt really does become more about individual attitude. There's a strong advantage to any of those three roles who can kind of cross over into the other two. As a PM, you need to start looking more like a hybrid PM prototyper, who has some good design sensibilities?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nDo you see one of these roles being more in trouble than others? Today, my guest is Howie Liu. Howie is the co-founder and CEO of Airtable. I'm having a bunch of conversations on this podcast with founders who are reinventing their decade plus old business in this AI era, to help you navigate this existential transition that every company and product is going through right now. Howie and Airtable's journey is an incredible example of this, and there's so much to learn from what Howie shares in this conversation.\n\n(00:01:20):\nWe talk about a very interesting trend that I've noticed that Howie is very much an example of, of CEOs almost becoming individual contributors again, getting into the code, building things, leading initiatives themselves. That's something that we call the IC CEO. We also talk about the very specific skills that he believes product managers and product leaders, also engineers and designers need to build to do well in this new world that we're in. Also, how he restructured his company into two groups, a fast thinking group, and a slow thinking group, which allowed their AI investments to significantly accelerate.\n\n(00:01:52):\nIf you're struggling to figure out how to be successful in this new AI era, this episode is for you.

That's getdx.com/lenny. Howie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nHowie Liu (00:04:14):\nI'm so excited. Thank you, Lenny. I've been a listener from afar for a while now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:19):\nI'm really flattered to hear that. I'm also very excited. You've been on quite a journey over the last, is it 13 years, is it longer?\n\nHowie Liu (00:04:27):\nYeah, right about 13.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:28):\n13 years. I imagine there've been a lot of ups and a lot of downs. I want to talk about all those things. I want to talk about a lot of the lessons that you've learned along the way. I want to start with what I imagine was a very surprising down moment in the history of Airtable. This is something that, unfortunately, something I think about when I think of Airtable. I feel other people may feel this way, is there's this tweet that went super viral, maybe a couple of years ago at this point where someone just shared all this data and they're like, Airtable is dead.\n\n(00:04:57):\nThey've raised way more money than they're worth. They're not making enough to get from underwater. Yeah, Airtable RIP. What happened there? How much of that was true? How did that go?\n\nHowie Liu (00:05:06):\nYeah, so basically none of it was true. I mean, the surprising thing to me was how viral this tweet went when ... Frankly, I actually look back at this person's other tweets. I think they worked at CB Insights, and the irony is the whole point of that business is to have good data, good data quality around private company data. And they just literally had incorrect numbers by a strong multiple on what our revenue scale was, what our growth rate was. And if it gave me some consolation, I look back and this person had also tweeted about other companies, like Flexport was the last take-down tweet.\n\n(00:05:45):\nThey have like, \"Oh, Flexport's dead\" and their evaluation is too high, and blah, blah, blah. And so, I think that the more surprising thing was just like this person has been tweeting a bunch of spicy takes that are not substantiated by real data or correct data, and yet this particular tweet went super viral and that was the perplexing part to me. And then, actually, I think what really gave it legs was on the All In podcast, which is obviously super popular. And I listened to it. They covered it. They were like, \"Oh, latest on this week's news, this tweet about Airtable. What do we think about this?\"\n\n(00:06:22):\nAnd it almost, I think became a way to talk about a broader theme of what happens to this last generation of highly valued companies, maybe decacorn companies in this new ... And at that point, it was the recent moment for both public and private markets. They did also issue a correction though. All In, did a follow-up episode, a few, I think weeks later saying, \"Hey, we got the numbers wrong. We are revising our case and a view on Airtable.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:53):\nWhat's that line about how a lie gets around the world some number of times before truth has even this time to get out of bed?\n\nHowie Liu (00:07:02):\nYeah. Well, I think I learned about memes and morality very quickly in that experience. Not a very good social media person, but I think I learned a little more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:10):\nYeah, it's tough. Twitter is such ... The incentives are so misaligned. It's just I tweet something people want to share, not truth.\n\nHowie Liu (00:07:17):\nWell, especially ... I mean, there's a lot to like ... I would say, I like the post Elon Twitter more than the pre Elon Twitter because it is just bolder, and I guess I really admire bold product execution where you're not just stuck to the current laurels and they've made so many changes, but I do feel like I get injected into my feed very sensational content all the time, and I mean, it works on me. I can't help but to click on it and engage with it, but it does ... I think it does result in this kind of content, really spreading.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:52):\nYeah. Now, Nikita running the show, I don't know if you saw this, there's a new ... We don't need to keep talking about Twitter, but there's a new feature where you take a screenshot of a tweet and it has a huge X.com logo watermark on the top, right? Yeah, just to ... People are sharing these tweets all the time. Yeah.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:06):\nMan. Never a dull moment over there.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:07):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nOkay. I want to go in a completely different direction, something that I'm really excited to talk to you about, which is this very emerging trend that I've noticed that I feel like you're at the forefront of CEOs becoming ICs again. It's kind of this move of, IC CEOs. CEOs getting their hands dirty again, building again, getting in the weeds, coating again. I feel like you're again at the forefront of this. Talk about just why you've done this, why you think this is important, and just what that looks like day to day to you versus what your life was like a few years ago.\n\nHowie Liu (00:08:39):\nThe underlying reason for this shift, at least for me, is that, as we started the company, I was very much in this mode. I was literally writing code both on the backend, thinking about the real time data architecture of our platform, also the front end, the UX. And I would argue that in that founding moment, the initial product market fit finding, and especially for a product that is pure software, we weren't building an operationally heavy business like a dog walking marketplace where the tech is only an afterthought.\n\n(00:09:11):\nThe tech was the product, right? And in a very Meta sense, Airtable is the platform for other people to build their own apps. So it's all about the attack, like the very intimate design decisions, again, both architecturally and on the front end and the product UX choices. That is the product's value prop. You can't separate those two. You can't say, \"Okay, I researched the jobs to be done. Here's the workflow, here's the process, and then, okay, some engineer can just build it as an afterthought.\"\n\n(00:09:40):\nIt's those little decisions and really be able to be at the bleeding edge of what's possible both in the browser and with the real-time data architecture. That made the product what it was. I think the same is true for Figma, which actually had a very parallel timeline to us. We both were founded around the same time, both spent two and a half years building the product, hands-on that early team before launching. And when I think now to both the era in between that founding moment and then now as well as now the new gen AI moment, I think there was a maturing era of both SaaS overall and Airtable specifically.\n\n(00:10:19):\nWhere, as you scale up and you learn how to build teams and organizations and you have to scale up stuff that's not actually those intimate details, but process and people and so on, you kind of get by default further and further away from those details, right? And maybe for some businesses that's fine because no longer is it about finding the details that make for a magical new product market fit. And it is really just about scaling up an existing thing that works and using what I would call more blunt instruments to scale it up, like a more blunt roadmap, a more blunt go-to market execution strategy.\n\n(00:10:56):\nRegardless, I think that now, we're entering this moment where ... Certainly every software product in my opinion, has to be refounded because AI is such a paradigm shift, it's not even just like the shift from desktop to mobile or on-prem to cloud where that was more like a very one time and somewhat predictable change in form factor. I think AI is so rapidly evolving that with every evolution, every new model release and every new type of capability that's released, it actually implies novel form factors and novel UX patterns to be invented to fully capitalize on those capabilities.\n\n(00:11:36):\nAnd so to be continuously relevant and to refine product market fit in this era, I think you have to be of the details. There is no looking at it from 10,000 foot view and saying, \"Oh, we're just going to throw a bunch of people at this problem.\" It's actually understanding what is the right product experience and the right business model that backs it up and the right ... everything else to support that engine to take advantage of the capabilities in our product domain.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):\nYou have this phrase somewhere where you talk about being the chief taste maker.\n\nHowie Liu (00:12:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:11):\nAnd to do that, you have to do exactly what you're describing.\n\nHowie Liu (00:12:14):\nThat's right. I mean, I think that, and I would also say it's actually now also hard to taste the soup without participating in at least some part of creating the soup. Meaning With AI, you can kind of look at the final product and say, \"Okay, this feels right or not, or it feels like we're being bold enough and we're properly productizing these new capabilities.\" But I think to really understand the solution space of what's possible, you have to be in the details.\n\n(00:12:46):\nI mean, literally, you can't just look at screenshots or a pre-recorded video of a new product feature. AI is something you have to play with, and ideally you're playing with both the packaged up app or solution that you've built with it, but you're also playing around directly with the underlying primitives who are using the models either via API or via a chat interface. You're really pushing them to the boundaries. Because that's the only way that you really understand what these new ingredients. It's like as a chef, you just gained access to amazing new ingredients, but you have to actually get comfortable with them to put them into a new dish.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:23):\nAnd we had Dan Shipper on the podcast, he runs this newsletter and podcast to product a company called Every. And they work with companies to help them become more AI successful and adopt AI and all that stuff. And I asked him, what's the signal that a company will have success adopting AI and seeing huge productivity gains? And he said, does the CEO use ChatGPT or Claude daily?\n\nHowie Liu (00:13:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:49):\nAnd I feel like you're describing exactly, hourly,\n\nHowie Liu (00:13:51):\nLiterally hourly, or you could even have a measure of inference costs, right? Like the equivalent underlying inference compute cycles, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:02):\nHow many tokens you use?\n\nHowie Liu (00:14:03):\nYeah, I mean, I'm proud to say I am pretty sure I'm still the ... I just checked this recently, but I take pride in being the number one most expensive in inference cost user of Airtable AI, not just within our own company, but I think for a long time I was globally across all our customers vault. I mean, I'm extremely intentionally wasteful. Wasteful in the sense of I'll do something that costs maybe hundreds of dollars of actual inference costs. For instance, doing a lot of LLM calls against long transcripts of let's say, sales calls to extract different types of insights like here's the product apps, identify or here's summaries, et cetera.\n\n(00:14:49):\nAnd we also have now a capability that's basically like an LLM map reduce. So effectively, even if you can't fit the entire corpus of content into one LLM call, because the context window limitations, we'll map through all of this content and break it up into chunks and then perform an LLM call on each one and then perform an aggregation LLM call on those chunks. Very expensive, because you're basically running a highly expensive model against a lot of data and then running it again on the aggregates of that. But for me, hundreds of dollars spent on this exercise is trivial compared to the potential strategic value of having better insights.\n\n(00:15:29):\nIt's as if a really, really smart chief of staff has gone through and read every single sales call transcript that we've had in the past year and giving me very astute product insights, marketing insights, kind of positioning insights and segmentation insights. That's invaluable. You could pay a consulting firm literally millions of dollars to get that quality of work. So to me, I still think the value versus the actual cost of AI when applied greedily but smartly, it's a crazy ratio. And more people should be aggressively throwing compute cycles at these very high value problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):\nUntil somebody tweets how you're costing the company so much on AI compute and you guys are going to be underwater.\n\nHowie Liu (00:16:19):\nI'm just kidding. It's like how we have personally taken down the cashflow profile of the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:27):\nSo CEO's, founders hearing this, they're probably like, okay, I should probably start doing this. What does this actually look like? I imagine you still have a lot of other stuff you got going on once, you got all these ... How do you change your day to day to do this?\n\nHowie Liu (00:16:41):\nYeah, so I actually cut my one-on-one roster by default, and the idea is not that I don't want to spend time one-on-one with people, but rather that I found that the ... Just having more standing one-on-ones actually precludes me from engaging in more timely topics. I like to think of the best types of meetings as very urgency driven. And there's some timely topic, you've discovered some insight. Maybe I talked to some new startup and I learned something from their product or their approach.\n\n(00:17:20):\nAnd I want to bring that into how we're thinking about a new feature at Airtable or even just plant the seed with some different EPD people within Airtable, I want to make most meetings very timely and very informed by real alpha. There's got to be some kind of value and insight to seed that with. Now, in addition to that, I'll supplement with, when I'm in person with someone, I want to carve out time for a proper catch up and less structured, less timely, and just more of building a relationship with a human.\n\n(00:17:53):\nBut I actually find that having that common .. It's almost a barbell approach where it's like if you're going to spend time with somebody in a freeform way, actually do it in a high quality, not forced weekly ritual way. Go for a longer lunch or coffee walk or whatever in person when you can. Maybe that's a once every month or two kind of thing. And then the in-betweens are either topical, so we do have standing meetings for ... Now, we have a weekly basically sprint check-in on all of our AI execution stuff, which now is half the company or half the EPD org is working on AI capabilities.\n\n(00:18:29):\nWe're trying to ship very quickly, like I basically want to always ask the question, how would an AI native company, like a cursor or windsurf, et cetera, how would they execute? And are we executing as fast as them and taking advantage of all the new stuff as well as them? So bringing that level of intensity and urgency to how I spend my time within, that's been the biggest shift for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:55):\nWhat's a change you've made to help the company move faster and match that sort of pace?\n\nHowie Liu (00:19:01):\nYeah. I mean, we did do a reorg of the EPD org. So before we had ... we've gone through a few different reorgs over the past, call it, four years. The original state as we just proliferated, I think by default or incrementally, was that we had a bunch of groups that were each responsible for a feature or a surface area. So there was a group responsible for search within our table, and there was a group responsible for mobile experience and so on and so forth. And that has its benefits. Obviously, that team can go and get really ramped up on that part of the code base, that part of the product.\n\n(00:19:36):\nBut it has the disadvantage of yeah, you tend to think incrementally when everyone's remit is actually a feature that they incrementally improve by definition as opposed to thinking about a mission or a outcome goal that might need to coordinate dramatic changes across a wider set of surface areas instead of just each one incrementally improving. And so, we reorged initially to basically different business units effectively. So I know Airbnb has done the functional to GM back, et cetera. This was more like saying, \"Look, we have an enterprise business\" and them MO there is more about scalability.\n\n(00:20:19):\nCan we support the larger scale data sets and use cases? Do you have the core capabilities needed to be able to push out an app to maybe 10,000 seats or 20,000 seats for product operations? A lot of architecture, a lot of scale, that kind of work. We would have, what we call the teams filler, which is more about self-serve, kind of the product UX, how easy it is to adopt the product on board, share, do all the kind of basic functionality. An AI pillar, solutions pillar, and basically infra. And what we found though with that approach is that there was still ... there was more kind of holistic bets being made.\n\n(00:20:58):\nSo the team's pillar could think not just about one feature, but the overall onboarding experience where really about Nuxt in a way that touched multiple parts of the product, but it still felt like it wasn't ... Especially as we started to execute more on AI stuff, it wasn't allowing us to aggressively and quickly move as a AI native company would. I mean, when you look at the cursors of the world, they're shipping major new stuff every week. And it's not like, \"Oh, well we have this separate roadmap for enterprise, we have this roadmap for this group.\"\n\n(00:21:33):\nAnd it just feels like one cohesive product that's shipping at a breakneck pace. So we did this recent reorg where now we have what I call the fast thinking group, which officially is called AI platform, but it really means we want to just ship a bunch of new capabilities on a near weekly basis. And each of them should be truly awesome value. You should drop your jaw, how awesome it is to use this new capability in Airtable. And then separately, we have the slow thinking group, and that's not meant to be better or worse. It's literally like you need fast and slow thinking in the common sense to operate as a human.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):\nI have that book behind me.\n\nHowie Liu (00:22:14):\nYeah, I love that book. But slow thinking it's like, it's just a different mode of planning and executing, right? It's like more deliberate that require more premeditation. We can't just ship a new piece of infrastructure that has a lot of data complexity like our data store HyperDB that now can handle multi-hundred million record data sets. That's not something you ship in a week in a hacky prototype. So we now have these two separate parts of the company, and I actually think what's really cool is they actually compliment each other very well, right?\n\n(00:22:46):\nBecause the fast execution, the AI stuff, that creates the top of funnel excitement that also inspires new use cases and new users to come to Airtable, including in large enterprise, right? Enterprises can use this stuff too. It's not just like a SMB thing, but the slow thinking basically allows those initial seeds of adoption to Sprout and grow into much larger deployments. Whereas I think a lot of the challenge for many of the AI native companies I've seen is that they could have a very wide top of funnel, like get all of this AI, tourist traffic.\n\n(00:23:19):\nA lot of interest, a lot of early usage, but then sometimes the challenge is how do you turn that into more durable growth and get each of those adoption seeds to retain and expand over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:33):\nThat is super cool. I've never heard of this way of structuring teams, the fast thinking, thinking fast, thinking slow, the Kahneman. It's so interesting for the fast thinking team, do you find there's specific archetypes of people that are successful there? Is it a lot of bringing in new people that are not just used to the way of working at our table? What do you find?\n\nHowie Liu (00:23:52):\nWe have a mix. So we brought in ... I mean, we're always hiring, right? There was never a point in the company's life where we stopped hiring. And candidly, even when we had to do two rifts, that's significantly reduced our head count. We had just way too quickly grown and overscaled the business at a certain point. But even when we did our rifts, we were still actively recruiting and hiring in ... I mean every major department, but especially in EPD, because it's always been my belief that it would be arrogant to say that we have all the people we ever need already in the roster today, right?\n\n(00:24:29):\nWe're always going to need to find new, fresh perspectives, new skillsets, et cetera. And so, we've continued to hire ... I think we've learned as we've gone along of what is the ideal type of hire, and we've done some actual hires and learned from that as well. But I think the fast thinking part, it really just requires a lot of ... Somebody who's able to operate with a lot of autonomy, who's entrepreneurial in nature. Now, it doesn't mean they have to literally be a former founder. I know some companies are, like Rippling for instance, does a lot of actual acquisitions and gets actual founders into the company.\n\n(00:25:04):\nWe found that that's great and we've done some of that as well. But also there are some really, really capable people who we didn't literally have to acquire in, and yet, they're just able to think full stack about the problem and the user experience. Problem, not just meaning the technical layers of the problem, but also, what is the wow factor we're trying to create. So tangibly we're doing this new thing that's about to ship, where not only can you describe the app you want to build and then iterate on it with our conversational agent Omni.\n\n(00:25:41):\nAnd it builds it with the existing air table platform capabilities, but we're also giving it the ability to actually do code gen, to extend those apps with really final mile very bespoke functionality or visuals. So you could say, \"Hey, generate me a very, very specific type of map view with this kind of heat mapping and this kind of icons and ...\"\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:00):\nIt's kind of like heat mapping and this kind of icons. And when you click it, do this. And that's a capability that there's so much ambiguity in some of the design decisions around it. And you have to blend that design thinking with some of the technical constraints of what can the AI models actually one shot effectively?\n\n(00:26:21):\nAnd if not, how do you add in the right human workflow for approval and review, and the reprompting and so on? So just so many different design decisions, and you need somebody who can really think full-stack about that kind of product and is not overwhelmed by that kind of open-endedness, but relishes in it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:38):\nI was actually playing with it before we started chatting. I made a really cute startup CRM.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:43):\nOh, that's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:43):\nYeah, started talking Omni over here. It's like the colors are beautiful-\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:47):\n[inaudible 00:26:47].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:47):\n... so that's what's standing out to me right now.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:49):\n[inaudible 00:26:49] there is...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):\nYeah.\n\nHowie Liu (00:26:50):\nI will say just as a note, I consider myself at my core a product UX person. That's my passion. And everything else I've had to learn to run this company is almost like what was a necessary part of the journey. But my real passion is thinking about product UX. And I think of UX in a deeper sense than just the cosmetic design. What you could put into a framer kind of prototype. I think of it as literally what should this product do and how should it represent that and behave for the user? That is the product, in my opinion, right. And of course, then you have to figure out technically what's possible and how to implement it.\n\n(00:27:36):\nBut I think to me what's under executed today in the world of AI products is there's so many awesome capabilities of AI, and most of them are really under merchandise, and there's very poor, actually, visual or otherwise metaphors or affordances given to users to help represent or understand what those underlying capabilities are. I mean, ChatGPT obviously extremely successful product, so not knocking it at all, but you come in and you just get this completely blank chat box by default, and now they have suggestions underneath and so on.\n\n(00:28:13):\nBut the product UX part of me is just craving more visual metaphors or colors or some kind of use the canvas of a web interface and all the richness interaction you create there to better represent or show all the different things that you can do with the underlying model, right. And so that's something we've tried to do with Airtable, is show all of the different states and use colors even to play those up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:44):\nIt's interesting how much of this connects with I just had Nick Turley on the podcast. He's head of ChatGPT at OpenAI, and he had these two really interesting insights that resonate directly with what you're describing. One is he has this concept of whenever something is being worked on, he's always asking, \" Is this maximally accelerated? How do we move faster? If this is important, what would allow us to move faster?\"\n\nHowie Liu (00:29:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:06):\nAnd I love that that's one of the themes that's coming up as you talk, is just this creating this very clear sense of speed. And you even call it the fast-thinking team, like, \"You are going to move fast.\" And then the other one is just this insight that with AI, you often don't know what it can do and what people want to do with it until it's out. So there's this need to get it out, and that'll tell you what it should be.\n\nHowie Liu (00:29:29):\nI couldn't agree more with both of those, and particularly on the second point, I think it's interesting. Clearly, there have been companies that have both been successful in PLG and more sales-led distribution for AI products. The most notable ones I can think of are Palantir with their AIP deployments. That's obviously very sales-led. You're not PLG into a Palantir deployment. But even companies like Harvey and so on, they're doing very well. And it's primarily, from what I understand, sales-led.\n\n(00:29:59):\nYou're not self- serving into a Harvey instance at a law firm. And yet, to me, the best way to get AI value out there is experientially, right. And so you can kind of get that in a sales motion. You can show a demo. Maybe you can do a POC, but it's so much more powerful when you just open up the doors and say, \"Anyone who wants to come and sign up and trial this product can.\" And I think to me, it's a real proof point that ChatGPT is arguably the most successful kind of PLG product of all time, just in terms of sheer scale of users. Like they announced 700 million... Is it MAUs or week... I think it's actually-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:41):\nWeekly active users.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:41):\nWeekly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:42):\n10% of humans on earth use it-\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:43):\nThat's insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:44):\n... weekly.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:45):\nThat's insane. In how many years? A few years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:48):\nThree years. Under three years.\n\nHowie Liu (00:30:49):\nYeah. So I mean, literally, that is just the most insane ramp curve. And I don't think they would've gotten there if you couldn't just come in and literally try the product out. And as a little bit of a rebuttal of the point I made earlier where I think ChatGPT doesn't do a ton right now, and even earlier they did even less to expose all the different ways you could use it, but they just made it so frictionless to just try it for yourself that you as a user could come in and just literally ask it anything and see how it did. And of course, people in the early days tried to stump it and showed, \"Oh look, see, it's not that smart. It doesn't answer this hard question really well.\"\n\n(00:31:26):\nBut clearly, the magical nature of it still appealed to you enough. Everybody used it. And so I think I do have a view. We've gone through that whole arc of we started PLG. I'd like to think Airtable was one of the PLG darlings of our era. And anyway, I started moving up market and doing more sales execution, although that was still always on top of usually PLG within an enterprise, but we started doing more and more sales execution. We still have that. That's still really important for our business. But I also think, me personally, one of my goals is to shift my attention back into that kind of builder-led adoption and literally showing in the product experientially, not telling in a deck, the value that you can get from AI and Airtable.\n\n(00:32:20):\nI think that's so key, and it's [inaudible 00:32:23], but it's also more than that. It's not just literally how do you onboard somebody into the product. It's literally thinking about the entire product experience itself, right. And in our case, we just made the entire product experience AI-centric. It used to be that we had kind of this secondary thing that you could ask questions to the assistant sidebar. We now made our agent the default way of doing everything in Airtable, and it's now the Airtable app, as you know, it is almost like an artifact that's manipulated by and can be tool used by the agent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:58):\nLet me follow that thread. So if you go to Airtable.com today, it looks like basically all the other AI app building sites. Now it's just tell me what you want to build. Thoughts on that, as just a thing everyone's starting to do is there... what do you think comes next? Is this... Is it working well?\n\nHowie Liu (00:33:15):\nThere's clearly an incredible magic to vibe coding and app building with AI. And this is actually a prime illustration in my view of that concept we talked about a second ago, which is as capabilities of these underlying models evolve, the form factor in the product UX also needs to evolve with it. And so the earliest models, like the kind of original ChatGPT, like GPT-3.5 kind of era models were not nearly as smart as the current models. And so you couldn't really ask it to one shot a more complicated chunk of code, or certainly not like a full stack app, and expect it to work.\n\n(00:33:56):\nAnd so the right form factor for leveraging those models in a software creation context was GitHub Copilot, right. It's like auto-complete a few lines of code at a time. But you couldn't chat to it and tell it, \"Build me this entire app from scratch.\" And I think that as the models got better and better, you saw that the new form factors emerge. I think Cursor did a great job of being an early pioneer of this more age agentic way of leveraging the models to do more complex things and generate more larger chunks of code.\n\n(00:34:27):\nAnd now with Composer, you can literally just go into Cursor and build an app from scratch, build me a 3D shooter game from scratch, and just watch it go and create all the files and fill out each file, and then the thing actually runs some of the time. And so to me, this is where the world is going. The models are clearly getting smarter. And if you think about the original vision of Airtable, it was always about democratizing software creation. We just strongly believed that the number of people who use apps far outweighs the number of people who can actually build their own or manipulate apps and harness custom software to their advantage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:08):\nThat sounds very familiar, very familiar these days.\n\nHowie Liu (00:35:10):\nYeah, exactly. And so I think this is, it's a different means to the same end. And so it's almost like we have to lean into this because if we started Airtable today, this is what we would be all in on. Now I think that the advantage that we have, and I do think you have to be realistic to yourself, especially as a company that predates GenAI and now has to find your new footing in the AI landscape. You can't fool yourself and just say like, \"Okay, I'm going to throw in some AI stuff on the landing... on the marketing site, put in a couple AI features, and call it a day.\"\n\n(00:35:43):\nI think you actually have to take a clean slate approach to saying, \"How would our mission best be expressed? If you were literally founding a new company from scratch with the same mission, how would you execute on that mission using a fully AI native approach?\" And then, by the way, do you have useful building blocks that you can leverage from your existing product and your existing business, or are you literally worse off having this legacy asset versus starting something from scratch? And I don't think the answer is always yes or no. I think it just depends on the product.\n\n(00:36:19):\nAnd if you can't really introspect and say, \"Look, I think I'm better off doing this with the pieces that I have for my existing business and product,\" then I think you should sell. You should find a buyer for that company and then go. And if you really care about this mission, go and start the next carnation of it. In my case, I really thought about this and really feel strongly that the building blocks that we have, these no code components, actually do allow us to execute better on this vision than if I had to start from scratch.\n\n(00:36:50):\nMeaning the problem with vibe coding, especially if we're building business apps... So I should clarify that we want to democratize software creation, but specifically, we are focused on business apps. We're not trying to be the platform where you create a cool viral consumer game. This is for like your CRM, right. Or if you want to build an inventory management system as a small restaurant or a lawyer trying to build a case management system, that's what we've always been focused on. And I think in this AI-native world, clearly, you should be able to generate those apps agentically.\n\n(00:37:24):\nAnd yet if you have an agent that has to generate every single bit of that app from scratch, from code, it's going to be very unreliable. There's going to be bugs. There's going to be data and security issues. And then you're also going to have a context collapse, as it just cannot manage all of the code that it's written, basically, as the app gets more and more complex. And what we actually have are basically these primitives that the agent can manipulate and use without having to literally write the code from scratch to represent, \"Here's a beautiful crud interface on top of the data layer.\n\n(00:37:57):\nOurs is real-time and collaborative, and really rich, and has collaboration on it. And by the way, here's all these other view types and a layout engine for a custom interface, a layout, or automations and business logic.\" And so it's almost like in programming terms, the Airtable pieces in our Lego kit today can be used by this agent as almost like a more expressive DSL, like a domain-specific language to build business apps instead of literally having to write everything down to the SQL and HTML and JavaScript to build every part of that app from scratch.\n\n(00:38:31):\nAnd so if we can combine the best of both worlds, we have these very reliable, high-quality Lego pieces. Now, an agent can go and assemble them for you instead of you just using the GUI to do that. And by the way, if you do want to fall back to the GUI, there's a really great kind of way for the non-technical user to still understand and participate in what's going on. Whereas if you're not technical, you can't inspect the code underneath a v0 or Lovable or Revolut app, right.\n\n(00:38:58):\nIt's just kind of opaque to you. And if you can't re- prop it to get what you want, you're kind of stuck. This is much more akin to a developer using Cursor can generate lots of code, but then can still drop back to the IDE to edit and manipulate it to the final production-ready state. So that's kind of the play that we're making. And if I didn't fully and truly believe we have a better shot at doing it with our existing product, I wouldn't be running this company in its form today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:25):\nI'm talking to a lot of founders that are going through the journey are going on, which is, \"We've had a business for a decade, AI emerged, and wow, we got to figure out something that works... that could work even better.\" And so I'm trying to pull out the threads that are consistently working across these journeys because I think a lot of companies are trying to figure this out. So one that you just touched on is just if you were to start today, what will you do?\n\n(00:39:48):\nWhat would that business be? Plus, how can... do we have an unfair advantage with the thing we've done in the past? That feels like an important ingredient. And then the other... circling back to stuff you've shared already, there's just creating a sense of urgency and pace and getting people to understand this is how things move in AI, and we need to create this fast-thinking team. I love that metaphor in framing.\n\n(00:40:11):\nAnd then there's the point you made about just talking to AI regularly as the founder feels like an important element, just like to truly be this ICCO talking to AI, working with AI regularly. Just on that note a little bit more, just to give people a sense of what this looks like day to day. So you're talking to Omni all day trying to and undertook... flex the power of what you can do and iterate on it. Is there anything else you're doing day to day that helps you figure out what to do for the business?\n\nHowie Liu (00:40:38):\nOne, I try to use as many different AI products, including not Airtable, as I can, and both literally for the novelty factor and just some new cool demo comes out. Like Runway release their immersive world engine, and so I'm going to go try it out. When Sesame AI put out their cool interactive voice chat demo, I tried that out because even though we don't have a direct and near-term need for really realistic and interruptible voice mode where it's not as core to our capabilities, I just want to understand and get a feel for everything that's out there.\n\n(00:41:23):\nAnd I try to invent little, almost like side projects of my own, to have a real reason to use these products. Like, \"Oh, cool. What if I were to take... What if I were to try to create a funny little short... a funny video short using a combination of HeyGen avatars with a script, like a comical script generated by AI? And maybe it'll be on an interesting topic. So I'll do deep research on the topic with ChatGPT and pull together the results, have it compose kind of a little dialogue.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:58):\nDid you actually do this? Is there something you made?\n\nHowie Liu (00:42:00):\nYeah. That's literally an example of something, just a fun weekend project. And to be honest, these things only take you an hour if you become kind of pretty proficient with using the products. They're all so easy to use. You can literally do the deep research thing, kick off query, make a coffee, come back in 20 minutes. Okay, let me prompt it to generate me some dialogue. It's a little bit like what NotebookLM does for you out of the box, but sometimes I like to just do it myself. And then, okay, let me take the script and cut it up and turn it into a HeyGen avatar and then download the video and play it.\n\n(00:42:32):\nAnd just for fun. I'm not trying to make that into an actual YouTube video business. But I think coming up with these different fun weekend projects is a really useful construct to force myself to actually try these products in a more than just a Twitch click way. And what it gives me is, A, it's not just understanding the models, which is also very, very important, right. GPT-5 came out yesterday, and playing around with it a bunch just on a variety of different personal use cases, but there's a difference between just understanding the model but then also understanding the product form factors in which they can be placed, right.\n\n(00:43:15):\nMeaning when you apply the model in a more structured way, when you apply the model with different tool calling than maybe what ChatGPT has in its out-of-the-box form, when you apply it with a more agentic workflow, again, that might be different from what ChatGPT gives you out-of-the-box, that's when you kind of learn you really get to inspire yourself on what are the product's form factors that these new models can take. And plus, by the way, I find it to be really fun. There is to me a delight and entertainment value to just using AI, period, because A, it's not perfectly predictable.\n\n(00:43:57):\nSo I think the element of you're not quite sure what you're going to get. It's like a box of chocolates. And B, it always blows my mind just to think about, \"Wow, five years ago we didn't have any of this stuff.\" AI was like, okay, it's like we can do predictive analytics. There's some basically very advanced kind of regressions that we could run with AI, but it looked nothing like this in its current form, and it's just actually super fun, in my opinion, to get to play around with all the different types of products that come out.\n\n(00:44:33):\nI think that is a big part of it because on the point about the pace of the world moving so much faster in AI than any other landscape in SaaS, in the mature SaaS era, it was important to study your competition. If you were building a SaaS company, you'd be crazy not to follow Salesforce every year and see what the major releases they're putting out are, or ServiceNow, or so on.\n\n(00:45:03):\nThis is the equivalent of that, but there's major new releases and products and so on every week, not every year. And so I just think you have to say abreast of all... of it all and combining this with our point earlier of a lot of this has to be experienced, not just read. You can't just read the write-up on TechCrunch or even a tweet about a new capability. You kind of have to try it to really get a sense of what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:33):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Anthropic, the team behind Claude. I use Claude at least 10 times a day. I use it for researching my podcast guests, for brainstorming title ideas for both my podcast and my newsletter, for getting feedback on my writing, and all kinds of stuff.\n\n(00:45:49):\nJust last week, I was preparing for an interview with a very fancy guest, and I had Claude tell me what are all the questions that other podcast hosts have asked this guest so that I don't ask them these questions. How much time do you spend every week trying to synthesize all of your user research insights, support tickets, sales calls, experiment results, and competitive intel? Claude can handle incredibly complex multistep work.\n\n(00:46:13):\nYou can throw a hundred-page strategy document at it and ask it for insights, or you can dump all your user research and ask it to find patterns. With Claude 4 and the new integrations, including Claude 4 Opus, the world's best coding model, you get voice conversations, advanced research capabilities, direct Google Workspace integration, and now MCP connections to your custom tools and data sources.\n\n(00:46:34):\nClaude just becomes part of your workflow. If you want to try it out, get started at Claude.ai/Lenny. And using this link, you get an incredible 50% off your first three months of the pro plan. That's Claude.ai/Lenny. For people that work for you across Airtable, say the product team, PMs, maybe engineers, designers, how have you adjusted what you expect of them to help them be successful in this new world?\n\nHowie Liu (00:47:02):\nOne is really, really, really stressing this idea of go play with this stuff. And I mean, when I say play, I really mean play in the psychological sense of there's a difference when you go in and you're kind of just trying to check the box and get a job done. There's a difference when you come in with a curiosity and you're kind of exploring, right. And it's both more fun and energizing, but also, I think you learn more through that. And so I've really tried to stress the value of play with these AI products.\n\n(00:47:36):\nAnd I kind of try to lead by example, by literally going and sharing out links or screenshots of the things that I'm doing in these various products. So, as an example, I will go into one of the prototyping tools and show, \"Hey, I built a marketing landing page for this new capability we're launching.\" I created a landing page for it in Replit, let's say, and now I'm sharing that link. Instead of what typically we would've done in the past is like, okay, we're going to write a doc about it and then share the doc, I'm just going to show you an actual landing page with visuals and everything in there.\n\n(00:48:20):\nOr I'll share the actual link to my deep research reports. Or instead of me writing a perfect memo on a topic, I'll actually just prompt my way into getting a chat thread or a chat output that basically covers all the content that I care about and maybe even ask it to, \"Okay, summarize this all into a final memo output,\" and then intentionally share that rather than expose the fact that I'm using AI in this way and here's literally how I'm prompting it so you can follow along as well.\n\n(00:48:49):\nBut really trying to encourage everyone to go and just play with these products. And I've even said, \"Look, if anyone wants to just literally block out a day or frankly even a week and have the ultimate excuse, you could use... you could say that I told you to do it, right. If you want to cancel all your meetings for a day or for an entire week and just go play around with every product, AI product that you can find that you think could be relevant to Airtable, go do it. Period. So I think that's the most important thing is this play, this experimentation.\n\n(00:49:25):\nI think there's also a lot of other kind of shifts in how we execute prototypes over decks. I want to see actual interactive demos because, again, it's hard to... In a deck or in a PRD, you could say, \"Okay. Well, we're going to make Omni really good at handling this kind of app building.\" Okay, those are just words. The real proof is in the pudding of like, \"Okay, let me try it out on a few realistic prompts that I can imagine.\"\n\n(00:49:49):\nAnd in a demo, in a real prototype, you can instantly try it out on unrealistic rather than golden pathy scenarios and see how it feels too. Does it feel too slow? Do we need to expose more of the reasoning or steps that are happening behind the scenes? Create a progress bar or something like that. But it's really hard to get that feel of the product with anything but a functional prototype that really does, in an open-end way, use the AI to do whatever you put in.\n\n(00:50:24):\nSo I think it's more like a experimentation playground it feels like how we need to execute, versus I think, in the past, it sometimes felt like a more deterministic resourcing and kind of timelines view of execution. We're going to put this many people on this problem, and this is the eight-week timeline to this milestone, and then we're going to ship in a quarter from now. And I think now the whole thing is just a lot more experimentation and iteration-driven.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:56):\nOf the different functions on a product team, PM, engineering design, who has had the most success being more productive with these tools, and how do you think this will impact each of these three functions over time?\n\nHowie Liu (00:51:07):\nWhat I found is that it really does become more about individual attitude and maybe some polymathism. There's a strong advantage to any of those three roles who can kind of cross over into the other two, like the hybrid unicorn types.\n\n(00:51:26):\nSo if you're a designer who can be just technical enough to kind of be dangerous and understand a little bit of how these models work and how does tool calling work and all of this stuff, then you can actually design a concept or even prototype a concept, including in these prototyping tools that's much more interesting and maybe realistic than if you're just stuck in the flat like let me put something in a static design concept because I think designs have to be more interactive. The whole... The value of the product and the [inaudible 00:52:04]-\n\nHowie Liu (00:52:01):\n... the value of the product and the product functionality is in the interaction of it, right? Think about the design of Chachi Petite. Again, it's the most basic design you could possibly imagine. The real design actually is happening underneath the hood in how it responds to different queries and what happens after you fire off a prompt, right? So I think I found that there are people within each of these functions, there are engineers who are very good at thinking about product and experience and can go and prototype out the whole thing. They're designers who can do the same. Even if they can't literally code, they can prototype something out literally using a prototyping tool.\n\n(00:52:42):\nI think that's where AI tooling is also giving more advantage to people who can think in this way by equipping them with an alternative to actually having to go through the long hoops of learning CS, right? Then PMs as well. I think there are some PMs who are really getting into the technical details and studying up on how does this stuff work and actually getting hands-on, rather than seeing the role as writing documents, writing PRDs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:08):\nDo you see one of these roles, I don't know, being more in trouble than others, just like you need fewer of these people in the future potentially?\n\nHowie Liu (00:53:16):\nI think overall you can get more done with fewer people, and that's not to say we want to go and make the team smaller, but rather ... the really cool thing for us and I think a lot of other companies is it's not like you have a finite set of things you need to do and execute on from a product standpoint, and okay, now I can do that with a 10th of people. I mean, you could do that in a lot of cases, but for us, maybe it's also because we're a very meta product, right? We are the app platform with which you can build now any AI app with AI, right? The apps themselves leverage AI capabilities at runtime, whether it's to generate imagery for a creative production workflow or leveraging deep research, or AI-based crawling of the web to search for companies that match a certain criteria for your Dealflow app or something like that.\n\n(00:54:10):\nWe can effectively leverage all of these other AI capabilities in this app platform, because by definition we're enabling our customers to build apps that have this wide range of AI capabilities. But because of that, it's like we have a almost infinite set of possible AI capabilities that we could execute on, right? I'm always telling the team like, \"Look, the great news is it's like we have all these fruit trees and there's so many crazy low-hanging fruit, and you've got literally massive watermelons literally sitting on the ground and all you have to do is walk over 20 feet and pick it up instead of having to climb the really tall coconut tree to grab a hard coconut from 50 feet up. So there's so many watermelons on the ground, just go out and start finding the biggest ones and attacking those, right?\"\n\n(00:55:03):\nWhat that means is that if we can build this culture, and I do think it's a learnable way of operating, I really like to believe in the growth potential of any human and any individual. I think if you really have a growth mindset, and that's why one of our most important core values is growth mindset, right? If you really have that growth mindset, I think especially if you're willing to put in the nights and weekends hours, or in my case I'm literally telling people like, take a full day off, take a full week off and learn this stuff, you can become more fluent in this way. I think then what we get is a team that can just go and work on more things in a much more leveraged and fast way, right?\n\n(00:55:48):\nSo, I like to think people who are willing to jump on the train are just going to become more and more effective. It's not like, oh, as a PM my role is becoming entirely irrelevant, right? No, it means that as a PM you need to start looking more like a hybrid PM prototyper who has some good design sensibilities. By the way, I think some of the best eng PM and design cultures respectively over the past even few decades have always been multidisciplinary in nature, right? The original PM spec at Google required the PMs to actually be somewhat technical so they could understand the engineering limitations of the product designs they wanted to make, and they had to be kind of designy, right?\n\n(00:56:33):\nI remember my co-founder, Andrew, when he was in the APM program was always reading books about design, even down to visual design and color theory and that kind of thing, right? So I think it's just a reminder that designers as well, some of the best designers through designer to Apple, including hardware designer, you have to understand some of the technical capabilities of how this stuff works, right? If you're an engineer, I think some of the best engineers and maybe Stripe always had a very good engineering culture of engineers who could think about the product and business requirements. In fact, on any given product group, at Stripe my understanding is that the DRI isn't always the PM as is traditionally the case in that triangle. Sometimes it's actually the engineer who's taking the product lead and saying, this is what we need to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:24):\nSo, what I'm hearing is essentially the trend across product engineering design is each of those functions needs to get good at one of the other functions at least.\n\nHowie Liu (00:57:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:35):\nIdeally you can do them all, but if you can just do one additional, so a PM becomes better at design, an engineer becomes better at product management.\n\nHowie Liu (00:57:43):\nWell, I would actually go further and say I think you need to get decently good at all three. There's just a minimum baseline of if you're any one of those roles, you need to be minimally good at the other two, and then you can go deeper into your own specialty, right? You could be a designer who's really good at thinking about UX and interaction design, and then just good enough to be dangerous on thinking about what's technically possible and what is the product story around this feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:17):\nI love that. To do that, one piece of advice that comes up again and again in what you've been describing is use the tools constantly to see what's possible, and that will teach you a lot of these things.\n\nHowie Liu (00:58:28):\nI think, well, use the tools gives you exposure to what's possible, right? It's kind of like if you wanted to be a great industrial designer, and let's say, I mean, the chair is the ultimate hello world of industrial design, it's the canonical design object, you wouldn't just sit there in a vacuum with no familiarity with the materials that you can use, plywood, steel, whatever, or existing form factors of chairs trying to invent the world's best chair in a vacuum, right? You should go and first do a study of all of the best chairs out there today. Go look at an Eames chair, sit in it and try to examine it to reverse engineer how it was made, and just look at the prior art for that type of product. That's how I see the go out and play with these products, and also, I think actually going and designing or implementing or executing is the best practice.\n\n(00:59:21):\nSo you can't just only go and look at other people's chairs, eventually you have to go and actually try building your own and then try building another one and another one and another one. So, I think that's where ... when I think about how I hone my own product UX sensibilities, I never ... and at that time that I was in school and then learning about this stuff, there wasn't really any good curriculum for UX, right? It's not like there were great college classes to learn product UX. I mean, even CS was very academic in nature at that time, it wasn't applied software engineering, like build an app or whatever. Maybe now at some of the schools like Stanford, MIT, they have actually UXy type courses, but it's still a rarity for most people to have access to that.\n\n(01:00:03):\nSo, the way I learned all of my product sensibilities was just trial and error and also using and studying other products, and then going and trying to build my own weekend project ideas, right? Oh, I want to build a Yelp style app with a map view and then also a list view, and I want it so that when you pan around in the map for it to automatically update the list view. Maybe there's some UX improvements I can make on top of that, but I can also test my technical skills to figure out which parts of this are hard to implement and how do you make it work, and what are some of the design changes or affordances that you can use to map to the technical possibilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:43):\nTo do that, I loved your piece of advice, which I forgot to double down on, which I also find really powerful. The best tip there is find something to actually build that is useful to you and fun. Pick a project that's like, okay, this would be fun to do. Have a problem you're solving that forces you to actually do this thing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:01:00):\nFor sure. Look, I think that can be night and weekend projects, it can also be the daytime job projects, right? I mean, I am basically telling our teams on the AI platform group especially, \"Look, in that low hanging fruit metaphor, it's like I'm not being prescriptive with you on which watermelons you should pick, but you should go ...\" We do have different pods within that group, but one of them for instance is what we call the field agents team and they're responsible for the agents that work within your app. So this is not the agent that builds your app, but these agents that run on a customer's behalf to do web research on your customers, or they can go and analyze a document and in the future maybe do things like actually generate a prototype of a feature from a PRD or from a feature idea.\n\n(01:01:52):\nI'm telling them, \"Look, there's a almost infinite number of superpowers you can give these field agents. I'm not going to tell you which specifically to do. Now you can ask me to weigh in for sure, but you should go and just experiment and prototype a few different directions we could go.\" What if you prototype what it would look like to have a deep research implementation in field agents, so that for any given row of data, let's say in your case it's podcast guests, you can just click a button or click a button en masse across every speaker you have lined up to do deep research powered by ChatGPT's own deep research on each of the speakers and have them all laid out side by side in this table, right? Go prototype that and see how it feels and looks like. So I think some of this stuff can also be in your daytime job, especially if that daytime job is literally to go and build AI functionality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:46):\nI actually tried to do exactly that. The problem I ran into, I wonder if it's changed, is there's no API for ChatGPT deep research yet as far as I know.\n\nHowie Liu (01:02:55):\nThere is now, there is now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:56):\nThere is, there we go.\n\nHowie Liu (01:02:58):\nSometimes it ends up being ... and I think they only recently exposed it. It ends up being something on the order of a dollar plus per research call, which-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:05):\nWhat a deal.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:05):\n... I mean, again, exactly. I mean, some people would say, oh my god, that's so expensive, and you rack up 50 of those, you've cost $50 a month. I think it's like, well, it just saved you hours of research by a human.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:16):\nNot only that, I actually have a researcher that I pay to give me background on guests that was four or 500 bucks and the dollar sounds great. I've been doing this-\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:28):\n[inaudible 01:03:28]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:28):\n... I've been doing this manually.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:29):\nIf he was being smart he would be using deep research and they just collected [inaudible 01:03:33]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):\nThey might be. They might just be. Oh, man. Okay, there's one more skill I wanted to talk about real quick. This comes up a lot in these conversations is evals.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:43):\nOkay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:43):\nThe power of getting good at evals, I know that's something you value highly. Talk about just why you think this is something people need to get good at.\n\nHowie Liu (01:03:50):\nYeah, and I listened to your episodes with [inaudible 01:03:54] and Mike who talked about this. I think it's interesting that both heads of OpenAI and Anthropic have converged on this point. I mean, look, I think I would add a slightly different or additive take though, which is I think for a completely novel product experience or form factor, you should actually not start with evals and you should start with vibes, right? Meaning you need to go and just test in a much more open-ended way, like, does this even work in kind of a broad sense?\n\n(01:04:28):\nSo as an example, for our custom code generation capability, instead of defining evals that get repeatably tested as you vary the prompt or the model or the agentic workflow used to generate these outputs, and you have to define what does good look like by definition for the eval, I would first start with a much more open-ended and ad hoc style of just throw stuff against the wall, try different prompts and see how well it does.\n\n(01:05:01):\nTo me, evals are more useful, A, once you've converged on the basic scaffold of the form factor and you kind of know what are the use cases you want it to work well for and what you want to test against it. Whereas in the early days, especially if your product market fit finding either for an entirely new company or for a pretty dramatically new or bold new capability that doesn't really have ... it's not an incremental improvement on something that exists in Airtable today, I think you have to just be a little bit more creative initially and throwing stuff at it, seeing what works to understand, okay, let's use an example, we're implementing this new capability that can use basically a long-running AI crawler agent that goes and researches the web for a specific type of object or entity, right?\n\n(01:05:55):\nSo it's similar to deep research, but what it actually does is instead of outputting a report, it's actually going and compiling a list of things. The things could be companies or people or anything else, right? Find me every Marvel movie ever made, find me every DC Comics spin-off series, literally anything. You have to go in and first just try out a bunch of random ... use your own brain to think of what's the range of use cases I can test this against, right? Then you get back some results and you're like, okay, well, it's clear that where it does really well are these types of searches, people and companies with this kind of parameter.\n\n(01:06:42):\nI think to me, evals are useful once you have a sense of what is that cluster of useful use cases, you can start then more programmatically measuring the changes that you're making to improve the output for that, right? But by that point, you've probably already scoped the product and maybe the way we would merchandise it in Airtable is not a completely open-ended capability, but hey, here's a specific capability that can research one of these X number of entity types including people and companies, and here's even the filter conditions or criteria that are more explicit that you can define to give it the prompting to search for that thing, right?\n\n(01:07:25):\nBut I kind of think it's more useful as a way to iterate your way to improvement, and you can start really testing stuff empirically, right? You can A/B test, especially if you have the scale of a really large product like Anthropic or OpenAI, you can just test everything and see like, oh, this model actually performs better than this one, this prompt performs better than this one, but I think early on you don't have that luxury and you're in a much more open-ended discovery process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:51):\nThat is very wise, evals could constrain you too early. I think about just the Double Diamond, I don't know, IDO framework of be divergent first, and then converge and then maybe-\n\nHowie Liu (01:08:01):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. I hadn't heard that before, but that completely resonates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):\nOkay, let me try to reflect back some of the advice I've been hearing about how to shift a company to be successful in this new world, and let me see if I'm missing anything that you think is really important. So, one is there's this sense of just reset the expectations on pace and urgency and help people understand in AI things move incredibly fast, this is how we need to operate. Then there's also a piece of get stuff out so that you can learn how people use it and what it's capable of versus polishing it endlessly. Forcing people almost ... I don't know if forcing's the right word, but encouraging people to play with the latest stuff and giving them a chance to take days off or block out calendars, cancel meetings, just stay on top of this stuff to play as you talked about it. Then sharing things they've learned, get the vibes of what's possible.\n\nHowie Liu (01:08:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:55):\nThere's also this idea of just rethink, okay, if we were just start today in this world, what would we do to achieve the same mission we are trying to achieve? Ideally it leverages this unfair advantage we have with things we've been working on for a long time. Then there's just talk to AI constantly every hour as you described.\n\nHowie Liu (01:09:16):\nFor sure. Yeah, multiple times an hour, if possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:16):\nMultiple times an hour, it keeps going up. Is there anything else that I missed there that you're like, you need to do this too to have a chance?\n\nHowie Liu (01:09:25):\nI think just to really, really try to break down role silos, and I think that's true certainly for EPND in the typical EPD triangle, but I also think it's probably true even for non-product roles, right? I think it's true in marketing, right? Something I'm really pushing for in marketing and I think our marketing team is really leaning into actually is if you can just do all of the thing yourself ... traditionally how a marketing team might operate is like, okay, you have one person who's responsible for executing the performance marketing part of a campaign. They literally go into the Google AdWords interface and they're tweaking the parameters of targeting and budget and conversion tracking, et cetera, and then somebody else is actually responsible for coming up with the specific ad copy, and somebody else yet was responsible for coming up with the seed content or positioning guide written by a PMM that feeds into the ad creative, and so on and so forth, right? Maybe they're promoting some new demo asset that somebody else yet created.\n\n(01:10:35):\nI just think that in the same way that you can collapse the roles in EPD, and the ideal person, maybe they're very specialized and deep in one dimension like engineering, but they're well-rounded enough to be dangerous on the other two, I think that's kind of true in almost every other function, right? Sales as well, I think you should start to be able to play more of an SE role. Traditionally salespeople didn't necessarily know the product that well and relied on the SE to come in and be the product experts. I think it's really hard to sell any kind of AI product now without actually being fluent in the product and be able to demo the product, so AEs need to be SE fluent as well.\n\n(01:11:21):\nSo I just think that that concept of collapsing roles, everybody needs to become more full stack to do the ... being more outcome-oriented, right? Your outcome as an AE is to convince customers of the value of your product and close deals, right? Okay, well, in order to do that, you used to have dependencies on having assets created by marketing and an SE to help you demo. Can you collapse more of those dependencies so that if you had to, you could do it all yourself, right? I just think it's a new operating mentality overall for every AI native company or company that wants to compete in this new arena.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:06):\nThat is a great addition. It almost feels like you go back to startup times when everyone's doing a bunch of stuff. There's no here's the head of product, here's the head of engineering, we're just doing stuff-\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:06):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:16):\n... that needs to be done.\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:17):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):\nYeah, I'm kind of seeing it as this upside down T where there's the thing you're really strong at and then as you described, the minimum of being good at engineering design or ... and SE, by the way, sales engineering imagine is what that stands for. Adjacent roles, you need to start having a baseline. The baseline is increasing of how much you need to understand that, everyone's Venn diagrams are kind of converging.\n\nHowie Liu (01:12:40):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:42):\nAmazing. Okay, let me take a step back and zoom out and think about the broader journey you've been on over the past decade plus. Let me just ask you this, what's the most counterintuitive lesson you've learned about Airtable building and company building teams that maybe goes against common startup wisdom?\n\nHowie Liu (01:13:02):\nI heard your interview with Brian Chesky and then later you talked about founder mode in that YC retreat, and the points there really, really resonated with me. I feel like maybe less eloquently I deduced some of the same principles just in my own experience, which is I think when you're scaling up, and this relates also to what we talked about before around the early days of building a company, you're in the details, you're finding product market fit, you kind of have to be pretty versatile, right? All these decisions from a technical standpoint to design, to even commercial, and what's the freemium model going to be like? And how are we going to market this product? What does the website look like? They're all very intertwined, right? You can't compartmentalize and then almost factory produce each of these things separately. They're all intertwined and you have a very small tight-knit team that's thinking full stack about all of this combined.\n\n(01:14:04):\nObviously that's the only way, in my opinion, to create that magical product market fit in the first place. Then I think as you scale up, the default guidance that you often get from operational experts and larger scale company investors is like, okay, you got to industrialize the process of all of this stuff, right? It's kind of like going from a bespoke artisanal, one person made an entire item of clothing to we got to factory produce this thing, right?\n\n(01:14:38):\nWhat that means in an organizational context is you then create these different fiefdoms, you hire all these execs and each exec just manages their own swim lane, and there's relatively looser coupling between all of those different groups, right? So then you've got sales executing on its own thing, marketing's executing on its own thing, product's executing on its own thing. Even within product there's different product groups and surface areas that are each executing on their own thing.\n\n(01:15:05):\nUsing the factory metaphor of there's an argument that that's actually kind of an efficient way to scale up production for each of these different swim lanes, right? Each one can operate in a more autonomous and purely scale up focus, wait, how do we produce more of this thing? If the thing happens to be within one product group improving search, that's our main focus. We're just going to go and ship, ship, ship more stuff to improve search. So it's not completely crazy why people give this advice, but I think what you lose is the magical integrative value of holistic thinking and making the bigger picture bets, right?\n\n(01:15:48):\nI think Brian talked a lot about this on his episode with you, which is like, look, in a company that is really serious about product, first of all, I really liked his point about the CEO has to play a CPO role, you have to care about the product. Ultimately the product is the thing and you can't just coast on scaling up go-to-market around the product forever, you got to keep innovating on the product. By the way, the best way to innovate on the product is not incrementally split over all these different little surface areas, but actually to have a bigger, more step function vision of how this product needs to make a leap, or what's the next big either act of the product or new capability of the product or reinvention of the product, right?\n\n(01:16:35):\nSo I think if you really care about doing that from a product execution standpoint and almost refinding new product market fit on a regular basis, I think it necessitates a completely different operating and leadership model throughout the organization. All of the stuff we just talked about in terms of how to operate in the AI native era I think is actually exactly the same as how you need to operate in this constant product market refinding of fit state.\n\n(01:17:02):\nSo I could not agree more with that concept of you got to think ambitiously and move the organization holistically towards these bigger outcomes, but also ship and learn and experiment a lot more in this era. Then maybe the meta learning I had from all of the above is that the specific advice obviously was like, okay, go scale up in this way or go hire these types of people, experienced operators, et cetera. Now, obviously there's some truth to that, right? The people giving this advice are not incompetent. They had some reason for giving it and in certain contexts that is the right thing to do, but I think my meta learning is it's not enough to just trust the recommendation, like, here's the action you should take from a lot of people, 'cause everybody has different priors and it's almost like we're all our own LLMs, and we all have different training from a different corpus of data informed by our own experiences. Maybe you're trained on the service-\n\nHowie Liu (01:18:00):\n... experiences, and maybe you're trained on like the kind of ServiceNow or the Oracle training corpus, and this person's trained on the Facebook corpus, and I'm trained on the Airtable one. I think what I've tried to do more and more is not to just ignore advice from smart people. Obviously, that's not the right answer, but to kind of take their... It's almost like in an LLM you can now with a reasoning model actually inspect the chain of thought and see how it's thinking. Why did it come up with this answer? To me, that chain of thought like \"Why did you recommend this?\", is actually more informative than the actual, \"Just do this recommendation.\"\n\n(01:18:44):\nThe answer might be like, \"Hey, at So-and-So company, this is how we eliminated the PM role entirely.\" For Brian at Airbnb, it made sense. We're no longer having PMs in their traditional form. Now, we have program managers and product marketers, but more than the actual decision because I don't think it's a one-size-fits-all, everybody should do the same, why did you do that? The why actually was very informative, and then be able to take that and say like, \"Okay, how would I apply that?\" Maybe it yields a different outcome, but the reasoning actually is very informative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:19):\nIt's interesting how this idea founder mode is not so different from this ICCO trend that you're following and it's-\n\nHowie Liu (01:19:26):\nFor sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:26):\n... yeah, yeah, it's like being in the weeds, being in the details, trying things yourself, not delegating to execs.\n\nHowie Liu (01:19:32):\nYeah, and I think anything taken to an extreme can be problematic. There is a world where you are so in the details and in every detail that you're basically just micromanaging and you're kind of creating like a euphemism for that. That's not really what founder mode is about. That's not like the Brian conception of founder mode is to like micromanage everything and not trust anyone, but I think it's more about finding that right balance of being unabashed about caring about the details that do matter and where the tying together of details across different groups or departments actually is the only way to yield a non-incremental outcome. Otherwise, each person is just optimizing within their own domain, but you'll never get to the global maxima or the global breakthrough. \n\n(01:20:23):\nI think the really cool thing about CEOs as I seize it, frankly any leader playing more of an IC-like role and being in the details is I think for the right type of person, it's actually more fun that way. I mean, to be honest, for me, the times where I felt most disintermediated from what I felt was the substance of this company was when I thought that I was almost like forcing myself to step away from the details. I thought that's what a at-scale CEO was supposed to do. I mean, there's some famous CEOs who have talked about, \"The less decision I could make the better. The less details I'm exposed to the better. I just want to inspect at the topmost layer how this business is running, and if everything underneath it is going smoothly, then I'm able to do that and everything looks good.\"\n\n(01:21:19):\nI just think that's maybe, again, it works in a certain type of very mature type of business. Even then, though, I can't imagine that at a CPG company like a Procter & Gamble. You wouldn't want to have a CEO who still actually goes and tastes the soup and tries the products and sees literally the details of what the new product innovation pipeline looks like, as well as like how it's being experienced on the shelves and so on. I don't know. I guess I'm just more and more skeptical that that hands-off pure delegation and process management role ever works as a CEO. Maybe you go through a long enough period of where the business is coasting that nobody notices, but I got to say, for me it's just much more invigorating to get to play that role. I think for the types of operators and leaders that I most admire, that's what makes the job interesting. They don't want to have a automated away kind of role as a leader.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:22):\nIf you could go back in time and whisper something in a decade-ago Howie's ear that would have saved you a lot of pain and suffering over the last decade, what would that be?\n\nHowie Liu (01:22:33):\nDon't step away from the details that both you love. I mean, first of all, if your passion is building product and product design, even if it feels like at times the company needs to do all this other stuff like scale up, go to market, and operations and just have like a large people organization, that itself creates a lot of need to do things and manage. There becomes a new job invented just to manage a larger group of people, and obviously you're going to have to do some of that. You can't just completely eschew all your responsibility as an at-scale CEO, but don't lose the essence of the thing that you love doing and that really made this product happen and gives this company as many companies that were founded on a magical product market fit finding insight. Don't step too far away from that, and always make sure that is still your number one, even if other stuff has to also add to your plate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:45):\nI think people don't talk enough about this how if someone starts a company that's an idea they have they're excited about, it takes off and then you're stuck on that for a long time, and then even if things are pushed in a direction you're not as excited about. This point about just remembering what you actually love about it and coming back to that is so important because that's the only way to keep doing this for a long time.\n\nHowie Liu (01:24:05):\nI think that's so true, and to me that's why there's always been a difference between entrepreneurs who love the act of building a product or the business, too, versus those who saw a just purely business or financial opportunity that they felt like they couldn't pass up exploiting or going after. Look, no knock on people who are more the latter, and there's entire industries where it's all just about alpha generation. You can go into the private equity business and so on, and it's just purely it's rationally about how do I find the alpha? I think that some of the best companies, product central companies, at least in my opinion, are run by those people who actually just love the product. I think you get a feel for that from some of the AI companies like Sam, I think genuinely just loves working on AI.\n\n(01:25:03):\nIf he could spend a hundred percent of his time on just being close to the AI and the research, I mean, he would and he's even said as much. Ranging to like Brian's with Airbnb, it's pretty clear that people like this are not motivated like... Airbnb was not founded because like, \"Oh my God, we want to make a lot of money off this arbitrage opportunity against hotels.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:24):\nThey just needed to pay their rent.\n\nHowie Liu (01:25:26):\nYeah. Well, that and I think they loved the product and I think they also loved the way in which they built the product, the design-centric nature of that product and company and culture. That's what gives you the continued joy of working on what could be the same company for a very long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:45):\nHowie, is there anything else that you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nHowie Liu (01:25:51):\nI just want to reiterate, especially for listeners here who are in an EP or D role and especially in the P role, I really do believe that this is not like you either have or you don't like in terms of the skill set needed to be relevant and AI needed, but I do think it's a call to action to go and bolster your skill sets where they may be less refined right now. I think even programming, I really believe everyone could learn how to be a software engineer if they wanted to. Now, obviously, some people just as with like great writers are never going to be a published author or the Hemingway, but everyone can gain a good enough proficiency of software engineering if they really wanted to. \n\n(01:26:39):\nYou could take that boot camp. You could do like some coding exercises on the side, et cetera. The point there is that sometimes I think we treat these disciplines like hard, hard skills that if you're already halfway into your career and you're not already an engineer, if you're not already a designer, okay, well, you can never be one. I just think our brains are malleable and there's a lot of great curriculum out there to learn. Lot of it, like I said, just comes down to also like trial and error and building projects, maybe nights and weekends projects even to learn this stuff. Everyone can learn how to be a versatile kind of unicorn product engineer/designer hybrid in the AI-native era. The only thing stopping you is just going out and doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:30):\nThat is a really empowering way to end it, and just to double down on that, it's never been easier to learn these things. There are super intelligences that you can talk to that do a lot as they're building can help you learn.\n\nHowie Liu (01:27:43):\nYeah. I mean, literally, I go into ChatGPT sometimes and I ask it just like, \"Hey, how would you build this app?\" I'm just curious. I'm like, \"How would you build Manus, the open-ended agent?\" Literally, how would you build it? You can ask the questions and it's like having an amazing, brilliant software architect, software engineer, product manager, designer expert tutor that you can literally like there's no dumb question. They have infinite patience. They're literally on and awake 24/7. It is the most incredible time to learn this stuff, to your point. Then, of course, the interactive tools to go and actually build stuff. Anyone can download Cursor and just start asking Composer to generate some code for you, and then looking at the code and trying to figure out what it does. To your point, when I think back to the earliest era that I experienced of building apps, first I learned C++, then I learned PHP and JavaScript and even building kind of JavaScript single-page apps in the early days like '08 through 2010. It was a dark, dark art. I mean, there were some like... You just had to go and like learn some of these things. There wasn't great tutorials for it. You had to reverse engineer certain things. There were just weird things like if you wanted rounded corners in your UI, you literally took Photoshop, opened it up, created like a rounded corner in pixels, and then cut that pixel up into an image that you dropped onto the page at exactly the right position to be at the edge of a box.\n\n(01:29:15):\nIt's like crazy stuff. I mean, everything was so much more arcane at the time, and now it feels so much more fluid and accessible, and the gap between the arcane tech that you have to wade through to build something has just been minimized so much. It's like the effort and abstraction between you and the magical, delightful actual building of the thing that you want has been so minimized. It's never been a more exciting time to be a builder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:47):\nYou remember spacer.gif?\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:49):\nOh yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:50):\nIt's like to create. It's that line stuff you just kind of have-\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:52):\nYeah, I remember it. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):\n... the invisible one-pixel thing that you just stick in places.\n\nHowie Liu (01:29:57):\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. No.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):\nOh my God, what a time to be alive. Howie, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:05):\nHere we go. What are two or three books you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:09):\nYou know, I've been trying to read fiction more, partly because I think it's just a really nice mental reset. I will say like Three-Body Problem for anyone who hasn't read it, it's a mind-expanding book. I like sci-fi and fiction that kind of opens your brain, so maybe this is my cheat card, but it's a three-book series. Those are three great books.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:30):\nI love that series, and my tip there is it gets good one and a half books in is my tip, so just keep reading. That's where it's like, \"Okay, now I'm in.\"\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:40):\nI liked even the first one, but I felt like it was inception where every subsequent book was like you dropped into another, like you incepted into another layer, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:53):\nAwesome. Okay. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nHowie Liu (01:30:57):\nTV show, I just started watching The Studio. It's like the Seth Rogen, Rogen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:05):\nYeah, it's so stressful.\n\nHowie Liu (01:31:05):\nYep. Yeah, it is pretty stressful, and I mean, Silicon Valley was too close to home when it came out, so I watched it, but it was just cringy. The Studio is kind of fund to watch because it's a little bit about like inside baseball of Hollywood, and yet I'm not in Hollywood, so it's entertaining to watch. It's I thought smart and a funny show because I split time between L.A. and S.F. I also feel like it's very real to me. I see a lot of the literal characters out there in the world that it's characterizing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:43):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be gadget, could be clothing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:31:48):\nOkay, so I'll give two because I feel like I have to say some kind of software product. I mean, I'm a really big fan of Runway, the product and the company. I just think every new model they come out with, they just came out with a new one just I think like two days ago that gives even more controls and refinement on creating exactly the video scene that you want. I think just the photorealism in what you can generate now, and they also built this cool demo thing that's an immersive world generator I mentioned before. I think it's just cool to see. I also like the underdog story. I'm clearly like Google's gunning in the space, has VO3 and so on and has its OpenAI, but I love the underdog story of this sub-hundred-person company still punching above their weight and building really awesome video experiences. That's the software one.\n\n(01:32:45):\nThen, a very, very kind of nerdy real-world answer on product is I kind of just recently got into this whole cottage industry of artisanally produced basically clothing by small-scale Japanese manufacturers that use literally like hundred-year-old looms to make clothes the old-fashioned way or the old-fashioned industrial way. They have these loop wheeler machines and they spin the cloth in a very slow pace, so it's completely impractical from a production-scale standpoint, but I've gotten some of these t-shirts and I just love the... I guess in a world where it feels like everything is becoming so much faster moving and even tech from five years ago is obsolete, I love a little bit of the throwback to like old things sometimes can be even more cherishable in this new era. Maybe that makes me a hipster, but I love the vintage, the retro increasingly these days.  \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:56):\nI feel like anything that starts with artisanal small batch Japanese is going to be really good stuff. Is there a brand you want to share that is that? Or is this like you want to keep it-\n\nHowie Liu (01:33:56):\nYeah. No, I mean-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:06):\n... under the radar.\n\nHowie Liu (01:34:07):\n... actually, so Self Edge, which actually has a storefront, the main storefront is on Valencia Street in S.F. They carry a lot of these items. That's kind of their whole MO and they have like jeans and t-shirts. I've gotten a lot. I mean, they basically curate a really good selection of different actual makers. One of them is called Studio D'Artisan, another one's called... Actually, it's cool. There's this company called... I think the umbrella company is actually just Toyo, T-O-Y-O, Manufacturing, which sounds like it's a big kind of like large-scale conglomerate, but it's anything but. It's like a really small-scale Japanese vintage manufacturer of clothing, but they have a few sub-brands.\n\n(01:34:51):\nThey actually bought the rights to this American post-war brand that was kind of like Hanes, one of the like big four or five menswear, kind of undershirts and athletic wear brands called Whitesville. I don't know where the name came from, but basically it's a bunch of like basic clothing, like t-shirts, et cetera, and this Japanese indie company, they bought the defunct basically name and now is reproducing clothes almost made to the exact shape and stack, and even with the exact recreation of the graphic packaging on these tees, but like today. I just think there's something really funny and ironic about they've taken an American post-war aesthetic and literal brand, but it's actually a indie small-scale Japanese manufacturing approach to making those clothes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:51):\nI feel like we just tapped into what could be a whole other podcast conversation about clothing and-\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:56):\nYeah-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):\n... craftsmanship-\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:57):\n... [inaudible 01:35:57].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:58):\n... but I'm going to pull us out of that.\n\nHowie Liu (01:35:59):\nThe next podcast franchise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:02):\nOr just Howie and Lenny talking about clothing.\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:04):\nThat's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:05):\nOkay, two more questions.\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:06):\nDo you have a life motto that you often find useful in working or you like to share with friends or family?\n\nHowie Liu (01:36:12):\nI stumbled on this guy Paul Conti, who I think he's an MD, but also a psychologist, and he has a book, but also he did this long-form podcast with Andrew Huberman, and he actually ends up talking a lot about just how to think about your life outlook and kind of your framework for thinking about life, but grounded in a kind of like scientific and neurological and cognitive science basis. I found one particular point really, really powerful it took with me, which is if you live your life in a way that's foundationally built around humility and gratitude. Look, everybody has different circumstances.\n\n(01:37:06):\nI think I fully own that even though I didn't come from money, my family was very, very financially modest growing up. I still had incredible resources and opportunities afforded to me even just by virtue of growing up in the U.S., being born in and growing up in the U.S., but also having access to a computer and the internet and even all the free resources I could then access and learn about from there. I still feel like whatever you have or don't have to start with, if you kind of approach the world and kind of the future with a spirit of humility and gratitude rather than, I guess, the opposite of that, I think I've felt like it kind of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. You're open-minded, you're kind of grateful, and then more opportunities actually come your way, and maybe it's because the energy you're putting out into the world and other people.\n\n(01:38:07):\nYou're kind of attracting good opportunities and good people and good things, but I think there's a lot of other parts of his framework, but the one that is easiest to remember is like, how do I approach each day? Even if I'm going through a tough moment and I had to fire somebody today, or maybe I get disappointed because we lost a customer deal or something broke or whatever, but to still try to look at the entire situation from overall a feeling of humility and gratitude I think just really does shift your like... It spills over into everything else for that day and maybe even for the whole lifetime. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:52):\nThat super resonates. That is really powerful advice that's hard to internalize, but important.\n\nHowie Liu (01:38:57):\nYeah, it's easily said, hard to practice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:59):\nYeah. Where can folks find you? What should they know about Airtable and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nHowie Liu (01:39:05):\nOkay, so I am on Twitter, howietl. I don't post that much, but I'm a lurker, so I listen and watch, and you can always DM me there. You can also email me directly, howie@airtable.com, anytime you have ideas, feedback, et cetera. On Airtable, just go try it. The whole point is we want to make this an experiential product. That's why we're really leaning into the PLG roots. We talked about the homepage literally says like, \"Just start building right now. What do you want to build? Go.\" \n\n(01:39:36):\nIt starts building, and so use the product, give me feedback, and if you have ideas of your own and you want to rip on them, I love because my passion is thinking about product and product UX, especially in the AI era if you're working on or thinking about something interesting in that space. Even if it's just purely to riff on a concept, that's something I enjoy doing, and maybe I get to learn and sharpen my own skill set from. Feel free to reach out and, yeah, I mean, tell your friends and family to try Airtable as well. That's the main thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:08):\nSounds like you're looking for people to nerd snipe you and-\n\nHowie Liu (01:40:10):\nYes. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:12):\n... Howie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nHowie Liu (01:40:14):\nAwesome. Thank you, Lenny. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:15):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
