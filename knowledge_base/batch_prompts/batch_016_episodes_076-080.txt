At this point, we're 100 people large, the pace here is insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:12):\nYou said that you've had to throw out most of your growth playbook.\n\nElena Verna (00:00:14):\nI feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, everybody and their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of them is not optimization of the problem, it's reinvention of the solution. I just feel like I usually spend maybe 5% innovating on growth in my previous roles, right now, I'm spending 95% innovating on growth, and only 5% on optimization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nWhat do you find is actually moving the needle?\n\nElena Verna (00:00:50):\nOne of our biggest strategy is building in public, and it's coupled with employee socials, founder-led socials. And another one is giving your product away a lot, this is part of our growth secret sauce. You have to remove the barrier of entry. If somebody, one of our users stands up and say, hey, I'm going to have a hackathon at my work on Lovable, can you give us some free credits to play with? Why would we prevent a person who wants to do all of the marketing and activating for us from using us? We're like, take it, how much do you need?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:22):\nThe trick is get more people to try it, just ship things you can talk about.\n\nElena Verna (00:01:25):\nThe only way to create a word of mouth loop is just to blow their socks off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:31):\nToday, my guest is Elena Verna, head of growth at Lovable. In under one year after launching, with fewer than 100 people, Lovable hit 200 million ARR, which is one of, if not the fastest ramp to 200 million ARR in history, and growth is still accelerating. They've also recently raised a series B at a $6 billion valuation. So, with that, there's a lot to learn about what Lovable has figured out about growth. This is Elena's fourth visit to the podcast, a record, she is my favorite growth mind, and in our conversation, we talk about how the growth playbook has fundamentally changed for AI companies. What works now, what no longer works, and what has surprised her most about how Lovable grows.\n\n(00:02:13):\nShe also shares her advice about whether working at an AI company is right for you, some incredibly interesting insights into Lovable's secret sauce for growth, the unique ways they operate internally, their approach to building minimal, Lovable products, also how they hire, and also how product market fit as a concept is no longer what it used to be, and how every company basically has to recapture product market fit every three months. This episode is incredibly tactical, and you will leave this conversation smarter on so many levels.

Elena, thank you so much for being here and welcome back to the podcast.\n\nElena Verna (00:05:24):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:26):\nAs you know, this is a record fourth time back to the podcast, no one else has ever achieved this feat. I feel like you're basically my co-host now.\n\nElena Verna (00:05:36):\nI love it. Thank you for inviting me back, I'm very proud record holder in this regard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:41):\nWhat I love about you coming back each time, it feels like every time you come back, you're just doing something even more epic and exciting. And so, these days, as we'll hear in the intro, you're head of growth at Lovable, which no big deal on track to be the fastest or one of the fastest growing companies in history, depending on the metric that you track. Let's talk about just the scale and growth of Lovable to give people a sense of just how incredible this is. I'll share a bit of this in intro, but just what are some stats you can share about just how things are going Lovable?\n\nElena Verna (00:06:08):\nSo, we are just a little bit over one year's old since we launched. The company actually did exist as a GPT engineer before, but it officially launched in the third week of November last year, in 2024. So, for us, we've hit over $200 million in annual recurring revenue before we even hit our one-year milestone since being launched. Which is pretty incredible. You, Lenny, actually have a really great blog post on how quickly it takes for companies usually to get to their first million ARR, and it's usually multiple years. So, this is definitely a unicorn, I don't think this is a standard. There's a couple of things that account for it, and we can talk about it, and the growth is only accelerating, so it's compounding, which is great. Because we had our 100 million in end of July, and just four months later we were at 200 million.\n\n(00:07:02):\nSo, seven months to, well, maybe eight months, to 100 million, another four months to get to 200 million. And from users too, we already have over eight million users that have tried Lovable, we have, as you can imagine, to feed that 200 million, hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers as well that are paying for us, so things are going great and we'll talk about why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:27):\nOkay. Absurd. I think people are getting used to these insane numbers, and not long ago is like, okay, if you hit a million ARR in a year, you're doing pretty well.\n\nElena Verna (00:07:36):\nYeah, yeah. I think still you're doing pretty well if you have a million ARR in one year. This is one of the once in a lifetime type of companies, and the category, the way that it's evolving. So, I want to make sure that people don't all of a sudden set this as a benchmark for success because it should never be. In some categories, it might be even faster as we continue evolving technology, but I don't think that it's realistic to expect it out of your business that you're starting right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:08):\nThat is such an important point you're making there, it's so discouraging to founders to hear these stories of getting 200 million. And again, this is ARR. There's a lot of companies, especially in the data labeling space, I've had them all on the podcast, that are very fast-growing, but they're not recurring revenue. There's also, they pay out their people to do this data labeling. So, the revenue numbers there don't really equate. Recurring $200 million a year is absurd.\n\nElena Verna (00:08:36):\nYeah, it is absurd. I really want to make sure that people understand as we go through this episode as to why it's happening, because part of it is on Lovable, part of it is just in the market and how it's moving. So, when you're setting yourself as a benchmark, so you know which benchmarks you actually to use, and whether Lovable is the benchmark that you should be using.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):\nCool. I'm going to get into that next. Last question, just I want to see what you can share here. A lot of people look at these numbers, a lot of people are very skeptical these are lasting, durable numbers. Like who are these people? How is there $200 million being spent on Lovable? Anything you can add about, just give people confidence, is this real, this is going to last, this is a really durable business.\n\nElena Verna (00:09:19):\nWell, I saw Stripe receipts, so it is real, as far as I'm concerned, unless Stripe dashboard is lying to us. But it is money getting deposited in our bank account. But let's talk about who is actually contributing to that number. We do have a really large use case of people starting their own companies on Lovable, so we call it a founder use case. Where somebody that is non-technical, that has never been able to code or create a piece of software is now able to come in and actually build an app completely from scratch. And some of them are already monetizing it, some of it just using it [inaudible 00:09:52] for other services, or some physical goods, for example, that they're selling. Some of them are just still building. And we monetize on the act of building, so that progression of building up to your product market fit takes quite a bit of time.\n\n(00:10:06):\nAnd even with Lovable, we're so much more efficient and effective compared to hiring an engineer in terms of the price, but it still takes time. So, we have a lot of founders, whether it's B2C, whether there's B2B, so consumer products, business products, e-commerce, whatever it is. But on the other side, we have a lot of employees within companies using Lovable as well, where they're building internal tools, or they're building prototypes, they're building landing pages. So, that is another use case that is very relevant and quite efficient for us, but then there is a hype and discovery that is happening as well. Because when I think about software, I think about it, I talked to John Cutler actually, and he gave me this framework that is completely stuck in my mind, of software always goes through capabilities stage first, so what is possible to actually create with this?\n\n(00:11:00):\nThen, it needs to transition into value, of how is it that am I going to get value out of this? And then you can start thinking about scaling it, of which aspects of my life and my work that can actually go in? And we're right now very much in the capability stage with vibe coding, because everybody's just exploring, what can I do? And the beautiful thing here is that what you can do changes every month to three months. So, you constantly need to come back and you need to see what has changed. So, a lot of people use it for personal reasons. I build myself apps, tutoring apps for my kid, so he has to answer questions in order to get some screen time accumulated for him. I build my own portfolio.\n\n(00:11:40):\nI see people doing wonderful things, my favorite story that I always say, there's this man that created a proposal on Lovable. So, his fiance had to answer questions and she had to complete this game, and then at the end there was this big reveal and he proposed to her. But people just unlock the most creative things that they build on Lovable, and that's where the revenue is coming from. The one piece that is working very well for us in terms of how our monetization model is, set up and how it interjects with your activation moment, which we can also cover, but that is what's driving both conversion and retention rates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:17):\nLet me ask you one question that's on people's minds, I imagine, as you talk about this, just what does retention look like?\n\nElena Verna (00:12:22):\nYeah. So, retention, really, I look at it in two ways, retention, that it comes as a subscriber retention. So, how much [inaudible 00:12:32] subscribers do we get, and how many of them are we capable of renewing? There's also very important aspect of it is, how many of them can we expand? Because if you can get positive or above 100% net dollar retention, which is super important metric for investors... If you don't know about net dollar retention, please read it up, that's like a superpower to get bigger multiple if you can show NDR that is over 100. And then there's actually engagement retention as well, because that is the leading indicator for how your paid retention is going to look like. For paid retention, I know there is so much on the market of, oh, this is a high product, and it's a leaky bucket, and it has really high churn rates.\n\n(00:13:10):\nAlthough, I shouldn't share, it's not public numbers for us to share actual retention, however, what I can say, it's on par with benchmarks of other B2B SaaS products that I've ever worked at. And I worked with Miro, Dropbox, SurveyMonkey, Netlify, Amplitude, and others. So, are we absolutely crushing with paid retention? No. Are we where most of the other companies are? Yes. Our NDR is quite good because when people build, they want to buy more credits to build. So, we're seeing really good revenue retention, but we're honestly more focused right now on engagement retention than even paid retention because our North Star is just to get as much usage as possible, and we will fix and tune our monetization model afterwards. So, engagement retention, I would say, is a by far bigger priority focus for us at the moment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:04):\nThat is incredibly interesting, and I'm optimistic to hear because of the growth rate. Rarely is growth rate this high and retention is on par with great companies.\n\nElena Verna (00:14:15):\nYeah. And I'll just say too, which is a little bit maybe counterintuitive would be to a lot of companies, we don't optimize for revenue at all. In fact, internally, we have a lot of discussions about how can we give more products away, how can we reduce our revenue growth rate by just getting more paid subscribers, more users using Lovable, to just get bigger share of the market. So, our revenue is an outcome of us just trying to get more people through the door, not us trying to optimize for revenue per user, or to get them to monetize at the higher rate. So, there's a very interesting path here, where, by actually focusing on the inputs, like you should, it translates to a good output, but we don't look at that output as something that we're trying to grow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:02):\nLet's talk about growth, let's talk about what you've learned about growth in this space. You had this post online where you said that you've had to throw out most of your growth playbook. This is a huge deal, you've led growth a lot of really successful companies. Lovable is growing incredibly well, this tells me there's a lot we can learn from what you've seen. So, tell us what you're seeing, what's still working, what's not working, what you've learned about what it takes to drive growth at a company like Lovable.\n\nElena Verna (00:15:28):\nYeah. I would say that in any other role that I've come into before, I felt confident in about 80% of the patterns that I can bring to that role, meaning that I can identify inputs, understand which framework applies. I know a lot of examples that fit in within that framework, so we just need to localize a solution and push, and it was quite productive in terms of getting a company those additional acquisition, conversion, engagement, monetization rates. So, I felt very repetitive in a way, after some time, because I feel like I'm just coming in and copy, pasting, copy, pasting... And although every single company loves to say that they have unique problems, at the end of the day, all of the problems were very similar. And I felt like I was doing the same job over and over again. When I started at Lovable, the one thing to me that was very clear is that this company was growing like crazy before I joined.\n\n(00:16:21):\nSo, I want to make sure that there's not that much value on what I have even added today, because this company is on the tear, and yes, we're rounding the edges and removing barriers for growth, so we're not standing in our own way, but there's something more magical happening here that is not a pattern that I've ever seen before. It's not a framework that I can even conceptualize in my head. And plus, it's a new category that I've never seen, or I've never been in a company that is in a new emerging category, that hits fast moving water so quickly. And that's the difference because when you're usually trying to create a new category, it takes years. I know it's every marketer's dream to create a new category, but it takes decades often to really get that much hype and adoption around it. Versus with vibe coating, this hype seemed to have happened really quickly.\n\n(00:17:16):\nIt's like it's hit the nerve with the market. So, yes, we're at the right place, we're at the right time, but we're also in really fast moving waters, and the demand that is coming to us, we need to capture it mostly, we don't need to generate a lot of it yet. But at the same time, it comes with the really big downfalls of we're not in control of a lot of our growth. Let's be honest about it, there's so much incredible word of mouth that is happening, and we're trying to grow that, but to enable as much of that as possible, but the company is moving, we're just hanging on to it as fast as possible, and making sure that we're not going to hit a wall, so to speak, in front of us, and that the wheels are greased, and that all of the pieces are in places. It's like your race car framework that you have as well.\n\n(00:18:05):\nWe're really just putting a lot of oil into it, and figuring out what is our engine actually going to be that is going to take us forward. But when I'm thinking about the patterns here, and what I have to unlearn, I feel like only 30 to 40% of what I've learned in the last 15 to 20 years of being in growth transfers here. And some of it is very straightforward, okay, this is how you're going to do paid marketing, this is how you're going to do some of the habitual retention, here's the free to pay maybe monetization frameworks that still stand. But the rest of it, honestly, it doesn't feel like it even matters anymore, because we just need to invest in such bigger bets, and innovate, and create new growth loops here, as opposed to trying to optimize it to the moon and beyond, which I usually be focused on in a scaled business like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:57):\nLet's follow those threads. So, what is it that no longer is worth it in this bucket of just like, let's not spend any time on this thing, and then what do you find is actually moving the needle?\n\nElena Verna (00:19:06):\nNot worth it, in growth, most of the people spend most of the time optimizing existing user journeys. So, you already have maybe some of your growth loops that you understand that you try to optimize or you just know, hey, there's big drop-offs from acquisition to activation, let me go figure out how to... I can tweak the dials to get it done. Here, what I find is that optimizations are just not worth our time. So, a lot of the times my growth team actually ends up working on new features, or just standing up new growth loops one after another, and yes, there's of course the saying of more growth loops does not mean more growth, but at the same time, the market is moving so quickly, you need to stand up a bunch of initiatives to capture it because it's perishable.\n\n(00:19:54):\nOr we also have so much competition. We're not alone here, so we can't ignore that there's everybody in their mother is starting a vibe coding business nowadays, and we need to figure out how to be ahead of them. And to be ahead of them is not optimization of the problem, it's reinvention of the solution. So, I just feel like I usually spend maybe 5%, maybe 10% if I'm lucky, innovating on growth in my roles, in my previous roles, right now, I'm spending 95% innovating on growth, and only 5% on optimization. And most of my frameworks are on optimization because it's really hard to come up with frameworks for innovation because by default there, by definition, they're innovative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:38):\nWhat I'm hearing here is new features. Launching new features, [inaudible 00:20:42] product is one of the bigger growth levers, versus you have a bunch of cool stuff, make it easier to use, increase activation, reduce friction, things like that.\n\nElena Verna (00:20:51):\nYeah. And for example, we on growth team launched integration with Shopify, to enable e-commerce use case, because we're like, hey, there's already people trying to come in and do it, Shopify was open for integration with us, let's go lean into it so people can vibe code their storefronts. That came out of growth, that usually would never come out of growth. Why would growth team ever invest into a core product integration? Or we enabled voice mode for people so they can actually chat with Lovable using their voice, as opposed to only having type. And that's also, it's a feature, it's a core product feature, but we're like, hey, it's going to help people to converse with Lovable more, it's going to increase the engagement.\n\n(00:21:32):\nOne area that we've spent very little time in is activation, because usually I spend majority of my time in activation because there's so many awareness things that need to happen, and so many things that we need to smooth out experience for the users in order for them to get through that setup moment, to aha moment, to the habit loop, and here you're just interacting with agent. So, we, at the beginning, we're like, the agent team that we have here is working a lot on it. Why would we go in there and do anything? It's like our core team is responsible for activation. Now, we're starting to move into doing agent work ourselves, so all of a sudden growth team is not just doing product surfaces, now we're doing agentic workflows and codifying agent instructions in order for customers to activate better.\n\n(00:22:21):\nSo, the work fundamentally, I feel like has gotten deeper into product, and deeper into actual core product functionality, as opposed to just being a smoothing surface on the outer layers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):\nOkay, that is also a very big deal, every growth person that's ever been on this podcast, including you, always talks about the power of activation, just how much opportunity there is to get people to this aha moment, realize the value of this product, that increases retention and increases everything. And what you're saying here is you barely spend any time on activation because in a company like Lovable, there's a prompt, you give it what you want, it generates a thing, and that's basically all it is. And so, the impact is to make that agent better...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):\n... basically all it is. And so the impact is to make that agent better at that thing, versus micro-optimize every step.\n\nElena Verna (00:23:07):\nAnd our agent team spends night and day thinking about it. So I've never been at a company where core team thinks so much about activation, thinks so much about that first generation, thinks so much about reaching a-ha moment. So it's more weaved in into DNA of the overall company, which takes the pressure off of me to only have to focus on it. Because otherwise, yeah, I would be in that experience all the time.\n\n(00:23:32):\nBut I feel a lot more at ease, because everybody's thinking about it and everybody's working on making agents better. And agent, the beauty of it is it doesn't matter if it's actually first generation or if it's your Nth generation. It just needs to be a better generation. Agent needs to understand your intent better, and think and reason behind it. So it improves the entire lifecycle immediately as opposed to having to only work on that first experience per se.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:59):\nAnd what you're not saying is, \"Don't care about that experience,\" it's, \"The team building that is already obsessed with making that activation experience better and better.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:24:07):\nExactly, exactly. I love that, because that's the core product functionality at this point. And before people would spend more time building deeper features, or deeper use cases, or trying to improve some platform functionality. And now the core team, they're obsessed about that first experience because that is core product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:29):\nAnother lever that I've noticed, especially with Lovable, and I'm seeing it more and more on social media is just founders telling you what's going on. I think this connects really deeply with the new features. Launch new features. Say Anton is just like, \"Hey, check out this cool new thing. Check out our growth numbers.\" Is that a big growth lever too?\n\nElena Verna (00:24:47):\nYeah. So one of our biggest strategy is building in public. Building in public, and it's coupled with employee socials, founder-led socials for sure. This is difficult for larger companies. But when you're smaller and you still have a little bit more narrative control with everybody on your team, plus you have so much more trust within the organization, where people are going to say the right things because they understand what actually has happened, that ability to just really quickly deliver the message to the market becomes really important.\n\n(00:25:21):\nNow, we still do the big launches, so we still have everything tiered into tier three, two, one. Tier ones are going to happen as big moments that we're going to really rally as a company behind. And it's going to be something that is meant to step function, change our product market fit, and we're going to do a bunch of activities behind it.\n\n(00:25:40):\nBut at the same time, what's really important to us is to maintain noise in the market. And that noise in the market happens by us shipping every day, every other day, multiple times per day and just talking about it constantly. Interestingly enough, it's actually works fantastic resurrection strategy, because people are like, \"Oh, there's more things here. I need to go check it out.\"\n\n(00:26:03):\nIt also works as a great reengagement strategy. So instead of sending newsletters to say, \"Here's the market trends or here's the user stories,\" people are literally logging into their social to say, \"Okay, what has Lovable shipped now?\" It's like, \"What is the change?\" So it's interesting to them to see, because from the time that they voice their opinion on what needs to happen to actual delivery is so short, so they feel heard. And they are heard, because that's how we prioritize all of the things that we're shipping. But it's interesting, because I've never been in a company that tries to maintain so much just shipping velocity to maintain a certain amount of noise that it feels like the product is alive. It's changing every single week. And then there's these big amplifications, turbo boost so to speak, in the race car model, that then go out and they fundamentally create a step function change in that product market fit as a whole. And that is a retention strategy I can get behind any day and all day. I only hope that we can maintain it as we continue scaling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:07):\nSounds stressful. This reminds me, I had a... Gaurav, he's the CEO of Mirage. Used to be called Captions, which is a really successful AI video company startup. And they have a policy of you ship a marketable feature every week. That's how their company operates. And it's the same thing, it's just ship things you can talk about.\n\nElena Verna (00:27:27):\nVelocity of shipping is our number one core value in development team. So we do anything and everything to just keep it going up, up, up and into the right. And by the way, this also means that everybody has a little bit of marketer within them. We have very lean product organization. We actually lean on our engineers to do a lot of product work. We call them product engineers, and they have to go and they have to announce the thing that they've shipped. It doesn't just funnel through marketing.\n\n(00:27:57):\nSo there is a lot of autonomy, a lot of agency that needs to happen with this type of velocity. Because otherwise, you have to have enormous marketing team to staff that. So it has to come with some roles and responsibilities. Redefinition on the team as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:13):\nLet's talk about marketing. That's something else you've written about is just marketing is changing in a big way, their role in growth. How does marketing play a role in all of this?\n\nElena Verna (00:28:21):\nOn one side, marketing channels are changing. On the other side, marketing's involvement into everything that product does is changing. And then number three, I think even marketing organizations in terms of where they hire the most are changing as a result as well. So I'll talk about second one first, just because we just talked about shipping, and that is... Yeah, you still have your product marketers, you still have your channel managers. But they focus more on the big things and the narratives.\n\n(00:28:49):\nAlthough it's difficult, because the narrative even changes all the time. As these functionalities come through, usually you can come up with a positioning and messaging, and you can have it for years and create all of the campaigns around it. Now, you have it for three months, and then the product changes. So the cycles here are really, really short. And for smaller changes, because cycles are so short, they spend so much time actually focusing on it as they should.\n\n(00:29:15):\nBut some of these smaller changes just cannot be supported by marketing. You have to delegate it to your product and engineering team to do their own marketing, because otherwise, again, you'd have to have an enormous marketing team in order to support it all.\n\n(00:29:27):\nBut at the same time, channels in which marketing right now works I think are changing quite a bit. And not enough people I feel like are freaking out and talking about it, as opposed to moving just in the same direction over and over again. And the changes that I'm seeing is that it has been very clear to me that when you're talking about marketing organic strategy, if you asked me that five years ago, I would've said that's SEO. It's search engine optimization. Go on Google, that's your organic marketing strategy.\n\n(00:29:58):\nIf you ask me what's your organic marketing strategy right now, to me it's all about social. Which is what is my CEO posting? What is my team posting? What is my creator economy doing? Influencer marketing, and across all of the social platforms. That is my organic, which is... That one's paid, to be fair. But when I think about organic, there is still a lot of that word of mouth. What are my users posting on social? What are they talking about it? What are they sharing?\n\n(00:30:26):\nWhich is a mind shift, because I've been always... Especially in B2B, so focused on search. And now I feel like it's been completely pushed even further into consumerization territory, and it has become all about social no matter how B2B you are, because that's where eyeballs are at.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:44):\nThat is fascinating. And so when you talk about socials, what are you finding is most helpful? Is it Twitter/X? Is it LinkedIn? Is it YouTube, TikTok, Instagram?\n\nElena Verna (00:30:52):\nFor founder socials, our employee socials, X and LinkedIn are fantastic sources. Especially for B2B, because that's where all of the BBWB people are at. But you cannot just have ChatGPT write your copy and post it, you need to show personality. There needs to be humanity that it goes through it. And it's not natural for everybody, and it feels very awkward sometimes to start. But it's important to people to see who is building the company, because there's so much competition now on functionality, so they can rally behind a team.\n\n(00:31:28):\nSo they want to have a team that they want to win. And for that, you need to be vulnerable, you need to be authentic, obviously, but you just need to be yourself. That corporate scrubbing has to completely fall off, which is obviously going to pull in as the company scales. But at least at the beginning, that is your chance to stand out.\n\n(00:31:52):\nAnd then your customers posting about you. So that word of mouth of really creating a product that creates something for customers that is worth talking about. It gives them stories that they want to share, that feels empowering to them to tell to others like they're unlocking a secret. They feel proud of what they have created.\n\n(00:32:14):\nWhich what we focus a lot on, Lovable on, to have that feeling of, \"Oh my gosh, I have superpowers now and I can't wait to tell others. I cannot wait to show others what is happening.\" So on both of those sides, to me, that is very much organic. If you aren't a consumer, then Instagram, TikTok are very much a go as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:35):\nThe CEO clearly is an important variable in this, them. In this case, Anton just tweeting, \"Here's what's going on Lovable. Here's how fast it's growing. He's something we've learned.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:32:44):\nIt is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:44):\nWe had the CEO of Gamma on recently, granted, and he's exactly the same thing. Just sharing a bunch of lessons, journey building in public, a big part of the growth lever. And your point here is okay, so it's the CEO. But then it's also how do you get your customers to share things on socials? And then there's a paid influencer component.\n\nElena Verna (00:33:01):\nYes, the customer is difficult one. That's a word of mouth loop that you need to stand up. The only way to create a word of mouth loop is just to blow their socks off when they actually experience your product. We have a almost unfair advantage, because our product is called Lovable. So by default, we're trying to create absolute lovable experiences. That is a mentality internally. If it's not lovable, we're not going to ship it. And the best way to fix a bug at Lovable is to say, \"This is not lovable,\" and everybody just jumps on it to fix it right there and then. Sprints, no sprints, it doesn't matter, it's getting fixed right now.\n\n(00:33:40):\nSo from that perspective, we have that culture already embedded as part of our brand and it's part of our name which helps us a lot. But the point is that you feel that brand through every interaction. I talk to my designer all the time, how can we add more love marks into the product? How can we prioritize more unique interactions? The little elements that make up that feeling of this product is speaking to me. It's like, \"It feels something that is unique.\" It has personality behind it.\n\n(00:34:08):\nSo we put all of the brand work actually into our product. When you think about Lovable, people think about a brand, but we don't have a brand marketing team yet. So it's all just through product interactions, and some of those building and public moments of the people behind those product interactions that is our strategy.\n\n(00:34:28):\nAnd then there's influencer marketing. Interestingly enough, influencer marketing is 10 times bigger for us than paid social. So yeah, we do some paid social as well, and it's working decently. It's quite expensive from payback period, we're still optimizing it. As I said, we're pretty early on in all of these channels. But influencer marketing is something that has worked from the beginning at Lovable. And a reason behind it is that influencer marketing, especially on the socials, it gives you an opportunity to have a little video and interaction. And Lovable is all about seeing like, \"Oh my gosh, this is what I can do, and this is possible.\" So that drives people to go and try it themselves.\n\n(00:35:07):\nSo that's why social works very well for us, because it's not really a written value proposition. Nobody knows what vibe coding is. But you watch 10 seconds of it and you go, \"Whew, that's new. Let me go give it a try.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:18):\nWho would've thought that a head of growth, who is traditionally seen as data, metrics, spreadsheets, drive KPIs is like, \"Okay, how do we make this more lovable? How do we add more moments of delight?\"\n\nElena Verna (00:35:31):\nI know. My joke is at the end of my Lovable journey whenever... Hopefully it never comes to an end. But at the end I'll be a growth brand person. Hi, my name is Elena, I do brand now. But I actually see it as part of growth strategy to make sure that that brand shines through every single interaction. And I always talk to my team about it, because that is one big lever in our growth story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:58):\nYeah, so I think that's a really important point to highlight. The reason Lovable is growing so fast is it is a product people love. You've made something people want. And the word of mouth spreads, because it's something that blows people's socks off as you said. So it feels like that's the first thing you got to get right.\n\nElena Verna (00:36:13):\nYes. Well, the first thing you have to get right is you have to be at the right place at the right time and you have to be in fast moving waters. Let's not discount how fast this category is exploding on its own. So this cannot happen in every single category that you're starting to build a product. But the way to stand out in the super crowded category is to create experiences that speak to people.\n\n(00:36:33):\nThat I think is something that a lot of people deprioritize, because they still prioritize functionality over humanity within software. And I think that we're actually moving to the new era of software that needs to feel human, that people want to interact with, not just utility of it. Because cost of software is coming down so much to develop that we now can actually invest into emotional feel of that software, as opposed to only just focus on creating the utility out of it.\n\n(00:37:04):\nSo to me, it's a... I love this move, because I hate nothing more than going to software that is just so painful to use that I lose some brain cells as I'm interacting with it, versus software that I feel I get energy out of. And for Lovable for me, I cannot wait on some of the projects that I have to go and vibe code myself. That's the highlight of my day. I bring in my daughter and I'm like, \"Let's go do this.\" Like, \"What do you think that needs to be done?\" Because I just get so much energy out of doing it. And that is the feeling you cannot create by looking at it as a utility problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:42):\nThe way I think about it, the way what you're describing is it's almost table stakes have increased, and now it's so easy to build. Now the big differentiator is experience, design, delight.\n\nElena Verna (00:37:52):\nExactly, and it has to translate through every single interaction. So your designer has to be one of your first hires now in startups. It's not just about the engineering, so to speak, utility. And you have to think through every single interaction of, does this communicate our brand or not?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:09):\nSo along those lines, I want to come back to something you talked about, which is launching new features as a huge growth lever. The big question there is just how do you maintain quality and cohesiveness as all these people are empowered to ship stuff? Is there anything else there you've seen that works well to help avoid just the Frankenstein product that's endless features that you want to tweet about?\n\nElena Verna (00:38:28):\nYeah. One part of it is not something that you can codify, but it's the type of people that you hire that are going to go and ship these things. We at Lovable try to hire the absolute best talent available out there that we can bring in, and that we can source and that we can attract to grow with. And what do I mean by that best talent? It's not that somebody who has been at really large companies, or somebody that has really done a lot of logos or has big success stories behind them. It's somebody who is extremely passionate about their job.\n\n(00:38:59):\nIt's their hobby. They love to work. They have fire in their belly. This is not a paycheck for them, they want to do this for some ulterior reason. This is the biggest opportunity of their life, so this is global maximum against any other opportunities that are in front of them at the moment. So that's very important for us.\n\n(00:39:18):\nWe want people to come and do their absolute best work at Lovable. It's very important, and you can feel it in this office. People are wired up. They are so high on how can we make this better? How can we deliver more to our customers? And that's very different compared to usually how companies grow where like, \"Okay, yeah, the check, check, check. They fit the skillset, let's bring them in.\" But is that passion, is that fire behind it?\n\n(00:39:45):\nAnd then the second piece is that we work really hard on just addressing what's the success here looks like? What is it that we're building? What use cases are we building for? And then because we hire these people that are so passionate about it, the other two skills, by the way, that are super important is high agency and high autonomy. I can figure out things that are tangential to me that I don't need other specialties, so to speak. I don't need a marketer to go launch something, I can go figure it out. And I have high agency, I can go do it myself. I'm going to own it all the way from start to finish. Those are very important, something that we screen for and something that we look for in our culture.\n\n(00:40:25):\nAnd then you just see... What you want to do is up to you. So there's very little supervision that happens on the ground. Now, we all have goals and some of the big launches that we're all marching towards, but some of the work that is completely up to developers, up to marketers or whatever, what is it that they want to do? So there has to be that enablement of go try things. And because of our velocity, if you fail, it's not a big deal. We'll just pivot, we will get through it. We are not here to just win all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nOn the hiring of these incredible people, as we all know, it's very hard to hire people these days, especially the best. What have you seen Lovable does differently or does well that helps them recruit the best?\n\nElena Verna (00:41:10):\nYes, and especially recruit in Stockholm. The main office here is in Stockholm. We're asking a lot of people to relocate, which is no small feat. Now some of it makes it easy, because of how much hype we created around our product. People want to come work for us. They're reaching out to us. They're saying, \"I love what you're doing, I want to join it.\" So that we have a cheat code to it, because we have... Most of the time when we reach out to somebody, they say, \"Yeah, I would love to explore.\" So building that product that is highly lovable also creates a really great recruiting brand for you as well. So make sure that there's multiple benefits to that.\n\n(00:41:49):\nBut second of all, we do a lot of trials for people. So trial work to see them in action.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nYeah, a work trial.\n\nElena Verna (00:41:57):\nA work trial to see them in action for a couple of days. We pay them as part of the work trial. We have some probation periods that we start people on, because this company is not for everybody. As I said in the podcast in the beginning, the pace here is insane. I went on vacation for the first time. So I've been here for six months. I went on vacation for 10 days. I came back, I felt like I needed to onboard from the beginning. Everything changed.\n\n(00:42:26):\nAnd when I'm in it, I feel like it's an evolution. But the fact that just being gone for 10 days, it feels like a complete revolution in the company. That pace is just not for everybody, and that's okay. Because I'm a very firm believer that there's different cultures and different environments that the best fit for different personalities and different people.\n\n(00:42:44):\nSo we try to be very upfront with how things are and how chaotic they are, and we prioritize people that don't look for clarity. We can create clarity out of chaos because it is absolutely chaotic otherwise. And if we start to look for people that can explain it to us, that's the only way that we can succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:06):\nThe way you described going on vacation and it feeling very different, it feels like when you don't see your kid for a few days and they're just completely different. You're like, \"How did you grow up so fast in three days?\"\n\nElena Verna (00:43:16):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:17):\nLet me try to summarize the growth levers that you're finding are working, and I'm trying to think about this from the perspective of an AI startup trying to think about, \"Hey, shoot, how do we grow faster? What has Lovable figured out?\" So it feels like number one is just build something lovable, something that blows people's socks off, but also in a market that is growing that people want to pay money for. You can build something lovable that nobody actually cares about, that there isn't much money going to this space. There's no tide pushing it forward, and it won't work.\n\nElena Verna (00:43:46):\nI call it minimum lovable product. It shouldn't be minimal viable product anymore. Viability is left back in 2010s. Now it's minimal lovable product. That's the only thing that matters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):\nI love how these AI tools are letting us... PMs have always had these smoke door test, or what's the term? Or it's not a real product. Paint the door.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:11):\nPaint the door. Paint the door.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):\nPaint the door, there it is.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:12):\nYeah. And it's like, okay, we just have a landing page. There's nothing there. And now AI makes it easier to do that, and it's more full-featured.\n\nElena Verna (00:44:18):\nYeah. Well, it's the feedback cycle. It's just completely collapsed. You can go from idea to some product that is functioning to user feedback within a day if you want to, depending on how fast that you want to run or how complex the product is. For missions, it took us a couple of weeks to vibe code it to the point to where... I have a full-time vibe coder on my team. He's amazing. So he wanted to create videos. He did a bunch of designs for it too. It took him a couple of weeks, we're testing it now and then we'll push it in the product. But it's a completely different development lifecycle.\n\n(00:44:54):\nBefore, it would just take so many more steps from user research to the design sprints, to prioritizing an engineering roadmap, to build something minimal and viable to actually test to little long testing cycles. Now it's just like, \"Boom, let's go.\" It could have taken us a day, we just decided to take a couple of weeks to get all of the video pieces correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):\nI saw you launch this on LinkedIn. To me, it looked like a full product launch. It is interesting to hear this is just a prototype.\n\nElena Verna (00:45:26):\nYeah, it's minimum lovable product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:30):\nMinimum lovable product. Okay, I got to ask you, you said you had a full-time vibe coder. What the heck is this? Is this an engineer? Is this something else? What is a full-time vibe coder?\n\nElena Verna (00:45:38):\nGreat question. This is a new job role that is actually popping up here and there. It's absolutely fascinating to watch this development, because I see vibe coding as a skill being added to a lot of job descriptions. For designers, for product managers, for marketers, which I think is a really interesting shift. Finally, Excel can move over. We have a new skill to add that is super empowering and not-\n\nElena Verna (00:46:00):\n... it's super empowering and I'm not 30 years old, but vibe coder, so his name is Lazar and he actually was chief of staff in his previous role so he's not technical at all. He's self-taught in technical aspects of it, but he was very early on in the vibe coding wave so he learned a lot about it. He was user of all of the vibe coding tools, Lovable included.\n\n(00:46:26):\nAnd when I was coming into the role, I'm like, \"I have so many projects that I will vibe code myself,\" so I run this woman only hackathon, SheBuilds. I vibe coded the first version of that site and submission process for applications, and then other people came in and started building on top of it. But I vibe coded, but then I don't have enough time sometimes because I need to run around and I want to push out so many different initiatives that I want to test in the market with our own product. So we connected on social and I'm like, \"Would you join us?\" And he joined us first part-time. I'm like, \"You're bringing so much value.\"\n\n(00:47:03):\nFor example, we partnered with Shopify, and he created a bunch of Shopify Lovable templates, vibe coded for us. And it's been so helpful to have somebody like that that is just pushing all of these things out. And he's an absolute expert, so he's teaching us all too of what is possible with Lovable because he's on the cutting edge of constantly pushing it to the limit. I really enjoy having that role, which I've never had before in my life and in my team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:31):\nI'm not surprised. I've never heard of this role before as a real full-time job. Do you think this is a thing people will start hiring for at non-vibe coding companies?\n\nElena Verna (00:47:41):\nI vibe code myself so I would put that as even as a skill on my resume now. It took me a while to figure out, by the way, everybody's like, \"Oh, you just go in and it all happens automatically.\"\n\n(00:47:52):\nIt takes you a couple of iterations, couple of projects until you know, okay, this is how I need to translate it, how I need to think about it. But for me, it's when I started scaling of what I want to vibe code, that's where his value really came in because I'm like, \"Okay, I understand what is possible. I know what needs to be achieved.\" And some of these apps, I want to be almost full-blown built because they're not going to get incorporated into the product anytime soon. They don't need to be. I'll just link to them from our header, so to speak. And he really accelerated that velocity for me.\n\n(00:48:23):\nSo once you get into vibe coding and you see its value within your organization, leaning into somebody like that, just accelerates your velocity because it is like an engineer on your team. It's just they're not, to me, he's part technical, but they can be non-technical if they're really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:40):\nThat is fascinating.\n\n(00:48:41):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users, fight fraud, and build trust. We talk a lot on this podcast about the amazing advances in AI, but this can be a double-edged sword. For every wow moment, there are fraudsters using the same tech to wreak havoc, laundering money, taking over employee identities and impersonating businesses. Persona helps combat these threats with automated user, business, and employee verification. Whether you're looking to catch candidate fraud, meet age restrictions, or keep your platform safe, Persona helps you verify users in a way that's tailored to your specific needs. Best of all, Persona makes it easy to know who you're dealing with without adding friction for good users. This is why leading platforms like Etsy, LinkedIn, Square, and Lyft trust Persona to secure their platform. Persona is also offering my listeners 500 free services per month for one full year. Just head to withpersona.com/lenny to get started. That's with persona.com/lenny. Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring this episode.\n\n(00:49:47):\nLet me go back to summarize just real quick the growth levers, I want to move in a somewhat different direction. Things that help Lovable grow. One is just build something that blows your socks off, as you said. I love these phrases out here. The second is make noise in the market. And the way that Lovable does this, the CEO's tweeting constantly. You build something that blows people's socks off so that they share things on socials themselves, plus this influencer marketing component, and just this idea of building in public has been really helpful. This point about activation being embedded within the product team of the AI agent essentially, so it's essentially not the growth team thinking about activation. It's the product team that is building the AI magic that is obsessed with activation. It feels like those are the main growth levers. Is there anything else that I missed?\n\nElena Verna (00:50:38):\nCommunity. I think community is really important here because you need to bring people together as they're exploring these capabilities and as they're seeing what's possible so they can bounce off each other and they can help each other out. I would say community also amplifies that word of mouth. It amplifies all of the social posting. It amplifies retention mechanisms for you as well. The community has been a huge part of Lovable's success as well, and that's something that was started very early on.\n\n(00:51:05):\nIt runs on Discord, so it's nothing fancy. It's not like we build anything completely from scratch for ourselves. And it has hundreds of thousands of members and it's very lively. We have community managers that are making sure that all of the questions get answered and the right groups are being created. We have incredible ambassador program now as well of people doing it. I would say community here, again, of really making software more human is very important role. Now, obviously not everybody can build a community, but maybe at least plugging in into somebody's community is quite important as well. And then there's another one, unless you have a question on community.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:46):\nNo, keep going.\n\nElena Verna (00:51:48):\nAnother one is giving your product away a lot. And for AI products, it may feel counterintuitive because they're so costly. Every single interaction with an AI product costs companies something. There's an LLM pass-through cost that is coming through. And a lot of, especially traditional tech companies I see are gating AI immediately behind the paywall because they're sitting on a really cush, high margin profile, and the moment that you start giving AI away for free, you're cutting into those margins like a knife through the butter. Now, at the same time, AI being so new and the capabilities being so new, you have to remove the barrier of entry. You have to give a lot of your product away for free. But by the way, I don't just mean freemium. Freemium to me is just a baseline. If you're in the new category, you need to let people explore what it is free and get that initial wow moment.\n\n(00:52:48):\nIt's not aha moment, by the way. It doesn't need to be aha moment anymore. It just needs to be a wow moment. And for Lovable, it's that first preview generation after your first prompt, even though it's absolutely not going to be complete thing of what you want to build, but you just go, \"This is possible? I had no idea. I want to keep building.\" And it becomes an addictive exercise.\n\n(00:53:08):\nBut we also give so many of our Lovable credits away to every event, to every hackathon. If you want to host a Lovable hackathon, we will sponsor it and give all of the participants credits away for free. We give them away as candy and we basically track them over our LLM costs on freemium and giveaways as our marketing costs, and it doesn't go into our something we need to reduce to make our margins better. It goes into, this is something that we need to spend more in because this is part of our growth secret sauce.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:41):\nOkay, I want to hear more about the growth secret sauce. That is extremely interesting. I haven't heard of that as a strategy, and I can see why this makes sense. If the strategy is blow people's socks off so they can tell their friends, post on all socials, the trick is get more people to try it. And it's such a new, crazy thing. Why would I pay money? Why would I even go take the effort to try sign up for an account? I don't know what this is. I don't know what I'm doing with it. So I could see how this loop goes faster and faster by giving it away.\n\nElena Verna (00:54:10):\nExactly. And again, this is very uncomfortable sometimes for companies that A, either used to really... AI companies have lower profile of margins. That's absolutely true. To find an AI company with 80%, 90% margin profile is absolutely impossible, let's be real. We're all sitting somewhere in a 40% or so, which is a lot smaller. So any time that you look at those AI costs as your cost center, that's when you're in trouble. You fundamentally have to flip the script and say, \"I need to expose to people of what is possible and I need to remove the monetization friction out of it.\" Because if you don't, nobody's ever going to try it, or you're going to be very easily overtaken by a competitor that will give it away. And let's face it, once you hook people, they're more likely going to stay with you. So you obviously have to still work on the retention strategy there.\n\n(00:54:59):\nBut if you can have, like for our case, if somebody, one of our users stands up and say, \"Hey, I'm going to have a hackathon at my work on Lovable. Can you give us all some free credits to play with?\" Why would we prevent a person who wants to do all of the marketing and activating job for us in their company from using us?\n\n(00:55:21):\nOf course, we're like, \"Take it. How much do you need? How much would you like? We will sponsor it all. We will give you anything that you need.\" So we're really leaning into people that are wanting to show this magic to those around you and empowering them as much as possible. And that is something that is actually applies to every single product. And I agree, this is not a growth strategy that I've ever applied in my life on giving product away as much as possible, but it is something that is more and more becoming something that I see that is absolutely non-negotiable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:51):\nWhat I'm feeling is the more mind-blowing it is, the more you should give it away for free.\n\nElena Verna (00:55:56):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:57):\nEspecially in a competitive market where everyone is... It's hard. There's so many companies trying to do this thing, and so it's almost like the better you are, the more you should give it away.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:07):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:08):\nAnd this also explains why so much VC money has to be raised for these sorts of companies because this is not cheap. Like you said, you're paying all these foundational models a lot of money.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:16):\nYes and no. I'm only going to say no is because, so take a look at Lovable, we're over 200 million in ARR. At this point, we're 100 people large so our headcount costs are very low.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):\nWait, let me just make sure people hear that. 200 million ARR, I didn't realize 100 people work at Lovable.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:36):\nYes. And six months ago, we had 30 people working at Lovable so we triple. So for us, it's a really big deal. We tripled our company size.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:44):\nSuch a big company now.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:44):\nWe're going to quadruple it by the end of, yeah, I know. We're big boy and girls now. But for perspective of the headcount costs, it's minimal. We have very little in that going on. We are not spending a lot on paid marketing so we're not a big paid marketing driver. Yeah, we're spending on influencer marketing, but it's not majority of our growth. It's low double digits to be fair because it's not why we're successful. It's amplifying our success and it's helping us reach new audiences. We don't have really large sales team, we have only a couple sales folks, and they're just starting to ramp up their enterprise efforts so we don't have really big enterprise demand gen costs as well.\n\n(00:57:24):\nFrom that perspective, if you look at the equation and you say, \"Well, okay, if you're not going to do a lot of paid marketing, if you're not going to do a lot of sales, because we're really only working on hand raisers of people that are saying right now that they want to buy Lovable, then whereas you don't have big costs, so you can spend it on product.\"\n\n(00:57:42):\nThat is the beautiful part because when we are giving our product away to our customers, we're not competing with other companies in that space, because they're just going to use Lovable in their hackathon. We're on their own, and we're not competing on AdWords or in paid Google where everybody's buying real estate for eyeballs. From that perspective, I think about it more as a shift of where we spend in costs. And honestly, it's more efficient way to do paid marketing almost in a sense because of the cost per eyeball that we get there is quite a bit lower compared to if we were trying to compete it on Google. So yes and no to your statement because it actually does not deteriorate margin profile. We're just shifting of where we're spending it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:30):\nThat is an incredibly important point you're making there. It's not like you're generating an incredible amount of revenue, so there is money available to spend. And what you're saying is because it's been spreading through word of mouth mostly, you're not spending tons of money on salespeople, you're not spending tons of money on paid ads. This is just an amazing way to get more people to use it, so it's like a marketing cost.\n\nElena Verna (00:58:54):\nThis is product-led growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:58):\nSupercharge.\n\nElena Verna (00:58:59):\nTo the max, supercharged. Yes, because you're literally using your product to drive that awareness by giving it away to the agents in your ecosystem that will do that distribution for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:11):\nSo fascinating. What a wild world we're living in. Free stuff for everyone.\n\nElena Verna (00:59:17):\nYes. I mean, it's great for consumers. This is a great time to be a consumer. You have so many options. Everybody's throwing themselves at you, giving your product away for free so it's great to be in the market right now. I think the power should be with consumer always, but with software, power has not been with consumer previously because we were forced to use towards some solutions because of either how they were chosen for us or what was available in the market. And now that supply is almost infinite, the demand from the consumers can be very picky and the one that serves the best will win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:52):\nAnd I think again, it's important to highlight. This is not some kind of VC subsidized bubble-ish sort of thing. There is a lot of money being generated that you are spending to help it grow faster. It's not some kind of, we're just raising more money to give away more money. You're actually making your own money. It's not driven by VC money. Obviously, it helps.\n\nElena Verna (01:00:09):\nI can't comment on specific margin details for us, but at the same time, the money that we're raising on VC is for future development and hardening our business, not because we will not be able to survive without it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nAwesome. Okay, great segue too. I want to talk about product-market fit in competition. You have this really interesting post that I don't think people grasp yet, which is that product-market fit is no longer this, we've done it. Product-market fit and we're up into the right. Now we just grow, go, grow. Now we hire salespeople, it's going to be great. You've written that just product-market fit is no longer this like you've done it and you're good. It's this endless fight to keep it. Talk about what you're seeing there.\n\nElena Verna (01:00:49):\nI'll first start with what I've felt at least before when people were talking about product-market fit, that yeah, obviously always product-market fit is an evolving thing, but the rate of that evolution was measured in years. What is it that you need the next product-market fit step function change, which often was called second horizon or third horizon. Sometimes five, 10 years, sometimes even longer that you'd need, depending on how good and hard your initial product-market fit was, but you'd spend years scaling the original product-market fit. It was like blitz growth stage. Marketing, sales, growth was very important that you just try to get it to as many people as possible. And then once you have saturation or the cost to getting to the marginal people becomes too high, you start thinking, \"Okay, what else can I offer to help me reach additional people or sell more to existing users that I already have?\"\n\n(01:01:39):\nAnd again, the main point here is it would take years to get to that stage where it became a question that you had to face really hard face-to-face. Now, it's three months, and all of a sudden you have to face that question again. And it's happening because of two things, in my opinion. Number one, in AI technology of what LLM is capable of doing changes still very rapidly with new model release, with each new model release. I think we'll stabilize at some point and then it's going to become more marginal, but we're not there yet. So every three months or so, every single AI LLM provider creates a step function change in what is possible with that LLM. And when you have this new possibility in just an underlying technology that opens up in front of you, then it creates another ceiling of what is possible to build on top of it.\n\n(01:02:36):\nThe tricky piece here is that it's not enough to just wait for that technology to get better and then start building on top. You have to build beforehand to make a bet and then it's the LLM to catch up because when that model releases, you already need to have that functionality available. That piece is, I've never been in a company where the fundamental capabilities are still changing so rapidly, and that's the product part. The product can leap to the new expectations, but let's not talk about the market part as well. Consumer expectations have never changed this fast before. What we expected ChatGPT to be able to do and answer and how we wanted it to talk to us eight months ago versus now is night and day and the deep thinking mode, and how deeply you can go into answering questions and what is capable of building on top of it.\n\n(01:03:31):\nConsumer perception has never changed this fast too. It's this unprecedented time of consumers all of a sudden in a month saying, \"Oh, it's not doing this yet. I'm bouncing.\"\n\n(01:03:43):\nBefore, again, consumer perceptions would be years to take. It's actually technology would sometimes be able to already address it, but consumer perception has not been changed yet so it would take a long time. We're in this really weird part where both product and market is shifting so rapidly that every three months, I feel like we have to recapture our product-market fit and not just recapture on the same technology and with same customers. It's both of those pieces of the equation change every three months, and it's terrifying in a way. It's also very confusing in a way because we're $200 million company, and we're not solely focused on marketing and sales because we still have to recapture our product-market fit.\n\n(01:04:26):\nYou know that the team that finds your product-market fit is very different than the team that usually scales your company, yet we have to find the team that is capable of doing both on ongoing basis. Now, I think every AI company is on this product-market fit treadmill. Hopefully that treadmill speed slows down. If not, I think we're going to come up with crazy things of what this LLM and AI will be able to do if it's going to continue at this cusp, but it's a weird place to be in because every three months we have to throttle on our scaling efforts and just reinvent and then scale again. But it's like short blitz of growth, not these long year long commitments.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):\nWhat makes this very real is just this week, apparently OpenAI had this whole code red moment where even though OpenAI by far the leading AI assistant over almost a billion, I think monthly active users, basically synonymous with AI around the world, with Gemini 3 launching, their market share just started to dip really quickly. I think they lost six something percent in a week. And so even OpenAI, ChatGPT, the original, the one that everyone uses constantly is in danger.\n\nElena Verna (01:05:39):\nIt's like nobody's future is bulletproof yet. And 10 years ago, if you asked me if a $200 million company was at risk in losing product-market fit in the next three months if it's experiencing 10% month-over-month growth, I would've said, \"You're crazy.\" And now that's the reality that we live in. And I don't know, it's fascinating to world in. What a time to be alive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:04):\nTime to be alive and very stressful, but the prize at the end is massive. That's why this is worth doing, not just monetarily, but just the impact it's going to have on the world, the way we people build and ship.\n\nElena Verna (01:06:17):\nExactly. The ceiling of what is possible has been raised so massively that we haven't even became too closest to even see it, I believe. I think that that's the exciting part of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nThe way I've seen you write about this product-market fit challenge is the traditional approach is you have these core users that are using it happy with it, and then you expand to the adjacent users and expand to the next. You're basically just trying to recapture that same core constantly and don't even have time to go adjacent.\n\nElena Verna (01:06:44):\nYeah. Bangaly wrote a really wonderful article. It was many years ago at this point on adjacent user theory in that your product-market fit expansion when you're in no growth stages, the biggest opportunity for you to go after is this what you call the adjacent user, which are just outside of your core user. They have somewhat similar needs, but maybe they're in different geo, maybe they have slightly different use case, slightly different needs. And your biggest way to continue growing a product-market fit without having to go to next horizon is to capture that next group of users. The interesting piece here of how I relate to it, we still have the core users. And by the way, those core users are mostly pioneers right now that are excited by the capabilities. Then there's latent majority that is filled with adjacent users. And the issue right now, which I'm actually quite worried about us as a category is that we're constantly focusing on recapturing the pioneers.\n\n(01:07:39):\nWe don't have time to go after adjacent users, and I'm worried of whether there's going to be a gap in the space where we actually going to alienate the latent majority because we're so hyper focused on just staying top of mind and top capabilities on the pioneers. But I don't know the right answer here, because without the pioneers, you need pioneers for latent majority to follow. But if you take pioneers and you take them too far into capabilities, will latent majority never be able to catch up? Maybe this is a fruitless concern, but it's just something that I think about because at this stage we should be working on adjacent users. I would argue maybe OpenAI definitely started to do that with how many people they have on their platform, but not most of the other AI companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:31):\nI completely see what you're thinking there. A brand could just become known as that's just for startups and prototyping and it's not for serious work.\n\nElena Verna (01:08:38):\nYeah, or it's for techies. It's for tech people. It never actually enters the people outside of our little bubble that we live in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nWe touched on this a little bit of just working in AI, working on AI companies, challenging, stressful, a lot of work. What's your advice for folks that are thinking about, should I join a Lovable? Should I join a Cursor? Should I-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):\n... are thinking about, \"Should I join a Lovable? Should I join a Cursor? Should I just go work at Google?\"\n\n(01:09:05):\nNot to throw them under the bus or anything. Although Google, very, very successful in AI now, maybe a less AI-focused company.\n\nElena Verna (01:09:13):\nI really believe that there's different... You need to understand what's the environment that is right for you. Just please understand that AI companies are very hectic at the moment. They're very unstable by definition of that product-market fit treadmill, about that distribution of how they're actually distribute to the market, really changing about how product is even being developed in the first place. So if you are very comfortable in being in that messy middle and really comfortable of converting chaos into clarity for you and those around you, then yeah, AI company is a wonderful place for you to really absorb new skill sets right now. Because even before joining Lovable, when I kept seeing AI, I'm like, \"My gosh, I'm so tired of seeing AI everywhere. Is it really changing the world? Is it really changing the way people work?\"\n\n(01:10:02):\nAnd I was at Dropbox before, and yeah, we would use AI here and there and I would use ChatGPT. I've never used AI there the way I use AI at Lovable and the things that I'm capable of accomplishing at Lovable, and I don't know if I ever would've made that leap so fast unless I joined Lovable. If I would've just read or listened about it, it's just different compared to be surrounded by people where it's expectation. It's not like a nice-to-have or something that somebody's asking you to do. This is just how you get things done. And you have to think about everything of, \"What can AI do here versus where do I add value versus in a traditional sense of work?\" because I start with my own value and then I augment it with AI. And here, the mindset has completely shifted.\n\n(01:10:47):\nNow, I don't think AI is replacing everybody's job, so please don't look at it as that cliche saying. I actually often call AI as average intelligence that helps me get the platform up. And then I add my human thinking and my human creativity on top of it to get it to the next level. But at least I can get this base level done with AI really freaking quickly.\n\n(01:11:11):\nSo from that perspective, I think if you want to leapfrog on what it means to be AI native employee and how to use all of these AI tools, you should go to AI company. But if you know that your superpower is in more structure and more definition and a really high specialty of things, because in AI companies, they're all fairly small, so you'll have to generalize quite a bit and have a lot of ownership, all of areas that you usually maybe not have ownership over, then you shouldn't join it, because AI companies will evolve to be more stable too.\n\n(01:11:43):\nSo it's just a matter of time on where you can join. So I would just urge people to look at their superpowers and the type of environments that really speak to them so they can feel happy, because this can lead to burnout for wrong type of personalities very quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):\nYeah. My sense is if you want work-life balance, don't join one of these companies, because that's just not the way they work.\n\nElena Verna (01:12:07):\nI don't know if I'd go that far. I mean, I have family, I have two kids. I feel like I have a very good work-life balance, but I put in boundaries for myself. I know when I need time off because I know when my brain starts to overheat, so to speak. But I also know that work is my hobby and it's my passion, and this is the best work of my life that I'm doing right now. There's no other place that I'd rather be than to be here.\n\n(01:12:33):\nSo I think that you just need to be more careful about setting your own boundaries that you know you need. But I mean, let's face it, I don't think anybody has work-life balance, regardless of a company that they work at, even at Google or Microsoft or any of the others. I think everybody's freaking out and running as fast as they can, it's just they're running it in different structures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:58):\nI'm really glad you said that and corrected me there, that it is possible to work at a company, one of, if not the fastest-growing company in history and actually have work-life balance to get sleep, to spend time with your kids and family.\n\nElena Verna (01:13:11):\nYou just have to protect it ruthlessly, but you also need to be realistic with how much is expected out of you, and you need to feel confident that you'll be able to deliver it. And by the way, you won't be able to deliver it unless you use AI in many aspects of your work life. So that's the piece that helps you actually get to hit those expectations of outcomes that you need to do and the velocity. But I'm very protective of my personal time with kids. Why did I have children if I'm not going to spend time with them? So those are part of the non-negotiables that I bring along with me in every single work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:47):\nFor people that maybe have trouble setting boundaries or just not good at this, anything, what works for you? Is it as easy as just telling people, \"Here's where I need to leave\"? What advice do you have for people to set boundaries like that?\n\nElena Verna (01:13:59):\nSo first of all, I would not think about it as a work-life balance. There's no such thing as balance. So balance feels like, \"Oh, I have enough time for everything.\"\n\n(01:14:05):\nI don't have enough time for anything, but I prioritize my family in some moments, I prioritize work in other moments, and I don't try to balance the two. I go where I'm needed and where I go, and I feel like I'm not going to regret the choices that I'm making today. So I'm constantly trying to put myself in the future and say, \"Will I resent myself if I make this choice right now?\" And if the answer is yes, I don't make that choice.\n\n(01:14:29):\nAnd sometimes I have to say no to Anton and say, \"I can't make it,\" or, \"I won't be there. I need to be here with my family,\" or, \"Today I need to cancel my day. My kid is sick and he needs me, and I need to take him to the doctor.\"\n\n(01:14:43):\nSo I think that just making in the moment, in every day, when sometimes in-the-hour decisions, to me, works better than trying to balance something that is completely unachievable and it feels overwhelming to even think about. But I prioritize this in my sleep, my health, my workout schedule, my kids, my family, my husband, and just my downtime because I know that I'm most creative once I have separation from work, because then I come in with all cylinders firing and I have so many more ideas about it. So to me, it's actually part of doing my best work is to take time off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):\nThat is really great advice. I want to touch on what it's like to work at Lovable because it feels like Lovable is at the cutting edge of what working in product is going to be. So you mentioned a little bit about how you're always talking to AI, asking questions. Is there any other kind of anecdotes of just how people operate at Lovable that is really unique or weird or funny or interesting that might be helpful for people to try in their company?\n\nElena Verna (01:15:43):\nYeah. I mean, we use Lovable at Lovable a lot. All of our internal tools are built on Lovables. We actually have our first hackathon on Lovable happening next week, where our entire company is just going to take full day to vibe code and see what we actually have happen. We prototype everything on Lovable. So our specs, yeah, we do still have a written spec, but it always accompanied by a lovable prototype that everybody can interact with and to click around with and provide feedback. And everybody bunches in and also does some edits if they have any better ideas.\n\n(01:16:16):\nSo I create mocks on Lovable. So for example, we need to make some pricing changes, or pricing page changes. I take a screenshot of our pricing page. I go to Lovable as I recreate this pricing page, make these changes, and then I send that to my engineering team saying, \"Hey, this is what I want to happen.\" And then they take it from there.\n\n(01:16:37):\nAnd ChatGPT, I use a lot for brainstorming, especially the deep thinking mode. I love it. It takes a long time, but it's so worth it. Sometimes it has crazy ideas. Sometimes it was like, \"Yeah, this is nothing new to me.\" So it's not interesting, but it gets me thinking and it gives me a look at the different angles.\n\n(01:16:56):\nAnd I use Granola a lot, for example, because to me, it's super helpful to get AI summaries of the meetings and it's very powerful for me. I use Wispr Flow a lot because I feel like I have no time to type anymore. So I just talk to my phone and talk to my laptop all the time in order to do it. But we're even thinking about all of the customer support automations that are done through AI. Every single aspect of what we do, question is asked, what can AI do here first, and then how we can add ourselves into the equation.\n\n(01:17:33):\nBut Lovable for us, having unlimited credits at Lovable is a pretty awesome perk, I have to say. I sometimes have to pinch myself. I'm like, \"I get paid to vibe code.\" It looks so fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\nFeel like that engineer, that vibe code engineer, he's actually getting paid to vibe code.\n\nElena Verna (01:17:48):\nHe has my dream job. I want his job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):\nYeah, exactly. Exactly.\n\nElena Verna (01:17:51):\nYeah, I got into the wrong line profession here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:55):\nOh, man. Okay. Is there anything else about Lovable? Because what I think about, actually, I interviewed the Perplexity founders back in the day years ago. Before we talked to anyone for advice, we first asked ChatGPT, and I was just like, \"That is the most insane thing I've ever heard. How can you possibly work that way?\"\n\n(01:18:11):\nAnd now that's how everyone works. And so I'm curious, I don't know how Anton works. Is there anyone else that's just way in the future of here's how things might be?\n\nElena Verna (01:18:19):\nSo for me, especially for product and growth, and even marketing in some capacity, when I have an idea in my head, it sounds so freaking cool. And sometimes I put it on paper and it's like, \"Ah, we need to do it.\"\n\n(01:18:34):\nAnd then I go and try to vibe code it, and I'm like, \"Oh, I don't see the magic anymore,\" or I can't envision it anymore.\n\n(01:18:43):\nOr sometimes I'm like, \"Yeah. Yeah,\" and there's more, there's more. So to me, it actually has helped really complete the ideation process for me quite a bit, because then I actually try to go and build it, and it breaks down some of the elements of what's important, what's not. So it's taking me on a product development lifecycle so much further down. And then it creates a much better communication vehicle with my engineers too, because I then can tell them exactly what's important and whatnot.\n\n(01:19:12):\nSo to me, it's been great because sometimes we envision things that are so much better than the reality. And before, until it hands it off to design, designers would do it for us and try to make it awesome versus I often stop my ideas in tracks super early on without pushing it forward. Versus other times I might've pushed it for too far too long, even through design queue or even pitching to leadership. And I find that very powerful because it calibrates me really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:44):\nAwesome. Okay. Last question. I want to talk about something that you've written about that I think it's a really important topic, something that we should surface, is you wrote this post called I'm Worried About Women In Tech. Talk about what you're seeing here, what you're noticing, what you think might be going in the wrong direction.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:00):\nYeah. There's actually conflicting data points about how women... You're talking about women, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:00):\nYeah, women in tech.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:06):\nWomen in tech? Yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:06):\nYeah.\n\nElena Verna (01:20:07):\nThere's conflicting data points about how women are keeping up with AI technology and wave, because there's a bunch of reports that has been done that show massive gap between women adopting AI versus men adopting AI, which points the story that men are just widening the gap of accessibility for technology. And whoever's adopting AI right now is getting paid the most, gets the most opportunities. I mean, we're seeing insane acqui-hires right now, where people are getting paid more for their talent than for the companies that they've created. And that's a really interesting trend that is occurring, and a lot of it is fueled on this wave of AI.\n\n(01:20:47):\nAnd women are not really present there. If you can think about one million-dollar acqui-hire that has been in the news that is a woman, I can't think of one. If you look at AI companies and their CEOs, most of it is men. If you look at the company's composition in AI companies, it's mostly men. To me, this really came to the head of when I came to Lovable, and I'm like, \"It's pink, it's purple brand. It's a heart. It's lovable.\" I'm like, \"I'm sure this is where it's 50/50 men versus a woman.\"\n\n(01:21:20):\nAnd although we don't collect this information, but just through third-party autofill, we saw it's like 20% at most. And I'm like, \"What is happening? Not again. Why is this, again, not being adopted by a woman?\"\n\n(01:21:35):\nAnd obviously I don't know all of the answers. I think that this is early on that we can shortcut it. And by the way, I also don't want to put this as a indication that men are to blame because I think men are doing wonderful job really spearheading the horizons and showing us what's possible and leading the charge. I'm just afraid that so many women are stuck in that latent majority that is just not catching up. And my worry is that it's going to affect the hireable talent. It's going to step us back again in the composition of the workplace, of the diversity. And maybe it matters, maybe it doesn't, like whichever side that you sit on. But I think that it needs to be built for everybody in the world, and for that, it needs to be built by a representative sample of people that are behind the product as well.\n\n(01:22:23):\nSo I just find it fascinating that even when the barrier to building has been lowered versus you don't need computer science degree, which I appreciate there's not that many women that are getting. We're still seeing the gaping gap on the adoption between genders, which, I don't know, there's something very frustrating about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:50):\nYeah. The thing that struck with me from your post is there has been a lot of progress being made in the last decade, and now AI is just kind of turning it all back, turning it all around.\n\nElena Verna (01:23:00):\nHopefully not. I think that we're early on enough that we can bridge the gap. I think sometimes women just need space and ability to discover it, and that's what we're doing at Lovable. We have this initiative, SheBuilds, where we create a hackathon for women only and we give them unlimited access to Lovable for 48 hours, and they come together as a community and they build together. And there's beautiful things that start to come out of it, which I've never anticipated before. But so many women in that hackathon for us build help with their elderly parents or with their kids or with the household or for their church group or for the kids' basketball team solutions, which have hyper-local, hyper-relevant, very needed for what they need in their life and something that was never been able to build before because of how expensive software was, because it would never going to become potentially a hundred-million-dollar companies, but it also doesn't need to be anymore.\n\n(01:24:01):\nSo I just want to bring women to build more and vibe code more so we can have more diversity in software that is even created because I think that we all have a unique take on what problems that we can solve, and I want everybody's voices to be heard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:17):\nI'll give the URL for SheBuilds. I pulled it up while you're talking, shebuilds.lovable.app.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:23):\nIt's fully vibe coded on Lovable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:23):\nThat's so cool.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:25):\nIs there a minimum viable product?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nMinimal Lovable product.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:28):\nMinimal Lovable product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:29):\nThere it is. So when is this happening? Is this December 15th, 18th? Oh, yeah, it's coming up.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:33):\nYeah, we're running it constantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nCool.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:36):\nSo our next cohort starts December 15th, but we're going to have more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nNow or never. Sweet.\n\nElena Verna (01:24:41):\nWe're planning a massive one on International Women's Day. So that's the one that if you can, come join us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nAwesome. Okay, so some glimmer of hope. I don't know if you saw this tweet where I tagged you the other day, or maybe it was today. I was looking at my most recent podcast video performance, and the top four are all women and they're all AI-oriented. And they're above Stewart Butterfield, founder of Slack, above Gamma's CEO, Grant, so maybe a glimmer of hope.\n\nElena Verna (01:25:10):\nYeah, absolutely. I think there's lots of glimmers of hope. I think we can just all lean in and make sure that nobody's left behind in this wave. And that's not to stop people that are marching ahead. This is just to open up opportunities for everybody around us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:25):\nAwesome. And we'll link to that post if people want to get a deeper perspective, what you're saying. Elena, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Is there anything else you want to remind people of before we get to your one-question lightning round?\n\nElena Verna (01:25:38):\nI guess the only other thing that I will share is for AI companies when it comes to hiring. It's really interesting, also, kind of the shift in the type of personas that end up being hired that I see. For me, at least it's quite different compared to anywhere that I worked before. And that is, there's this narrative going in the market always that new hires, sorry, new grads have no jobs in the market left because all of the entry-level jobs are automated.\n\n(01:26:07):\nI actually think that's quite false, because new grads, especially AI-native new grads... So it's very important for kids that are entering into the, I shouldn't say kids, young adults that are entering into the workforce that they really know AI, which there's another really big issue that our schools are not teaching AI students. So this is something else that we need to fix as a category, because otherwise we're literally setting up our young for a complete failure. But I think it's incredible to see some of those new graduates come in and what they're capable of doing.\n\n(01:26:43):\nWe have multiple new graduates at Lovable that are working, and I learned so much from them. And you need to obviously have the right atmosphere where people with experience, like a old guard like me, that can look at the new guard and really hear them and see them and really change the way that I operate based on how they do things. So make sure that you bring some of that fresh talent that doesn't understand any of the baggage that we came from and that can really look at the future in technology and what can unlock from a completely new lens. So highly recommend putting those into your team as little fireballs that are going to be sometimes hard to contain but can start the best initiatives for you forward.\n\n(01:27:32):\nAnd then it's also interesting that there's a really high demand for ex-founders now, for those people that truly have a lot of agency and high autonomy. So instead of just having people that have been working in the corporate world, the failed startup founders are now hot demand for a lot of these AI companies. So these personas that we traditionally would not prioritize in companies to hire are now becoming the hottest commodity and the highest-going talent, which I think is fascinating and is the wonderful thing that is changing how the culture inside operates.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:09):\nThat is really interesting and really empowering, just this idea that if you need grad, there's hope. You're not going to be out of a job.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:09):\nAbsolutely. Absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:16):\nAnd you might have an advantage. Yeah.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:18):\nYou have to lead with that. That's the thing. You have to lead with the things that you are capable of achieving, knowing what you have with AI, because that is a lot of people. Especially in traditional tech or in more traditional companies, they're looking for somebody to show them because it's really hard to figure it out on your own versus coming in and seeing and then copying.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:37):\nWell, Elena, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Because it's your fourth time, I'm not going to ask you all the questions I always ask you. So I'm just going to ask you one question. So Lovable is based in Stockholm, Sweden. I'm curious, just what's something you love about Stockholm that you weren't expecting? Is there a food, a restaurant? I don't know, something.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:55):\nWell, you always have to say Swedish meatballs. I mean, I've never liked meatballs before, and now it's so good here. It's so good. So every time, one of my meals here throughout the day involves it. But I actually really love their-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:11):\nIt sounds really good. I actually haven't yet.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:14):\nYeah. I don't know, they just taste different and they're-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:16):\nAnd they smell like the Ikea. It's not like the Ikea Swedish meatballs.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:19):\nWell, I have been to Ikea here, because that is a Swedish company too. It reminded me of in-person Amazon. It was absolutely incredible. Ikea here is next level. But food, Swedish meatballs for sure. Honestly, how clean the city is, it's kind of incredible. The architecture, everything is so built out. It's picture perfect like it's on a card. I don't know. It's different compared to most of the large cities that I've been at that are little bit more worn down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:49):\nSo fun. Makes me want to visit and get some meatballs.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:54):\nYeah, and visit during the summer. Otherwise, the daylight here-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:54):\nDuring the summer? Okay.\n\nElena Verna (01:29:56):\n... is really tight during the winter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:59):\nOkay. Good tip. Okay. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nElena Verna (01:30:06):\nYes. Please find me online on LinkedIn. Please feel free to follow me. Always engage on my post if you want to engage with me because that's the place that I always talk to people. I have my newsletter as well that baby steps compared to what Lenny has, but it's elenaverna.com. That's where I post most of my findings that I experience at my work. So if you want to continue seeing how my thinking evolves or the patterns that I notice, that's where to find me.\n\n(01:30:35):\nAnd how to be useful to me? Really pressure test my thinking because so many things are changing right now. I'm honestly not even sure myself of what is a pattern versus what is just a data point. So I'd love to just engage in as many conversations as possible and hear your opinions because that will help us as an industry just understand what is actually happening and makes more sense out of this whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):\nI'm just going to double click on your newsletter. Definitely subscribe to it. It's incredibly good. Everything we've talked about here, Elena has written about in her newsletter in large part and goes even deeper. It's just elenaverna.com. If you're reading this on your podcast app or YouTube, you could just look at her name and just type it .com and you'll find it, and subscribe and you'll be really happy.\n\n(01:31:17):\nElena, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing, everything I wanted it to be. Thank you for sharing. I know you have a lot of work to do, so I appreciate you making time for this and for joining us.\n\nElena Verna (01:31:26):\nThank you for having me.

  "transcript": "# Rethinking SEO in the age of AI | Eli Schwartz (SEO advisor, author)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou've noticed a significant shift in how SEO works with the rise of AI answers being integrated into search results.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:00:06):\nTransparently, I thought this was going to be an apocalypse. Up until AI Overviews, whoever won on that long form piece of content would get that first click. But now that doesn't exist anymore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nWhat should people do to be successful in this new paradigm?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:00:19):\nThink of SEO as a product. The product managers are the people that should be thinking about this SEO question because it's a product question. Product people need to think about how do we position this to the user that is not going to find out about this from a social channel, that's not going to be attracted by an ad? This is a user that's doing their own self-discovery journey. If you can't answer the question about what is it that someone's going to do a search on, then don't do SEO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):\nTo a lot of people, SEO is kind of this dark art.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:00:45):\nIt is not a dark art. It is simple. I think step one is the step that almost everyone misses on SEO, which is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nToday my guest is Eli Schwartz. Eli is a growth advisor specializing in SEO and has helped companies like Quora, Coinbase, Tinder, LinkedIn, WordPress, and Zapier develop and execute their SEO strategies. He's also the author of Product-Led SEO and has a very refreshing take on how to think about SEO and win at SEO. Recently, he's been spending a lot of his time analyzing how SEO changes with the rise of LLM chatbots, Google giving you the answers straight in the search results, and also how to utilize AI in your SEO strategy.\n\n(00:01:31):\nIn this episode, we dive deep into everything that you need to know to be successful in this new AI paradigm. As Eli shares in the conversation, Google is just now rolling out changes to how search works and is greatly increasing how many searches include an AI-generated answer at the top of the search results. So things are going to start shifting under our feed pretty quickly. If you're at all thinking about SEO, working on SEO, or are just curious about how search is evolving, this episode is for you.\n\n(00:01:58):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Eli Schwartz. Eli, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:02:16):\nIt's a real honor to be here. You've had some amazing guests, and I'm honored to be counted as one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):\nIt's completely my honor. You've been working on SEO for a long time. You've been helping companies figure out how to win at SEO for a long time, over a decade. And we were chatting about what's happening in SEO, and you told me that you've noticed a significant shift in how SEO works with the rise of LLMs, with the rise of AI answers being integrated into search results.\n\n(00:02:43):\nAnd so I thought it'd be awesome just to spend an entire episode talking about what people need to know about what's changing in SEO and how to be successful in this new paradigm of SEO with LLMs and AI being prevalent. How does that sound to you?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:02:57):\nThat's an awesome idea. I really like what's happening with AI in general for SEO because it's causing everyone that cares about SEO traffic, whether that's a PM or that's a CMO or that's a CEO, to really be forced into pivoting their thinking about what SEO traffic means because the tactics around SEO haven't really changed. It's always been the exact same thing.\n\n(00:03:23):\nMy last full-time job was out at SurveyMonkey, and I was moonlighting on the side. And I was introduced to a CEO of a big company and they were asking me about my approach to SEO. And I wanted to close it. I wanted to get this consulting engagement. And the CEO says to me, \"So essentially what you're telling me is I need to find my keywords, put that into content, and then build some links. Is there anything else you're going to do for me? Why should I pay you?\"\n\n(00:03:47):\nAnd it stunned me into silence because essentially that is and was SEO, and then that forced me to really pivot my thinking around what SEO might be. And I pivoted my thinking and I've worked with many companies around how they should think about SEO and what SEO traffic should mean, but others have not because those tactics did work. And LLMs and AI in general is forcing people to think again, how should SEO work? How should I be driving business from the search channel?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by Pendo, the only all-in-one product experience platform for any type of application.

Tired of big tech's same old list of links? It's time to try Brave Search. Visit brave.com/lenny to get started. That's brave.com/lenny. So just to set a little foundation, talk about just what is it that's changing in search and in SEO with the rise of AI answers and LLMs.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:06:52):\nSo essentially Google and other tech companies had their hand forced by OpenAI and ChatGPT. Google claims to have invented the concept of LLMs and they may or may not have, and some of the early OpenAI employees were Google employees. But ChatGPT came on the scene at the end of 2022 with this ability to ask any question and then get a written out answer. And suddenly people are like, well, I don't need a Google and click all these results.\n\n(00:07:19):\nSo there started this conversation of you don't need Google anymore. Google is ending. Even more than that, you don't need SEO. You don't need to optimize anything because the entire world will just be given to you. We'll dig into that. I don't think that's at all correct, and I don't think anyone, whether you're doing SEO as your full-time job or whether you're receiving SEO traffic as a part of one of your primary marketing channels, I don't think anybody has to worry about that.\n\n(00:07:47):\nHowever, Google was worried about it, and I think one of Google's primary stakeholders is really Wall Street. So if Wall Street suddenly thinks that Google is a has-been company and they're not interesting anymore and they don't want to maintain investments in them, their stock price goes down. And that hurts Google's ability to recruit employees. It hurts Google's ability to raise money and invest in all the interesting stuff they do.\n\n(00:08:11):\nSo Google has to satisfy the curiosity and the interests of the general world and general investor by saying, \"Oh, that OpenAI thing, we can do it too. That's not that big of a deal.\" So then Google responded, badly, of course, first, by launching what was then Bard. So they said, \"ChatGPT, look, we've got our own version,\" and they did a public demo. It didn't work out well at all and their stock price actually went down.\n\n(00:08:37):\nAnd then they fixed it and then their stock price went up. But they also had to have an answer to this concept of, is search dying? Does anyone need to search anymore when the entire world can just be given to you? So they launched what at the time they called SGE, Search Generative Experience, which is essentially ChatGPT in a search result. So they launched that, but they launched it as a beta.\n\n(00:09:01):\nAnd there were huge issues with what they were doing there because there's monetization issues. Everything they do comes from ads. The majority of their revenue comes from ads. So if you're going to show this AI answer on a search result, then you also can't have ads. You need to go all in on one of them. That was one issue which they actually have not solved yet. Another issue they had was liability.\n\n(00:09:26):\nSo if they have a generative response that tells you to do something awful, like I think there was one where it may or may not have been fake, a lot of people made some fake ones, that told you to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge. Are there liability concerns? Because Google now is the publisher. They're not a search engine that told you how to find out the answer to that.\n\n(00:09:43):\nThey told you to do it themselves. And the third issue there, which is another liability concern, is it plagiarism? So those are the things that they worried about. So they took about a year to test this thing, which was fascinating because we're tech people and most of the listeners are tech people. Google is very much a launch fast kind of company. They reveal something and then it sort of rolls out very, very quickly.\n\n(00:10:07):\nThey're not the kind of company that says we're going to launch something and then they take a year to do it. So AI Overviews, what was then called Search Generative Experience, launched at Google I/O this past year, in May of this past year, and they renamed it to AI Overviews. And it's that. It's essentially ChatGPT in a search assault. They launched it to great fanfare.\n\n(00:10:27):\nOf course, it was live right away. They said it was only going to be logged in users only in the US. Obviously they always have concerns about launching things in Europe, because Europe's a little bit more litigious than the US. And once they launched it, suddenly they started getting these screenshots of Google told me to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, Google told me to put glue on my pizza, which, of course, Google didn't do that.\n\n(00:10:50):\nThey just crawled things from around the web. I'm surprised that Google didn't predict that because the exact same thing happened with ChatGPT and Google is much bigger and a much more interesting target for people that want to share those things in social media. So Google launches it, and that was a little bit embarrassing, so they rolled it back somewhat.\n\n(00:11:07):\nBut what's even more interesting is they've given up on this rollback. Or not given up, they've gone back into it and they've relaunched it, and now it's on so many more search results. I'm seeing it on most of the search results that I see. And on top of that, non-logged in users are seeing it, so in incognito users or users without any history with Google are seeing it, and they've just launched it in the UK. So this thing is coming and it's really going to be affecting search results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:34):\nTo maybe help people understand why this may impact SEO, if it's not obvious, is it pushes results down. People get the answer right there. They don't have to click your links. And then there's also the sponsored links at the top of the page that already are pushing you down. So basically your stuff is harder and harder to find, right?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:11:54):\nActually, it's not that it's harder to find, your stuff becomes less relevant. And that's the part about SEO that I'm excited about. So SEO was exactly like that CEO said to me years ago, it's just about creating some content. And then it's just this race to the top of getting your ranking results on that top keyword. So years ago, I worked at a startup where we were in the automotive space and we wrote content about cars.\n\n(00:12:19):\nAnd a word we liked to rank on was cars. The homepage was ranked for the word cars. We bought tons of links, and we were just a cars website. Obviously that's not something anybody could expect to do now because you don't search like that. You don't search, \"Oh, I need to buy a vehicle. I'm going to use the word cars and see what comes up,\" because cars means a lot of things. Cars is a movie. Cars is a kind of car you drive. Cars could be a go-kart. It could be a lot of things.\n\n(00:12:46):\nSo no one's going to think about those search results. However, SEO is still geared towards those top of funnel, those big keywords that people cared the most about. So now a lot of those keywords are going to be moving into these AI Overviews. I don't want to just focus on Google, although I think Google's going to own the entire search page forever, at least for a very long time.\n\n(00:13:07):\nBut other engines, whether it's Perplexity or whether it's Claude or whether it's Meta, they all have this opportunity to give AI Overview type responses. That I think, those top of funnel kind of queries, are a great fit for what's going to come out as an answer. So if you're looking to go on vacation and you want a beach vacation, you can ask a very explicit question about give me a beach vacation that is not in America, but is a two-hour flight from X airport.\n\n(00:13:34):\nThat's the kind of thing that you could do in a Google search, but would take you a very long time to do. And those are great answers from just getting a paragraph. And then from there, you move into the mid-funnel. So now you do this query and Google suggests to you that you should go to Cancun. Or sorry, not Google, but whatever that answer is suggests to you that you should go to Cancun. And now you're in the mid-funnel and that's where SEO begins to matter.\n\n(00:13:59):\nSo the reason why I think this disruption is so big is because the journey changes, the discovery changes. So whereas before if you were a travel site and you were able to rank on best beach vacation within two hours of the United States, that's your ranking result. And then you have your long piece of content and you have your ads and you can monetize that.\n\n(00:14:21):\nThat all changes when you can still rank number one on that, but you're all the way at the bottom of the page. The AI answer, whoever that's from, whether it's again from ChatGPT or Google, tells you where to now start doing your deeper search.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:35):\nSo just to maybe mirror back what you're saying is the discovery step of search is going to be swallowed up by LLMs that give you direction. And then once you have a sense of what you want, then you go back to Google and that's where potentially the opportunity continues to remain.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:14:55):\nAbsolutely, and I think that's where things are good. That's where I'm excited by the user experience for search, because I don't think the user was best served by, I don't know, U.S. News or Forbes writing out where the best beach vacations are within two hours of the United States, with that piece of content that was written by a freelancer who's not a travel expert.\n\n(00:15:17):\nSo now you're going to get that information also from not a travel expert. You're going to get an AI summarized answer, and that will give you more clues and more ideas to do a deeper research search. I think that's where the user's best served.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):\nOkay, this is fascinating. Let's definitely spend more time there so people understand exactly what that means. Before we get into that and what people should do to win here, what impact have you seen on SEO and search results and the space of SEO as these things have rolled out? Have you seen numbers of like, this is declining, this is growing?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:15:51):\nTransparently, I thought this was going to be an apocalypse. So I shared about a year ago that it's going to be an apocalypse. We have not seen it yet, and a lot of people are declaring victory that there's no apocalypse because we have not seen it yet. However, this thing just launched in a way that I think it will start impacting traffic.\n\n(00:16:07):\nSo prior to the last couple weeks, it was not available on logged out search. It was only on logged in search. And even more than that, on that logged in search, Google had rolled it back significantly because of those embarrassing things that happened in May and June when they first launched it. They're only just now launching it broader. And I do think we're going to see impacts.\n\n(00:16:27):\nOf course, another challenge with pinpointing and impacts is they're rolling algorithm updates that are happening, which we'll also talk about, and that will mask what's happening. Because if you've been hit by an algo update and suddenly you recover from the algo update, you'll see more traffic, but you might have seen more traffic but on a lower base because these AI Overviews are changing things.\n\n(00:16:48):\nSo I think if you take all those steps back and you look at this from a journey perspective, there's no way that it won't be impacting search. It's just going to be hard to find. And there'll be certain examples where it is extremely prevalent, and there'll be others where it won't impact things at all. And I think the riding line is the journey. We're in the funnel that user is.\n\n(00:17:09):\nSo if you are WebMD and you're writing content about the human body, just generic content that has existed since medical journals were created, AI Overviews are going to be fantastic at giving you that answer. You have a headache and you're just like, \"Well, this headache's not going away. Should I take more Advil or should I take a nap?\"\n\n(00:17:29):\nAnd then you find that WebMD article and you get to page six and it tells you that 0.2% of people that have a headache actually have a brain tumor, and you don't need that anymore because Google can tell you you're good, you should take a nap and drink some more water.\n\n(00:17:43):\nWebMD was competing with Healthline and other, Cleveland Clinic and Dallas Clinic and all these other hospitals, and it's totally unnecessary to go and look at all these results and go through six pages of information about headaches. So a site like that will be impacted by AI Overviews. An e-commerce site, maybe not. It depends where in the funnel that user is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:07):\nAs you're talking, I was reminded of something that I forgot about with my own experience. I used to have a website called whenishanukkahthisyear.com, because it changes every year and it's just the date. That was the whole website. It gives you the date of Hanukkah this year. And I put ads on there and made 10 bucks a year, and then Google came in and just gave you freaking answers right inside the search result. So I've experienced this.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:18:30):\nSo it's even more than that. So what you are referencing is structured data. So that's a very easy thing for Google to tell you when is Hanukkah in 150 years from now? It's in a data set. What's happening now is Google's taking this unstructured data from content and building it into structured data. So you could ask a question of what is the likelihood of a baby needing to go to the hospital because they're showing this sort of symptom.\n\n(00:18:57):\nAnd again, instead of reading all that content and making a decision, Google could take all that unstructured data, not just Google, again, ChatGPT or Claude can take all that unstructured data, and give you a statistic based on everything they've read. And that's very helpful to users. And I think, again, users benefit.\n\n(00:19:14):\nAnd then a user might find out there's another piece of information where I'd actually like to read a medical paper, or that now I'd like to Google and find the closest doctor to me who has certain hours. That's a Google search. That's not an LLM AI search.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:26):\nAnd just to clarify, I didn't intend to say that that was AI oriented. That happened a decade ago. So yeah, I totally, totally agree.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:19:36):\nWell, I just thought that was interesting to really drill into the difference between structured and unstructured, because unstructured is actually where Google is disrupting everything. So this entire idea of SEO, again, up until 2022 was monetize unstructured data. Whoever wrote the longest piece of content on best beach hotels in Miami and then built the best links to it, they would win.\n\n(00:19:59):\nThey win whether it's ads or win whether it's hotel bookings. Now, Google can start you off at the top of that and say, \"These are the best beach hotels based on all the people that have written content,\" or actually Google's own unstructured data from the reviews and give you that. And then you can say, \"Okay, I'd like to go to this hotel, or I'd like to stay in this city.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:19):\nSo help us understand even deeper this distinction between top of funnel and mid-funnel. So when people are maybe winning at one or the other, what does that look like? What are some examples of like, here's a top of funnel type of search that Google's going to eat and here's a mid-funnel experience that you can win that?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:20:35):\nSo in general, SEO has always been more at the top of the funnel generally, because you're curious about something. So let's say you're looking for a new software. You're looking for new podcasting software. So you search for top podcast tools, and you get back a list on let's say G2. G2 and all the sites like G2, like the Gartner sites like Capterra, all going to be massively disrupted. So you would get back a list from G2, which would give you out all the software.\n\n(00:21:05):\nAnd you would look at some and it would say, \"This one's geared towards enterprise. This one's geared towards small podcasters. This one's free,\" and then now you've narrowed down your list to these three tools. And that's when you start doing those searches. Now you're mid-funnel. Now let's say you've chosen Riverside and you've gotten enough information from those other searches. Now you start searching Riverside price, Riverside capacity, Riverside bandwidth.\n\n(00:21:29):\nThat's bottom of funnel, and that's where you'll now go buy Riverside. However, at the top, you were doing top podcast tools. So again, up until AI Overviews, up until this entire concept of LLM, whoever won on that long form piece of content would get that first click. But now that doesn't exist anymore. You just go to Google and Google tells you, \"These are the tools. Oh, you're looking for a new CRM? This is what a CRM is. You want to know, do you need a CRM or do you just need a calendar?\"\n\n(00:21:59):\nLook at that and Google will just tell you in a paragraph, and now you've redirected your search somewhere else into middle of the funnel. So I think that's where SEO always should have been because that's where conversions could potentially happen. However, SEO never was there before because the way most SEO measures its performance and its success is rankings. So they would say, \"Well, it doesn't really matter if we convert on the word CRM. But look, we're number one, so we're winning.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:24):\nFirst of all, as a user, this sounds great. I'm so tired of just all search results just being a bunch of SEO pages, just with a bunch of BS answers. And so I really prefer, Google, just tell me. Just tell me what I need to know. The other piece is if you really think about what Google has been trying to do, they've been trying to do this is like, here's our best shot at giving you an answer to this question, and here's links that'll point you to an answer.\n\n(00:22:47):\nAnd this is just a better version of it where it takes all the actual information and just gives you the end result. So it makes a ton of sense that they're doing this and the technology has finally allowed them to do this. Okay, so let's get to the, I don't know, $64,000 question, million dollar question, what should people do? What should people do to be successful in this new paradigm that as you're describing is in motion?\n\n(00:23:09):\nIt's just starting to now happen. And it may be catching people off guard because they've thought it's already been out and things are okay, and you're saying it's actually starting to actually move quicker.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:23:20):\nI think it's fascinating, I'm honored to be one of the few marketers on your product hard test, but I think of SEO as a product. And I think the product managers are the people that should be thinking about this SEO question because it's a product question. There are users that are coming in from the search channel. What is the product that I need to create for them?\n\n(00:23:42):\nWhat is the experience that I need to create for them? So typically, it was thought of as a marketing challenge of the product people have created this thing for me, and now I expect the marketers to go and do the SEO thing for it. But there's a mismatch. So for example, I find very often when I talk to SaaS companies, I don't think SaaS in general should do SEO.\n\n(00:24:04):\nBut very often when I talk to SaaS companies, they have created a product for whatever user, and then the marketers are expected to make that product fit into the thing that the search results are around. And it doesn't work because that's not what they're looking for. No one asked the question of what it is that they're looking for. So now that SEO is changing and you really need to think about this mid-funnel and you need to think about a user experience and a buyer experience when they're doing the search, I think it all comes together.\n\n(00:24:35):\nAnd this is where the product people now need to think about how do we position this to the user that is not going to find out about this from a social channel, the user that's not going to be attracted by an ad, the user that's not going to discover this tool from a trade show. This is a user that's doing their own self-discovery journey, and this is what is the thing they're looking for and how do we position this product in a way that they're going to find it.\n\n(00:25:00):\nSo that's what everyone should be doing, product really collaborating with marketing and discovering what is it that the user wants and showcasing that. I was recently talking to a company in the health space. They have an app. It's a health app. And we talked about their marketing. Their SEO in general was they write thousands and thousands of blog posts. AI has allowed them to do things they should never have done.\n\n(00:25:25):\nThey wrote thousands of blog posts about health in general. I told them they shouldn't do that in general, but they wanted me to experience their product. So they gave me a code to download their app, and their app is awful. It's a bad product. So they're trying to do marketing that doesn't fit for a product that doesn't do the thing they say it's going to do. If they fix the product and understand the user, now it becomes, well, if I'm a user looking for this product, what are they looking for? How do we showcase that, again, in the mid-funnel?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):\nCan you help us make this even more real? Maybe go through an example of a product you worked on or one that's doing this really well in terms of going from, hey, they want our product. What's the journey look like? What's a good example of that?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:26:10):\nSo the earliest example of where I discovered on this process was about 10 years ago, I met the CEO of Zapier, Wade Foster, and he was a co-worker of mine. I had invested in this company, and he asked me to meet with him to just discuss SEO. They were doing something that no one needed. They had this product which zapped things together, but no one needed it because they didn't know it existed. But people knew that they needed things to work together.\n\n(00:26:38):\nThey just weren't looking for Zapier. So in my discussions with them, in our SEO experiments that we came up with, we said, well, people are looking for let's say Gmail and they're looking for Salesforce. They know that Gmail doesn't connect to Salesforce, they know Salesforce doesn't connect to Gmail, but they're looking for ways to pair it together.\n\n(00:26:56):\nSo what if we created as a product a marketing way to showcase that this product of zapping Gmail to Salesforce and Salesforce to Gmail exists? And that's what we did. So we built that at scale for everything that could work, and that was the experiment that I did with them, where everything would be available and it creates this flywheel of, wow, if Gmail can work with Salesforce, what else does Gmail work with?\n\n(00:27:21):\nCan it work with this other tool I have? And that's a, again, early example where I stumbled upon this idea of people are looking for that other thing that you could do, showcase the fact that your product could do this thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:33):\nI had no idea that you were involved in Zapier's SEO work. That's one of the most legendary successes of SEO. Very cool.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:27:40):\nTotal accidental. Whenever people ask me about programmatic SEO, and I know we have to dig into that, what programmatic SEO is, they're like, I want to imitate Zapier. It's always great to mention that I helped through that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:53):\nThat's amazing. Okay, so the lesson there is you realized that the key, the opportunity is to teach people what they could accomplish with this product. There's this awesome product doing amazing things. They have a need they're searching for, say it's like Gmail and Salesforce, and how do we help them see there's something really interesting here.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:28:12):\nYeah. I actually have a better one for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:14):\nGreat. Let's do it.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:28:17):\nSo I worked with Tinder for a couple years. One of the biggest challenges I ever had with SEO, especially as a consultant, is getting things done. And I worked with amazing companies and there's great people, but then they run into this wall. In my book, I talk about one of the earlier stories I had of this where I worked at a company where I was hired by the CMO and we built out a great plan.\n\n(00:28:41):\nAnd then we go to the CEO who brings in the CTO to discuss our plan, and the CTO says, \"I don't have engineers for this. So you decide whether you want to work on the product or you want to work on this marketing thing you've done.\" And then we didn't do anything because they never resourced it. But I worked with this really great product person at Tinder, Udi Milo. He was the chief of growth.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:29:00):\nAt Tinder, Udi Milo, he was the chief of growth, and he really saw a problem where Tinder had never done SEO. All of Tinder's inbound came from the word Tinder, and he is like, \"There has to be upside for SEO if they've never done it before.\" So that... he was convinced of that. He was willing to drive forward on this idea. So when we started working together, the first thing we came up with is what is someone going to be searching when they look for Tinder? And it's not online dating. That's a single word.\n\n(00:29:31):\nWe're not going to write out long-form content around everything related to dating because that's not the Tinder product. You're not reading a piece of content about how to fall in love and then somehow converting into Tinder. But in our user research and in the discussions we had on what the investment we can make into SEO was we discovered that Tinder is a loneliness-solving problem, loneliness-solving solution. So you're lonely, you've gone to a new city, you don't know anybody you'd like to solve your loneliness problem. So because you're in a new city, it occurred to us that this is a local thing. So we're going to look for anything related to local. So what we built out is if you look for online dating in many cities around the world... This is beta. It remained in its beta state, but if you look for online dating in many cities around the world, you're going to find a Tinder page, which gives some examples of places you can go on a date. And more than that, it gives you Tinder as a solution to solve the loneliness problem you have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:32):\nSo what changes here with the rise of AiO reviews and things like that? Is it this is where... this is how future of SEO looks versus just keywords and endless block posts.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:30:45):\nActually nothing changes here with AiO reviews because if you're looking for, you've gone to Dubai. You've just... You've gone to Dubai. It's a brand new country, you've never been there before, and you're lonely. So you look for online dating in Dubai, and you're going to get... Again, AiO reviews might tell you what the dating scene is like. It might tell you where to go on great dates.\n\n(00:31:05):\nHowever, it doesn't allow you to solve the loneliness problem you have. The loneliness problem you have is a mid or bottom-of-funnel problem. You're still going to click on Tinder's result, no matter what the AiO review does. So that's where I think SEO should be is you need to be in the buyer journey with the SEO you're creating. And it doesn't matter what AiO reviews does or doesn't do because you're still solving the mid-funnel problem with your SEO solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:30):\nLet's go in a direction I was going to say for later, but it might be useful now, which is, say, somebody's just sitting there at their desk thinking, \"Hey, I want to be... I want to start doing some SEO. I want to be successful at SEO. Haven't really done a ton here.\" With this new world of AI and LMs, what would be step one, step two, step three to move down a direction of starting to poke their toe in the water of SEO?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:31:54):\nI think step one is the step that almost everyone misses on SEO, which is be the user. Try to understand who your user is. And there've been so many companies, and SurveyMonkey was a great example. One, I spent seven years at SurveyMonkey, and when everyone got onboarded at SurveyMonkey, they gave you a SurveyMonkey account and told you that you should run a survey. I think later, in the later years, they forced everyone in their onboarding time to use a survey... run a survey with people in the company, but before that, no one did. So they had this account, and they never did a survey. So they had zero customer empathy for why people use the tool.\n\n(00:32:31):\nAnd then, when you think about it from a product and marketing standpoint, you're thinking about it as a work challenge rather than a customer empathy challenge. So the first thing anybody should really do around anything that they're trying to do SEO is try to be that customer. So if I am a user of this SaaS, I'm building SaaS, and I want to market this tool, what is a user going to look for? What's the problem they're going to look for that would make them want to do a search? And earlier, I referenced that I don't think most SaaS tools should do SEO. And the reason is because a lot of times, when I talk to SaaS companies about SEO, I ask them this question, and they give me a blank stare.\n\n(00:33:09):\nSo if you can't answer the question about what is it that someone's going to do a search on, then don't do SEO because SEO is about appealing to that user. If you can understand what the user should do around looking for whatever product you have, then that's the first step for SEO. So who is this user? Who am I marketing to? You're sort of creating this persona in your mind. Step two is think about the asset you're going to create. So pivoting over to what he talks about Tinder. So we understood that it was a user that was solving a loneliness problem any in the world because that's what Tinder does. It solves that loneliness problem in any way you want, of course.\n\n(00:33:47):\nAnd now we had to think about what is it that we're going to create. We know it should be global, of course. We would know we want it to be programmatic, which is something we should dig into like difference programmatic versus editorial. We know we want to be programmatic because no one wants to in position of writing a page out for every town or every city or every neighborhood in the entire world. So we want it to be programmatic. What things do we need to pull into that? And then the third step is really building, and we're on a product podcast. Of course, to the product people, you're building the product for that SEO user. So where do you get those inputs? What does this page need to look like?\n\n(00:34:21):\nSo again, the reason I think SEO needs to be on product is because the inputs for SEO aren't the way many people think of SEO, which is a piece of content optimized for Google based on the keywords I've chosen. I think of it as a product, which means you need design resources. You need engineering resources. Of course, you need a product manager to really oversee the building of this. You need user research. So it's, again, more than just a piece of content. So going through those steps, again, it's understand who your user is, decide what it is that you need to create for that user. And the third is envision this product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:55):\nSo I think there's a really powerful point here that might be... people might not get, which is the user needs to be thinking of something they will go to Google to search for to find your product.\n\n(00:35:07):\nSo it's if they're... if nobody is searching for the thing that you're building in some way, there's not going to be an opportunity for you to win an SEO or and benefit from SEO. Are there any examples that come to mind to you of B2B, SaaS companies that just like, \"This is not... There's no SEO opportunity here, just like no one's searching for this thing.\"\n\nEli Schwartz (00:35:27):\nMost of them. [inaudible 00:35:30]. One of my first consulting clients, right, when I left SurveyMonkey was Mixpanel. So, I mean, I just left my job, and I'm going to take any client that I have. I have some awful clients that I took, but Mixpanel was not an awful client. It was just an eye-opening client where we're trying to do SEO, and I'm doing SEO and exactly the way that CEO had told me SEO should work, and he was going to do it himself. So I told them the keywords. We came up with the content. We built the links. We did all the stuff SEO was supposed to do, and it didn't work. And we were sitting there, and I asked them to show me the user journey. They have a tool that does it. That's what Mixpanel does.\n\n(00:36:06):\nSo someone clicks on a search result and they land on this piece of content, which we did research and we know what people look for, but why is it that it doesn't convert? And then I realized that there were other problems to this conversion, which is Mixpanel is a product you integrate in your entire company. You don't just do a quick Google for it and be like, \"Oh, analytics. Yeah. I'm going to tell everyone we got to do it and it's going to be live tomorrow.\" Also, Mixpanel is expensive. So again, it's the kind of thing that there's friction of. You don't just click from a search result and then decide to just purchase it. You can't even purchase it on your credit card. I don't believe.\n\n(00:36:39):\nSo those are the issues, and that's why I think SaaS is not the best fit for SEO because if you think about that journey, the problem doesn't necessarily exist. The SaaS solves the problem, but only once you know that problem exists. And getting people to know that problem exists is typically not an SEO challenge. It's typically a brand challenge. You make a viral video of you didn't realize that you could use this tool we've created to solve your problem, but no one is necessarily searching for a problem they didn't know they had or a solution they didn't know could exist. So that's where the breakoff is. And then the other issue, of course, is now they know the problem exists, but it's not an SEO journey.\n\n(00:37:20):\nSo I had another eye-opening experience early in COVID when I was... everyone was home, and there wasn't a lot of things to do. Google reached out to me about a role on their team on Google Cloud for doing SEO. And there wasn't a chance I was going to take it, and it seemed like an interesting thing to go through a hiring loop and stay at home. So I had a fascinating experience interviewing because every time the... first it was the hiring manager and every time it was someone on that team that started the interview. They said, \"Are there any questions that you have for me?\" And then I spent the next 45 minutes asking them all the questions like, \"Why are you doing SEO? What kind of keywords would you want to do? What does this SEO journey look like?\" Because for Google Cloud, they only have two competitors, Amazon and Microsoft, and no one is going to do a search and be like, \"Oh, Google's number one for this term I searched. Let me just go buy it.\" There's a decision-making process. You bring... There's a committee decision. So SEO sort of made no sense for that even to be included as a part of a marketing channel. And at a grand scale, Google Cloud should not be doing SEO. At a small scale, a lot of SaaS tools shouldn't be doing SEO because there isn't necessarily an SEO journey. I get a lot of pushback from companies when I tell them. They're like, \"Look at all the SEO we've done.\" But that plateaus really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:36):\nThis is really fascinating, and just to maybe reframe what you're saying because there's kind of a couple elements of this. It's not necessarily that people aren't searching Google for the problem. So I'm thinking of Vanta SOC 2 stuff. It's not like people aren't SOC 2 certification. It's not like they're searching... they're not searching.\n\n(00:38:55):\nAnd what I'm hearing is the bigger issue is they will never buy your product from that experience and that journey. It may educate them a little bit and may teach them, \"Oh, Vanta exists,\" but they're never going to become customers. They need to talk to salesperson. They need to involve bunch of stakeholders. So it's basically a sales motion. It's not a product-led SEO motion.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:39:14):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:14):\nIs that right?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:39:15):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:16):\nCool. Pulling on that thread a little bit further beyond maybe even B2B, just how does one decide if SEO is an opportunity for you, and also just how much should you invest in this opportunity just to explore it?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:39:28):\nSo we have to really put away the myth that SEO is free because it's absolutely not free. There's a cost in time. There's a cost and resources, and, of course, there's the direct expense for SEO. So if you're deciding that you should do SEO, so now we have to go through this evaluation. Again, this is where I think of it as a product where you have all these product ideas and what should you spend time and money on. So SEO is a channel you may or may not want to invest in.\n\n(00:39:54):\nSo say there's a SaaS tool, and they're convinced there's an SEO journey, people do search for this solution. When I was at SurveyMonkey, we generated a couple of hundred million dollars a year off of organic traffic because it was a freemium tool where you search for the prodem... the problem, you find the solution, it's free, you sign up for it. If it works for you, you end up paying, and that's the revenue we've generated from organic. So say there is a journey, so people do search for it, and it makes sense to invest in SEO now is when you'll decide how much should you invest in it and how you should invest in it.\n\n(00:40:30):\nSo typically, [inaudible 00:40:32] again, for SurveyMonkey, it was around creating content. It was around templates. It wasn't very expensive. But let's say there's a company that does not have a content team. They don't have a product yet that people are going to search for. They don't have a product manager that's going to be overseeing this SEO process. So say you need to hire this PM, or you want to hire an agency, a typical SEO agency, I mean, you're not going to spend $500 on an SEO agency. It's going to be upwards of $10,000 just because that's the cost of someone's time.\n\n(00:41:01):\nSo it's $10,000 a month, $120,000 a year, gets even more expensive if you have a full-time employee. So that's one expense you're going to outline. Then, you're going to add in all the supporting resources. You need a CMS. That costs money. You need an engineer to support them. That costs money. You need a potentially design. You need content. So it can really add up quickly. And now you look at that investment, and you say, \"For this tool, if I invested a million dollars a year in SEO, do I expect to make back a million dollars a year soon, right?\n\n(00:41:33):\nSEO will always make back money if it's the right fit, but soon. So SaaS tools, especially startups, they need to make that money back soon. Or if they took that exact same million dollars and put it into brand ads, or they put it into influencer campaigns, or they put it into just traditional paid marketing on Meta and Google, would you make that million dollars or $1,000,001 back faster?\n\n(00:41:56):\nAnd that's where I think the evaluation should happen instead of this default, \"Well, I just got my funding. I need to invest in SEO because it's free, and everyone does SEO. And look, my competitors do SEO.\" It should really be this thoughtful strategic decision-making process of how much will this cost me all in and is this the right use of funds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:16):\nAmazing. So I think this is really important. It's not that you won't benefit from SEO. It's not that SEO isn't an opportunity. It's that you have much bigger opportunities in other areas. Most likely, if you're a B2B SaaS companies, because the journey isn't fully online, you're not going to convert by just reading a bunch of pages.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:42:34):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\nSuper fascinating. Yeah.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:42:35):\nYeah. There was once a company I met, there was a SaaS tool, they were in a gardening space. [inaudible 00:42:39] they made a SaaS for gardeners, and they were insistent on doing SEO. And they asked me to look at a proposal they got from an agency for $15,000 a month, and it was all content. And then I asked them how their users found them. How did they get all the customers they had that paid them? How did they find them?\n\n(00:42:55):\nThey said they go to these gardening shows around the country, and they have a booth, and each booth costs them $10,000. So I said, \"Instead of spending $15,000 on SEO, you can get... you can go to all these shows for the exact same budget, and you get users who are interested, they're in market, they try your tool out at the booth, and then they leave and they're leads that you could follow up with. Instead of investing in me like, hope it works. It's sort of free. There are searches for it, but it's not the right searches.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:26):\nThe takeaway here is if you're thinking about whether SEO is worth an investment for you and you see all these other companies doing SEO winning with SEO, think about how much will this actually cost us. And I think the most important takeaway for me here is if you don't think it'll convert online if you think sales is the core motion of the process, it's probably not a good ROI for you.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:43:49):\nAbsolutely. Yeah. Really think about what are the trade-offs. Again, from a product standpoint, there's always trade-offs. So what are the trade-offs to investing in this channel versus another channel?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:59):\nAnd I think what I've seen, there's all the... the way I think about it, there's four actual growth engines... there are four core growth engines. SEO, paid, virality, and sales. And what I find is, eventually, large companies do them all. Unless you're a consumer, you don't do sale. And so it's not like SEO should you never do. It's I think the main point here is earlier stage, when you have limited resources, probably not the best use of your time.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:44:22):\nI think there are companies that should probably never do SEO. [inaudible 00:44:24] going back to what I said when Google Cloud, I don't think that Google could ever say... really pinpoint that there was a customer that they got purely from SEO, and you're going to do all sorts of weighted attribution. And maybe that person did discover Google Cloud from a piece of content or piece of SEO asset, but they never would've converted with all those other things that they've touched.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:45):\nAnd it's not like you're saying, \"Don't be on the internet and don't will make it easy for people to understand who you are, don't have a great site, don't have other pages writing about you. It's just don't... You don't need to spend time optimizing the search results for Google Cloud. You're not going to benefit significantly from that work.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:45:02):\nYes, I mean, again, go really digging into this user journey piece. I don't think restaurants typically should have a website. Not only should they not do SEO, but I don't know that they should have a website.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:12):\nHot take.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:45:12):\nBecause if you think about the buyer journey for a person looking for food, they don't typically go to a website. So if you're looking for pizza, and again, a lot of pizza shops have websites. But if you're looking for pizza, you're going to Google Maps, DoorDash, Uber Eats. You're not going on Google and saying, \"Pizza near me,\" and then browsing the websites and just making a decision about where to eat lunch.\n\n(00:45:35):\nAgain, if you're choosing how to cater your kid's birthday party, that might be a different thing, but you're not browsing and saying, \"These are the places I'm going to go right now.\" But more than that, it's expensive, and there's no way that that pizza shop knows that the website they have with the soft music playing and their menu that comes up in flash, which is expensive, does a single thing for them. Most of their orders are going to come again through those other platforms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:59):\nYeah, I hate restaurant websites. One thing I read once that explains why what restaurant websites are so bad is restaurant owners are big on just like what is the experience when someone enters my restaurant that they go through the vibe, and they do that on the website. They're like, here's the music, and here's the imagery, and here's the animations.\n\n(00:46:18):\nAnd nobody wants that in [inaudible 00:46:19] on their website. Just like give me the hours and location and your menu. You mentioned a couple of things that I want to drill into a little bit. So, one is just how long SEO should take for you to see results. Two is just expectations of what does good conversion look like. What does it tells you this is actually us, a journey that could work for us well enough that SEO might work? So maybe those two questions.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:46:40):\nSo those will be custom for anything. And I hate to use the word, it depends because I think whenever consultants say it depends, they're just... they're throwing their hands up and saying, \"I don't really know. I'm not... I don't have an opinion on this.\" And it's like when you go to a doctor, and the doctor's like, \"Well, it depends.\" I mean, you could be dying, or you could just... need to take a nap, right. So there's a custom answer here, and it comes down to what the company is and what the expectations are. So how long it takes, that depends on what you're building. So if you're... if there's an... Again, with Tinder, it took us a while to actually build anything.\n\n(00:47:15):\nSo it took us all this time to build for ideate them, build and then to see results. But once we built, and I love working with big companies that are well-known brands, because what we build, as soon as it's available on the web, it's like this turning a huge ship. It starts driving revenue and starts being super effective because it's there. Something didn't exist, and now it exists, and it drives revenue. Smaller companies, it may take many months before Google notices. It may take many months before the demand is there. With Zapier, I think it took them a couple of years before they even saw any results because nobody's looking for it. So it comes down to what it is that you're building and how quickly users will come and find and need that solution.\n\n(00:47:57):\nThen, as far as what the expectations are on conversions, that also is really depends on what it is that you're looking for. There's... Some companies are building media, and they [inaudible 00:48:09]... I mean, again, I think most companies should just not write a lot of content unless they're a media company. But if you are building media and you're monetizing that content from a media standpoint, so maybe it leads, maybe clicks off the page into leads, or maybe it's CPM advertising, so then your conversion is... what you're trying to do with SEO is get a lot of page views because the more page views you get, the more clicks off that page you get into something else. If you're a SaaS tool, then your conversion should absolutely be whatever a MQL should be.\n\n(00:48:37):\nSo you... And again, I think most people don't do this correctly with SEO. They used the wrong conversion metric, which is top-of-funnel ranking. \"Oh, I'm ranking. My SEO is successful. I'm number one for this.\" Instead of, \"How does this benefit me?\" There was a company I was working with, a SaaS tool. They're in a two-sided marketplace they worked with... in an HR space, so they only monetized one side of that HR space, but all the traffic was on the other side of the HR space. So when we were talking about their SEO conversion problems, I suggested that they delete all the content that was on the wrong side of that marketplace because they didn't convert at all.\n\n(00:49:14):\nAnd there's no... And this is a common misconception. People will think you get a benefit from traffic. Google sees, \"Oh, I get all this traffic from search. They think I'm a very good website. So even though none of this converts for me, I should have a blog because blogs are good.\" It doesn't really work like that. I mean, maybe if you're this massive website and I don't know, let's say, get millions and millions of visits, then you can build some sort of authority and some good experience in Google, and now you can launch something else, and you don't have to worry about needing to build up that authority. But generally, driving traffic to something that doesn't convert for you wouldn't be a good idea.\n\n(00:49:48):\nSo really understanding what is it that you're trying to do with SEO traffic, that's your conversion metric. So it could be MQLs, could be page use, could be dollar conversions, it could be people picking up the phone or watching the video, but it has to be some sort of conversion. So for a startup, it might mean that they... you're getting links. I mean, at a minimum, people reading your content deciding to link to you and give you social shares. That might be something you put in a pitch deck. Whatever it is, there has to be a conversion metric that matters for the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:20):\nSo just to give someone that's starting to do this something concrete to look at. When you come to a startup and help them with SEO, what do you usually track as a sign this is working that we should keep investing? What's... What are the couple metrics that you look at most?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:50:37):\nThe first is really understanding what is it that they care about. And rankings could be something they care about if someone else cares about it. So, for example, if they're going to put in their pitch deck, \"We're number one for this tool,\" and investors, they don't know that that doesn't convert. So that might be something that we should care about. They should be number one for that tool. If it's MQLs, so they just need people filling out lead forms.\n\n(00:51:02):\nSo really understanding who it is that they're trying to attract with SEO that's the metric we're going to use. And again, I don't know why SEO... this happens with SEO but not any other channel. No one doing paid marketing will ever say, \"This is how many times I'm number one on this search, or this is how many clicks I get, or look at how much I spent.\" There's really a, \"We spend this, and we're this efficient. This is what we drive from that.\" And SEO really needs that same rigor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:29):\nSo what I'm hearing is look at if you're in B2B leads coming in through SEO, track that, or rank potentially if that's like a vanity thing, you can show investors and you're saying traffic alone, because usually in decks I see and investor updates almost always the metric I see is traffic we're getting through SEO.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:51:46):\nYeah, total waste of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:49):\nAmazing.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:51:50):\nYeah, I mean, unless there's a reason for it. So if you're a media company and traffic means that that number keeps going up, then yes, it matters. But if you are driving leads and that traffic number goes up, you're not driving more leads from SEO. You're getting worthless traffic. It doesn't help the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:07):\nAwesome. Okay. Back to the question of just how long it takes just to give someone something here that they can tell... that can tell them when it makes sense to keep going or move on. Say you're just taking a shot at SEO, how long should you give it to make a decision this is working for us or not? Or is it always, \"There's always something here, keep working.\" How do you decide keep doing or not?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:52:28):\nWhen you're building out an SEO effort, and I'm going to keep going back to this, it's a product. So you're building out a product and you're creating milestones. So you say we're... it's going to take us this first month to ideate on what it is that we're building. It's going to... In the second month, we're going to build out a PRD for engineers to start working on. In the third month, they're going to start working, and they're going to ship this.\n\n(00:52:49):\nNow, if you start missing all those milestones, so I mean, this is a common problem in consulting in general, you miss all those milestones, and then some will say, \"What's... We've been working together for six months, and we have nothing to show for it.\" And you can point very specifically to all those milestones that were missed. So that's the result of not shipping or not meeting the milestones that the SEO didn't work.\n\n(00:53:11):\nSo as you're meeting those milestones, you can say, \"Well, we launched, and our expectation was that after the first month of launching, we would have X amount of pages indexed. Did we meet, or did we miss that milestone?\" And then you can say, \"SEO is working at a small scale.\" And I've seen in many companies it takes a really long time, but eventually, when you look back, you see this hockey stick, but while you're in it, you don't necessarily see that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:38):\nAwesome. Okay.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:53:39):\nOkay. Let me share an example of one that worked really quickly. So this was also an interesting one, and I was at SurveyMonkey, and I was introduced to the CEO of Quora, who was interested in doing more SEO. So Quora had never done SEO or never done SEO effectively from a product standpoint. And there were a couple of things I was able to recommend to them, and within three months they had quadruple traffic. So it really will depend on what is it that's holding things back. In Quora's case, they weren't showing any answers. So they were really pushing to get people to log in before they saw any answers.\n\n(00:54:15):\nSo I encourage them to show the answers. Yes, they were going to be giving way answers for free, but they were also going to be giving answers to Google. So that was number one. That they were able to quadruple traffic. And the second thing is they had no way that Google could navigate within the site. So when you came to Quora, and it's like this again, so they reversed the suggestion I made, but I think it was 12 years ago. So when you came to Quora, and when you come to Quora today, you see related questions. So you see a question and then there's related questions. And that's the way a bot or a human will navigate through the site.\n\n(00:54:48):\nIf they create a sitemap, they did this in the past, and if Quora's listening, you should do this again. If you create a categorized sitemap where you can say, \"These are all the questions on health and from the sitemap, again, it's HTML sitemap, not just an XML sitemap and way even a user can navigate through it. This is health, and this is health page one and health page two, and you can navigate through this entire site. Then a search engine can navigate through the entire site, and all of the questions and answers are discoverable.\" So when I made that suggestion to them, within a couple of months, they were able to quadruple traffic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:20):\nThere's so much here, and there's so many valuable insights. One that I think is really recurring that I think is really important to people is the point that you're making about your SEO content pages should solve... should be a product, AKA should solve problems for people as they're trying to understand the space and the potential problem they have.\n\n(00:55:39):\nSo correct me if I'm wrong, but kind of the advice you're sharing is there's less opportunity in just generating tons of blog posts that just have a bunch of content. And the opportunity is more things like Zapier and Canva with templates and Notion and Quora where it's just like, \"Here's the answer.\" It's just like actually help them solve the problem. And with that, \"Here's how our product [inaudible 00:56:03] help you solve that problem further.\" Is that...\n\nEli Schwartz (00:56:05):\nIt's really building a product around what the company is attempting to monetize. So Canva is building templates because then they're going on to monetize that templates by having other people build off those templates with upgrades and subscriptions. But if a company was... Let's say there was an enterprise version of Canva, and they didn't monetize those templates, so putting out a bunch of free content on the internet that just looked good wouldn't benefit. So it always comes down to what is it. What is the product that you want to use? So going to mention the templates did at SurveyMonkey, so the survey product.\n\n(00:56:39):\nIf someone looked for a template of a survey, they wanted to make a survey. So we were not a survey product, and we just monetized off the survey templates that would not have done anything for us. So copying someone else's version of programmatic doesn't do anything. And generally, doing programmatic for the sake of programmatic, so just to have content, wouldn't do anything unless that programmatic fed you into exactly what your product did. So Zapier, they did programmatic. It feeds you into making other zaps between different products. Tinder, we did programmatic.\n\n(00:57:11):\nIt fed you into, \"Oh, well, you would like to solve your lonely... We showed you that your loneliness problem is solvable in the city you're in. You have to solve that problem by downloading the Tinder app.\" And I've never used Tinder, only used it from a marketing standpoint, but [inaudible 00:57:26] Tinder gates you. So if you'd like to get the advanced Tinder experience, you have to pay. And again, they're... it's all part of that buyer journey, and anything you're building SEO for, it has to be a piece of that buyer journey. So programmatic, blog posts, anything you're doing, if there is no product journey for it, there's no user journey, it just stops.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:45):\nThat's an amazing clarification. So again, it's another point you've been making of traffic alone is not valuable if it doesn't convert. And so you can look at a Canva, you can look at Notion at Airtable with all these templates, copy that. But if that isn't the thing people, will buy from you and monetize it's not going to be worth doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:00):\n... Will buy from you and monetize. It's not going to be worth doing.\n\nEli Schwartz (00:58:04):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:04):\nAwesome. I'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:58:13):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems, like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:58:30):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema File Feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:52):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap, and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:59:04):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:23):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to OneSchema.co, that's OneSchema.co. Okay, so coming back to AI and its impact on SEO, can you use AI to help you with this, and use AI to create content for you?\n\nEli Schwartz (00:59:49):\nAI is a tool. Everyone says AI is a tool, it's not a solution. You can use AI to create content if the content you're creating is a part of that journey. For example, before AI content really came on the scene, because AI's been around for a while, Jasper's been around for a while, Writer's been around for a while before ChatGPT. Before these tools, a lot of ways that companies created content for cheap is they went on Fiverr, and they went on Upwork, and they just created content.\n\n(01:00:20):\nA lot of that content, completely worthless. If you're just creating content for the sake of content, and you paid someone on Upwork $50 for their content, now you can use an AI tool and just create the content, the same worthless content, for free. AI as a tool is a tool creating something that's not necessarily useful for the end journey of the company and for the user journey in general. However, if the content you were creating was pretty useful, and now you're using AI to create really useful content for cheaper and better, of course, you can use it.\n\n(01:00:53):\nAn example of a place you can use AI content is if you're an e-commerce site and you're selling your own products, of course, you can use AI content to write product descriptions. It's not a content website. There's a lot of big companies out there, and if anybody wants to look at some of the e-commerce sites and how they do SEO, a lot of them have large SEO teams. The typical JCPenney, the Nordstroms, the Macy's, they have a lot of content on their category pages, but if you look at the keywords that drive traffic to those pages, it's the products on the pages.\n\n(01:01:25):\nIf you're looking for shoes, the fact that a Macys.com page will have a lot of content about what shoes do doesn't do anything for the user. They're just looking for shoes, and then there's shoes on the page. I think Macy's actually ranks pretty well on those kinds of things. Using AI content to write more fluff content that's not necessary would just be a waste of time.\n\n(01:01:46):\nUsing AI content to feed in a product, and describe what that product is, and maybe some features of that product which help a user, that's not hurting your SEO, because what you're trying to optimize for is the product and the product name itself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:59):\nGot it. Basically, don't use AI to generate entire blog posts. I know people are doing this all over the place, but absolutely leverage AI to help you add to existing pages, descriptions, titles, things like that, which I can see why Google, Google would've no idea that you were helped to write this thing with AI, right, if it's just a small part of the page versus the entire page?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:02:25):\nIn their documentation, they say that AI itself is not the problem. It's the helpfulness, the usefulness of the content that would be a problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):\nYou don't have to name names or reveal anything, but do you know of a bunch of companies using AI now to generate tons of high successful pages, high converting pages in some way? In this way?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:02:44):\nThere's this hatred of AI content by users in general. I think once companies declare that they're using AI, people get upset about it. It was a Red Ventures company, I think it was CNET that said they were using AI to create content. I think they got in trouble because they said they're using AI to create content, but if they had not said they're using AI to create content, I think their entire model would've been very successful.\n\n(01:03:09):\nThere's no reason you can't take in, they take 10 products, and they want to review 10 different products. There's no reason you can't tie that all together, have AI write the original piece of content, and then have a human editor just review it. I don't know, years ago, it's not AI, but it's sort of like AI, but there are sports websites that will take in a lot of the things that happen in the sports game to merge it all together into a piece of content.\n\n(01:03:34):\nIf you look at any earnings reports on public companies, it's sort of the same thing. Their company will issue, they'll file their earnings report, and then now it's AI. Before AI, it was basically like Mad Libs kind of content. It would extract pieces of the earnings report and then it would write a blog post, which is actually fairly useful. I don't think there's an issue with it itself. I don't think users have an issue with it.\n\n(01:03:56):\nI think if you read that old piece of content, again, on earnings reports, it's pretty obvious that it wasn't written by a financial journalist, but it was useful. You got a quick summary, you didn't have to go into the SEC and read an earnings report.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:09):\nThere's this guy, Noah Smith, he's on Twitter, he's got a newsletter called No Opinions. It's awesome. He had this tweet about how we're approaching an age of a ton of slop of content, just a lot of really bad content generated by AI for better or worse, this is related to SEO, but it makes me think about just how much bad stuff we're going to see.\n\n(01:04:28):\nTo your point, it doesn't matter whether it was generated by AI or not, people will gravitate towards and Google will gravitate towards stuff that is useful and good, whether it's written by people or not.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:04:41):\nThis is a huge issue for Google, because the amount of content being created is enormous, and it's growing exponentially. Google's trying to crawl everything. They now have more content to crawl, which becomes more expensive for Google, and which is why you have this backlash by Google against many websites, because they're trying to clean the index to save their own costs and to protect the users from having to see this awful content.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:06):\nThe crazy thing for LLMs is now to be trained. They're trained on content on the internet in a big way, and they're struggling with not training their LLMs on stuff that AI has written because it becomes this, a bad direction that LLMs will go. They're trained on themselves. Anyway, something I wanted to come back to around AI, which is AI Overviews. I imagine many people are like, \"How do I get into that answer? How do I get my product into the answer that Google gives at the top?\" Is that something you recommend people try to do? Is that something you can do?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:05:42):\nI think of AI or AI Overviews as a branding exercise. Getting into the AI Overview, and Google has links, I mentioned this earlier that Google has links within the content, and I think a lot of what Google does is around potentially liability protection. They're having links. They're saying, \"Well, we didn't tell you to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge, this website, which we summarized, told you to jump off the Golden Gate Bridge,\" or, \"We didn't plagiarize. We just linked to the piece of content. We may have extracted more from the content than we were supposed to, and the law hasn't decided that yet, but we linked to it, so it's fair.\"\n\n(01:06:17):\nRight now, Google has these links in the content, and it sort of links off of it. I did a survey on LinkedIn, and I was surprised by the answer. I thought most people did not click on the links. I got a couple hundred responses, and it's sort of 50/50 and based on my SurveyMonkey experience. It's not a statistically significant survey in general, but it will never go to 99% and one. That's fairly indicative that people are clicking the links, which surprises me, because I don't think that the links are necessarily meant by Google to be useful, which means that AI Overviews is essentially duplicating search results.\n\n(01:06:53):\nYou have this AI Overview which summarizes, then you have a link so you can link off of it, and then beneath it, you sort of have the exact same thing. That's the challenge that Google has to work through. For a company to show up in AI Overview, it's a brand challenge. If your link shows up there, then you likely were showing up beneath it in the ranking results, so you've already done the work you're supposed to do.\n\n(01:07:12):\nIf you're showing up in the AI Overview mentioned as a brand, like, these are the top CRM tools, you're showing up as a brand, that means you've exercised brand efforts and it's working out. I don't know that companies necessarily want their content to show up because they're giving away their content for free. They want to be showing up in a way that benefits them. If you show up as a brand, you've done good branding, but if you show up as a link, it means Google has stolen your content, and people may or may not click off of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:41):\nAlong this lines of brand and SEO, do you have any... That's always this question of are we investing in brand? Do we just want people to be aware we exist, or are we trying to actually drive conversion? Any advice on how to think about brand building and SEO, especially with this world of AI?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:07:57):\nThe biggest myth in SEO is that you could just build links, and link building is the secret source and the secret sauce to growing your SEO footprint. That's totally wrong, because the way most people build links is they buy these guest posts, or they pay for links on low authority websites that sort of look like they might have authority, and it doesn't really benefit anyone because no one's reading these sites.\n\n(01:08:22):\nIt's funny that everyone complained about Google as this really, really smart, all-knowing LLM, and at the same time, they think they're dumb enough to fall for these guest posts that are on websites that no one really read. The right way to build links is to build a brand. It comes part and parcel of what you're trying to do. If you're building links, and going back to all the SaaS examples we talked about, so if you've created a bunch of content that is not relevant for the product you're trying to sell, building links to the content that doesn't really benefit the product, doesn't really benefit, the links don't benefit the product.\n\n(01:08:55):\nIf you can build this product that's awesome and everyone loves and wants to use, and you get not links, but mentions, and links might be mentions now, because the way a link before LLMs and the link 10 years ago was actually an HTML link. Now, Google can read content. They can say, \"Well, you've been mentioned here,\" that's pretty good. Now, we acknowledge that this might be the brand, and this might be the match for that kind of thing.\n\n(01:09:23):\nThat's helping to build that brand. In general, I think of any SEO effort as promoting a brand, building up a brand, rather than building a product, and then separately building out an SEO effort, which has content that may not be relevant, and links from websites that are certainly not relevant to content that's not relevant. It all comes together as being one big effort. The same thing you'll do on PR, you'll do for SEO.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:50):\nAwesome. Okay. I'm glad we touched that. There's a few other directions I want to go, so I'm going to bounce around a little bit and cover some of the other stuff I wanted to extract from your deep experience in this space. One is you've mentioned this idea of programmatic SEO a couple times versus editorial. Maybe first, just clarify what those two directions are, just for people that don't exactly know what you mean. Then two, what's your general advice for which direction to go, programmatic or editorial?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:10:19):\nIt might be obvious at this point, but I'm going to say it's dependent on the user, but essentially, what programmatic is is it's taking a bunch of data sources and building out a page that is a combination of all these data sources. In my book, I talk about two of my favorite programmatic SEO companies. One of them was created by a past, well, it's not created, the strategy was created by a past guest of yours, Luc Levesque, who introduced us, and that was TripAdvisor.\n\n(01:10:50):\nTripAdvisor took in all these data sources of, \"This is the hotel, these are the cities,\" and then it allowed UGC to combine into one comprehensive page about each property. TripAdvisor did not write a piece of content on every single hotel. They don't write a piece of content on, \"Here's this long form blog post as an influencer on the Waldoff Astoria of New York, and here's a long form blog post about the Marriott Marquis in San Francisco.\"\n\n(01:11:17):\nThey built it all from a programmatic standpoint. They took all these data sets, they took all the countries in the world, they took all the properties, and they merged into one comprehensive page, which has dominated the top of search results since the beginning of the time. They still own it. That team has cycled through many, many leaders, many different, a lot of different things, and they're still number ones. It's the strategy that has allowed them to build that brand and to dominate it.\n\n(01:11:43):\nThe second example is Zillow. What Zillow did is they solved an early problem many years ago in the real estate space, which is no one understood what the value of a piece of property was. Zillow took in all of those data sets. They got, some of them are government data sets, some of them are their own comparison data sets based on other home sales. The government can say a house is worth one price, and based on their comparison, Zillow can completely disagree with it.\n\n(01:12:11):\nThey're building in these data sets, and they're taking photos from realtors, they're taking neighborhood data, they're taking school data, and that's a programmatic SEO page. SEO is the only channel to bring in traffic to each one of these pages. They're not going to do paid traffic for my house, they're not going to do paid traffic for your house. The only way someone would find that page on Zillow, either they start at Zillow.com and then just navigate through it, or they Google it. Those are programmatic SEO efforts.\n\n(01:12:38):\nOn the flip side is editorial. Editorial would be, in TripAdvisor's case, writing out that long form piece of content around each hotel, each city, and all the things they've done. Zillow would be the same. Zillow would take 500 million properties and write out an editorial piece of content. Neither of those would be a fit for their model, and it would be extremely expensive. Say each piece of content would cost a thousand dollars, that would be cost prohibitive for anyone to do.\n\n(01:13:06):\nGoing back to my distinction based on the user, what is it that the user's looking for? Is the user looking for the value of a home? They don't need a long form piece of content. They need a piece of content or a page that just says what the value of that home is. TripAdvisor's case, they're looking for a single thing, a rating, or maybe they need some of that UGC, but really, they're looking for that rating. That long form piece of content, there's a purpose for it, but not on TripAdvisor's site.\n\n(01:13:31):\nUnderstanding, what is it that the user needs will help solve, do you approach this from an editorial standpoint, or do you approach this from a programmatic standpoint? Some of the companies I mentioned earlier, like G2 and Capterra, which are completely being disrupted, so they're being disrupted by editorial, but they're also being disrupted by Google itself with their AI Overviews.\n\n(01:13:53):\nIf you look for the top CRM tools, you have G2 or you have Capterra, but you also have Forbes writing out a long form piece of content on what Salesforce is, what HubSpot is, and that's probably unnecessary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:07):\nI think generally, you would, programmatic is the better path and the most common success path is what I'm hearing. What are things you need in place to be successful in programmatic SEO? Like basically, you just need some sort of data source that you own. Is that just... What's a checklist of like, \"Here's what tells you you have a big opportunity here?\"\n\nEli Schwartz (01:14:29):\nProgrammatic is the right solution when there's scale and when there's a user use case. If there is not, you create scale for nothing. An earlier version of programmatic, again, pre a lot of the internet companies now, is building out a piece of content for every single zip code in America. Say you offer some sort of local product. You would build out a page for every single zip code that is, in theory, programmatic, but users don't look for it, and Google has completely disrupted that with their own local products.\n\n(01:15:02):\nProgrammatic can always be something. I see programmatic mistakes all the time, where websites look at, they say, \"Look, we're making reviews of software. There's 10,000 different softwares in the world. We're just going to make out a page for each one and we're going to combine it with, I don't know, a city.\" You can make programmatic pages like that, but there's no use case. Really knowing what programmatic solution to use comes down to, \"Is this something that someone would actually be looking for? Does this page itself provide a solution?\" Zapier provided a solution because someone was looking for that combination, but there are many tools like Zapier, which try to be Zapier, but they're not looking for that solution. Going back to some of the template companies you mentioned, I don't think a lot of companies that make templates, they're making programmatic, but there's not a use case for every single one of those templates. They've made programmatic for no [inaudible 01:15:53].\n\n(01:15:54):\nAgain, SurveyMonkey was one where we had a fat head of templates we could make, but it wasn't a long tail. We could make a hundred templates, but we couldn't make 10,000.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:05):\nI want to do a rapid fire of SEO myths. Before I do that, I know that you spent a lot of time actually reading the recent ruling against Google and their whole deal with Apple, and you were telling me it revealed there were a lot of interesting stuff about their strategy and where search was going. Let's spend a little time here, just what did you learn doing that exercise?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:16:28):\nIt's fascinating. It's 286 pages. I basically read a book. It was a verdict.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:33):\nOh, geez.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:16:34):\nI would say that the judge or the clerk that wrote this verdict has a better understanding how the SEO works and how digital marketing works than most people I meet in digital marketing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:43):\nWow, I did not expect to hear that.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:16:44):\nYeah. This verdict explains how Google decides to rank a page. The verdict explains how the auction model works in ads, in Google Ads. I think that's fascinating. Talked about the comparison between social media. This court really understood a lot of the questions that were posed to them. For example, Google tried to say that they're not a monopoly because they're social media. The court analyzed that question and said, \"Social media is not a comparison to Google search.\"\n\n(01:17:12):\nGoogle tried to say a lot of the things they did were non-monopolistic because there's alternatives like Bing. The court really analyzed a lot of these things. Why I found it fascinating was, again, a lot of the testimony was public, is the summary of how the court put it all together in a verdict. A few of the things I learned is one, the market share, Google's market share. That's been a number that no one really liked to talk about.\n\n(01:17:39):\nGoogle would say, \"Oh, we think it's like 80%,\" because they didn't want to be viewed as a monopoly. Microsoft would say, \"Well, maybe we have 20%.\" I just found a recent document from Microsoft where they claimed to have a lot of market share in search. In the verdict, it says that Google has 98% of mobile searches. I forget whether it said that the court said it, and it said Google didn't disagree, or that came from Google's own documentation, but 98% of mobile searches.\n\n(01:18:08):\nThe thing that I thought was most fascinating from the verdict is how much the default partnerships that Google has contributes to Google's success. The plaintiff in the case was the Department of Justice suing Google for being a monopoly. However, I don't know what the word is, but one of the complainants in this is this company, Neva, which was a search engine started by a past Google, I think it was like a head of research or something. A senior person at Google created a new search engine.\n\n(01:18:39):\nA lot of the trial was focused on how Neva could not be successful, despite having a better search engine, despite having a better experience for users, because they didn't have any of these default distribution agreements. That's the part that I thought was most fascinating. Google has these default agreements with Apple, and they also have Chrome.\n\n(01:18:58):\nThey have all these inputs into Google searches, which means that I don't think there's a chance, and this is the biggest takeaway, I don't think there's a chance that ChatGPT, or Perplexity, or Claude, or any of these other LLM startups, because they're startups now, even OpenAI is a startup with Microsoft's investments, still a startup. I don't think they have a chance at really unseating Google purely from a quality standpoint.\n\n(01:19:27):\nThat's what a lot of the documentation in this verdict is about is how much a force of habit, how much the brand, and how much the distribution agreements Google has, drives searchers to Google. There were a couple of very interesting insights. One is that Bing tried to give itself to Apple for free, and Apple said there was absolutely no price that they would take to use Bing search within Apple.\n\n(01:19:49):\nAnother one was Mozilla had a partnership with, I think it was Yahoo, and they did a rev share deal with Yahoo, and everyone switched back to Google. When people say, \"Well, SEO is dead, everyone's going to go to OpenAI,\" and you just look at the 25 years of Google's existence and what they've built, I really don't think so. I really think distribution and the force of brand will keep almost everything Google has today.\n\n(01:20:14):\nNow, why is Google fighting back so hard to build AI Overviews? Well, I think there's two answers. One is, like I said, Wall Street. They really want Wall Street to think that they care and they're doing this thing. The other is losing small percentage points to ChatGPT costs Google a lot of money, so it's worth it for them to invest in it, but I don't think that they have any fear about not being the most dominant search engine in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:37):\nWell, isn't the idea with this trial that this may change, and they may lose that default status, whether it happens or not, that's the whole game here, right? It's like maybe they can't be that anymore, and that maybe opens up. I think that's the opportunity potentially.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:20:52):\nI don't think so. Yeah, I'm no legal expert. I don't know what the DOJ will do, but what's interesting, if you saw Google's press release when the verdict came out, so Google tweeted, \"We thank the court for recognizing that we're the greatest search engine in the world, and more to come.\" They're going to fight back, and it's almost like a bully being declared the world's greatest bully. They're like, \"See, told you we're strong.\"\n\n(01:21:15):\nWhen reading the verdict, it actually said, \"There is no competitor. Google is the greatest search engine. They have 25 years of great data. They've done a fantastic job.\" I don't see any way that those, if they break the default agreements, Apple actually loses all that money Google's paying, and then users will still Google. That's not what will do it. I think the only thing they can do is figure out how to prop up a competitor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):\nYeah. I think that's an interesting takeaway. People will go to Google, will switch to Google even if it's not default. There's actually a really interesting takeaway from Ben Thompson's analysis of this stuff, and I will point to the podcast episode. I think that shifted my perspective on this, because when you hear Google is paying Apple to be the default search engine, it sounds nefarious and unfair. The deal is actually revenue share. They give them a percentage of the revenue from the ads, which ends up being $20 billion, something like that, a lot of money for Apple. Anyone else can come to Apple and say, \"We will give you a revenue share of our searches also.\" It's just nobody is as big and can pay as much. If you think about it, why can't Google come to Apple? \"Hey, we will send you tons of money by doing the search for you and giving you a large percentage of the ads that we are doing for you.\"\n\n(01:22:36):\nIt's weird to not allow that if you really think about it, but it's also unfair, because no one else will ever be able to compete with that.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:22:43):\nYeah, and that's what the court said is like Neva didn't have a chance because of that. One other point is, so I did this survey, this was years ago when I was at SurveyMonkey, I did a search market penetration survey to figure out who used what, like Bing versus Google. On my survey, I was generous. I threw DuckDuckGo on there, and I came back, I had thousands of responses, and came back that I had 1% of people use DuckDuckGo.\n\n(01:23:07):\nI didn't realize it, that DuckDuckGo didn't actually know what their market penetration was. When I shared the survey, Gabriel Weinberg, who's the CEO of DuckDuckGo, hit me on Twitter and he said, \"Can you share the data with us? We really would like to see it.\" This was, let's say 10, 12 years ago. In the verdict, it said that DuckDuckGo's market share is 2%. I came back with 1% 12 years ago. DuckDuckGo, I think they raised a hundred million dollars.\n\n(01:23:33):\nThey have all these brand partnerships. They have, at baseball games, they have their logo, they've done everything, and all they've been able to do is get from 1% to 2%. There's a lot there, and Google being Google, I don't see anyone knocking them off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:49):\nFascinating. Well, thanks for sharing your takeaway so that we don't have to read this report. Before I move to rapid fire SEO myths, is there anything else along the lines of AI or SEO that you think is really important to share that you want to leave listeners with?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:24:04):\nI think the most important thing to leave people with is SEO is not dying. There will always be a world where users are requesting their own information. One of the reasons I think these home assistants, whether it's from Google, or Apple, or Amazon, have never taken off, is because you don't have choice. You talk to your Google, and it gives you only one answer. You talk to Amazon, and it gives you only one answer. Like, \"I want to buy toilet paper,\" and Amazon just buys you whatever it decides to buy you.\n\n(01:24:33):\nThere will always be a world where there needs choice. One other piece from the verdict is Google believes that we're in the very early days of LLMs, and even with all the machine learning they do and understanding users, you will always need real user data, which Google has on past searches. I think users will always be requesting their own information, and there's never going to be an AI that understands you so perfectly, it's going to know that for you personally, you would like to click result number five.\n\n(01:25:01):\nThat's the best fit for what you're looking for right now, which means that there always needs to be multiple choices to make. Yes, most clicks are probably going through the first one, two, or three results, but there needs to be seven, 10, multiple pages of Google, because some people do go to those other pages. I think that's the most important thing to underscore is that all of this means that search changes, a lot of top-of-funnel search goes away, but in general, there's always going to be a world where people are doing the searches.\n\n(01:25:33):\nThen the last piece on that really is when you're looking to do something with search, you're looking to take an action. Companies benefit from those actions. Say you're a hotel, and you want people to sleep in your hotel and pay you to sleep in your hotel. The aggregate number of people needing to take that action and pay you for it does not change even if search volume gets cut. If you're selling shoes, people still need to buy shoes.\n\n(01:25:58):\nIf you're selling information, though, your media, if you're WebMD, yes, your revenue declines, because that information that you now aggregated and curated and gave away for free in return for people clicking on ads, Google is now going to give away for free in return for no one clicking on ads.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:16):\nInteresting. I wonder if there's an investment arbitrage opportunity of predicting which businesses will decline with this and which will thrive. Anyway, I want to talk about SEO myths. I know that you have a few things, and we've talked about a few of these, I think, of just things that you know people believe about SEO, but they're actually wrong. Let me just ask you, what are some myths that people get wrong about SEO?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:26:44):\nProbably the biggest one we've said over and over is they even need to do SEO. There's this always default assumption that you've raised money, you have a marketing team, you should do SEO. I think that one is really worth putting to bed is think about that user journey. Should you do SEO? It's a question like, \"They ask about other channels, should you do brand...\"\n\nEli Schwartz (01:27:00):\nIt's a question like they ask about other channels. \"Should you do brand marketing? Should you take out an ad in Times Square?\" And no one will say, \"Well, I just raised a million dollars. I should totally take out an ad in Times Square.\" And congratulations on being in Times Square, by the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:15):\nThank you.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:27:16):\nNo one will just decide, \"Oh, I've got money to burn, let me just burn it.\" So somehow SEO becomes this thing of like, \"Oh, I've raised money. Now, I need an SEO team.\" So that's I think the first myth that's really important to just put to bed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:30):\nAwesome. What else?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:27:32):\nLink building. So link building is brand building. So it's thinking about how you're going to build a brand and have people mentioned to you. And when you're doing link building, you're creating a relationship between the piece of content that has linked to you and the product or whatever you're trying to monetize. So that should be link-building. Just getting the idea of getting links on... An HTML link will equal SEO success, again, I think that's completely wrong. And then I mean probably the biggest myth in general is thinking that Google itself is a black box. So I think there's nuances to how you rank, and no one can really unearth what is it that will you be number one and what it is that will make you be number three. But the basic idea of how you build SEO is very simplistic and Google has a best practices guide on what it is that you should be doing, which is build a website that Google can understand, link to the pages in that, write content that is helpful and that users want to read. And those are the basics. And starting with that is how you're going to build an SEO strategy that improves upon it. But the idea of if, \"I take all three of these steps right now. I'm guaranteed to be number one,\" I think is something that is completely incorrect. And there's an assumption that if you do a lot of things around SEO, you're going to be successful. And I think that that's incorrect.\n\n(01:28:57):\nYes, there are nuances. But for the most part, you get from most... Zero to 10, you can get to step eight by just doing the best practices.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:09):\nOh, wow. It sounds very empowering. I like the sound of that. Maybe just on that thread briefly. If someone wanted to start down the road of SEO, I know you're going to be a little bit biased because you help companies with this, but do you recommend bringing someone like you in first or having someone just give it a shot, listening to this podcast, reading some books and blogs, or something else?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:29:32):\nYes, so I am biased. I think they should have the right people give them advice on SEO. So if someone wants to be... If they validated that there is an SEO effort, paying for help on SEO, it goes back to that resource discussion we had before. So if you want to hire a growth advisor, a growth advisor might be very expensive, but you squash a learning curve so you don't make as many mistakes as fast.\n\n(01:29:56):\nIf you hire someone in-house, and a lot of times they see this with roles where I'm helping companies hire someone for SEO, they don't have a lot of budget, which means they're going to have someone that doesn't have a lot of experience. So is that the right decision to make? If you're hiring an agency, agencies are typically expensive, and agencies a lot of times get paid on deliverables. So are the deliverables they're doing worth paying for?\n\n(01:30:20):\nAn easy deliverable that a lot of agencies produce now is content, but that goes back to our earlier discussion. Do you even need the content? It's very easy for agencies to sell content as deliverable because it's something they actually deliver. Delivering strategy the way most of my growth advising works is very difficult because I don't have a strategy to offer in a proposal because I haven't developed a strategy, and we don't actually see the fruits of that until we implement the strategy. But agencies can end-run that by just saying, \"Oh, you pay us on a monthly basis and these are the things we're going to shift to you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:53):\nSomething that I wanted to touch on, which might be a myth and might not be a myth. But I think you're going to say it's a myth based on what you said about Google being so dominant. There's a lot of talk about TikTok and Instagram replacing Search for people. I actually do search TikTok a lot now for like, \"How do I solve this problem? How do I cut a watermelon? How do I, I don't know, find a cup for my baby?\" It's really good. What's your take on TikTok and Instagram videos basically replacing a lot of searching for Gen Z, especially, and younger kids?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:31:26):\nIn the Google Verdict, I think Google's said this before. 63% of Gen Z uses TikTok to search.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:31):\nOh, wow.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:31:32):\nYeah. I think that's just a headline number because it comes down to, you said it over and over in the podcast, user journeys. So there's going to be things that are more appropriate for TikTok or Instagram, and there are going to be things that are more appropriate for Search. So I think if you're doing top-of-funnel discovery, you're going to maybe watch TikTok videos to learn more about the topic. But as you go into the mid-funnel, so say you want to... A popular TikTok search is around travel. So you want to go on a trip. You want to go to Southeast Asia. You don't know where exactly you want to go. So you might want to watch a bunch of videos and see influencers and see experiences. But now you're ready to book. And you want to book a hotel. You want to book your flights. All of that is not going to happen on TikTok. All of that's going to happen on Google Search. So that's the mid-funnel again.\n\n(01:32:24):\nA lot of search will move different places, but ultimately, Google is still the right place to do those searches, to do those mid-funnel searches. So maybe it was more inappropriate that there ever wasn't TikTok for you to get those better experiences. For those top-of-funnel things, you had to suffer through reading awful content that was written only for SEO purposes, and now you get rich dynamic content that comes from TikTok.\n\n(01:32:49):\nAnd one interesting piece on this is if TikTok does get banned in the US, which looks like it's likely, a company that will pick up all of that users is YouTube. So YouTube has YouTube Shorts. And again, we're looking at a potential monopoly with Google as Google tries to put those YouTube Shorts to solve the problem that TikTok was now solving. So that will be kind of interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:14):\nOh, man. Google all the way down.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:33:18):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:18):\nA thought I had as you were talking about this idea of mid-funnel versus top funnel is a simple way to think about the mid-funnel is where there's intent. You actually have intent to now buy a thing, a specific thing. Yeah. Cool.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:33:30):\nI mean that's what it is, but it's a buyer journey. So at the top of the funnel, you're curious. You don't know if you have intent. And in the older way of doing SEO where you only focused on top of the funnel, you only focused on rankings as a KPI, which I think is sort of the incorrect way of doing things. There is no intent. So you showed a KPI that matched with a non-user, which matched with a non-buyer.\n\n(01:33:55):\nAs you move down the funnel, there is intent. So there is a user and there's less traffic. There's always going to be less traffic at the middle of the funnel. But that doesn't matter because your KPI is closely related to your business metrics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:08):\nLet's do a couple more myths if there's anything else that we missed, and then we'll wrap up and get to our very exciting lightning round. Is there anything else that you think is an important myth that people get wrong about SEO?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:34:19):\nI'll touch on one more myth, which is that technical SEO is an easy solve to any SEO problems. So there's been a lot of Google updates recently. Again, I think... I don't like to defend Google because in reading the Verdict, I think that Google did some pretty evil things. But a lot of what Google has been doing is pushing back on the things that users hate. There's a lot of bad SEO content out there. So Google's trying to get rid of a lot of this bad SEO content in their recent updates.\n\n(01:34:46):\nWhen sites get hit by these updates, they try to solve the problem that they think happened to them by doing technical SEO. So they'll reach out to me or to someone like me and say, \"Can you do an SEO audit and understand why our traffic has suffered?\" The reason their traffic has suffered is because they've done things that were not really useful for users and they sort of polluted Google. They need to solve that problem. Technical SEO has a place. So if you have a large website with tens of millions of pages, if you're Zillow, how you link to each listing, if you're Airbnb, how you link and allow Google to crawl a site and understand a site, very, very important.\n\n(01:35:23):\nIf you have a hundred-page website that sells a SaaS tool, technical SEO is probably going to be less important. So spending money and time on technical SEO would be a waste of time. So I think that's another big myth is you solve SEO problems with the right SEO solution rather than, \"Let's do an audit or let's get better links or my page...\" Page speed is another one that... Agencies like to sell on... If things related to page speed, Google keeps changing the words of what that is, but it doesn't matter as much.\n\n(01:35:54):\nBecause at the margins, yes, maybe if you're Kayak and you're competing, you get Expedia, and Kayak is maybe slightly faster, maybe that matters. But if you're in a space where you're competing against lots of slow terrible websites, it doesn't matter at all. So spending a lot of money on making that fix is not the right thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:15):\nI like how you just make SEO feel much more approachable and simple and something that you could just do and not have to again figure out the dark arts that...\n\nEli Schwartz (01:36:26):\nIt is not a dark art. It should be for most things, it is simple. And then there are tons of companies out there get in a lot of trouble, and there's billions of dollars to be made on doing the right SEO. But a lot can be unlocked by very simplistic SEO. PMs that don't really have an SEO background can do enough SEO to make a lot of money for the company without needing to be an SEO expert.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\nI love that. That's actually how it worked at Airbnb. The PMs work in SEO were not like historically SEO legends. They were just PMs figuring out SEO and they had a really big impact. So that really resonates with me. Eli, is there anything else that we haven't touched on that you think is important to you or something that you think might be useful to people to leave them with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:37:11):\nYes. So I think we talked about how to decide whether to resource SEO, but we didn't talk about how to understand what the expectations are from SEO. So this is something I came up with while I was working at Faire, which is a very interesting company. So it's F-A-I-R-E. They are a wholesale Shopify. They were launching in a new country, and they wanted to understand what the upside of launching in that country was from an SEO standpoint. So the way most people do SEO forecasting is they do a bottoms-up forecast, which is they look at keywords. So say we want to sell a pair of shoes.\n\n(01:37:48):\nYou do a bottoms-up forecast, you go onto a keyword research tool, and they're all fairly the same. Look at how many people search for shoes every month. And then you try to estimate what your ranking would be on that word shoes, and then you estimate what you click through it would be, and then based on that, that's your clicks. And then you get a conversion rate, and that's your bottoms up.\n\n(01:38:08):\nAnd you make an assumption that the word shoes in that tool didn't capture all the people that search like white shoes and black shoes and running shoes, so you just gross it up. You just pick a number and you gross it by 10, and that's your SEO forecast.\n\n(01:38:23):\nNow, the problem with that is that usually it's too small. So you get this number and now you're pitching to launch in a new country. I want to launch in Japan and sell shoes. And you say, \"Well, I think I can get 500 users because based on the way I got here, this is my click-through rate and this is my rankings and I'm 500 users.\" And no one will ever fund that. That's too small.\n\n(01:38:44):\nNow if you're launching in a new country, it's actually fairly easy to figure out what your SEO upside is because you can take the population in the country. So this is not something Pharoah sells, so I don't have to... So I'm not giving away anything. But say you're launching shoes. You're launching a new product website that you're selling shoes in a country like Japan.\n\n(01:39:02):\nI'm going to guess. I don't know the actual numbers for Japan. So say Japan has a hundred million people and you're selling shoes. And you're not going to sell shoes to a hundred million people. We're only selling shoes to men. And let's just divide it in half. 50% of Japan is men, so we got 50 million people that would buy shoes.\n\n(01:39:19):\nBut now, we're also going to say, \"Well, there's older people and younger people and we're not selling shoes to them.\" So now we can take 25 million and cut that in half. And then from there, again, we're selling shoes on the internet. Not everyone buys shoes on the internet. Some people buy shoes in a store. Some people buy shoes on the internet. So you take some percentage rate of the amount of people that are going to buy shoes on the internet and say, \"We'll take 10% of our 25 billion people in our market. 2.5 million people buy shoes on the internet and we want to do SEO for 2.5 million people. And our expectation is we want to get this number of market penetration, whether it's 10% or 50% or 100%.\" And there's your number and multiply that number by the amount of shoes they're going to buy every year and your AOV and there's your forecast.\n\n(01:40:07):\nAnd that may be inexact. And you can tweak those numbers up or down. You can say, \"Well, my AOV was wrong. My market penetration was wrong. I was wrong on the total population. I didn't realize that in Japan, no one bought shoes on the internet.\" But at any point in time, you can go back and adjust your forecast. Whereas if you're doing this bottoms-up forecast, it's actually in many cases wrong to begin with because the keyword research volume is wrong.\n\n(01:40:29):\nI worked with some really fascinating companies where the largest query in their space was the biggest query. So I worked with WordPress. So WordPress, the word WordPress is the biggest query in the web development space itself. There's no other word that's as big as WordPress. And the number that every single keyword research tool had was completely wrong of what Google Search Console said for the word WordPress is, \"When you're building these forecasts based on keyword research tools, that first number that you build the entire forecast off of if it's wrong, your forecast is wrong.\" So when you do this top-down, it's a TAM forecast essentially. When you do a top-down, you're closer to the truth. Now, you probably aren't going to get to the truth. I've never seen a product plan get to the truth of what it could do, but it will help you make a better decision than if you just guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:20):\nWow, this is a massive insight you're sharing. So you're saying the keyword research tools are not actually that accurate in terms of the opportunity there. And why is that? That begs the question. Why are they so off? What are they doing wrong? What are they missing?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:41:34):\nThey have their own secret sauce for estimations. So even Google, again, for past monopolistic reasons, Google's not allowed to give the real number that they see on Google Ads for how many people search it. They have to buy it from another data source, and then give that out. I forget why. They're all basically guessing. So they're using whatever sort of proprietary algorithms to guess, which is why a lot of them are not aligned because they have their own algorithms. So you're using, whether it's Semrush or Ahrefs, one of my favorite tools is Similarweb, which Similarweb has a lot of browser plugins, which snoop on the way people are searching. So whatever it is that they're... Because Similarweb has browser plugin, but they're not seeing every single person's search, so they have to use algorithms to estimate how much the entire world would be.\n\n(01:42:18):\nAnd again, I don't know that any of them could get close to truth was when I... I worked with big companies where there were keywords that I could look at Google Search Console, some of them, the tools were overestimating by 10 times. Sometimes they're underestimating by 10 times. So I'm not saying they didn't get the exact monthly number wrong. I'm saying they got it wrong by many factors.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:38):\nWow, that's crazy. So your advice is... Do you just ignore those numbers? Or is it just, \"Check it out but don't roll it. Don't use that number\"?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:42:48):\nThey're indicative. So I would say if you want to know like, \"Do most people spell WordPress with a space or WordPress without a space?\" It's pretty indicative that people spell it without a space. But if I were building a forecast and say, \"Oh, I absolutely choose this based on this defined number.\" I don't think so. I can use it for normalization. And I use them only for normalization to understand how do people search. And I really like user journeys and they're helpful for understanding user journeys. But as an exact science, it's hard to really use that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:19):\nThat's wild. And so it's mostly useful for order magnitude and comparing one keyword to another relative in this bit. Okay, interesting.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:43:29):\nYes. I mean I have a great example of how wrong it could be in estimating traffic. So there was a company I was working with early in COVID. The public company, their board member emailed them and said, \"You guys are getting crushed by your competitors in COVID because look at your competitors. I'm looking at one of these tools and you're at the bottom and you're doing everything wrong.\" And the CMO says, \"What do I tell this board member?\" I said, \"The board member is completely wrong. This is the Google Search Console.\" And Google Search Console is not perfect, but again, it's real data and our Google Search Console shows that our traffic has quadrupled in COVID, so it doesn't really matter what this external tool shows. So they're helpful. Tools are helpful. But I don't think they are a source of actual truth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:15):\nWow. That's an awesome point in closing. One thing I had noted here that I want to make sure you have a chance to talk about is just you're really passionate about helping people get into SEO and also just becoming advisors the way you are. Share what you think might be useful to people along these lines.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:44:33):\nAs my own forecast and prediction, I think the need for SEO expertise is going to explode because a lot of what is happening in the search layouts is going to mean that companies have to pivot their approaches. So again, companies focus on rankings, they focus on traffic, and a lot of that goes away. Suddenly the layout changes, the traffic changes. It's not necessarily going to impact their bottom lines if their SEO wasn't a right fit. So this is going to create a lot of interest in SEO help, and I'm seeing this.\n\n(01:45:02):\nOver the last year, my own inbound has really grown because there's a lot of questions as things shake out. So there will be people that want to go into SEO consulting, and I think there's going to be a huge need for it in growth advising in general.\n\n(01:45:15):\nWhat I would say is, and I had amazing mentors along the way, some of your past guests like Casey Winters and Yuriy Timen, Ethan Smith, they're all guests with great episodes, but they advised me and they shared with me not on how to be a better operator, but on how to do sales better, how to propose better.\n\n(01:45:36):\nAnd for anyone out there that wants to become a growth advisor, I'd say that that's the skill you really want to perfect. Communication, sales, proposals, and not really worry about being the best operator. You should be the best operator, but that's probably the skills you already have. And don't make an assumption that because you're a good operator today, you'll also be a great growth advisor. Build that growth advising muscle by staying on your day job. Don't quit your day job, and moonlighting and practice selling, closing, working, retaining, and that's where if you're successful there, you can be successful on your own.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:11):\nAmazing. And I know you have some posts that get into this stuff that we'll link to you, right?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:46:15):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:15):\nAwesome. It's kind of think of yourself as a product and the journey of working with you.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:46:21):\nYes. You're building a brand. You're not building a consultancy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:24):\nI love that. Eli, this has been amazing. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:46:31):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:33):\nHere we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:46:39):\nAs has been apparent, I really like user journeys and understanding people. So there's a book called Small Data by I think Martin Lindstrom. I don't know if I'm pronouncing his name right, where he talks about understanding people and understanding how people buy. And he digs into that entire process. He actually goes and lives in people's houses and watch how they use different tools and toys. I always find that book to be fascinating, and recommend to people who want to understand users.\n\n(01:47:04):\nSimon Sinek's Start With Why. Again, the same idea. Really understand what a product a business is supposed to be doing to understand users. This is specifically for growth advisors and not necessarily for PMs, but Million Dollar Consulting. It's a book I read, recommended actually by Ethan Smith many years ago. A fascinating book on how to build a brand and become a growth advisor. I ended up working with the author as a coach for almost a year. Amazing book.\n\n(01:47:33):\nAnd then the last book that'd be remise in not recommending is my wife's book, which is How To Stop Caring What Others Think: For Real. So it is a book for precisely that. Understanding your own successes, not worry about what other people think about you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:48):\nBeautiful. Is that in the background, by the way? And if not, you got to put it in your background, your wife's book.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:47:53):\nMy wife made the background. So yes, it is in the background.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:56):\nWhich one is it? Which color am I... Just so people recognize it. Oh, the big one right there. I was wondering why that one was a little taller than the rest.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:48:02):\nYes, this is the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:04):\nThere it is. Wait, move it up a little bit so we can see the full cover. Oh, beautiful. Stop Caring What Others Think. Beautiful. I need that. For Real, I like the ends, but for real.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:48:13):\nFor Real.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:15):\nI love it. Okay.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:48:15):\nIt may or may not be a Google Search query.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:19):\nOh, man. I see. I see what happened there. Genius. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:48:27):\nI was on a plane and I saw this movie Blackberry and it looked like a documentary, so I don't know if you've seen it, but it was fascinating. Because it's one of those movies, it has a cliffhanger, and you know exactly how it ends. And it is such a fascinating movie. I didn't know all that history, but they owned the entire smartphone industry, and they went to zero. And it really charted that journey and it makes you think like, \"You can never really rest on your laurels. You have to create a product people want and understand your users and keep selling that product.\" And not be like, \"Well, we're number one, this will never go away.\" And great movie.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:03):\nFunny, it was just recommended by another guest very recently, so there's trending up. It's been around for maybe a year at this point. I watched it.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:49:09):\nYeah, I never would've watched it if it wasn't on a plane. It was totally... It seemed like a plane movie, but it was perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:14):\nI watched that at home. And I love just the technical... Their ability to find clever ways to use the cell networks, that felt impossible, and that's what allowed them to all these. I like the messaging and things like that. That was really fascinating because I didn't realize they basically reverse-engineered the way the cell networks worked to allow what they allowed. Yeah, awesome movie, and crazy story.\n\n(01:49:38):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent product that you've recently discovered that you really love? It could be an app. It could be some physical.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:49:46):\nIt's not a recent product and it's the kind of thing I fall in love with over and over again. And it might be cliche, but it's my phone. So I recently traveled in Southeast Asia. I lived there for a little bit. So I haven't been back in eight years. And the things I was able to do with my phone like traveling, Google Maps, Waze, and ordering food. I went from multiple countries and I was able to use the same app to book rides and make payments. It was so useful.\n\n(01:50:12):\nEight years ago, and I was there and I had to buy a SIM card and my phone didn't really work and I couldn't make payments. It changed my entire experience. I almost didn't need a computer. So falling in love with my phone again.\n\n(01:50:24):\nAnd then another one that... It's not necessarily recent, but I absolutely love, which is Grammarly. So I like writing. I write all my own stuff. I don't write with AI. Grammarly helps me to be a better writer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:37):\nYou know what I've realized about Grammarly recently? I just upgraded to their pro plan. They're like the best product at upselling you on their paid plan because they're just right there in your face all the time. \"Hey, we have stuff. We have so many tips for you. We have so much we can improve. Just pay a hundred whatever bucks and we have so much advice to make all your writing so much better.\" It's right there in your face all the time. They're so good at it. And they got me. They got me. And I'm happy. It's not like that much money in the scheme of things if you're doing this full-time.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:51:08):\nI'm so embarrassed when I use Grammarly on my book and it just shows up all blue and green. I'm like, \"Oh, man, if only I had known.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:51:17):\nI actually have a copywriter on my newsletter who's incredible. She finds a hundred things every time to improve that even when I think it's perfect. And interestingly, she doesn't do what Grammarly suggests in more cases than I would expect. So that's kind of interesting I'm finding. But anyway, yeah, Grammarly is great. I use it all the time.\n\n(01:51:36):\nTwo more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often use yourself, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:51:44):\nI don't know that it fits into a sentence, but it's something I always encourage people, which is to really think big and think long. So I just started working with LinkedIn as a consulting client, and I've talked to LinkedIn about working with them for six years. So, never give up. You meet someone and propose something and suggest an idea you never know where it'll go. I had that all through my career with living in different places, really not think about the moment of where things will go, but just it's a relationship you're building. You don't ever know where anything will happen. So look at the big picture.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:22):\nLove that. And kind of following along those lines, last question. Curious if something comes up here. What SEO win are you most proud of?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:52:30):\nI don't know if I could say most proud of. But I really like what I do with Tinder because it brought the entire journey together. There's users out there that didn't know that Tinder would solve a very specific problem, and it's just there to solve that problem. And it's not the way Tinder thought of themselves. They thought of themselves as a dating app, but it's a loneliness solution problem that answers a Google Search.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:57):\nThis has been awesome. I think this is going to help a lot of people think through SEO and especially as they realize how things are changing, they're going to have this resource now to be like, \"I see. This is what I should change. This is what I should be doing.\" And I just love, especially the pattern and the thread of, \"It's not actually that complicated. You can do it even if you've never really done it before.\" So I really appreciate you being here and sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out to work with you? Also, check out your book. And finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEli Schwartz (01:53:29):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn. So search Eli Schwartz, and you should definitely look for my book. So the book is Product-Led SEO. Actually, one piece on just your own personal brand and your own personal rankings. It doesn't matter where you rank if you search your own name. So if LinkedIn shows up first for your name, that's great because they're finding you. And a lot of times, brands and people will be very focused on where they're positioned, but it's about the journey. If they find you, they find you. It doesn't matter if it's number one.\n\n(01:53:59):\nAnd that also underscores that it's not all about links. I believe for my own name and probably for you too, I outranked LinkedIn. And my book, so if you search Product-Led SEO, my own personal website, which does not have the best domain authority, it outranks Amazon. So that should right away disprove that it's all about links. That's all about SEO metrics. It's really all about the right fit. So be the right fit, and you'll show up where you're supposed to.\n\n(01:54:25):\nAnd then users can be most helpful for me by subscribing to my newsletter and giving me ideas and feedback on what to write. I really enjoy writing, and I really enjoy hearing from people. So my newsletter is Productledseo.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:54:36):\nIt's so consistent across all your things. I love it. Productledseo. Eli, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEli Schwartz (01:54:42):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:54:44):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:54:46):\nThank you so much for listening.

Episode 78: How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)

  "title": "How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)",
  "transcript": "# How Netflix builds a culture of excellence | Elizabeth Stone (CTO)\n\n## Transcript\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:00:00):\nWe can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence in improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density. And in some ways, it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes. And that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days. And in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior.\n\nLenny (00:01:06):\nToday my guest is Elizabeth Stone. Elizabeth is chief technology officer at Netflix, and as far as I can tell, the first economist to ever be named CTO at a Fortune 500 company. Prior to this role, Elizabeth was vice president of Data and Insights. Before Netflix, she was vice president of science at Lyft, COO at Nuna, a trader at Merrill Lynch, and an economist at Analyst Group. In our conversation, we cover a lot of ground. We talk about how an economics background has helped Elizabeth in her career and why she expects to see more economists rise in the ranks of tech companies. She shares some of her secret sauce for rising so quickly at so many companies so consistently. We delve into Netflix's very unique culture of high talent density, radical candor, and freedom and responsibility. We also talk about the structure that Netflix has for their data and user research teams, which she believes is a part of Netflix's secret to success. We also get into what biking and triathlons have taught Elizabeth about life and how she brings that into her work and so much more.\n\n(00:02:08):\nA huge thank you to Ali Rao for introducing me to Elizabeth.

Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:43):\nSo when we booked this conversation, you are VP of data in Netflix. And since then you got a promotion, you're now the CTO of Netflix, which feels significantly more fancy. Question for you, what is life like now that you are CTO versus VP of data? How is it most different? I'm imagining more meetings.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:05:01):\nI would say the biggest thing that changed is probably the amount of context switching and the degree to which I feel behind or I have a lot to learn. And I felt like I had a lot to learn in the VP of data and insights role that I was in before in part because we cover a lot of different areas of the business and there's always people to learn from, but the engineering organization just takes that to 100 basically. So more people to get to know, more problem spaces, aspects of technical expertise that I'm just not as deeply familiar with. And yeah, a lot more meetings.\n\nLenny (00:05:41):\nI imagine many higher stakes meetings as well.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:05:44):\nYes. So thankfully not a lot of meetings that Netflix feel like now you're really in this scary room, but it does feel like the role has more consequence, which is actually an exciting thing.\n\nLenny (00:05:57):\nKind along the lines of what you just talked about being a CTO. Your background is actually unusual. You're a trained economist, you got a PhD in economics. And from what I can tell, you're the first CTO of Fortune 500 company that is an economist trained in economics. First of all, is that true? I don't know if I think that's true, but you tell me.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:06:16):\nI have not checked the list. That was one of the things I did not do after getting the title. It might be unusual. I've heard a lot of feedback on that, so I don't know if I'm the one and only, but I will definitely say it's probably unusual.\n\nLenny (00:06:30):\nYeah. So I guess the question is just, do you think this is an anomaly and going to continue to be really rare? Do you think this some are going to see more at tech companies? And generally do you think tech companies should hire more economists?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:06:41):\nYes to the last question. That's the easiest of it. But one of the things I observed even with the focus on data science where I've been deeper for a period of time is that economics is a flavor of data science. So it is a set of technical skills for sure. It's a way of framing certain problems or solving challenges.\n\n(00:07:06):\nAnd so when I was first switching from economics into tech, it was before there was a lot of sort of the frenzy around data science that we've seen more recently and it was harder to make that argument that economics is a flavor of data science and maybe complimentary to other versions of data science. And I feel more strongly about that now that I've seen it up close. And so maybe by extension I would say just like I think data science can be helpful for a lot of different problems that you might not immediately think, \"Oh, this is something that we should bring data to,\" I think that economics is generally valuable for a lot of different challenges and it's a useful perspective to add to things, especially in a business context and especially in how we want to simplify problems in a way that makes them feel tractable.\n\n(00:08:00):\nSo I feel like that's been a benefit to me to have had that type of formal training and then bring that perspective or way of thinking to different roles. And so I don't know that many people at Netflix think of me as an economist, but I find it comes out in the way I think about things. So to the extent that that's true generally, I think it's useful in a lot of companies. And I feel like even since I made the switch towards tech, I've seen it become much, much more common to think about the value of having economists on teams.\n\nLenny (00:08:32):\nJust to pull on that thread a little bit more, is there something very tactical or concrete that you can share that you find helpful with that background that you found helpful in your career?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:08:42):\nOther than the dismal dry science of it all? So one example would probably be in an understanding incentives and thinking about unintended consequences. I think that that is true both in terms of internal leadership, so being part of a management team that's thinking about how do we clarify priorities or motivate a company or define the problems we want to solve. And then part of it is more externally oriented. How do we want to think about what Netflix is to consumers and how we want to think about competition?\n\n(00:09:24):\nThere can be a rational way of thought, which is one version of economics of shouldn't rational intelligent people behave in the following way. And then there's the, well, if given certain incentives, what might you see that we didn't think was optimal or we weren't expecting to happen but could be a consequence or repercussion here? And so I think that that type of framing, I don't know if it's unique to economics in a way because it has elements of psychology to it as well and planning ahead has become really useful for thinking through cause and effect. So that has come up in a lot of different spaces in Netflix and in other roles I've been in.\n\nLenny (00:10:08):\nI was looking at your LinkedIn and looking at your career over the years. It seems like you've had a meteoric rise at four different companies. And I'll just walk through them briefly. So at your first job, you went from associate to vice president in three years. At the next company, Nuna, you went from manager of data science to COO in two years. At Netflix you went from VP to CTO in three years. I think that's really rare. I'm curious what is your secret sauce to being so successful at so many places and especially in the context of what advice can you share with folks earlier in their career?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:10:46):\nThis is one of those questions that sparks the reflection that I wouldn't normally do, so that's great. I really don't think of it as a secret sauce, but maybe I can walk through some of the things that I think have been instrumental. As you listed that out, it sounds like the two to three year point is the real sweet spot, so maybe there's something about that timeline. But I think some things almost feel trite in how I would say them, which is I'm very dedicated to the work and to the teams I'm part of. It's been part who I am for a long time that I give everything I've got to the job that I'm in. And I think that dedication and that I get joy out of that has mattered. It matters because I enjoy what I'm doing. I do the best work I possibly can, less so for myself and my own ambition and more so because I think of myself as being part of a team and so I really need to deliver for that team.\n\n(00:11:52):\nI think that framing in my mind and that motivation has helped me in a few fronts, which is the way in which I build partnerships with people I work with that I really care about setting other people up for success and being someone that people want to work with, so I learn from them, they learn from me, and we get better outcomes for the business together, I have found that part of that is being someone that people can leverage to translate from technical to non-technical and non-technical to technical. So that I do think has been a relative advantage in my role. So while I was often sitting in more technically-oriented teams, a lot of the advancement in my career was to roles that required that type of communication fluency. It grew out of being able to partner with people across the businesses who didn't necessarily have the same background, but where we needed to really connect spaces so that we could be more effective.\n\n(00:12:57):\nThat was something that I think really the training for that came from analysis group where it was a very quantitative set of work that we had to find a way to communicate to judges and juries for economic cases. So that was something that was trained in other roles and I think I've been able to leverage. I'm a relatively introverted only child, so I observe a lot, which means that I learned from other people. And in each of these roles I have tried really hard to watch what other people are doing, think about how could I learn something from them, whether it's the thing that I want to be able to do myself or it's the thing that I think, \"Oh, that doesn't quite fit or feel authentic with my style.\" And I do a lot of that introspection. So I have been surrounded by amazing people in all these roles and I have a feeling that I learned a lot by osmosis and observation and then have been able to leverage that to be stronger in the roles I was sitting in.\n\nLenny (00:14:00):\nI took a few notes here. A few things you mentioned is just like, dedication, essentially working really hard and taking your work seriously, being part of a team and setting other people up for success, translating complex tech language and problems to non-tech people, and then being really good at observing and learning from other people around you. Is there an example or two that you could share of some of these to make it even more concrete for people? Like dedication. Is that just like working many hours, being part of a team? Anything along those lines to share a story maybe to help people put this into practice.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:14:35):\nNo, and it's a good clarification because the dedication piece really isn't about long working hours. It's more about how much I care about excellence, I guess. So giving it my best in those situations. And that might not mean that I work really wild hours or I work weekends or I'm the one who's willing to sacrifice the vacation. I've actually tried to avoid setting that as an expectation, but more that I hold myself to a very high standard.\n\n(00:15:13):\nSo an example would be, especially as I've gotten more senior in roles, there can be an expectation that it's okay for other people to wait on me. So whether it's the timing for a meeting or providing input on something or reviewing a document or following through on something I said that I was going to do, and I really try to avoid that, which means that if someone sends me something, I try to be very responsive about it. If I know that I said I'm going to do something, I follow through on it in the timeline that I said I was going to do. If I have a meeting, I try to be on time to that meeting.\n\n(00:16:01):\nThose are all flavors of dedication to the work that show up in, \"Oh, it seems like Elizabeth works really hard,\" but the motivation factor is other people are relying on me and I want to show up for them. And so that's when I say dedication and it's related to the second point around showing up well for the team, those would all be examples of I feel urgency in responding to people and doing high quality work.\n\n(00:16:27):\nFor the other parts of technical to non-technical, I think a great example is actually a very timely one at Netflix, which is, we are making strides to offer live content types. So live events, live TV shows. We announced this week that we're going to be hosting WWE starting later this year and early next year, 2025. That is easier said than done. I know that there's a lot of entertainment companies that have live content. But Netflix has really been in the streaming content business, so live content is something new for us and it's something that's going to require a really close partnership between our content organization and our products and technology organization because there's a content strategy to it, there's a business strategy, there's a technology strategy to it. A big part of my role is, can I explain how we're going to approach those technical problems in a way that builds competence with the content team? Can I try to understand their content strategy in a way that sets the technical teams up for success and we understand what we need to be able to deliver on here in terms of requirements.\n\n(00:17:46):\nI don't think I'd be able to do my current role well if I wasn't able to do that type of translation for something that's going to be a big bet for the business and something we want to invest in jointly. And then to set my partners up for success in that. So I am going to do everything I can to make sure we deliver well for my content partners because I feel like that's what's best for Netflix in the business.\n\nLenny (00:18:09):\nAmazing examples. In terms of life content, I think about the Love is Blind. I think it was for premier, whatever, reunion that we got sucked into that show. So good job. And I think there were some issues with that, right? That reunion streak.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:18:24):\nWell, yeah, that was about a little less than a year ago now. So the amazing thing about failure is you learn a lot. We learned a lot. We've taken notes on it and we had a couple successful events after that, including the Netflix Cup last October. And we've got some exciting events coming up. So I think that's something that strengthened us, but did reveal that we're tackling a hard problem.\n\nLenny (00:18:50):\nYeah, the Twitter feeds during that, Love is Blind premiere were hilarious. People are pissed.\n\n(00:18:57):\nOkay. And then in terms of the, keeping a high bar for yourself, I love that. I think about a quote that... There's a VC, Ann Miura-Ko, at Floodgate and she did this interview with Tim Ferris. She shared that her dad always asked her, \"Are you doing a World-class job with this? Are you doing a world-class job with your homework? Are you doing a world-class job with your piano recital?\" And that's the bar that he always had for her. And I feel like that's a really good way to think about work and life in general if you can.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:19:28):\nYeah, my mother used to describe to me, probably still does, though it required more repeating when I was younger, that the last 5% is the 5% that really mattered. And so it is that framing of the extra effort you put into something to make it world-class or to make it excellent. And so I do like to push myself that way and I hope it sets a good example for other people too. It's very consistent with especially the company cultures that I tend to thrive in where that's the general expectation of the culture. So you don't feel like you're doing it alone, because then I think you can start to feel frustrated by that.\n\nLenny (00:20:15):\nI know that this is a big part of Netflix culture and I want to get into it. But before that, I'm curious just what that looks like with people that report to you. How do you help them level up in this skill of having a really high bar? And an example I'll give as you think about maybe an example is the way I described this to my PMs was, you want to have this aura that you've got this that, \"If you give Lenny something, he's got this. He's going to follow up, he's going to close the loop, he's going to get it done. If he can't get it done, he'll tell me, I feel like this thread will not disappear. He won't drop this ball.\" Is there anything that you've learned as a good way to help someone learn this kind of skill, understand why this is so important?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:20:53):\nIt shows up for the people who report to me, is one part example setting. So if I don't do it, why would they do it? I treat that very seriously that we should all be held to the same standards.\n\n(00:21:12):\nAnd as a second thing, I give feedback when it's not up to the standard. So I think one of the things I've observed especially with people on my teams is that the expectations aren't always clear and you can't assume that they're clear if you don't share them. When something's not meeting expectations or really showing up as excellence, I think it's a combination of both giving the feedback on that and being direct about it and being specific about what would it take to get this to the bar that I am expecting or to show up in the way that I'm expecting.\n\n(00:21:55):\nAnd then the third and probably most important thing is help them fill that gap. So that would mean... Let's take an example. It certainly has happened frequently in many jobs. A document is okay, it's not great, it's not going to be easy for people to follow, it's not as crisp as it could be. There's things that would strengthen it. I can both give the feedback on that to make sure like, yes, it's going to take another round of iteration, yes, we're going to have to work another week on this and not be done with it, but pushing people to get there, and then jumping into the document and helping.\n\n(00:22:32):\nSo I feel very strongly about, and that's kind of what I mean by setting an example of like, \"Let's work on this together,\" and then through that, help people uplevel themselves so the next time around they know the expectations and they've had help getting there in the past. So that's probably happened a thousand times in my career where I jump in with both feet because something needs to be better and I think the teams are better for it afterwards, or I hope they are.\n\nLenny (00:23:00):\nI think that's such a good framework just to kind of mirror back what you said, \"Set expectations that the bar is going to be really high and here's what I'm expecting from you.\" Give them very specific feedback on where the gap is and then help them fill that gap. I think a lot of people may feel this and hear this and they're like, \"Oh man, I don't want a manager that's like this high of an expectation person and it just feels really stressful.\" But I've had these managers and I feel like that's when I've learned the most and leveled up the most, is having someone that had really high expectations and then helped me understand, \"Here's where you're not doing as well as you can. I know you can do better. Go back and work on this.\" I know that sounds annoying, but I think in practice it ends up helping you most in your career. I imagine you've seen a similar result.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:23:45):\nI think so. I mean you'd have to ask some of the people on my team. So I might look at it differently that they look at it.\n\nLenny (00:23:51):\n[inaudible 00:23:52] differences.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:23:53):\nIt's a hard skill because it's not always easy to give feedback, especially if you feel like you know someone's put a lot of effort into something. And so I give a lot of thought to how I deliver that feedback so it feels like we're on the same team and I'm trying to help them be successful, not to help encourage failure. And that's where I think that third piece of the framework of jumping in to help can make people feel like, \"I'm in a safe space. My manager wants me to be successful. My manager's helping me here.\" I do often do that behind the scenes. So maybe that's another flavor of this, which is, I don't do it live in the big meeting in front of all the people where the presentation doesn't go very well. I do it afterwards where it feels like a safer space to say, \"Here's a way this could have gone better. Let's think about this differently next time.\" So it gives people a little grace and a little bit of an ability to absorb that feedback without feeling like it's kind of on a stage.\n\nLenny (00:25:02):\nAnother thing someone may be feeling when they're hearing this is like, \"Oh my god, it's going to take me so many hours to just get it to a place Elizabeth is happy with.\" And I know you said that this doesn't mean necessarily many hours. Do you have any advice or thoughts on just how to avoid burnout and working all the time, but also keeping this really high bar and high expectations?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:25:21):\nIt truly is not about time. I even found myself in a meeting earlier today saying, \"If we're clear on the objectives of something, it might be that the last 20% of polish on the document is a really bad use of time. So if we're going to come together to talk through...\" Like quarterly business review was the example, what were the highlights? What were the low lights? What were the learnings from the quarter? Where are there places of misalignment? The reason we're doing the quarterly business review is to have a really candid conversation about how we think things are going, to have a debate about things where maybe we're stuck. It's not to have a perfectly polished document for that conversation.\n\n(00:26:08):\nSo my feedback in that instance would be, I would much rather have someone spend the time thinking about what's the conversation we really want to have? \"How do I tee that up?\" Not, \"Could I spend another 20 hours to make it look like everything's perfect in this document?\" And so I think in that sense it's not just excellence, like you wrote the perfect document, I should probably be careful to not use that as the only example, but instead we really got to the outcome we wanted to get to because we were thoughtful about it and we put a lot of energy and time and iteration into making sure we got to that outcome.\n\nLenny (00:26:43):\nAnd is this an example where you gave someone feedback that they spent too much time on the polish or is this earlier? And to give the pyramid of this framework you kind of shared of set expectations, give specific feedback, help them fill the gap and then do it in private, is this the expectation setting in this example or is this feedback you spend too much time on this?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:27:01):\nThis is expectation setting. So one of the things in my new role is that there's some practices that the team has had where they're trying to understand, Are we still going to have those practices? What's going to be the same versus different about those things?\" and get an understanding of my expectations. So it's great that people ask that question so that I can be clear about, \"Oh wait, if you're on the last 20% of this polishing the dock, I'd rather spend time over here. And here's how I would like the conversation to go so we all get something out of it instead of it feeling like it's just a leadership reviewer on my behalf.\" So in this specific situation, it was setting expectations ahead of time so that we can set everyone up for success.\n\nLenny (00:27:44):\nAwesome. Okay. So we've kind of been talking around this, but this is an important part of the Netflix culture. Just broadly, Netflix has a really special and unique culture. Even though it's been around for I think over 25 years now, it feels like the culture has come up many times. There's that initial culture deck that came out that blew everyone's minds. There's a recent book, No Rules Rules I think it's called. And it feels like Netflix has done a great job at maintaining its culture.\n\n(00:28:10):\nIt feels to me there's these three important elements, and maybe there's more. One is very high talent density and a focus on high performers. Two is candor and being really direct. And then three is giving people freedom and responsibility and getting rid of useless processes like vacation time and things like that. So maybe just to dive into that first one of high talent density and this focus on high performance. I guess the question there is just like, what does this look like in Netflix? And I imagine part of it is hiring, part of it is performance reviews. And then just why is it so important? Why is this such a focus on Netflix? What happens when you have such a high talent density?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:28:51):\nIt's just so intrinsic to who Netflix is as a company. And in some ways it's very reflective of Reed Hastings as founder of Netflix. So when he founded Netflix and grew the company over time, it was with a belief that there could be a different approach to building a company that would make it a place that people thrived in and loved being and would feel different than other places, both in the quality of that talent density, but even more importantly, the excellence and the outcomes and that that's where people would derive a lot of sense of fulfillment. So it is very deeply seated at Netflix from its original days.\n\n(00:29:37):\nA big piece of that talent density is definitely hiring. So who are the people coming in and joining the team? But a lot of it is, we can't really have any of the other aspects of the culture, including candor, learning, seeking excellence and improvement, freedom and responsibility if you don't start with high talent density.\n\n(00:30:03):\nAnd so in some ways it's not the end, it's the means to the end in what Reed and the rest of the leadership team has been trying to build. And so in order to do that, you have to really hold yourself to a lot of stuff that doesn't feel like natural human behavior. What I mean by that is giving the feedback, this gets into the second bucket. So giving feedback, being candid around your expectations when they're not being met, what could be better in helping people improve, and be able to receive that type of feedback yourself in order to keep talent density high? Because no one comes to Netflix as a perfect human being and stays a perfect human being the whole time. We all have ways that we could grow and improve. And so in order to keep that bar high, you have to be willing to have those types of very uncomfortable conversations. It's an uncomfortable amount of candor and feedback in order to keep that bar high.\n\n(00:31:10):\nAnd then the other piece of it is another thing that doesn't come naturally to humans, which is making a call in pretty timely fashion if someone's not able to meet the bar, and to say either, \"I don't think the role you're sitting in is the right role, or I don't think that Netflix is the right place for you,\" and to make that something that is part of best practice to get to a point where you could make that decision. And that's where we refer to the keepers test, which is really just a mental framing to make sure we hold ourselves accountable for this. Where if I'm asking myself the question, \"If this person on my team came to me and said, 'I'm leaving today. I have a different opportunity and I would like to take it,' would I do everything I could to keep them at Netflix?\" If not, then I should be having that tough conversation about, \"Should you really be here? Are you in the right role?\", if I might be a little bit relieved if you said you were leaving.\n\n(00:32:20):\nThe reason the keeper test and that question is useful is because no one wants to think that way. It's very hard to say to someone, \"I think this isn't the right fit. I think you should move on from the company.\" So we have to introduce some of those reflections in order to encourage the behavior. And we also then want to get to a place where when you're having that tough conversation, people aren't surprised by it. That is easier said than done. But you can only get to that conversation around, \"I don't think Netflix and you are the right fit for one another\" if you've been giving feedback along the way. And so it feels like in its most ideal state, it's a mutual observation. In practice, it's not always that smooth. Obviously we are humans. But that all feeds on itself in order to make sure that we're really holding ourselves to what we say our behavioral norms as part of the culture.\n\nLenny (00:33:17):\nHow is that operationalized? Is that just mental model that you should have in mind? Or is it like every quarter you should go through this exercise? Is it part of the performance review process? How does that actually operationalize at Netflix?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:33:29):\nIt's definitely a mental model. So when we talk to managers about what does it mean to be a manager at Netflix, it would mean you should be with some frequency asking yourself this about the people on your team. People ask me frequently, \"Am I passing your keeper test?\" So it becomes part of a regular manager direct report, one on one. And it is just another way of saying, \"Am I meeting your expectations? What's going well? What's not going well? How are you thinking about things?\" And that can sometimes be a very awkward conversation to have. So in the middle of a lot of like, \"We have to talk about this project or that deliverable or this thing that's happening,\" to take the time to step back and just say, \"How am I doing?\", can feel loaded sometimes. And the keeper test, while it feels like a very heavy concept, creates a lightness around being able to have that conversation regularly. So we do operationalize it. A point that you made, I'll just clarify, we don't have performance reviews.\n\nLenny (00:34:33):\nOh, wow.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:34:34):\nSo we don't have a practice that a lot of other companies do where we would think about reflecting on a rating of how things are going. We do have an annual cycle of 360 feedback where you request and receive feedback from a lot of people, but it's not an input to some output, it's just for the value of the feedback and to make sure we're keeping that muscle. And we have an annual compensation cycle where we reflect on how are people doing? And so you think about performance as part of both promotions and as part of compensation, but in that way it has to be part of the day-to-day and part of the operating rhythm because we don't create a process where that would come to the surface.\n\nLenny (00:35:20):\nInteresting. I didn't know that. So the idea there is just ongoing, like the whole... So what many people dream of, no performance reviews, we'll give you ongoing real-time feedback. We don't have to wait six months. I feel like people talk about this but rarely do this, but that's how you guys operate.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:35:36):\nIn ideal.\n\nLenny (00:35:37):\nIn ideal, yeah.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:35:38):\nIn practice. It's like you have to keep reminding yourself, \"This is our ideal\" because it's really easy to rely on the annual 360 cycle. And all of a sudden I do get about 300 pieces of feedback. And some of those things are on things that happened six months ago and I think, \"Oh, I wish you had told me this at the time, that would've been more living the Netflix culture.\" So we have to push ourselves to do it that way. But yeah, that is if working well, it's very timely direct feedback. The 360 site goal is sort of the annual check-in on, \"Let me get the full picture. Let me be able to distill some themes. Let me tee it up for a conversation with my manager.\" And then it does remove the sort of crutch of an every six month performance review or something like that.\n\nLenny (00:36:31):\nWhen you talked about this example of someone asking you often, \"Am I meeting your keeper test?\", it makes me feel like someone's just super nervous. They're like, \"Am I passing your keeper test?\" And it makes me feel like it could create a culture of just like a lot of stress and worry and this hunger games mentality of like, \"I got to compete and worry and I might die or get fired any day.\" I'm guessing the solution to that is partly cultural. This is just the way we work. You don't need to stress all the time, but you may be let go if you're not meeting this keeper test. How do you avoid this just constant worry that you might be fired any day and that you may not be hitting the bar?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:37:08):\nIn my personal experience, I have felt a lot more at ease by having these conversations than by not having them. So in many roles I've had, I haven't been sure how I was doing or things I could be doing better on, and I didn't quite know how to get that information. And that made me feel much more stressed or nervous or at risk than having it be part of the culture to have those conversations.\n\n(00:37:45):\nSo the thing that I think can be nerve wracking, and I feel it myself, is the high bar for excellence at Netflix and if we're doing this while you're surrounded by amazing people. And that can feed a sense of, \"Am I doing well enough compared to how everyone else is doing? I know the bar's high.\" For the most part, that can drive people and in a good way, but in some ways it makes people nervous. And that's where I think it's helpful to know we expect to have these conversations so you can just kind of let your shoulders relax a little bit of, \"Yes, the expectations are high, but my manager says I'm doing a great job, or my manager says I'm not doing a great job, but they gave me concrete things that I could do better.\" And so I think knowing is better than not. And so in that sense, it's the culture combined with the conversations around performance I hope take a little bit of that stress out of it. But I've certainly heard it a lot that without that conversation, people can be nervous.\n\nLenny (00:38:49):\nThat's such a good point and such a good example that I feel like every company wants to have a high bar and have only high performers and keep the bar really high for every person they hire. I'm curious, I know this could be its own podcast and book, but just in terms of hiring people that are amazing and keeping this bar of excellence, is there anything you can point out that might be helpful to other companies hiring to help identify amazing people and make sure that bar stays high? One thing I know is you guys pay a top market for salary. I think that's one unique thing about Netflix, is we just pay people. So maybe that's an part of this answer, but just what advice do you have for people to keep a really high bar in their talent?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:39:33):\nYeah, I mean on the compensation point, we pay what we call personal top of market, meaning we want to be highly competitive in the pay, but we don't want pay to be like the golden handcuffs of Netflix sets market rather than paying people a strongly competitive compensation. So I think that that's important for attracting and retaining talent and has been a big part of the culture, but almost more importantly, we hope we don't have to rely on that to want people to want to be at Netflix or for us to be able to assess whether people are going to thrive at Netflix.\n\n(00:40:20):\nThe way that I've thought about hiring with that context is we know we're going to offer you very highly competitive compensation, but are you going to come to Netflix and help us identify the right problems to solve or new ways to solve existing problems? And that's a different way of hiring than you might think about, especially at scale where you're saying, \"Does this person have this skill, this skill, this skill? Check they're going to fit in this box and they're going to deliver this work that I need them to do.\" I'm being intentionally simplistic. I recognize a lot of people don't hire actually that way. But at Netflix we try really hard to say we're looking for the new perspective or the person who's actually going to make us stronger as a team. So thinking about additive skills, additive perspectives, people who are going to push our thinking on something. That tends to help us with thinking about talent density because you're constantly introducing people to the team who uplevel.\n\n(00:41:25):\nSo then the questions you have to ask in an interview might be different because yes, we're trying to assess do you have the baseline skills to be successful here, but we're also looking for the things that make people exceptional or even stronger than the team we've got. And then you think about making the magical teams comprised of all those amazing minds and what can you get out of that. And that feels like more that the talent density and practice.\n\nLenny (00:41:50):\nGot it. So the advice there essentially is, don't look for someone just simply great. Look for someone that raises the bar for the whole team, brings in a whole new perspective.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:41:58):\nYes. That's a great way to say it. Yeah, it's a good way to say it.\n\nLenny (00:42:00):\nI think what's great about this idea of just maintaining excellence consistently is that the best people want to work with the best people. And as soon as there's one person that sucks and the company allows for that, it just brings everyone down because they know, \"Hey, we can be okay. We'll stick or no one's going to do anything about it.\" And when you make it clear, we only want the best and only hire the best and only keep the best, it keeps the best there, right? I imagine that's part of the strategy.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:42:29):\nYeah. It's definitely the goal. And I think understanding that having gaps in the team and people's skillsets or their behavior can be really toxic for other people on the team. So it's a cost.\n\nLenny (00:42:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by Xplo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting.

And there's a great question that came in from Nan Yu. He's the head of product for Linear and he asks, \"What practices does Netflix do that other companies should not attempt to do because their talent level is so much higher than other companies?\"\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:44:15):\nThat is freedom and responsibility in a nutshell. So let me explain that. It's a good question. It's kind of related to what I was saying earlier, that talent density is a prerequisite for a lot of the other ways we operate. So if we want to create a work environment where we are not prescriptive about how people solve problems or the scope of problems that they could tackle, assuming they're highly impactful for the business, and we don't have a lot of process around that work, so think about being able to make large innovations to our engineering systems or introducing new ways to think about metrics and experimentation, we get a lot of those things because we give people the freedom and the space to explore and question things and experiment in a way with solutions. I think that that would be very hard if not dangerous if we didn't have a high talent density.\n\n(00:45:32):\nIt's really not a top down do A, then B, then C. Even in how we go through some of our planning processes or thinking about how we think about priorities, there is a lot of room for contribution across all levels of the team and that requires talent density. And then there's things like you have to have amazing people if you're not going to have really strict guardrails that would influence the consumer experience or business stakeholders experience. We do give people a lot of responsibility on those things. So I think the lack of process and prescriptiveness is all hinging on we've got amazing people who are smart, but even better have strong judgment.\n\nLenny (00:46:18):\nThis is kind of what you always hear from people giving founders advice is, \"Just hire amazing people, get out of their way and let them do their job,\" which is often not a successful experience. What are examples that either things that came out of this freedom, I don't know, products or features or ideas that came out of this or policies or processes you don't have that everyone else might have? So I know there's no vacation time, there's unlimited vacation time, I assume. Is that still a thing? Unlimited vacation time?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:46:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:46:49):\nOkay, cool. All right, great. And I know performance reviews, you talked about that. So I guess in either direction, is there an example of something that came out of this freedom or some process that which surprised people that you don't have or a framework or system?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:47:05):\nWe've been able to deliver... I'll speak to my own team around innovations in our content delivery network or innovations in encoding or innovations in discovery and personalization. We're not driven by some leader saying, \"I think this is a priority.\" They were driven in many cases by individual contributors who had great ideas for innovation. So a lot of the stuff that Netflix has succeeded in, came from creating space for people on the team. So there's probably thousands of examples of product features and things like that that came out of creating this space. And right now, the trick is finding the sweet spot so that we can operate efficiently at this type of scale without snuffing out some of that, what was kind of the core beauty of the culture.\n\nLenny (00:47:55):\nMaybe a last question around just the culture. We talked about candor a bit. I'm just curious if there's an example that comes to mind of an example of candor that you recently saw or had to be the candid person that might be interesting to share where it's like, \"Oh wow, that's what you mean when you say a culture of candor.\"\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:48:15):\nThere's a couple things that come to mind. I am generally a transparent leader, meaning I share information freely and openly. It's part of the culture to context, not control, which means part of my job is to make sure that people have the context they need to do their jobs well. And in practice, that means I take notes in leadership meetings and I share those notes with the whole organization. And that is sometimes it includes candor around reflections on things that aren't going well or problems we need to solve. Sometimes it's just letting people know, \"Here's what leadership's talking about so that they have a sense of what's top of mind.\" But it's a version of transparency that I feel strongly about, doesn't exist a lot of other places. I think it's a version of candor too in being able to share... I can't always share every detail of everything that we're talking about, but I do try to share things that probably push the boundary a little bit in the team, feeling like they understand what's happening across the company and what I'm thinking about.\n\n(00:49:22):\nAnd then there's a second example that comes to mind, which is, until two years ago, individual contributors didn't have levels at Netflix. So all engineers were just senior engineers, all data scientists were senior data scientists, and we did not have a leveling system. We introduced IC levels two years ago almost exactly. And it was a big, big, big shift because it was seen as something that was sort of sacred of it. A lot of people came to Netflix because we didn't have it. We didn't have process around promotions. This is probably part of why we never had performance reviews, because promotions really weren't at play. And it gave people a sense of freedom of not having to worry about that type of structure. But when you get to a scale of an organization, we needed some type of scaffolding to say, \"We want to talk about how we compose teams. When do we need the person who has 30 years of experience? When do we want to have a new grad?\" Because that's what the work requires. We didn't have a language for it.\n\n(00:50:27):\nSo I introduced Levels a couple of years ago and we had quite a change rollercoaster is the only way I can describe how it went.\n\nLenny (00:50:38):\nThat's a good phrase.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:50:40):\nYeah, it was sort of like being the tumble dry machine for a few months, and so really talking through it with the team. That's just context and backdrop. For an example of candor recently, which is, we had kind of a postmortem or a retro on how has it gone with IC levels. So it's kind of like wells, not wells. And I would normally think in a lot of cultures it would be like, \"Well, we got past that change. We're living that change.\" Don't reflect on it. Because that kind of opened some of that early debate. And I felt differently about it. I think it's a good example of being candid about, this was a big change for us. It hasn't all gone perfectly. There's a lot that we can do better in how we implement levels at Netflix. And I would rather share that information than pretend it's all gone swimmingly and we achieved every objective. So I think that I try to build examples like that because I do think that level of candor and reflection helps build the sense of community and trust across the team.\n\nLenny (00:51:44):\nThat's an awesome example. Kind of along the lines of that, but also this category of freedom and responsibility, something Netflix innovated long ago, and I'm curious if this is still a thing, is this idea of Chaos Monkeys, which essentially are a program that runs on your infrastructure that just kills random processes and things and just to see what breaks and make sure things are stable when things actually start falling apart. Is Chaos Monkeys... Was that what it's called? And then is that still a thing? Is there still some Chaos Monkeys running around the servers?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:52:19):\nNot unbridled Chaos Monkeys. No.\n\nLenny (00:52:22):\nOkay. Contains chaos and niche.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:52:24):\nBur no, we carry too much responsibility, speaking of freedom and responsibility for the member experience to inject pain, though we do do a lot of experiments to test resilience, and that does probably mean injecting things that we're not quite sure whether A is better than B. And so that happens across engineering systems really at scale. But it is not for pure chaos, it's for intentional learning and so we can avoid making bigger mistakes. And then as we go into new efforts like cloud games, we have a beta that's out now, Live would be another example. We do try to come up with intentionally low profile examples where we can test the bounds of our systems in a way that's unlikely to damage the member experience. But that's less randomness, more by design. And so we're doing that in a few places that feels mostly good engineering practice so we can understand when it's really showtime and we're going to really test our systems, will they be able to perform like we want them to.\n\nLenny (00:53:42):\nRIP Chaos Monkey.\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:53:45):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:53:47):\nSo kind of along these lines of data, so data itself has always been at the heart of Netflix. My understanding is the way the data team and the insights team is structured has been one of the reasons Netflix has been so successful. And that's the team you led before you moved into this new role. Can you just talk about how these teams are structured and why this structure is so effective?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:54:14):\nYeah. I certainly like to think of it as being special. It's unusual. I can explain why. So the scale of company that Netflix now is very often data oriented teams are embedded in other parts of the business. So it could either be they're embedded in a business line like ads or games, or they are organized more functionally separating data engineers from data scientists, from analytics engineers, from consumer researchers. We've resisted that and kept a centralized team that is both functionally diverse. So across all those types of functions that I just described and works on nearly every area of the business from within the team. I sort of understand why a lot of companies move away from this because it really does require basically extraordinary partnership that we would have people working on data problems that don't report into the teams that are relying on them.\n\n(00:55:30):\nBut the benefit we get is we get to think about our functional expertise. So are we really world's best data engineers, world's best data scientists? And how do we continue to be ever better from a functional and technical perspective? It gives people better career paths because there's more mobility across the teams. It feels like a team that has a functional expertise with a lot of different problems to solve. And so I think it enables more cross-pollination of ideas in a way.\n\n(00:56:03):\nIt also allows us to be really objective. That is probably the most important thing, that our job is not to tell the story that someone wants to hear with the data or to solve the problem that someone thinks is most important. It's for us to have our own perspective about things. I think that that uplevels the whole organization because it means that we're able to be truth tellers or to be curious in a way that might not fit if we had a different organizational structure. We have to balance, that would be a good partner, deliver on the things we agreed were priorities, be flexible with how we're spending our time, but it gives us agency and responsibility beyond that. And I feel like the team takes that very seriously. So I've seen examples of that in how we bring data to a lot of spaces, including how we partner with engineering on data-related topics or how we partner with content that I'm not sure we would've gotten to if not for having that kernel that's sort of a center of excellence around it.\n\nLenny (00:57:10):\nAnd it's Data and Insights, that was the team that you ran. Insights, is that describing user research or what does that have function actually?\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:57:19):\nSo part of Data and Insights is a Consumer Insights team that includes a lot of different flavors of research really. So in some ways, consumer is even a misnomer because there's parts of the team that do internal research, for example, on tools and products for our studio productions. So that's more of a user research-oriented versus consumer. And then the parts of that team that are consumer-oriented do things all the way from content screenings to make titles the best version of themselves before they're on the service to more traditional UX research to think about how can we deliver the best title discovery experience or how can we think about things that improve accessibility? And then that team has a global remit. So there's also teams that are more local or regional expertise in understanding consumer needs and entertainment.\n\n(00:57:12):\nSo Consumer Insights and a team, formerly known as still kind of known as a shorthand, data science and engineering, combined together to create data and insights probably about two years ago. That's another piece that's unusual. It becomes truly a full-stack data and research expertise. And so we could tackle a problem like, what's the right way to think about recommendations and how best to surface them in a way that combines attitudinal research, qualitative and quantitative with behavioral research on more of the data science, data engineering analytics side.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nIt's super cool because I think it's really rare that what people think of user research is within the data org. And I think that might be a solution to some of the backlash a lot of user research teams get where they're like, I don't know, what are you guys doing all this anecdotal evidence if it's under the same org. I feel like that leads to a lot more credibility and avoids this like, \"Oh, data's telling me this thing. This user research team is telling me this thing. What should we do?\"\n\nElizabeth Stone (00:59:17):\nYeah, I mean, Consumer Insights is one of the newer teams for me; it wasn't in my background to lead a team like that and not in my individual training, but they are critical for making sure we keep a consumer orientation, a member orientation on things. I have loved to watch the teams collaborate on problems because we talk about it as a superpower internally in combining those skill sets. So I think the Consumer Insights team at Netflix has had a lot of credibility in a certain area of expertise and we took it to the next level by combining it with other functional expertise. So it's not required in every problem space. So we try not to overdo it and say we need to be collaborating everywhere because that just feels like the wrong expectation, but we try to make the most of it in spaces where we really benefit. So yeah, it's worked out really well.\n\nLenny (01:00:12):\nAwesome. Okay. I want to ask two more questions before we get to our very exciting lightning around. And they're both skills that [inaudible 01:00:08] have told me you're very good at. One is that you are very intentional and thoughtful about staying close to individual teams and individuals within the company, even though you're higher and higher in the org. I'm curious how you do that, how you actually practice this skill of staying really close to teams at the bottom of the ladder and individuals that are working on things on the ground basically?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:00:45):\nA lot of it is how I spend my time and fighting to preserve opportunities to connect with people. So examples would be, I still have biweekly office hours, people sign up for slots. It can feel a little like speed dating for 20 minute slots, but I get to meet a whole bunch of people and hear about work, hear what's top of mind. People book them out many months ahead and it's just an opportunity to stay in touch. And then I do Ask Me Anything sessions with teams of different sizes depending on how intimate we want it to feel, but truly anything is fair game as a way to get to know me as a person, for me to hear questions, to try to be candid about what I can answer or can't answer. And so those things have helped me maintain connection, but both of those examples are about making the time for it.\n\n(01:01:50):\nSo what I have found as my role has changed is that it just wouldn't happen if I didn't make it a priority. And then through those types of sessions, I do think I become or I hope to become more approachable so people know, \"You can send me a Slack message, you can send me an email. Like I mentioned earlier, I'm going to respond to you as quickly as I can because I want to hold myself to that bar.\" And so that builds a flow of communication between me and the team that I really value... I don't think I would want to do my job if I didn't have those points of connection, so that helps too.\n\nLenny (01:02:24):\nAnd you also send that email to everyone after every leadership meeting, so they're like, \"Oh yeah, Elizabeth.\"\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:02:28):\nYeah, they hear from me. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:31):\nKind of related to this, so we have a mutual friend, that's how we got connected. Ali Rao, she was a data scientist at Airbnb, now she's at Uber. She had a question that she wanted me to ask, and it's about how good you are at being present. So her question is something she's noticed about. \"Something I've noticed about her is how 100% present she is no matter who she talks to. Do you have any advice for people to get better at this? Because it's so hard in the day of email and iPhones and Slack.\" Her questions like, \"When does she respond to stuff if not sometimes in meetings?\"\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:03:05):\nI actually think I'm the most present when I'm having conversations like this one. I do preserve a lot of time to have one-on-one conversations where I'm genuinely curious about how someone's doing, how I can help them, what they're excited about that's authentic. And so while my EA would probably cringe at saying I like to spend time doing a lot of those one-on-ones, it is relatively easier for me to say the human connection is part of what I enjoy about this. I think that's true for a lot of people in what we get out of work and life, but I try to live that in those meetings. I'm probably not as good when we're talking about meetings of 30 people and I'm multitasking, so I'll admit to doing that for sure. But I think the one-on-one conversations I treat as being pretty sacred.\n\n(01:04:09):\nOne of the things I've noticed that helps me continue to invest in that and maybe is helpful for other people is some of my greatest friends and connections, including people like Ali, are people I met along the way professionally. So I worked very closely with Ally's husband, Keith Henwood, at multiple places, both Analysis Group and at Lyft. And that means that it's created opportunities and it's been points of connection. And so you get back what you give basically.\n\n(01:04:45):\nThere are people in my life who are part of my life because I worked with them or because I crossed paths. And I like to think that if I can make a positive mark on them, it'll come back and be at some point too. So I think to distill that is that I truly enjoy it. It's what I get out of especially work. And then it's my community. And that's served me really well over time. And so I have given people advice of, \"This is a small community, think about what you're investing in other people because that will matter down the line for yourself too\" and I try to live that myself.\n\nLenny (01:05:22):\nYeah, that's such good advice. There's kind of two things that come to mind there. One is treat people the way you want to be treated. Someone once said that maybe. And I think you've come back to this a couple times, this idea of just pay attention to what gives you energy and that you're good at and just almost double down on that. Just make that more and more of a superpower.\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:05:41):\nYeah, that last part resonates. It's been a big part of my personal and professional practice to reflect on how I'm feeling, what I'm excited about, what I'm enjoying. I do think it helps me be more grounded, which maybe helps me be more present or helps me be a better manager or leader. That might be part of the secret sauce too, but it is part of my practice.\n\nLenny (01:06:11):\nI can't help but ask, is this an actual practice? Do you do this on a regular basis or is this just something you think about like, \"I should reflect back\"?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:06:18):\nI wish I was so advanced to say I meditate and I create all this structure. It's more that I think I mentioned maybe I'm an introvert, so I do spend some time alone. That's how I recharge. And early mornings, especially people who know me sometimes are horrified at the time of day I send emails, but early mornings are a quiet time for me where I do try to have a daily check-in of just how are things going, why am I feeling anxious, why am I feeling excited. And it's kind of a muscle you build. So while I don't write in a journal, I don't have a meditation practice, I do have a time of day when I try to keep it protected from other things so that I can think for a second.\n\nLenny (01:07:05):\nWhat I think about there is Jeff Bezos has this approach in the morning. He just calls, he putters around. He has no meetings until I think 10:10 or something. He just wants to putter around, read the newspaper, see what's going on in email, which I'm trying to do. I really like that. That feels really good. I'm just going to putter around. I have no responsibilities in the morning.\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:07:22):\nI've never heard that. I'm going to adopt that language.\n\nLenny (01:07:27):\nI'm just puttering and puttering. Elizabeth, is there anything else you wanted to touch on or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:07:38):\nNo, I'm ready for the exciting lightning round.\n\nLenny (01:07:40):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:07:50):\nIt's probably a little recency bias, but I've been recommending What I Talk About When I Talk About Running by Murakami, which talks about introspection about the similarities between running and writing as sort of flow states and very meditative things. So I had read some of his fiction books and the autobiographical reflection on these types of either professions or hobbies I think is very insightful. So that's one. And then one of my longtime favorite books is A Fine Balance by Mistry. And that is just a great story of human complexity and challenge and relationships. So I'm drawn to both books and TV and film that are about humans.\n\nLenny (01:08:43):\nSpeaking of TV and film, this is maybe a high stakes question for someone that works in Netflix, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:08:52):\nI'm not going to name all Netflix. That feels too much like an advertisement. Film, Triangle of Sadness is phenomenal if you haven't seen it. And then I'll go Netflix for TV, Beef was I thought hysterical. I'm an Ali Wong fan, but also just a pretty unique storyline.\n\nLenny (01:09:18):\nAnd I think they just won a bunch of Emmys.\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:09:20):\nThey did.\n\nLenny (01:09:21):\nAmazing. Good picks. Next question. Do you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you are interviewing?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:09:29):\nHigh talent density. I'm usually looking for the person who would be better in my role than I am in my role. So I often ask people what would their priorities be, what would they do differently if they had my job.\n\nLenny (01:09:45):\nNext question, do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:09:52):\nSo while I carry the CTO title, I live a pretty analog life. So my most recent product is a Fellow pour-over coffee maker, which is actually part of my morning ritual, which I'll now call puttering around, where I take great lengths in my coffee-making process because I find it calming. And then it's not a recent find, but I have to shout out that my Peloton is probably the favorite product I own.\n\nLenny (01:10:22):\nThe bike or the treadmill?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:10:24):\nBike. I'm a recovering outdoor cyclist, so it's also kind of questionable if I can even admit to this, but that's why I would admit to I love the Peloton despite being ideally an outdoor cyclist.\n\nLenny (01:10:39):\nI have questions about your cycling, but before that question, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends or family that you find useful either in work or in life?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:10:50):\nMy mom said something to me that has stuck with me. I don't know if I live it very well, but the phrase was, \"Something good happens every day.\" And the reason she said it was because she was encouraging me to be more mindful about enjoying the small things in the day-to-day rather than letting myself get caught up in the busyness.\n\nLenny (01:11:13):\nBeautiful. Final question. You're a big biker and triathlete. I am curious what that sport and time has given you in your career or in life. What benefits have you found from spending so much time and energy, running, biking, being an athlete?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:11:32):\nCertainly by mental resilience. So while those sound like physical strength, I've found especially endurance sports are much more mental and how you go through the highs and lows and sustain and then coming back from challenge. So those sports have had their highs and lows and from the lows I've really learned how to recover and bounce back. So those feel like universally applicable skills.\n\nLenny (01:12:04):\nYou have such an interesting mix of athleticism and then Netflix, what a good balance for life. This is going to give me permission to go watch Netflix recording this on Friday afternoon. Elizabeth, you're awesome. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe follow up on things? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nElizabeth Stone (01:12:24):\nYou can always find me on LinkedIn, so definitely reach out or ping me if you have questions or comments. I think the way the listeners can be useful to me is being maybe curious about how they can show up even better in their lives now that we've done this reflection on Netflix culture and how we show up for other people. I would like to ask listeners to pay that forward to people that they're working with and how they show up for them.\n\nLenny (01:13:02):\nAmazing. I love that. If you end up doing this and you're listening, maybe leave a comment on YouTube or in Substack with something that you haven't covered about yourself.

There's just so much theoretical conversation and examining the big blunders, but at the end of the day, if you're a startup that wants to get coverage for your company, you need to know actually the steps to take to do it.\n\nLenny (00:00:13):\nYou mentioned a bunch of amazing companies you've worked with, Ram Perplexity. Most products won't have this interesting of a story to tell. How do you help find something that is a nugget?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:00:21):\nYou can get so in the weeds with your own messaging that you want to set up this massive problem statement, you want to make it a huge trend story, but if you're very straightforward and you're pattern matching, it's generally actually going to work.\n\nLenny (00:00:32):\nSo I asked you to bring some examples of pitches that are great and also examples of pitches that could be better.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:00:39):\nI want to read one to you and then I want to see if you can tell me what this company does.\n\nLenny (00:00:44):\nDeal. Today, my guest is Emilie Gerber. Emilie is the founder and CEO of Six Eastern, a PR agency that has worked with over 100 tech companies, from stealth startups to publicly traded companies, helping them get press, build awareness, and level up their PR and comms strategy. Before starting her own firm, she worked at Uber where she led PR for the business development team and B2B programs. Prior to that, she worked at Box on product communications with a focus on product launches and partnership announcements. In our conversation, Emilie shares so many golden nuggets of advice on how to get press that I lost count.\n\n(00:01:23):\nWe talk about which publications to target depending on your market and story, how to craft your pitch and your outreach to reporters, how to actually reach reporters, and also how to craft your product story for people to pay attention to what you're doing, why warm introductions to reporters aren't actually that important, how to find podcasts and newsletters to pitch that might be even more effective than traditional media, how much it would cost you to work with a PR agency instead of doing it yourself, and how much lead time you need if you do that.\n\n(00:01:50):\nAlso, we go through a few real-life examples of press and outreach, both good examples and bad examples, and what we can learn from those. Also, we look at a pitch that Emilie sent to me about a podcast guest that is a client of hers that worked, and this guest is coming out in the future, so we look at what was effective about that pitch, and so much more.

Emilie, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:04:59):\nYeah, thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:05:01):\nSo we're going to be talking about press. A lot of people say that trying to get press isn't really worth your time. It doesn't drive signups, it doesn't drive growth. You could spend your time on other things and have a lot more impact there, and I know that you have a really interesting perspective on second order effects of press and other benefits. So I'm curious to hear, what's your perspective on this idea, that press isn't really worth people's time and how can press be helpful?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:05:27):\nYeah, when we were emailing about it, talking about some of the articles that you were in, some of the coverage that you got, I was thinking about how, in your case, you have multiple audiences. You have your customers, which in a way, are your listeners and the people that are engaging with your content. So in a way, you're a B2C business, but in another way, you're a B2B business. Obviously, you have sponsors and you're trying to attract really great guests to come on the show, and so there's a second order piece of the press is validating that you're something that a software company wants to sponsor. So internally, they're making those decisions. Not everyone might know Lenny's podcast, but they could send around a CNBC article and see that this is something very legit and something that people care about. It just signals that third-party validation that I think is really important, and that ties back to, when you look at a SaaS company or something and they're making decisions, having that validation, I think, and that credibility goes a really long way.\n\n(00:06:24):\nEspecially for a company that might be early stage, they've raised a little bit of money, I think sometimes the buyers are skeptical of engaging with new tools, because they're worried they might not raise more funding, or it might go away tomorrow, and so the more that you can validate the business through things that's not just you doing personally that other people are doing, I think the better. So I think, yeah, that's the value from the B2B perspective and it's not necessarily going to directly drive signups, but when that AE is sending their sales emails and they can link to a story, I think that really helps. Also, candidates too, when you're reaching... If it's a recruiter reaching out on LinkedIn and they only have 100 characters to make their pitch, linking to that story can be really powerful.\n\n(00:07:03):\nSo those are some of the second-order effects for B2B. And then, on the consumer side, it's a much more complex issue. There's affiliate marketing, which is this whole world of paid, where you're getting product reviews and that sort of thing, and that's not really an area that I'm an expert on, but we do work with some consumer companies where press is a major driver of growth. So for instance, Perplexity, they have invested essentially zero in any paid marketing, they don't have a marketing person even, but they do do PR. And so essentially, after their most recent announcement, they saw a massive spike in growth, a massive spike in signups, pro users, all of that. And I think, in that case, the reason PR works so well is...\n\n(00:07:47):\nFirst of all, it's something that's very easy to grasp. Google alternative. I know how to use Google, I've used Google a million times, you can go to perplexity.com. The barrier to trying the product is very low, you can quickly type in a query, get the answer, and then see the power of the tool. It takes one time to see the power of the tool. So in that case, I think just organic press is enough to generate that. There's not a long process to get the customers interested, so... Yeah. I mentioned very case to case, but in those instances, it works well,\n\nLenny (00:08:18):\nMan, there's so many threads I want to follow here. That was such an interesting answer. And by the way, I love Perplexity. I once tweeted a result I had when I was using Perplexity, and that was one of their default questions you could ask about strawberries. Apparently, strawberries are not one fruit, strawberries are a bundle of fruits and every little piece of a strawberry, those little red things, are individual fruits all bundled together, which blew my mind. I was like, \"I need to share this,\" and so I wonder how much of their growth just comes from crazy things like that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:08:45):\nYeah, it's like the kind of tool where your mom could try it and instantly know how to use it. Yeah. It's good for weird questions, like what you just shared. That's where it comes in really handy.\n\nLenny (00:08:55):\nYou did a great job just defaulting, \"Here's weird questions you could ask,\" and then, wow, what an answer. Okay, so on the B2B side, I think this is really interesting. When people are thinking about doing the calculus of, \"Is it worth investing and trying to get press for a B2B business?\" Related to what we were talking about offline. So when I got these stories in Fast company, I got a story in CNBC, I got a story in Entrepreneur Magazine, and I was telling you I've seen zero growth impact from all these stories. And you'd think like, \"Wow.\" I had a story in the magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, print edition, and nothing comes from it as far as I can tell.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:09:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:09:30):\nAnd your point, which really stuck with me, is the real benefit isn't that first order growth impact, it's... And I've been doing this, it's when I'm emailing potential guests telling them, \"Hey, check out my work or my profile in these magazines.\" And just having those little logos is really powerful, and that's why you see those logos on people's websites. So is your advice here, basically, for B2B businesses than most? If the pie chart of impact of press, most of that percentage is just having a logo of an awesome publication on your website and your outbound emails, and things like that?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:10:06):\nYeah, the logo is a piece of it and then also the storytelling part. Maybe they're not going to read eight paragraphs that you wrote about your business, but if it's in the format of an article, I think they're more likely to take the time to do it. One other, I guess, aspect of it is content. So for instance, the articles that people want to write about you are not about necessarily how great your podcast is, which it is, but more about how you created this business. And so it's more through the lens of you're an entrepreneur, you have built this media empire, and so that's not necessarily the kind of story that's going to drive your core audience to sign up, and so contents is part of it, too. And so we work with companies where we get them great stories about their company culture and cool initiatives that they're doing, because reporters are interested in that topic. That's not going to help their sales, but it might help with something like recruiting. And so yeah, I think thinking... That's the other piece of it, is thinking through the content.\n\nLenny (00:11:03):\nThat's such a good point, because the story they're going to write about you isn't, \"This is the best product you've ever seen,\" this is, \"Look at this interesting journey this startup has gone on,\" and that's not going to convince your customers, it's going to convince other people just to read this publication, but the fact that they wrote about you is really beneficial. And then you're saying B2C, most of the benefit is actually driving growth and you've seen lots of examples of press driving significant growth.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:11:27):\nYeah, I think it can be and I think this is one where, yeah, it's a little more case-to-case, because we have some clients where they need to invest heavily in affiliate, because product reviews are what they need or they want to be on lists of the best vacuum cleaner, or whatever category, and it's less about getting them big features. And so there's different ways of doing it for B2C. But yeah, I do think it's like... Yeah, there's two camps, affiliate or not affiliate.\n\nLenny (00:12:00):\nCan you actually explain this affiliate bucket? Because I'm not actually that familiar with it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:12:00):\nI can. However, we actually don't do affiliate marketing, so there's probably going to be a lot of people that have a much more insightful perspective on it, but affiliate is essentially when you work with a publication to give them a percentage of any sales that come from the piece of the article. And so if you look at Business Insider's list of best personal finance tools, it'll say at the top that they're getting commission. So they track the links, they figure out a certain percentage, and then they basically get a percentage of all the sales that come in, and it's very common. I would say most consumer companies are doing this, but yes, there's entire agencies that are dedicated to that field.\n\nLenny (00:12:38):\nWow, I didn't actually know that was such a big thing. I've heard of affiliate marketing where you get paid for promoting something, I didn't know Business Insider did this as a revenue.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:12:48):\nYeah, and I don't want to call out just... I mean, I would say every publication that's doing product reviews for the most part, I believe, it's a very common practice.\n\nLenny (00:12:58):\nWow. All right, already learning a lot. Okay, so I definitely want to start talking about how to actually get press for your product, but one quick question about fundraising announcements. So I'm an investor in a lot of companies, very often, they email me and ask for advice how to get press and, most of the time, it's a fundraising milestone. When is it worth investing trying to get press and fundraising? Like always worth trying, rarely worth your effort? Does it have to be some really impressive fundraising moment? What do you suggest?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:13:32):\nI also think not all PR people are going to agree with this, but I do think funding rounds, you can always get a reporter to cover if you go about it the right way. I mean, we scope out projects that are just for funding announcements, we've never had to not finish that project or we've never... I wouldn't do that if it wasn't possible, so I think there's a couple of reasons that it sometimes doesn't work out. But I guess just to take a step back on funding stories, a lot of founders automatically think that, \"I raise money, so TechCrunch will cover this.\" The reality is... Someone tweeted, actually someone from another agency, I should... Propeller PR, they tweeted that they counted how many funding stories TechCrunch did in a week, and it was nine, so they had written nine funding stories in one week. And then they counted how many funding rounds actually happened that week by looking at Axis Parata and Fortune Term Sheet, and it was like 50.\n\n(00:14:26):\nSo it seems... When you go to TechCrunch, it looks like, \"It's all funding stories, so mine should be one of these.\" That's not the case at all. But I do think, if you go about it the right way, you can be one of those nine. And I'm talking about TechCrunch specifically here only because the reality is they are the publication that's going to be most likely to write your funding story, that's just kind of the way it works. And it's not a bad thing, they're actually... They don't have a paywall, they tend to do a very good job, they understand it. It's a well-oiled machine, and so we know if you've done a story with them, it's going to pretty much go how you want to plan it. So when you go to pitch a funding story, I think the first thing that founders, or whoever is reaching out on behalf of the company, does wrong is they convolute the message.\n\n(00:15:10):\nWhen we pitch a funding story, we make it very clear, \"Hey, we're reaching out with a startup launch or funding. We're offering this to you as an exclusive, meaning we're not going to pitch anyone else if you take the story. Here's the amount that's raised, here's the space that... Here's the space they're in and here are the investors.\" I think you can get so in the weeds with your own messaging, that you want to set up this massive problem statement, you want to make it a huge trend story. You don't really say what you're trying to accomplish from it, but if you're very straightforward and you're pattern matching, \"Hey, this TechCrunch reporter is the one that covers FinTech. I have a FinTech funding round, here's the reason my FinTech funding round matters.\" It's generally actually going to work and now it does 100% takes follow up.\n\n(00:15:50):\nYou're not shooting off one email, you are respectfully following up. When I follow up, I like to come in with some new information, whether it's something they had tweeted in the past couple of days, a new article that they wrote, very respectful. I try to wait three or four days. If it's not going anywhere, then try someone else. Do that three or four times with the most relevant reporters. Generally, I think it works. Yeah, I think if you can just be really concise and direct and say what you're looking for out of the relationship, it tends to be a pretty easy process. And yeah, TechCrunch is one publication, but this actually goes for a bunch.\n\nLenny (00:16:24):\nAmazing. I love that we're already getting into tactical advice for how to actually get press. So that was essentially for fundraising and the notes I took is keep it really simple, \"Here's how much we raise, here's our investors. Here's one line about why this matters.\" I want to talk later about how pitching press is different for customers, because with customers, I think this is probably the mistake a lot of people make, and we don't have to get into this just yet, but you want to paint the picture of the market and trends and, \"Here's where the market's going and why this is huge and why this is a solution to your problem,\" versus, \"Bam, this is interesting for this reason,\" and that's it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:16:56):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:16:57):\nOkay. I want to talk about publications to target and what each one is best suited for. So you're talking about how TechCrunch is essentially really good for fundraising. When I think about other publications, there's like Axios and Verge, I don't know if they do press stories like this. Wall Street Journal, New York Times, things like that. So I guess, what are the different publications people should have on their list of target? And then, what are each of them most aligned to, story-wise?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:17:28):\nI really love this question. I feel like no one ever gets this tactical in PR. There's just so much theoretical conversation and examining the big blunders and... It's all so high level, but at the end of the day, if you are a startup that wants to get coverage for your company, you need to know actually the steps to take to do it. So yeah, I appreciate that question. I'm going to answer it, but also answer it with the caveat that media changes so much and so fast. For instance, just a couple weeks ago, TechCrunch decided they no longer accept op-eds, which is... It's actually huge news for us, because we love doing op-eds in TechCrunch, and so things change all the time, but I will talk about it in its current state. So yes, TechCrunch, a go-to for a lot of funding announcements. A go-to for some product news, too, even sometimes.\n\n(00:18:15):\nI would say the areas where they don't have dedicated beat reporters, where we tend to end up not working with them, are health tech-related companies and even MarTech, too. We've struggled to find the right folks to cover those kinds of stories. So not everything, but generally, if you do your digging, you're able to find a relevant beat reporter or a couple of relevant beat reporters, and it's not just about getting coverage there. They have TechCrunch Disrupt, you can apply for speaking at that conference, and that sometimes actually directly turns into coverage. They have The Found Podcast, which interviews founders, and so if you have a really compelling founder story or topical founder story, that can be an excellent avenue to go as well. They have The Equity Pod, which is investment advice, so it's not just thinking about getting that one funding story with them, there are other ways to work with TechCrunch.\n\n(00:19:02):\nAnd I actually have heard really great feedback from clients on TechCrunch driving website traffic, the day of the announcement, especially... I haven't really been able to pinpoint when that does or doesn't happen. I'm trying to figure out if there's trends among that, but I have... Clients have sent me screenshots from the day of the announcement and they've seen a nice pickup from TechCrunch, so I think a lot of that comes down to the fact that they don't have a paywall, but their stuff tends to do really well. So it's a great spot, especially for that first piece on your company. Axios is really strong on the FinTech side, on the healthcare side, they have some really great beat reporters. The one thing I'll say about them is they're very deals-focused, so 100% would need to either have funding. If you're announcing a partnership that has a monetary component, that they would cover that. An acquisition they would consider covering, but they're not going to be... You should never pitch them on a product announcement.\n\n(00:19:58):\nAnd I think they might just get annoyed. There's a couple exceptions, a couple of the reporters might have little columns where they feature product-related things, but that's just not their bread and butter. And actually, Axios recently launched, or I guess has been launching over the past year or so, local editions. So they're really branching into local news, and so that can actually be a really nice way to get an Axios hit if you have a region-specific story. So I highly recommend checking that out. Another publication that we work with a bunch is Business Insider. If you struggle to pitch your funding story but really want it out in the world, they are big on the pitch deck stories. Those are a little controversial. Some founders, they're like, \"This is not what I want my story to be about, I do not want to share my pitch deck.\"\n\n(00:20:44):\nBut if you are in the camp of... You're open to that and you can redact, it does not need to have all the financials, it does not need to have the growth metrics, that can be a really great way to get a piece of coverage on your business. And the way that I explain it to clients is you're just getting all your core messages out there in a very direct way. You're sharing exactly what you shared with investors, that's not necessarily a bad thing. And sometimes clients will put in some customer slides, too, and so you can really make it a little bit more like what you're looking for. So yes, if you're looking for a funding story, TechCrunch passed, others passed, that's a good option. They also are huge on the entrepreneurial journey pieces, similar to the CNBC article that you got, but they really want metrics, they really push for metrics, so how much you're making, how much you're spending.\n\n(00:21:35):\nThey love those kinds of stories, so it's not necessarily about how much you raise, but for people that have really built a business. And then the last thing for Business Insider, they do a bunch of these lists of top startups, of top professionals in the field. We love doing those, they're generally a really light list, and they put out a call for submissions. Takes five minutes and it's a way to get into Business Insider. There's so many of them, it's become a joke within my newsletter, because every week, there's five more and it's the most obscure different categories. Like top sports marketing professionals helping TikTok stars. I don't know, it's always a very niche ask, but those could be really great. Then a couple more.\n\n(00:22:16):\nVentureBeat is huge for AI news. We pitch them all the time for any client that we work with that is building AI capabilities, has a new offering related to AI, perfect publication for that. Fast Company is perfect for anything related to future of work, how people work. Really great for design, media, I would say perfect for any company that fits in those categories. They're also really open to op-eds, especially with leadership advice in them. And last but not least, on the list of ones that we work with most often, I would say is Forbes. Especially on the award side, they have the FinTech 50, AI 50, Forbes Under 30, all of that. And you're not going to get a feature with one of their main reporters until you're a bit further along, but they do have that really strong contributor network, which is much... A lower bar in what they'll accept, in a way. They're more open to covering earlier stage companies, so that's worth checking out, too. So those are my top ones, I'll stop there.\n\nLenny (00:23:15):\nThat's amazing. And those are the most commonly requested and the ones you mostly go after?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:23:20):\nYeah, they're the most realistic for most startups. There are ones like The Verge, and they're a little more gadget-focused and just areas that we don't necessarily touch, but could be good for some companies as well.\n\nLenny (00:23:33):\nGot it, and then... I was going to say this for later, but there's obviously New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. Thoughts on going after those?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:23:42):\nYeah, we do get those questions all the time. I would say it comes up on calls with founders, \"I want one out of every five.\" And really, when you look at... I make a joke sometimes like, \"If you want those, just have a crisis and they'll write about it.\" Fire your CEO or do really intense layoffs and have some regulatory issue.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:24:00):\nPlayoffs and have some regulatory issue and you'll get a story there.\n\nLenny (00:24:04):\nUber got a lot of stories there.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:24:06):\nYeah, I can show some examples there. When you look at earlier stage companies that are getting coverage in those publications, that's what's happening.\n\n(00:24:13):\nNow, let's say you're a tiny bit further along and you're series B, series C, maybe even series C, and you're looking for coverage in those publications, there's a couple criteria that they're always going to want if it's to write a feature on your company. One is your valuation, so that needs to be something that you're sharing on the record. Two is your hard business metrics, usually revenue, sometimes something else. And so oftentimes they'll tell founders that and immediately they're like, \"Oh, well we're not sharing that.\" So I'm like, \"Okay, well that's kind of the end of the conversation.\" Sometimes it can be shared on background, but as a general rule, you're expected to share that sort of thing. So that's kind of a nonstarter a lot of times.\n\n(00:24:51):\nI totally think it makes sense to build relationships with the relevant beat reporters and ideally shoot for... When I say build relationships, I just mean shoot for an intro meeting on behalf of the clients, or they can reach out directly with those kinds of reporters, but they're just not going to write a feature on your company. If anything, you are going to be one or two sentences in a larger story of something that they're writing about. And yeah, that's just the nature of their coverage.\n\n(00:25:16):\nAnd then when you look at something like CNBC, they're targeting people that want to learn about public markets. And so if you're not a public company, they have their CNBC Disruptor 50 list, which is focused on companies that will soon be at that stage, but it's not going to be a place for early stage companies.\n\nLenny (00:25:32):\nWhen I have these pieces in past company and CNBC, it was such a weird experience where I chat with them for half an hour and then it just comes out, and I have no idea what they're going to write about. Could be a complete tear down of everything I'm doing and you have no idea. How do you help try to avoid that sort of story? I know you have no control. Obviously reporters can write what they want to write about. Do you have any advice for how to avoid them writing something really negative about you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:25:58):\nGenerally, if it's something that you're being briefed in advance, unless it is around something negative that's going on, it's just not their intention, it's just not going to happen. But what is a bigger issue is it not being the angle or the messaging that the company wants. And so part of that, there's absolutely nothing that we can do. Reporters are not our employees. We're not paying them to write these pieces. They have to maintain their editorial integrity.\n\n(00:26:25):\nAnd so I consider it my job to educate the founders and spokespeople that we work with that we cannot change anything the story says. What we can do is correct any factual inaccuracies, and we do that all the time. If something is factually wrong, we can get it replaced. But if they don't like that they were called, put in a category of software that they don't identify with, that's not something that we can fix.\n\n(00:26:50):\nAnother thing that you can do though to prevent that from happening is just really ensuring that the spokesperson before talking to the reporter is going to nail the messages that they want. The more that you can reiterate over and over again how you want the article to be, I think the more likely that it'll land in the reporter's head and make sure that the reporter really understands what you're building and what your goals are. And all you can do is really use the briefing and the materials that you provide to kind of sway and influence, but there's not much beyond that.\n\nLenny (00:27:20):\nSo we've talked about all these publications. These are ones to consider going after. You also mentioned podcasts and awards as something people go after. Is there a tip you could share of how to find aligned podcasts or awards, like how you find a list of here we should go after these?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:27:35):\nWe use Google. We just use search engines basically for finding everything. And the way that we go about it is first figuring out who their customers are and what vertical they're in, and then just doing searches for podcasts that are within that vertical.\n\n(00:27:48):\nBut it's not as easy as just reaching out to the ones that pop up first. The next step is a qualitative analysis. First of all, do they have vendor CEOs or vendor executives on their show? Let's say your product is sold to product managers. Maybe they only have product managers on the show. So instead you don't put the CEO forward and you put the right spokesperson-\n\nLenny (00:28:11):\nWho could that be? What podcast might that be referring to?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:28:12):\nYeah, right? But this could be for CFOs. So let's say you sell into CFOs. Don't pitch your CEO for that podcast. Get a CFO and then pitch your CFO for that podcast. I'm very for companies hiring folks, or hiring so the roles that they sell into, it helps us a lot. So if your audience is a CFO, it really helps if you have a CFO. If your audience is a CMO, it really helps if you have a CMO, and that actually when your earlier stage isn't always the case, and so it's a lot harder to pitch. So I think that's the second part of the qualitative analysis.\n\n(00:28:48):\nThe third is, podcasts really come and go, make sure... It sounds obvious, but make sure it's one that's actively producing. When you Google ones, half of them are not going to be active podcasts. And then the third is actually listening to at least part of one episode, making sure the quality is high, making sure it's the kind of thing you even want to associate yourself with. And then just looking at who the past guests are, is that the kind of peers that you want to associate yourself with?\n\n(00:29:14):\nAnd then one other thing that you can do is just in conversations with customers, find out what they're listening to, find out what they're watching, find out their media diet. And it doesn't have to be a big crazy survey that you send to your entire customer base. It can be casual. If you're farther along, it's great if you can make that a more formal sort of process, but it doesn't necessarily need to be.\n\n(00:29:33):\nAnd then in terms of reaching out, I highly recommend figuring out who the host is, just doing the research, figuring out who the host is, and then just sending them a casual note. I'm a big fan of just reaching out on LinkedIn and saying, \"Hey, love the show. Are you open to guest ideas?\" I don't even mention the client or anything, just opening the door. I just feel like that's so much more approachable and friendly than starting with a big pitch. And I think so many people start with this very long email introducing themselves or going really deep and you don't have to do that. And especially because maybe only one out of every 10 replies, it'll also save you a lot of time if you just start with something really lightweight.\n\nLenny (00:30:15):\nI think that actually works really well. That's what I find is if it's a simple little message, I'm like, yeah, let me know what you got in mind. Even though 99% of the time it doesn't work out, sometimes it works out great. And so I find, sure, let's just see what you got. And then usually I'm just like, \"Nope, sorry, not a fit.\"\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:30:28):\nAnd you get the reply that way. If you send the initial pitch and the reporter or podcast host isn't interested, chances are they won't reply. But if you just start with something friendly and they reply, they'll feel like, I guess a little more of a connection there, and so at least you'll get an answer. Whereas otherwise, you might not get an answer at all.\n\nLenny (00:30:48):\nOn the survey piece I think that's a great idea, and I've seen a few of my sponsors do this where they ask their customers, what podcast do you listen to? What newsletters do you read? Which is such a simple idea, but I think people don't do that. And just from that you could figure out, okay, here's the podcast we got to get on. Here's the newsletters we want to run after.\n\n(00:31:06):\nI want to talk about how to actually pitch well. But before that, we've been talking a bit about who to reach out to and how to do that. So there's a few questions here. It's just like how important is it to have a warm connection to a reporter? If you don't have that, what's the best way to reach out to them? Is it LinkedIn, is it Twitter DMs, something else? What advice do you have about, just before we get into the structure of the pitch, figuring out who to pitch and then how to get to that advice?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:31:34):\nWho are your relationships question comes up on a lot of our calls with founders as well. I'd like to pose the question to you. Did we have a relationship before this?\n\nLenny (00:31:43):\nNope.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:31:44):\nExactly. I'm of the belief that it does not matter as much as many people think it does. And I explained this on calls where they ask, \"Oh, tell me about your Rolodex, or who is your relationships with?\" First of all, media's changing so fast. So sure, maybe there is a reporter that we worked with recently. They might have a completely different beat in six months. They might be at a very different publication. So it's not sustainable to build an entire career on having relationships with certain publications.\n\n(00:32:17):\nAnd media is changing too. Now, podcasts and Substack and newsletters, it is just changing too fast. And so I think cold outreach done well is just as effective. The only thing that a relationship will get you is an open and an answer. And so any good reporter is not going to be making their editorial decisions based on who their friends are. That's just not the nature. It shouldn't be the nature of the industry, and it's not. Maybe it'll get you an intro coffee, but that's about it. It's not going to get you coverage. They're not going to cover your news because there's a relationship there. I think the much harder and more important part is being good at writing really thoughtful notes to the right people.\n\n(00:32:57):\nAnd in a way, now we do have a relationship, and so it can come from a cold email, but now it's easier for me to pitch you because you know my name and we've spoken and we've worked together. And so for me, I'm a big fan of being helpful to reporters, and I tend to just keep it professional and pitch them on stories. I don't necessarily feel like going to drinks or having coffee all the time is crucial to building those relationships. A lot of the reporters that I work with regularly, I've never met in person, and that's okay, but it can be great for getting answers I would say. That's where the relationships can be helpful.\n\n(00:33:35):\nAnd then once you have worked with a reporter on a story, it's true that maybe they'll be more likely to come back when they're working on something related, use you as a source, quote you in articles that are relevant. So once there's something there, that's great and you should totally nurture it, but it's not all about calling in favors.\n\nLenny (00:33:52):\nAwesome. Okay. And then in terms of how to reach reporters, what do you find most effective?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:33:59):\nYeah, I'm pro all platform approach. So sometimes reporters will tweet that they're working on a story about something, and rather than me sending them an email with my pitch, I'll say, \"Hey, 10 words on why this person is the person you should talk to,\" and then send a link to an article on them and that's my entire pitch. And honestly, it's sometimes more effective than when I spend 30 minutes writing a really thoughtful email. So I'm a fan of that. I'm a fan of DMs, short, concise, direct DMs. Sometimes LinkedIn, although for whatever reason I feel like that works better with on the podcast side with hosts.\n\n(00:34:38):\nAnd then of course email, we totally email. When I email a reporter, I love to make the subject line just as clear as possible as what the goal is and why I'm emailing them. And so let's say it's for a recurring column that they have, I'll put the name of that column and the person that I think should be included in the subject line. And even that for a reporter, it's like, oh, they actually know. They actually know I write this column and they're suggesting a guest for this column. It's so direct, it's so clear.\n\n(00:35:06):\nI think just saying what your intentions are right away. Are you trying to get a Q&A? Are you trying to get a story? Are you trying to get a funding story, like I mentioned before, is very crucial, and keeping it short. I would say my most successful pitches are three sentences and anytime... Sometimes it needs to be longer than that, and generally I feel like my pitch is weaker for that reason. Attention spans are short, and so the more concise you can make it, the better. And then just sometimes I'll start with one platform. I'll start with an email and that doesn't work, so I'll go somewhere else. But I try to make it very human and respectful. So using language like, \"Hey, I know your inbox is probably slammed. Sorry to annoy. Trying you one more time here.\"\n\n(00:35:49):\nAnother thing that actually can work really well is pointing out gaps in their coverage too, and talking about things that they should be talking about. Like, Hey, my client's noticing this trend. I know you've covered it from this point of view, but no one's talking about it from this point of view. That can be really helpful because it shows that you are actually paying attention to what they are writing, but in a way that you're demonstrating that you have some critical thinking going on, not just, I liked your article on X, which is a common practice that PR people use is I like this, and then jump to your pitch. So yeah, giving it a little more thoughtful, pointing out gaps in coverage.\n\n(00:36:25):\nAnd then the last piece is, especially if you don't have hard news that you're pitching, having something pretty controversial to say.\n\n(00:36:33):\nSo we work with a lot of AI companies. If nine of them have one stance on something happening in the field and one has the other stance, chances are that one is going to be the one that a reporter wants to talk to because they are getting so many pitches on this topic, but they want to write a balanced article, they need that opposing view. And so we really push our clients to have something unique and different and bold to say. And it obviously has to be a strategic decision for the business. You don't want to go commenting on regulatory things if it sounds like you don't want to necessarily be a part of that conversation, but there are I think instances where it can make a lot of sense to say something that's a little bit bold and controversial.\n\nLenny (00:37:15):\nThat last piece is really interesting. Is there an example that comes to mind where you had a controversial contrarian pitch?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:37:23):\nYeah, so we work with a company called Clockwise, which essentially manages your calendar and allows time for focus time within your workday. They move things around for you. And a couple of months ago, Shopify got tons of positive press for essentially canceling all their recurring meetings, and everyone was very intrigued by this strategy. Press was generally quite positive towards it, and so we knew that if we just wrote another piece saying, \"Oh, this is great,\" no one would want to publish that. It had been said in a million different ways. So we looked at the topic a little more critically and we're like, okay, is this actually enough to change meeting culture within a business? And we kind of identified all these other things that we think need to happen in order to really change the culture in a way that's going to be sustainable and long-term versus just blanket deleting of calendar meetings.\n\n(00:38:14):\nAnd so we ended up turning this into an op-ed, so something that together we wrote and then pitched a publication. And yeah, the title was \"Shopify's Meeting Cost Calculator Does Not Address the Issue of Wasted Time\". And so it wasn't necessarily saying it was a horrible idea, but it was putting a little bit more of a critical eye towards it. And Fast Company was interested in the idea and they posted the piece by the CEO, Matt Martin, and it was a great thing for us to comment on. And so yeah, I think it doesn't necessarily need to be something where you're coming out against it, but just proposing something that's a little more thoughtful on the topic.\n\nLenny (00:38:53):\nJust hearing that it sounds like such an obvious thing to do. Basically a reporter is looking for an interesting story to write about. If you tell them something interesting that they could put out, that's a win-win for everybody. So makes a ton of sense. Let me try to summarize the advice you've shared so far when you're, say DMing a reporter, your advice so far is basically be very direct. Just tell them, \"Hey, I'm looking for...\" What's an example of being direct? Is it like I'm looking for a story on this fundraising announcement?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:39:19):\nI wouldn't say I'm looking for. I don't know, just I would say if it was a DM, I would say, \"Reaching out from X company. Would love to offer you the launch story alongside their funding if you're open to it.\" And usually I'd either say the amount and the investors or the company name. If you give them both, you're kind of just giving them the story and they could run with it right away. That's actually an important distinction. And so you could either say, \"Reaching out with this Martech company that's raised 8 million from X Investors. Really interesting approach, they're taking on X incumbent. Do you want the exclusive?\" That's kind of how I would phrase it.\n\nLenny (00:39:59):\nOkay, awesome. Then, try to keep it to three sentences. And you're saying sometimes when you go longer, you actually end up backfiring each time. Sometimes include a link to a story they've written or some other story about the company that might give them some context. Is that right?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:40:15):\nYeah. And a caveat on that is, if a competing publication just wrote a bigger similar feature on that, they're not going to want to see that. And so I would use that strategically. If it's a piece from a while ago on a different topic that does share a lot of info, I'll include it, but I'm not necessarily going to include something that might seem like why would I cover this when this was just written about.\n\nLenny (00:40:37):\nGood point. You also talked about how try to acknowledge their inbox is probably slammed, and this is taking some time maybe in follow-ups, especially like, Hey, I realize your inbox is slammed, just thought I'd come back to this. Then you talk about this idea of identifying gaps in the writing, like, Hey, it seems like you cover Gen AI. There's this trend that we've been noticing that maybe it would be interesting to cover. And then something controversial or something a little contrarian that would get them. Oh yeah, this could be a really interesting story.\n\n(00:41:08):\nAwesome.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:41:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:41:09):\nIs there anything else broadly in terms of pitch advice to get the attention of a reporter that comes to mind? And I know this is a lifetime of experience and it's hard to summarize all of it, but anything else?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:41:24):\nWell, one topic, maybe this would be covered elsewhere, but one topic I think is talking about incumbents that this company is taking on. So a lot of companies want to position themselves as category creators, and I actually hate that. It doesn't work. It doesn't land with press, and most of the time it's not totally true.\n\n(00:41:46):\nAnd so instead, it's actually really great when you can talk about how you are doing what X household name does, but better for X reasons, and that works so well. I'll put that in subject lines. I'll put company taking on whatever Salesforce with X approach. It's so successful because instantly it gives the reporter a frame of reference. And so it gives the reporter, oh, I know what Salesforce does, so I can understand how this solution would be better. And a lot of companies really want to position themselves as the first to do anything in a certain space. They love the idea of category creating, creating these little marketing phrases that they use for the new category. And that's fine if perhaps that works on the sales side, but on the PR side, I would never have put that in a pitch.\n\nLenny (00:42:35):\nThere's just going to be a meta comment, but the two topics that are most controversial in this podcast that I have both sides of opinions on is the power of category creation and jobs to be done.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:42:48):\nOh, really?\n\nLenny (00:42:49):\nThere's a lot of passion on both sides.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:42:52):\nI mean, sure, you can point to examples of the two companies that have done category creation well, but it's two out of what, thousands?\n\nLenny (00:43:06):\nI love it. I'm going to keep poking this hornet's nest. I love it. Okay. But you're saying in your experience doesn't work when pitching reporters?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:43:10):\nFor PR. Yeah, simply for PR. In other areas of the business I can't comment on, but for PR, it's just not a useful tactic.\n\nLenny (00:43:18):\nOkay, awesome. This episode is brought to you by Vanta.

So thank you for doing the homework. Let's pull them up and then I'd love to just show people what you find has been really effective and works great about these examples and then what somebody could have done better, whatever you want to share about that example.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:44:35):\nSure. Sounds good. I guess since we're on the topic of category creating versus not category creating, I'll start with an example that's very relevant to that. So we worked with RAMP in their very early days, and one of their first product announcements that we did together was the launch of their bill pay offering. And so at the time, I think they were like a three billion dollar company, something along those lines. So big, but not as big as they are today. Product news rarely gets big feature coverage, especially for something along the lines of a bill pay offering for B2B companies.\n\n(00:45:09):\nAnd so essentially the way that we framed the story was how RAMP was now able to take on Bill.com, which at the time I'm not sure if it still is, was one of the best performing FinTech IPOs public company that really had still only captured two percent of this market overall. And so by positioning it as allowing them to take on this massive incumbent that was getting a lot of press, we actually were able to get a CNBC story on the launch of this product. Generally they won't even consider product stories, but they really liked the angle of this underdog doing something that could take on a piece of market share from them.\n\n(00:45:47):\nAnd the next day there was actually another story about how Bill.com stock had gone down and they did make mention of RAMP's news in that story. So it ended up really just, it was a very powerful way of telling the narrative there.\n\n(00:46:02):\nAnd another way, if we hadn't pitched it like that would've just been RAMP brings simple, seamless, streamlined ability to do vendor payments and new finance offering, first of its kind. All these things that might be how you would talk in your customer emails, but if I had pitched it that way, probably wouldn't have been a story. So if we had pitched it as them creating a new category of this all in one software, which I mean, yeah, it could be argued, that's another way to tell the story. I don't think CNBC would've been interested.\n\nLenny (00:46:34):\nAwesome.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:46:36):\nSo, okay, another example, we work with a company called Column Tax, which is embedded tax filing software. So essentially they work with other FinTech's to allow people to file their taxes within the tools that they already use. And last year they partnered with a company called Propel that offers SNAP benefits. So essentially for low income families to receive the government benefits to offer tax filing directly within the app that they've created.\n\n(00:47:04):\nAnd that was one thing that they were doing amidst many other customers, that they had lots of different threads we could pull on with them, but we decided to really just focus our press strategy on that one initiative because it allowed us to tell macro story about TurboTax had to pay all these fines for practices that many considered unsavory around calling themselves free but not really being free. The IRS is building a free filing system, but it's in its very early days.\n\n(00:47:35):\nSo the fact that they were having this offering that was supporting a lot of low income families, and I believe 40% of the people that filed their taxes with Column hadn't filed taxes in the previous year, so hadn't gotten a return. It's like identifying the piece of the story that's most interesting and then doubling down on that. So we were able to get a great fast company piece instead of pitching this macro here are Column Tax's latest growth metrics, and they're announcing a partnership with Propel. And so it's like...\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:48:00):\nGrowth metrics, and they're announcing a partnership with Propeller. And so it's figuring out how to tie it to these things that people actually care about, and not just the company's messaging I think is our job.\n\nLenny (00:48:12):\nAmazing, is there any other examples? Otherwise, I'll share your pitch of someone coming on my podcast, and what worked about that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:48:20):\nI do want to share one more, because it's my favorite. I want to share my favorite funding story that I worked on. And so I'm actually going to pull it up, because this one is very graphic, in terms of how we went about showing the product. So we worked with a company called Gamma, which is essentially bringing a PowerPoint into something that's much more modern, and interactive, and usable. So when we did their launch, they were a seed stage company, we tried to get really creative with how we could display or talk about the company. And so instead of doing your standard company blog posts, we actually made a Gamma presentation, and we kind of included all these fun elements that made it really interesting to reporters. So firstly, it's a visual platform. So we created... Or actually I don't want to take credit for this. The Gamma team created this great visual.\n\n(00:49:11):\nAnd we kept it very to the point. Every year, half a billion people create presentations in Google Slides and PowerPoint. We're not using marketing language here, we're talking in a very direct way, we're including fund visuals. We talk about Gamma's mission, pretty short, this is not a long essay on why the company exists. And then we include some customer love, so they're early stage, so we didn't really have necessarily growth metrics that we wanted to share. So we tried to make it a little bit more personal, and focus on actual users and what they're saying, while also showing the product capability here. And then instead of doing a long thing on each investor, we just bulleted who the investors are, which is very to the point, easy for a reporter to repurpose.\n\n(00:49:55):\nAnd then the fun part that I really loved, is we did a video from the lead investor talking about why she invested, instead of including an investor quote. So it's a little bit different than what you expect. And their videos are fun, because they have all these interactive elements. And yeah, team photo, make it a little more personal. And that was about it. But anyways, it was a very successful story, and I believe the title of the TechCrunch article that we got as a result was Gamma Brings PowerPoint into the 21st Century. Exactly, that's exactly what we're talking. Maybe they are creating a new category, we weren't talking about it then, we're talking about how it's better than the existing solutions. And so yeah, I guess the piece of advice there, is feel free to get kind of fun and creative with it, and don't just follow the typical issuing press release format.\n\nLenny (00:50:42):\nAnd is that something we could link to for people to check out? Is that just on their site?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:50:42):\nOkay, amazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:46):\nYeah, I actually had to for some reason do some digging to get it. But yeah, I have it now, so I can give it to you.\n\nLenny (00:50:52):\nOkay, great. And the way that you use that is when you sent emails or DMs to reporters, you included this link?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:50:58):\nAfter they had that they're potentially interested, because again, if I had shared it right off the bat, it would be their prerogative to just publish it essentially or share it publicly. And I guess one important note, is everything you say to a reporter in an email is on the record, and so that's why I make the point on not sharing the entire story right off the bat.\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nGot it. So many companies won't have... They're not a deck product, so they can't do something like this. But the takeaways for other folks here, is be just very human in the language, the investors are just bullet points, make it fun, add some visuals, don't just have blurbs, and paragraphs, and things like that.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:51:41):\nYeah. I think reporters are used to getting the same thing all the time, and so this one obviously worked well for the format. But I think we try to always think of, what can we do that's slightly different for this one? Or how can we make this a little more fun? I guess the one exception, if the product is very technical, and you have a very technical audience, and you're probably going to work with a very technical reporter, it's totally fine to talk to your audience in those cases, and you don't need to necessarily dumb it down so everyone can understand. But that doesn't mean... I mean, you can do that while still using clear and concise language.\n\nLenny (00:52:18):\nOkay, so let me share the element of the pitch that you sent me, that convinced me to bring this guest on. So this is going to be the chief product officer at NewBank. I barely know anything about NewBank. And so in your email to me, you basically had just two bullet points, and the way you put is, \"Two fun facts about NewBank, growth has been 80 to 90% organic because of the way they try to make customers fanatical about the product.\" And to me that's like, \"Wow, that's very rare, is 80, 90% of your growth being organic.\" So to me is like, \"That's an interesting story.\" And then the other tidbit is, \"NewBank is bigger than Coinbase, Robinhood, Affirm, SoFi, and Lemonade combined. Seriously, so much bigger than people in the US realize.\" Which I 100% did not realize. So to me both were just like, \"Okay, this is an interesting story to tell, I think people would be very curious to hear how a company like this operates.\" So now I'm going to start getting all these emails from people, all these couple bullet points.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:53:15):\nThey're going to combine a bunch of companies, and see which they're bigger than.\n\nLenny (00:53:19):\nYeah, or use AI to help them figure this out. But I think what you identified here is just what I get excited about. Is there any advice there of just what you did there that other people can learn from?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:53:32):\nYeah. I mean, I think with pitching you, speaking to the audience, it's not just about having... You don't want the most well-known CEOs all the time, you're not looking just for the biggest companies and the most well-known people. You're looking for the things that they can talk about, and how the things that they can talk about are relevant to your audience. And with the first bullet, it was indexing on that. The second bullet was more so like, \"Hey, you might not know about this company.\" And it's a little bit of a unique one, I wouldn't necessarily always include that. But to me the first bullet was really what mattered, because it wasn't just about the fact that they were a huge company, it's that they grew in a unique way, and I knew that was the kind of thing that you'd be interested in.\n\nLenny (00:54:13):\nAnd how did you figure that out? Is it from emails we were exchanging ahead of that? Is it listening to some podcasts? How did you get to those conclusions?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:54:21):\nYeah, listening certainly helps. But I do think just figuring out... If you even just scrolled the names of all the episodes that you've done, it would be pretty easy to spot a trend there. And so you're not talking about product launches, you are not talking about entrepreneurial journeys, you're talking about tactical lessons. And so pitching people based on those sort of things, I don't even think you necessarily need to listen to a whole bunch of episodes most of the time, maybe occasionally you want to gut check something before you reach out. But yeah, you can tell a lot just by doing a little bit of research.\n\n(00:54:53):\nAnd then we did have a little back and forth, because I will take responsibility, I did try pitching you on a CEO at one point, which I know you don't have on as guests.\n\nLenny (00:55:03):\nOnce in a while, very rarely.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:55:08):\nYeah, actually, there's obviously some exceptions. But I had known the subject matter you were looking for, but I did not spot the trend that you've never had CEOs on. So I think my pitch was actually okay, but the spokesperson was not the kind of person that you would want on. So maybe you won't get it right 100% of the time, but you can tell a lot just by doing some searches.\n\nLenny (00:55:24):\nAnd oftentimes I just reply, \"Here's my policy.\" And then, \"Okay, good to know.\" Kind of along these lines, something I wanted to ask earlier, you mentioned a few publications to go after, and then how to pitch people. Obviously the way that you're describing takes a bunch of time. How many people are you often emailing, DMing per attempt to get a story? Because it sounds like it's not a ton, and so you have time to do these sorts of custom pitches. Or is it a lot higher than it sounds?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:55:51):\nI would say for hard news, funding, the startup launch, those sort of things, less, and I try to really stagger it because we're offering exclusives, and I highly recommend offering exclusives. So the worst thing that can happen is two reporters reply, and are both interested, and you have to go back to one and say, \"Nevermind.\" And sometimes that's okay if they left you, if it's been a week or something, they hadn't gotten back, and they'll understand. So it's fine to move on without getting an answer. So I would say, yeah, with the funding story, it could be anywhere from one to six reporters on average, sometimes more. With stuff like general just outreach, relationship building, trying to get on podcasts, it kind of is a numbers game, and you really have to balance quality and quantity.\n\n(00:56:38):\nAnd that's why I love starting with the first note and not saying much, and just saying, \"Hey, you open to guest ideas?\" Because it allows you to do more. I'd rather do that than send a bad pitch, and not have it be targeted to the right sort of audience. And so that's kind of a way to play the numbers game while still being respectful. But yeah, I mean, with some clients maybe they get one opportunity for every 20 or 30 things that we send. And so yeah, we try not to do... We don't do blasting media, it's not about sending the same pitch to a single list of people. It's figuring out, which ones do I want to really double down on because they're the perfect target? And you'll keep trying, you'll be really custom, which deserve maybe a slightly higher level note, which deserve a DM, and just figuring out your strategy from that.\n\nLenny (00:57:27):\nAwesome, okay. Do you have examples of pitches, announcements that were not as effective as they could have been, and advice for how they could have been better?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:57:37):\nYeah, I have some excerpts that I pulled from press releases where I think there's room for improvement. So Lenny, I want to read one to you, and then I want to see if you can tell me what this company does. Okay, \"Today X announced their workflow automation product, which combines AI assistance, human in the loop collaboration, and a robust multiplayer experience to help teams save time.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nAbsolutely no idea what's going on.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:05):\nYou kind of gained something from workflow automation, and then after that it's like, \"Wait, what?\"\n\nLenny (00:58:05):\nJust a bunch of things.\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:10):\nOkay, now let me read to an excerpt from the TechCrunch article, and this is how TechCrunch positioned it, \"A new automation startup is setting out to eat Zapier's lunch. It helps people tackle mundane and repetitive tasks, and goes beyond the triggers and actions popularized by similar platforms like Zapier.\" So to me, yeah, it's a better version of Zapier, where they aren't just doing triggers and actions, and there's a little more substance and depth to it. If you know what Zapier is, you can kind of start to figure out what they do based on that.\n\nLenny (00:58:41):\nYeah, it comes back to your point about referencing incumbent to help you understand what the heck you're talking about\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:58:47):\nAnd you wouldn't necessarily need to do that in your press release, but I think they could have been a lot clearer, and not use... Because terms like robust multiplayer experience, that makes it sound like a game. Are we talking about just collaborative multiple users? Human in the loop collaboration, isn't all collaboration between humans, and we're all in the loop? AI assistance, that just means they use AI. So yeah, sometimes I push my clients to like, \"Okay, let's talk through what each of these phrases actually means. And if you can't articulate it, then let's change it to the way that you just articulated it, and it might be more successful.\" So yeah, that's a good way to do it. And just read it out loud, read it out loud and see if someone understands it.\n\nLenny (00:59:34):\nSomeone hearing this is like, \"How could possibly anybody think that was great? How did these come about, these really bad descriptions?\" I know it's hard to come up with something really short and pithy, but where do these come from?\n\nEmilie Gerber (00:59:49):\nIt's just a culture within marketing and comms, of this is how we're supposed to write. And I just think that's a majority of how people do it, and they think it sounds smart, or they think it sounds more professional. I just think it's just how people are trained. And so even when we bring on someone new, part of my job is stripping away at a lot of that, and getting people... Everyone's capable of talking like a human being, we do it every day. But it's stripping away that thing that goes off in your head that you're supposed to be writing in a very marketingy way. Because I would say at least 50% of releases are like that, it's not a small problem.\n\nLenny (01:00:30):\nRight. I love the advice you shared of just trying to say it out loud, hearing yourself, what does it sound like? Do you have any other tips for trying to make it something people get and connect to? I know that, again, it takes a lot of time to really do well and it's very context specific, but is there any other tricks that you find help you communicate what you're actually offering?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:00:48):\nIt's talking through the basic questions, what does this product do? Who is it for? Who are your customers? If you can answer each of those in one sentence... What product launch are we talking about here? If you can just answer each of those verbally, chances are you're not going to be far away from what you're looking for. Because when I talk to marketers, and founders, and teams, generally in the conversations I have no trouble understanding what they're talking about. They can articulate it just fine, it's only in the writing that it gets that way. So actually I think it's kind of easier to solve than many might realize. And then also I think there is some skill involved in removing words, not over explaining, you can make things more concise. But at the bare minimum, just strip out all the jargon, that's the first step.\n\nLenny (01:01:36):\nI love it. So one way to think about it is, just think about, what does it do? Who is it for? Who are the customers? Is there something else along those lines that you shared there as a bullet point?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:01:45):\nWell, I mean, if you're talking about what makes this business interesting? Why should people care? And not over indexing on that. I think that's just one part of the overall story, is why people should care about this business. And then what's new? Is it growth metrics? Is it the customer piece? Is it product? What makes this timely and relevant right now?\n\nLenny (01:02:08):\nOkay, awesome. There's actually this awesome Twitter thread from a couple of days ago, where the CEO of Product Hunt did this thread where he asked people, \"Share your tagline, and I will give you a much better version of the tagline.\" And he's really good at this. So I'm going to link to it in the show notes, where he can give you an example of what it looks like from bad to good.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:02:26):\nI love that. That's exactly the kind of thing I would love to do too, because it's so fun and so easy.\n\nLenny (01:02:33):\nIt's easy if you're good at it, most people are not great at it. You mentioned press release in this example, you shared thoughts on value of press release, traditional press release versus not.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:02:44):\nPress releases came about because reporters would be checking news wires for ideas of what stories they want to write. No reporters do that anymore, or a very small percentage, I don't know any reporters that do that anymore. So now it's this thing where you go to one of the PR distribution services, you pay them anywhere between 300 to $2,000, that's literally what it costs, and they put it on the wire. And for the more expensive services, it does get syndicated to this press release section of some business websites. No one, in my opinion, goes there for their news. I've personally never read an article, like a Yahoo Finance article, that was a press release syndication. So in that sense, they are not helpful for getting eyeballs. They also require... Going back to that more marketing form of writing, they require that you write like that.\n\n(01:03:39):\nThe standard press release format, it's so formulaic, and I think it actually encourages that more marketing speak. The benefit is that you're getting all the news details in one place, so it's relevant for a reporter. However, you can do the exact same thing in a blog post. And the blog post can be this first person piece of content that's written by either the founder, or the product lead, or whatever executive, that has a lot more flexibility in the style. You can kind of write it however you want, it can still include all the same news elements. And it's much more shareable on social, you're not going to share a link to a press release on your Twitter or on your LinkedIn, but a blog, for sure. You can add your own graphics, it's great.\n\n(01:04:21):\nAnd you're also encouraging people to go to something that lives on your website versus this black hole of a newsletter. I should be fair, so I think that the reason that people say that they still do them, is that it helps with SEO. However, I've read a few articles that have said that Google no longer does prioritize press releases in SEO, so I don't know how much that holds up. And that it signals to the market that the company is more serious, so that's a perception thing. I personally think that blogs actually signal a more modern, kind of cool company than a press release. But at a certain stage in your growth, public companies, they do press releases for earnings, makes 100% sense. There are certain rules around when companies do need to issue press releases, so there's still a use case for them, I just think your average early to mid-stage startup doesn't need them.\n\nLenny (01:05:10):\nThis mention of blogs is where I wanted to go next actually, so it's a good segue. But before we do that, is there any other examples that you wanted to share of less than ideal ways of pitching a product?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:05:21):\nOne sentence I found in a press release that a lot of companies want to include that I always try to remove is... Well here, I'll give you the sentence, \"Since exiting stealth in May, we've witnessed a 700% increase in organizations using our product.\" You're saying that since you were in stealth to now you saw a 700% increase, so you could have had one customer, now you have seven. And it's every company wants to do these percentage growth stats when they just launched, and I've never seen reporters include that in their stories.\n\n(01:05:50):\nAnd so there are ways to give signals of how fast you're growing without being that kind of disingenuous. One way that you could put something similar is, \"Our revenue hit six figures at the end of last year, and has been growing about 30% each quarter, with 40% of adoption coming from the enterprise sector.\" So you're giving color to the growth, and you can kind of play with that, it doesn't need to be exactly something like that. But if you can make it a little more specific, I'm not against doing percentages, but I think there's a way to balance that with something that seems a little more realistic.\n\nLenny (01:06:25):\nOr, \"We went from zero to six figures in ARR in X months.\"\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:06:29):\nYeah, no, totally. And it doesn't need to be huge, especially if you're doing your first story, they're not expecting that you're necessarily going to have massive revenue. And so I think founders might sometimes be concerned that it's not going to seem big enough or significant enough, whereas from working with a lot of companies, it's kind of the case across the board.\n\nLenny (01:06:49):\nYou mentioned a bunch of amazing companies, you've worked with Ramp, Perplexity, a few others. And people may feel like, of course you're getting pressed, those are amazing. Ramp grew to a 100 million AR in two years, Perplexity is this killer AI product, everyone's talking about AI. Most products are not that, they don't have as interesting of a story to tell. Is there either an example you could share of a company that didn't have an amazing story to tell, that you created an interesting story out of? Or just any advice for, how do you help find something that is a nugget that gets people excited?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:07:23):\nSo some of the examples I gave, so Clockwise and Column Tax aren't as big as some of the other brands I mentioned. So that's certainly actually the bulk of our business, I would say 80% of the companies we work with are at a stage where they haven't reached that kind of mass awareness yet.\n\n(01:07:40):\nAnother really great company that we work with is Entropy. And so essentially they work with transaction data, they're an API. It's a very technical tool, it's not something that necessarily every reporter is going to instantly understand. But for them, we've actually really leaned into the founder story. She's this incredible woman who moved to the US, and actually struggled with getting her first apartment here because of the way that our credit scoring system is set up. And one of the use cases for what she's building actually directly relates to how our credit system could change in the future, and so we've been really leaning into that angle. And her personal story is really powerful. And so maybe sometimes the product isn't going to be something that you can easily pitch, but you can kind of find those other personal angles in or pull on certain threads.\n\nLenny (01:08:33):\nAnd there it connects back to find the publication that cares about these sorts of personal stories, because TechCrunch probably won't.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:08:40):\nYeah. But she spoke at Money20/20, so it's useful for speaking abstracts too. Actually it was on a panel with Column Tax, we got them on together at Money20/20.\n\nLenny (01:08:52):\nWhat a win.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:08:56):\nNo, and we love doing that, it's so fun when you do have multiple companies that you can connect. Actually, that's kind of a good macro point as well. It doesn't always need to just be about you, if you have an idea for a conference session, reaching out to colleagues that you've worked with at other companies, peers, people that are building other things that maybe don't compete better in a similar space, and packaging that up as like, \"Hey, this could be a really strong panel.\" It's actually way more successful than just pitching yourself.\n\nLenny (01:09:24):\nAwesome, okay. So you've mentioned a couple of times the rise of newsletters and podcasts. So there's kind of two buckets of questions here. One is going after these kind of non-traditional media platforms, and then the other is building your own following, and building a following on Twitter, for example. I know you worked closely with the CEO of Vox who's really good at this, and basically doesn't need press. Elon is amazing at this, maybe that's why he bought Twitter, he has this huge platform to talk about all the stuff. So maybe in the first bucket, talking about when you're trying to decide, should I go after traditional media, Vox, and VentureBeat, and Axios, and all these guys? Versus I'm going to go for newsletters. As an example, Ramp got a lot of benefit from Not Boring, that newsletter with Packy, who wrote about them constantly and loved it. And they're sponsored posts, and organic posts. So I guess the question there is just, how do you think about going after podcasts, newsletters, Twitter, LinkedIn, influencery platformy people versus traditional press?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:10:31):\nI think of newsletters and podcasts actually in the camp of, if we're pitching traditional press, we're 100% pitching those. Social is its own ball game, but I would not leave out newsletters and podcasts from any core PR strategy. To me, it's now just a part of any PR program that we're going to run, because it's just part of media now. And to me, it's just a very important part of media. In terms of social, I think doing social well is very hard. So you gave Aaron from Vox as an example, that was all 100% him. I think I helped with one tweet once about a Microsoft partnership that we did, and I was so excited.\n\nLenny (01:11:10):\nHow did it do?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:11:11):\nActually really good. A publication ended up writing a story on the tweet about Microsoft and Vox partnership because of it. Yeah, so that was fun. But generally it's not always something that you can just turn on by hiring an agency. And I've seen many companies try doing that, and not necessarily see as much success as they'd hoped for. So if a founder is naturally good at that stuff, lean into it as much as humanly possible, go for it. If they're not, and you're trying to outsource it, it can be done to some success. But I don't necessarily think it's as easy as just posting three times a week on relevant topics, there has to be more going on there. I think that if the spokesperson or the executive that you're trying to build the presence of is willing to... Going back to what I said earlier, kind of push the limit.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:12:00):\n... Presence of is willing to, going back to what I said earlier, push the limit on opinions that they have, be bold, be controversial, then it could be worth potentially investing in. And I have seen it play out where reporters have seen those posts and used and quoted things in their articles as a result, so it can tie to your traditional media strategy a little bit, they're not necessarily fully siloed, but I would say if you're considering investing in social to just do corporate channels and not think about executives, you're really leaving a lot on the table. Corporate channels, it's very hard to build a following.\n\n(01:12:39):\nTo get someone to follow a brand and care about a brand, you have to be bringing something new to the table, because they don't want to read your latest blog post, they don't want to read a relevant article that your social person just decided to put out there. When you have an executive, you're following a personality, you're following a person, ideally there's more flexibility with tone, all of that sort of stuff. And so I think it's important to think about it from the people perspective and not just the brand perspective.\n\nLenny (01:13:07):\nSo just to make it clear, the CEO or some execs should be the people tweeting and LinkedIn, and not the company as a brand?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:13:17):\nYeah. And I don't know. I think that it can be a little industry specific as well for where it makes sense to be investing in the corporate channels. And you certainly can do that sort of thing. But I also think if you're going to do that, have an exec that you're also trying a social strategy with. Don't just do the plain corporate channels.\n\nLenny (01:13:36):\nWhen I think of a brand doing this really well, it's Duolingo. They're just so hilarious and so ridiculous in there. And I don't know if the key is just funny is the way to go, and that's how you get any attention, but they're so funny and creative in their videos, especially TikTok.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:13:50):\nIt's interesting though, we're getting to the point where even brands having a personality on social is becoming its own meme. People are making fun of how all the fast food brands all are like these Gen Z like TikTok-\n\nLenny (01:13:59):\nAnd they're all replying to each other on Twitter threads.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:14:02):\nYeah. And so things change quickly. So, yes, that was a good strategy, but you just have to stay on top of it.\n\nLenny (01:14:11):\nSo you talked about how if this comes naturally to you as a founder, obviously do it. I'm guessing for most people it doesn't. Do you find that it can work if you're just like, \"I know this is important, I need to tweet often and share things,\" have you seen that work or is it just like it's just probably not going to be something that works great for you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:14:31):\nYeah, I think it can work to some extent. Maybe you're not going to necessarily be going viral or getting hundreds or tens of thousands of followers. But for me personally I push myself to post on LinkedIn at least once a month, because every time I post we get at least one client inbound and maybe a candidate inbound. And so if you test it and you start to see value, push yourself to do it even if it doesn't come naturally. And that's, I guess, the nice thing about social is it's easy to test out. You can try doing it, you can post for a while, even for a month or two, see how it's going, and then adjust your strategy accordingly.\n\n(01:15:06):\nBut, yes, I think for a lot of execs that we work with, it does feel like it's something that's really hard, there's a lot of overthinking, making sure it's right. You can get really in your head about it, and I totally understand that because I feel the same way. And so if it's taking up so much of your time and bandwidth just thinking about your social strategy, then I guess you can weigh if it makes sense to do that, but I think pushing yourself to try it is a great idea.\n\nLenny (01:15:31):\nAnd then Aaron specifically is very good at this, is there anything that you learned from his approach to tweeting specifically? I don't know if he uses other platforms. That works really well for him.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:15:42):\nI actually think I just learned so much. So it was my first in-house job, so I had worked in an agency, I hadn't worked internally at a company before, and I think I just learned so much about comms best practices from him in general, just even beyond social. He was so good at figuring out how to comment on things happening in the news, having just the right stance that was both interesting to the reporter but not necessarily threatening to the business, and just capitalizing on all those moments. And I just watched how that worked and I was like, \"This is how good PR is.\" And it's like the space that they're in is not necessarily one that reporters are all writing about, but he was able to insert himself in those conversations really well. And I think also at the time that I was there at least just really valued press and was willing to put the time in and do the briefings.\n\n(01:16:34):\nAnd so just getting to hear how he speaks over and over again was really helpful. And then on Twitter, I think it clearly just comes naturally to him, and so it wasn't necessarily something that needed to... Like I mentioned, how some execs will spend all this time thinking through to the point where it could get in the way of other things. I think that's not the case there. And if anything, it just helped the business. And actually with his Twitter presence, I would say it's a good example too of stuff getting included in articles, like I mentioned in that Microsoft article. So it helps the PR strategy as well.\n\nLenny (01:17:10):\nAmazing. And we'll link to his Twitter account. This is Aaron, CEO of Box, by the way. I think I mentioned at the beginning and then we just started talking about Aaron. Also, I realize, he tweets about this sometimes, he actually makes money from Twitter, and now the Twitter pays you for views and things and they share ads, he makes thousands of dollars also from X now, by the way, not Twitter.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:29):\nThat's so funny.\n\nLenny (01:17:30):\nYeah, it's pretty ridiculous. I think I've gone through every question that I had for you. I'm curious if there's anything else that you think might be helpful to share or cover or leave listeners with.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:43):\nI can leave with one very tactical media opportunity that I love.\n\nLenny (01:17:51):\nAmazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:17:52):\nOkay, so here it is. It's a way to get a morning brew feature pretty somewhat easily. So they have this series called Morning Brew Coworking series, and they have it for Emerging Tech Brew, they have it for HR Brew, all their verticals. I think there's a CFO one, marketing one. And essentially if you go to the series, the coworking series, either at the top or the bottom, there's something where it's like, \"If you want to be featured, click on this link and fill out this form,\" and it's about 10 questions. If you keep your answers interesting and fun and not too self-promotional, we've had, I would say, 50% success rate with getting execs featured that way. And all you have to do is submit through a Google form. And it's just one of my favorite media opportunities right now. It doesn't need to be CEO, actually probably shouldn't be a CEO in a lot of instances, but it's basically intended to help readers understand what the day-to-day looks in certain jobs and just get a little insight into the people that are in these jobs. And so I guess I just wanted to share that as something that you could do today for over 10 minutes and potentially get a story. Although, maybe not after you post this, so we'll see if they get an influx.\n\nLenny (01:19:03):\nWe're going to take down Mailbrew. Funny enough, they have an interview with Zuck today that they published on Morning Brew, so it could be you alongside Zuck.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:19:10):\nThere you go, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:19:13):\nMaybe before we get to our very exciting lightning round, it might be fun to chat about how to pick a PR agency. Obviously you run one. When people are trying to decide who to work with and also when to decide to pick and work with a PR agency versus doing it themselves, what advice can you share when they're trying to make that big decision?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:19:33):\nI think there's an assumption that bigger, more well-known agencies are going to do a better job. I think a lot of those bigger, well-known agencies are used to working with a lot of household brands. And so their strategies tend to be very reactive, focus in the messaging, maybe have to turn down a bunch of opportunities, control what people say. That is the polar opposite in my opinion of doing startup PR. Startup PR, you got to experiment, you got to try new things, you got to be scrappy, you got to be fast. We actually personally love diving into pitching right away rather than spending several months on messaging just testing and market right away. And so don't assume just because they have the huge logos... To your point, you're like, \"Oh, well, you work with [inaudible 01:20:16] Perplexity, does that mean you know how to work with all these tiny companies?\"\n\n(01:20:19):\nThat's not necessarily a good thing, so don't just go buy the big logos. I would say that's my first piece of advice. My second piece of advice is find out what month one looks like with them. If month one is them just doing intake calls and learning about the company, and you're a startup that's still really paying close attention to how much money you're spending, you're not going to necessarily want to partner with an agency that needs a three-month ramp up cycle. And so really tactically understand what those first few months look like. I think that's something that I've noticed is a lot of agencies take a while before they get their hands dirty and start doing things. My third piece of advice would be writing recent writing samples. To the point of all those press release excerpts I shared, is that how they write? If it is, maybe they're not the right agency. So ask them. That's so easy. That's so easy to do.\n\n(01:21:14):\nJust ask them for a couple recent blogs or releases, whatever they tend to go for, and read those. And, of course, wins too. You want to see what kind of stories they're getting, but that's a little more obvious. A lot of people have already talked about this, so I'll just mention briefly, it's important to meet with the actual team you're working on, not just the founder of the agency. So asking who's our day-to-day going to be? Can we chat with them really quick? One thing I would say don't do is an extensive RFP process. We actually as an agency don't participate in RFPs. The two times I've done it, I have regretted it just because of the amount of work going in versus the value that's there. And it's you're asking a team to do a lot of free work for you, and generally I think the best players are not going to do that, so you're going to weed out some of the best players if you're asking them to do a lot of free upfront work. So those are a few considerations.\n\nLenny (01:22:06):\nPerfect. And then just two more questions, because I imagine this is what people are thinking about when they're trying to decide should we find somebody is how long ahead of time they should find someone before something big is happening? And then just what's a budget they should have in mind for something like this? What's a minimum or a range, whatever you think would be helpful for people to understand here's how much you're probably going to be investing here?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:22:27):\nStart times can vary from agency to agency. I think we can get started the week that a client needs us to, so maybe I'm not best equipped to answer this, but I would say before an announcement happens, you probably want to kick off six weeks in advance. So when we start with the company, it's like we're working on the blog, we're doing a media training, we're doing the media outreach, we're getting quotes from investors, or coordinating with all the parties, making sure images are being created so it's not just pitching and securing the article. So I would say buffer with time to pitch, make sure that the reporter is actually able to cover it. Six weeks is ideal. I would also note I highly recommend not having a firm date that you think you need to announce something and going instead with when a reporter is able to cover your story.\n\n(01:23:12):\nWe get so many clients that come to us and they have this set date in their head, but there's not usually a real reason for it. It's like they're planning around it, it's like they have other comms they want to go out that day, but if you can optimize for the reporter over the timing, you're going to see such a better outcome because getting the first choice reporter is going to drive way more for your business than announcing it four days sooner. So leaving a little bit of flexibility for that agency is key. And I've even seen companies like issue a press release for big news with no coverage because they had stuck to a certain day and were very rigid about it, and they didn't get any stories for that reason. And so I think a good agency would counsel to offer that flexibility.\n\n(01:23:54):\nSo six weeks I think is the ideal amount of time. And then budget, I would say the lowest end would probably be about 10K a month for an agency. You can find consultants, I think the best ones would be at least 8K a month, but for a small boutique agency starts at 10. I'll just be transparent, I'm very open about our pricing, our rates start at 15K a month for our retainers, and actually that's for a series A companies generally what they're at. And then I would say unless you are a global business that needs basically different teams for different product lines, which happens when you're a Microsoft of the world, that's another story. But if you're just a series C startup that's getting a lot of attention, I wouldn't go beyond 30K probably. There are plenty of agencies that go into the 50s and 60s a month, but that's just a whole nother world, and I'm not an expert on that part.\n\nLenny (01:24:56):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing all that. What if you're going for just a one-off, just help me get one story, what's a range there for budget you should expect?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:04):\nI would say between 10 and 20. And you might be able to find a consultant that'll do it for eight.\n\nLenny (01:25:12):\nAmazing. So helpful. Emilie, is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:19):\nNo. I'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:25:20):\nWell, welcome to our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions. Are you ready?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:25):\nI am.\n\nLenny (01:25:26):\nFirst question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:32):\nI have one that's very top of mind right now, so it's How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan. Actually, I leave tonight for a week long psilocybin retreat.\n\nLenny (01:25:46):\nWe should have done this... N [inaudible 01:25:48]\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:52):\nI know. I would be getting much more philosophical maybe.\n\nLenny (01:25:53):\nWow.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:25:56):\nSo very excited, I'm going to Jamaica.\n\nLenny (01:25:58):\nAmazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:00):\nAnd ever since researching that field, there's the whole concept of changing your neural pathways is just very fascinating to me. And just opening up and shifting perspectives is something that I think will actually help me a lot just even in running a company, being a better leader, I think we're at a stage in our growth right now where we're hiring a lot and there's a lot of pressure and I just want to make sure I'm bringing my best self forward every day. And so I'm really excited about it.\n\nLenny (01:26:27):\nWhat an amazing answer. This is going to be part of your set and setting this interview, but hopefully you can get it out of your mind.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:34):\nNo, totally. I was nervous. I'm like, \"It's actually really great that this is happening and then I can completely unplug after it. And so I think it's actually good timing.\n\nLenny (01:26:34):\nI'm excited to hear how it goes.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:26:45):\nI'm not a big book recommender. I have ADHD and reading full books is very hard for me, and so I'm just going to leave you with that one. I can do the occasional beach read I'll really focus, but it's not my main format of content consumption.\n\nLenny (01:27:01):\nAmazing. All right, great answer. One's plenty. Do you have a favorite movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:27:08):\nMy favorite genre is post-apocalyptic, end of the world survival. I need to mention my all time favorite show, because it would be bad not to. So Walking Dead is my comfort TV show, I can watch it when I'm going to sleep at night, but my most recent favorite was Yellowjackets. Are you familiar?\n\nLenny (01:27:30):\nI've seen the poster on my TV, but I've not watched it.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:27:35):\nNice. I discovered it a little late. I think the second season finished and they're working on the third. But it has plane crash, and it has just shocking moment after shocking moment like cannibalism, very weird stuff. And it's one of those shows that sticks in your mind, which I like where you're thinking about it afterwards. It's kind of creepy.\n\nLenny (01:27:59):\nWow. I thought you were going for Last of Us, but I now have to watch this show.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:28:05):\nNo, I watched Last of Us and I didn't feel like it had enough survival elements to it. It was like storytelling in that environment, but it wasn't actually a survival post-apocalyptic show in the way that I was looking for.\n\nLenny (01:28:17):\nHardcore. Do you have a favorite interview question you like to ask? And you could take this in any direction you want.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:28:25):\nYeah. I have a new one. We actually just revamped our interview process, so I wanted to make it harder. So my new favorite question is if a client comes to you and they're convinced they have something that's press worthy, like an announcement that they think should be, I don't know, in the Wall Street Journal or something, and you know for a fact that it isn't, what steps do you take? What do you do next? And I like that question because they can handle it, one, from the client relations standpoint, how do you communicate with the client when they say something like that, but it's also a critical thinking and creativity question of how do you take a no and turn it into a yes? How do you take what they're giving you and make it into something interesting? And so I like to dig into that, and they can use a real example if they want, but I also think a lot of our job is pushing back in a way. And so that also shows if they're able and willing to push back.\n\nLenny (01:29:17):\nI'm so curious to hear people's answer to that. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you love?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:29:24):\nI was very skeptical of Apple Vision Pro and I was making fun of it at the beginning, and the first time I tried it, I completely changed my tune, I'm so into it, I'm ordering one, and I'm very excited for actually using it for work. I think it could be a really good use case for just my day-to-day at work. After I had tried it, the next day I messaged a bunch of clients that I thought could have relevant applications for it. I'm like, \"Do we have an Apple Vision Pro strategy? Are we billing to talk about it publicly yet?\" Because sometimes it's tying back to the PR conversation, I love if you're willing to push the envelope on stuff that you are building or are going to do and getting ahead of those conversations, so that's a lot of conversations I'm having right now is trying to convince clients to talk about that.\n\nLenny (01:30:10):\nSo you have an Apple Vision Pro strategy, amazing.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:30:13):\nAnd then my other one, which is very self-serving, because they are a client, but I do use them every day, is Perplexity. I find it so helpful even just for like I'm working on an award submission, I forgot how much funding a client has raised, asking them that instead of opening five different Google links and trying to find the answer, it's just huge for quick information. Or writing a bio for an executive, getting just the TLDR of what they've done in their past, it's so good for PR use cases, and I actually think marketing and PR is going to be one of the core work applications for them.\n\nLenny (01:30:52):\nI've also already shared how much I love Perplexity, I have the Chrome extension installed. I probably use it at least once a day for podcast interview prep along with a bunch of other stuff. So good find for customer. I think they're going to do great. Wish I was an investor.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:07):\nI'm the happy investor. I rarely angel invest and I was...\n\nLenny (01:31:12):\nDrinks on Emilie someday.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:15):\nThere we go.\n\nLenny (01:31:16):\nThat's awesome. Good job.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:18):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:31:18):\nOkay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, either in work or in life?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:31:26):\nStrong opinions loosely held, I'm a very opinionated trust my gut kind of person, but that doesn't mean I'm not willing to change my mind on things and be wrong. I first heard it from an influencer [inaudible 01:31:38] and then I Googled it, and apparently... What was it? Jeff Bezos also said it at one point, so I have no idea the origin of the quote, but I think that's a good one. You can still be really opinionated in life, but that doesn't mean you always are going to be right.\n\nLenny (01:31:52):\nEmilie, this was everything I hoped it would be. I feel like this is going to help so many people get awesome press. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you and reach out if they want to learn more or work with you? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:32:06):\nOur website is sixeastern.com and our email is hello@sixeastern.com, so you can find us there. And actually I have a newsletter called On Background. It's on Substack. And really what it's intended to be is a place for people to find these tactical opportunities, so it has media moves, it has reporters that are working on stories, it has awards that are open, all of this stuff that basically an intern in an agency would spend their days researching we put into a newsletter. And so its main audience is PR people, but I actually think it could be a great resource for people within companies that don't have PR teams to stay on top of stuff. So I guess to be helpful, feel free to subscribe. And then other than that, we're hiring, so if you happen to be a PR person that got this far in the episode, always looking for great people to bring on.\n\nLenny (01:32:57):\nAmazing. Is there anything specific you're looking for in people you're hiring for people that may want to reach out other than they've been in PR?\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:33:02):\nIdeally some B2B experience. I think doing B2B PR is very different from doing consumer PR. If you work with startups, that's a huge plus, you know how to be kind of scrappy and fast. And also people that just love to be really hands-on and doing the actual work. We're very flat, so we're not a place where there's much managing of teams. So it's really much more like a consultancy than anything else.\n\nLenny (01:33:24):\nAmazing. Emilie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEmilie Gerber (01:33:27):\nYeah, it was so fun. Thank you so much.\n\nLenny (01:33:29):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to build a powerful marketing machine | Emily Kramer (Asana, Carta, MKT1)\n\n## Transcript\n\nEmily Kramer (00:00:00):\nForget the product marketing content partner, demand and growth, forget all of it, and just think of marketing as you need a fuel and you need an engine. And goal is like all the things that you're creating. I mean this should be obvious, but it's the content, it's the word, it's the design in some regard. All the things that you're making, all the things that are going to add value. An engine is how you get it out to the right people. And all of the tracking of that and sort of the ops work I put under engine, everyone needs an engine.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:00:28):\nAnd the question is, where do you have the biggest challenge right now? Or where do you think if you did more, you would grow faster? Is it on fuel side or is on the engine side?\n\nLenny (00:00:37):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experience building and scaling today's most successful products. Today my guest is Emily Kramer. Emily led and built the marketing teams at Asana, Carta, Ticketfly and Astro, which was a startup acquired by Slack. She's one of the first marketers to be hired at all four companies, and has been instrumental in helping these companies build their marketing function, grow their products, and build their brands.\n\nLenny (00:01:11):\nShe also writes my favorite newsletter on marketing, MKT1. And the best compliment that I can give her is that she's a marketer that thinks like a product manager. In our chat, Emily shares a ton of concrete advice on what to look for in your first marketing hire, what the different archetypes of marketers are, and who you should look for based on your business model. How to work with marketing effectively as a product team, and also what red flags to look for that tell you that your marketing team is not doing a great job.\n\nLenny (00:01:39):\nEmily is super specific and incredibly concrete with her advice, including sharing a ton of templates that you can immediately use that we link to in the share rooms. I always learn a ton talking to Emily and I can't wait for you to hear this episode. And so with that, I bring you Emily Kramer. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler, from Podcast Sponsor Amplitude. Hey John.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:01):\nHey Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:02:03):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation and even just launch a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:14):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform that, ship experiments and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (00:02:35):\nAnd supporting growth and learning has always been amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:02:39):\nYeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (00:02:48):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to amplitude.com to get started.

Looking forward to chatting with you in depth here.\n\nLenny (00:03:53):\nSo if I remember correctly, we first met in the first round Angel Track program maybe two years ago, and then since then we've invested in a bunch of different companies together. I'm also just a big fan of your newsletter that we're going to chat about. So just to settle little context for folks, can you just give us a quick high level overview of your illustrious career and then also just plug your newsletter so folks can find it.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:04:16):\nFor sure. And theme of my career has been building out marketing teams at B2B startups. So early in my career I was in advertising, went to business school. But after that I started doing the startup thing and I was at Ticketfly, I was like the second marketer. And then I went to Asana where I was the first marketer when they were about 30, 35 people and built up that team and led the team for just under four years. And then I went to a small seed funded company, help them raise rates and eventually went to Carta, which was about 300 people when I joined-ish give or take, but didn't have a marketing function at the time.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:04:49):\nSo built that function up from scratch. Much like Asana but at a very different stage in the company's life cycle. And then since then I've been advising and investing full time and now have a small fund where we invest in early stage B2B and help them build out marketing. So building marketing, that's what I do.\n\nLenny (00:05:07):\nI love it. Okay, so plug your fund and your newsletter real quick just so we can cover that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:05:11):\nOh yeah, sorry about that. My newsletter is the letters mkt1.substack.com and my fund is Market 1 Capital. You can pretty much find most of these things on mkt1.co. Links to all the different various things that I'm doing so I can remember, because there's lots of iron in the fire. So got to keep the website up to date so I don't lose track of all the things that are going on. I also have a job board and a bunch of other things. You have more things going on but I have a number of set of things.\n\nLenny (00:05:42):\nAwesome. And we'll link to that in the show notes and everything. I don't think I've told you this but many founders have mentioned you as one of their most helpful angel investors that they've had on their cap table. It just comes up often when we co-invest. And the things that you help them most with as far as I understand is marketing advice, go to market advice, hiring marketing people. And so, I'd love to spend most of our time chatting through, basically the advice that you give founders around marketing.\n\nLenny (00:06:09):\nAnd the first area I wanted to dig into is hiring marketing people. To non-marketing people it's such a mystery of just like, what is a marketing person? What do I expect from them? How do I hire them? How do I find them? How do I interview them? What should I avoid? So my first question is just like what mistakes have you seen founders and teams make when they're thinking about marketing and hiring marketing people?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:06:33):\nAnd just to add to that, it's even hard for marketers to hire other marketers. It's even confusing for marketers to know where they fit in. And if they haven't been hired yet exactly what world they should be looking at or exactly who else they should be hired on the team. While it's very confusing for founders and people who haven't kind of been in a larger marketing team to understand all the different function, like also confusing for marketers. And I think that's just because there's so many different sub functions of marketing and there's so many different things that marketers could do.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:07:01):\nAnd there's such a range of being a deep specialist. You have people that are just deep SEO specialists or deep paid search specialists or writers and they love to write and they write long form content and that's definitely a part of what marketing does, but it's a specialty for sure. And then you have people that are just very much generalists and can handle all areas of marketing. So a couple of mistakes that I see is just hiring people that don't cover the area that you need most as a startup. And that kind of comes for two reasons.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:07:33):\nOne, is like you don't know as a founder or someone else doing a marketing hiring for the first person, you don't know what you're going to be doing in marketing. You don't know what your big levers are going to be, you don't know what's going to work. And so you hire a marketer thinking they're like smart, they've done this before. But really they haven't done the thing that you need to do before. So I see that especially with business model where I think having the right business model experience is almost more important than having industry experience or experience with that audience.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:08:05):\nAnd I think often people are like, I need someone who is marketed to HR or marketed to construction or that specific. And my response is you, you're going to really narrow your set up people with that, and also it doesn't matter as much because great marketers learn the audience and learn the product quickly. And sometimes that fresh set of eyes is helpful and you have other experts in house on the audience. But the business model really dictates what marketing does in a big way. And by business model I mean more like, are you doing top down sales? Are you selling the enterprise?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:08:39):\nAre you doing bottom up product led growth or have a free version? Or whatever it is. Those types of things matter a lot. Because the set of marketing activities is just wildly different which I'm sure we'll go into. So to kind of summarize here, what I'd tell founders is I usually start when I talk to founders about who you need to hire in marketing. Because usually the question is, I think I need a marketer, who do I hire? And my critic question, let's try to nail this down because there isn't one answer. It very much depends.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:09:10):\nThere's usually some common archetypes. But the first thing I say is forget all the sub-functions that you've heard about in marketing. Forget the product marketing content marketing partner, demand and growth, forget all of it and just think of marketing as you need fuel and you need an engine. And the goal is all the things that you're creating. I mean this should be obvious, but it's the content, it's the word that's the design and some regard, it's all the things you're making, all the things that are going to add value.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:09:37):\nAn engine is how you get it out to the right people. And all of the tracking of that And of the ops work I put under engine. So you still need an engine. And the question is, where do you have the biggest challenge right now or where do you think if you did more, you would grow faster? Is it on fuel side or is on the engine side? Typically, if you just think about it logically, you kind of need the fuel first. And sometimes what I see is people just build an engine first and they're like why isn't this working we're sending so many outbound emails? And it's like, well you don't have anything valuable to put in those, you have no fuel so this isn't working.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:10:07):\nOr you see the flip side where they're making a whole bunch of things, they're writing a bunch of blog quotes or making a bunch of content and they're like, this content doesn't work. It's like, we'll, have you tried distributing it? Because if you're not distributing that and getting mileage out of it's a waste of time. So this is a big problem in marketing overall, getting the balance of fuel and engine rate. But I like to start from what do you think is going to help most and what skillset does your team not have? And typically, if a team is sales driven top down, they might have an SDR or at least two at this time.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:10:37):\nUsually that comes first in top down. And so the SDRs are kind of an engine. They're an imperfect engine, outbound shouldn't be the only thing you're doing. And if they're just reaching out and asking people to schedule meetings, it might not be that effective but you have a little engine going on. So maybe now you need some fuel first. On the other side of it, if you're a product growth or bottom up, you might have a situation where just nothing is optimized. Your website's conversion rates are terrible, people are dropping out of the funnel all over the place.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:11:06):\nAnd you really need someone who can build up these lifecycle email touches, work in product instead of work with a product or a person as well. And you really just need more engine because people are already finding out about your product or it has someone made virality and you're just not capturing enough of that. So I kind of like decode, what's going to help the most right now? And then ideally you get someone, so move back to an engine first.\n\nLenny (00:11:27):\nCan I actually jump in real quick because that's a really cool framework that I haven't heard before, this idea of fuel and engine from a marketing perspective. To make it a little more concrete, what are a examples of, it doesn't have to be exhaustive, but when you think about all the things that could be fueled, and all the types of engines, what are those lists?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:11:47):\nFor sure. Yeah, I have a diagram of this stuff in my newsletter.\n\nLenny (00:11:50):\nAwesome. We'll link to that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:11:51):\nSo when I think about fuel and engine and what goes on either side, it's important to recognize that some things are fuel or engine and that some things are both fuel and engine. Let me start with an example of something that's fuel and engine. If done well, your community, let's just take for instance, let's keep it simple because community needs 75 things. If you have a Slack community that should be tool and engine. If you have people creating content in there that maybe you can then use in other areas. Like you do this well, you take what's going on in your community and you do your community wisdom parts of your newsletter.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:12:24):\nSo you're using that as fuel but it's also an engine because you have people in your audience that you can distribute out content too. So there's some examples like that. But to go back to the question of what fuel and what's an engine. Fuel is like the copy on your website, it's the blog posts that you had, it's the templates that you've created. It's the video recordings of the webinars or the podcast. It's basically content, but also to include some of the copy.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:12:50):\nAnd I think people have this limited view of contents where they think blog posts and blog posts are still one part of content. Content should be tools, resource, assembled like calculators, those kind of things do better in all the cases.\n\nLenny (00:13:04):\nAnd positioning I imagine is a fuel.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:13:08):\nYeah. That's some of the product marketing steps. So product marketing is this weird thing and we'll talk about it that's kind of in the middle. But yes, product marketing, doing any positioning. Again, like the web copy which is of the first manifestation of your positioning and messaging, or it should be the source of truth for all of that. But you're positioning, you are messaging the words, the words are the things you're creating, that's the fuel, things that add value in that way. The engine side is what people tend to call marketing growth or demand jam or things of that nature.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:13:37):\nThat's really the distribution channels. The email copy itself is fuel, but how you've set up the email and the segmentation you've used and the rules for that drip email, that's the engine. The SEO content is fuel, but your SEO sort of keyword list as a technical FTO and that kind of stuff is sort of engine. Social media, you got to have good fuel but you also have to nail it exactly what channels you're using and all that stuff. So a lot of things have both sides of it. So most projects or activities or initiative have some fuel and some engine.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:14:08):\nI also consider marketing ops work, the setup of HubSpot or whatever it is you might be using. That's engine. It's really instructing the engine, but I kind of put it in that bucket. Because people who are usually good at executing on email or executing on ads or things like that, usually have some working knowledge of the ops work and the reporting work because you have to be optimizing. I guess admin paid is also engine.\n\nLenny (00:14:34):\nAwesome. Okay. And so coming back to your original piece of advice here is before hiring a marketing person, you want to figure out which of these buckets is the biggest constraint to your growth, right?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:14:44):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:14:45):\nYou talked about this briefly, but is there any simple heuristics to give you a sense of it's probably fuel, I need more great content, maybe some website updates versus I need to figure out how to get this out. How do you think about that high level?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:14:58):\nYeah, I mean, it's kind of simple. You can just ask what are your top performing pieces of content or what's the top performing page on your website or things of that feature. Who is your product for? Why is it better? What are the benefits? How does it compare to competitors? If you don't have an answer for those questions, you don't have top performing content and you don't know your positioning and all that stuff, you got a fuel problem here. Oh, you wrote this really great piece of content and I saw it on your website, how are you distributing that? What are you doing?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:15:24):\nAnd they're like, I shared it on social, they didn't really go anywhere, you got an engine problem. Or if I say, do you know what your final stages are? You have two sales people now, how does the marketing sales handoff go? They're like, they share a list and block off everyone they should reach out to. I'm like, well, you have an adventure problem if this isn't going to scale. So it's just these basic things. Are you doing these things or not? And sometimes founders are really great at making the original sort of content and writing the early positioning.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:15:52):\nAnd they're the best suited to that and they just need someone to help them get that stuff out and that's when they need an engine person. So that's basically how you figure it out. And normally when you ask vendors that question, they get it pretty quickly. They're like, \"Okay, I think this is my problem, I can kind of identify it.\" And then it's like, okay, from here, well, what exactly do you need and what exact type of marketer do you need? And that's where everyone's answer is always, I think I heard from investors or I've been hearing from other founders that I really need a product marketer.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:16:20):\nAnd the question is, well what do you think a product marketer is? And you get a different answer every time. In fact, when I was at Asana our COO, his question that he liked to ask all the marketers or all the product marketers that we were interviewing was just, \"What's product marketing?\" And that's the scariest question you can ask a product marketer. It's like no scarier question for a product marketer then hey, what's a product marketer? They're like, \"Oh, shit, I have no idea. Just my job, it's me. I'm a product marketer.\"\n\nEmily Kramer (00:16:48):\nBut really a product marketer, they understand the product, they understand the audience and they understand the market in which you're operating. And from there they can figure out how to communicate with your audience about the right things at the right time. So they're kind of laying groundwork. And then they're also doing some work too. They're also doing a lot of the copywriting and the actual messaging and handling sort of launches and sometimes writing copy for things like emails and helping set the content strategy and things like that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:17:16):\nAnd people think they need product marketers. One because it's like a fake people say, but two, because product marketers tend to shadow this line between fuel and engine. They're more on the fuel side, but particularly they've done a lot of launches in the past. They have a general understanding of channel strategy and what channels do at what time and that sort of end and stuff. But product marketers aren't really specialists in writing and producing content. They're not specialists in building out marketing ops or doing FDO.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:17:44):\nThey're definitely more of the generalist function. And so sometimes that's a great answer. You need a product marketer, but sometimes you need someone that's scrappier in different areas. Another one of my frameworks is we start with doing these seal engine, what are the biggest problems? What are the biggest things that if you did, you would drive growth? And then we talk about the three typical subfunction that you would hire, which would be content, community type person, a growth demands and type person and a product marketer. And we kind of talk about what those three things mean.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:18:16):\nAnd kind of align based on what you're saying, based on the fuel engine thing, probably in this type of person. And then from there, what I tell people when you're hiring your first marketer and probably even your first several marketers, you're more want to hire generalist than specialists. This is probably true for anywhere at the early stage startup, but specialists are great to hire. It's great to hire contractors that are specialists. Like the FDO contractor, even the contractor who can write the marketing ops contractor. But you want someone who is pretty much a generalist.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:18:49):\nAnd the way I describe that within marketing, usually you you are like hire a T shape person that bites in one area and has working knowledge and try to crop all of them. But I use this thing that I made up which is you one up higher pie shaped marketers, not pie like dessert, but pie like 3.14 where the pie symbol has two vertical lines. So like a T but it has an extra line. And it's because you want the first marketer to be an expert in one of those three areas that I mentioned, product marketing, content marketing, growth marketing.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:19:21):\nAnd you want them to be proficient in another one, the second T. But you want them to be able to set strategy and know how to hire contractors across all of them. And so the promise land of hiring a first marketer, they are a pie shape marketer. And so then you could hire a content and product marketing pie shape marketer, product marketing growth pie shape marketer. But it's like what are those two spikes and what's the one that you're going to worry less about that they need to work knowledge of?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:19:45):\nThe last thing I'll say on the pie piece is that it's really hard to find someone that's a content marketer that's also really good at growth. Like that pie shape marketer exists a lot less frequently. Maybe it's someone who is really amazing at content distribution or really amazing at FDO, but they don't really exist. Because the content side is like one side of the brain and the growth data stuff is a whole other side of the brain. You don't find those people very often. So you are usually looking for that product marketing, growth marketing pie shaped person or the product marketing content marketing pie shaped person.\n\nLenny (00:20:21):\nWow, okay. This is great. So I was going to ask you about-\n\nEmily Kramer (00:20:22):\nSorry this is dense, this is a lot of marketing window, so hopefully we're breaking it down.\n\nLenny (00:20:29):\nYeah, we're getting there. So let me try to summarize and see where we go. So I was going to ask you about the archetypes of marketing people and it sounds like there's these three is the way you think about it. There's basically a content community person, there's a growth person and then there's product marketing which is kind of like in the middle. And I guess, one question I wanted to ask is there's also just the growth function, product growth, growth PMs, things like that. Do you see that as the same thing as this growth marketing person or is that a different type of person and a different role?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:21:01):\nIn top down sales businesses it is 100% different. A growth person typically probably called a demand gen person. There's a whole other rabbit hole we can go down on what's the difference between growth marketing and demand gen. And demand gen is probably more top of funnel and growth marketing is probably more full funnel at its simplest form. But it's definitely different there. In a product led growth business, the growth marketer and the product grows sort of role or the hybrid growth role, sometimes it can be the same person depending on the skill.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:21:31):\nBut typically the difference would be that the growth marketer is doing more of the top of funnel sort of inbound side and the product growth person is doing more once they actually get into the product, but can be collaborated with that growth marketer. So it can be the same person in extremely data driven sort of person that kind of has the working knowledge of both marketing and product stuff. It can be one person in early stage PLG companies.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:21:56):\nBut I think typically, and I'm sure you've seen that at larger companies as you get bigger, you're going to have some people that come from more of that marketing perspective and you're going to have a little bit come from more of that product perspective. But the question is, is there ever one person that does that?\n\nLenny (00:22:09):\nOkay, so to make this a little more concrete even for startups, thinking from a startup perspective, when you're just thinking about hiring your first say marketing person. When you think about this set of buckets that you talked about, there's content marketing, growth marketing, product marketing, plus to your point there's at larger companies or maybe later stages separate from a growth PM type person. What do you generally think is the right role to hire/architect to focus on? Or is it really dependent like you said on fuel versus engine versus something else?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:22:45):\nI mean it's highly dependent on, again the business model, what you need more of, what you already have in place, what's going on. But the most common archetype that I say you want to hire is a product marketer. Even though I joke that everyone says you need a product marketer. But it's actually understanding what that is first, that understands growth marketing as well. So they probably work somewhere early on where they've had to have some exposure to that. So they understand all the channels they're working with, understand what they can do with those channels and maybe they need to work with contractors on some of those things.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:23:17):\nAlso product marketer needs to know how to write. All marketers should some working knowledge in writing, but they need to know how to write. They are the copywriter for a long time. Tests that they can write, make sure they can write well, short form and long form. They're not going to be necessarily as good in writing as say a content person, but they need to be able to write. And product marketers just tend to have that ability to write and that ability to understand what channels they can use to reach their audience so they're in the middle. So often that's the case.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:23:44):\nBut I mean, sometimes I find that I'm recommending hiring that growth person first because they maybe already have a couple of really great contractors and they have a couple of really great pieces of content that can just be gifts that keep on giving if they keep distributing them and repurposing them.\n\nLenny (00:23:58):\nWhat do you look for in this product marketing person? You mentioned ability to write is really important? What else? When someone's scanning LinkedIn or just later talking to them, what do you find is important to focus on and look for?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:24:10):\nThis can be hard to find, but I think I want to see that they've worked on a team that's early enough where they are not siloed into their specific role. Because what happens at leader stage companies or at public companies is when you're a product marketer, you don't see what's going on in the rest of marketing at all. You have a very siloed view of it, maybe you're only working on product launches as a product marketer, which the positioning is already set, the audience research already done, they haven't done any of those things, or the channels are all built out.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:24:38):\nIt's just different. I think that's the case in a lot of roles at startups. But building it from scratch is different. So that doesn't mean that if you're a series A company hiring your first marketer that you need to hire someone that's worked at a Series A company. But it usually means you're hiring someone that's worked at least at a growth stage company where they have exposure to a bunch of various marketing. Also looking for, have they seen what great looks like? So whether they joined us startup up early and it did really well, or whether that's they had a stint at a later stage company and then earliest in their career, they're a big company then they went to some big smaller.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:25:17):\nDo they know what high quality sort of great looks like? It doesn't always have to be, you don't have to have been at a startup that everyone thinks of as like, they're really great at marketing, but it is helpful. And there are some people that just have a really high quality bar and really understand what great marketing looks like even if they haven't worked in those companies. But I like to say has worked somewhere early enough that they could set strategy across all of marketing. And do they know what great looked like? That's something I'm scanning for. I'm also scanning for your first marketer, you don't want to go out, I see this mistake all the time.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:25:47):\nYou don't want to go out and hire someone super senior who's only worked at a public company. That's the wrong person. And often VCs or sort lead investors that aren't in a certain niche. when they refer candidates to startups, usually the fail I see is they're like, here's someone great from Google. And I'm like, I'm sure they're great but they're not great for this role and that's the mistake I see all the time. Oh, we just fired our first marketer. I'm like, \"where did they work?\" They're like, \"They only worked at Salesforce.\" I'm like, well, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:15):\nWhy is that not a good fit?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:26:16):\nJust because they don't understand how all the marketing works together and they don't understand how they built the foundation. It's much different marketing something that already everybody knows what it is or everybody knows the brand even if they don't know the product and they have a built in customer base, than building something up for scratch from scratch is just a very different marketing motion, and you need to do a lot of things. You need to do a lot of things yourself, you need to be a doer.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:26:38):\nSo you're really looking for most roles or most lead of function roles at startups, they need to be both strategic and of scrappy enough to get the work done. You're going to be doing it all. And in marketing you're often going to be the first marketer for a little while and you're going to be doing everything. And so there has to be some sign that you're going to be comfortable with that.\n\nLenny (00:26:59):\nAwesome. When do you find that it's usually best to hire your first marketing person?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:27:05):\nI mean stage wise you're looking at some nice people hire at seed depending on their business, but usually it's in Series A or you hire one sort of more junior person at seed when you're coming into raising or Series A and then you know have two people right after your Series A. But really, I think it's helpful to have some sort of semblance of product market fit. Maybe you're not 100% sure, but maybe you have definitely some successful customers. It's not like we're working with a design partner to build this out and we have a couple pilots. Marketing is really good at accelerating growth and doing that scale one to many.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:27:46):\nSo if you're still in the very well spoke founder led sales, founder led marketing, like I'm doing discovery with each of these potential customers and have to modify my product for them, that kind of thing. You don't need one yet. Founders can do a fair amount of stuff and they can use some contractors. I think you need them earlier in product growth models because you're not going to hire a salesperson then. So it's more thinking about go to market holistically and saying, do I need one or two people here and why is that? And so if you're a top down model sort of enterprise sale, you're probably going to have a couple sales people before you hire marketing, but that might not be the case.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:28:26):\nAnd these are more self or product led growth models, you just don't need the sales person. So having the marketer is helpful. So again, the business model affects this a lot, but usually the general rule of thumb is, if you had a marketer what would they do? And I often help people try to figure that out. What would they do and if they stepped on the gas and did all this stuff really well, would you be able to handle all those people that came in? Is it even a good time to bring all those people in to your product?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:28:52):\nSo are they going to be held back by where your product is or where some of the discovery on exact business model is or things like that. And that's the case. It's just not a good use money when they're kind of just sitting on their hands. I can't spend any money on paid and we don't even have any idea what to say on the website because we're selling four different things. It's just kind of hard to hire someone in that case.\n\nLenny (00:29:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens. I've been hearing about AG1 on basically every podcast that I listened to, like Tim Ferris and Mark Friedman. And so I finally gave it a shot earlier this year, and it has quickly become a core part of my morning routine. Especially on days that I need to go deep on writing or record a podcast like this. Here's three things that I love about AG1. One, with a small scoop that dissolves in water, you are absorbing 75 vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and adaptogens. I kind of like to think of it as little safety net for my nutrition in case I miss something in my diet.\n\nLenny (00:29:56):\nTwo, they treat AG1 like a software product. Apparently they are on their 52nd iteration and they're constantly evolving it based on the latest science, research studies and internal testing that they do. And three, it's just one easy thing that I can do every single day to take care of myself. Right now it's time to reclaim your health and arm your immune system with convenient daily nutrition. It's just one scoop and a cup of water every day and that's it. There's no need for a million different pills and supplements to look out for your health. To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a free one year supply of immune supporting vitamin D and five free travel packs with your first purchase.\n\nLenny (00:30:35):\nAll you have to do is visit athleticgreens.com/lenny. Again, that's athleticgreens.com/lenny. Take ownership over your health and pick up the ultimate daily nutritional insurance. Just to set context, most of your experience is B2B, so I guess we should just let people know this is probably mostly B2B advice.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:30:53):\nSorry. Yes, mostly B2B advice. I think a lot of this holds, I think the fuel engine stuff holds for B2C. I think the roles pretty much hold, but you might hear the word brand marketing thrown out a lot more in B2C and that's what we're going to be talking about, the fuel stuff and maybe that's going to be what they hire before they hire say like a product marketer. But it's kind of the same set of functions. But most of my experience are B2B and most of the startups I work with are B2B, but some of it holds.\n\nLenny (00:31:19):\nYeah, I was going to ask about brand marketing, that's like another bucket, right? We haven't talked about that as a type of skill or does that fall into one of these that you've talked about?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:31:27):\nTo me, brand marketing is a combination or has some of the work that happens by a product marketer and by a content and community marketer. But maybe they also are more influential on the design side of things. And so brand marketing is another one that needs 75 different things. Sometimes it means you literally manage designers or you're a trade up producer, and sometimes it means you are more doing work on what are the stories that we're trying to tell and you're doing more of the content stuff. And sometimes it means I'm doing the positioning work, sometimes it means I'm working on the website or branded paid stuff and consumer.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:32:10):\nSo it means a lot of things too. But usually in B2B, the person that kind of owns the brand is the positioning story side of brand is owned by product marketing. And the design side of brand is either just owned by the product designer on first or working with a brand designer or if the marketer has skillset set there could be owned by them as well. So it's a little murky at first, but eventually on B2B teams when I've grown teams plus 10 to 15 people, I'll have a brand person that is working really closely with the designers and kind of making sure that everything that we're producing on the content side of things is up to... They're acting as sort an editor there.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:32:58):\nThey're making sure everything ladders up to the overall story. So they're helping tell the story, they're helping make sure the design is right. And in some instances I'll have a brand person that's kind of working on these larger brand initiatives. We did a huge data study when I was at Carta and the person that kind of ran that whole initiative and the events and it was sort of a separate initiative that had a lot of different parts was my brand marketer. They were kind of working on these larger sort of big data project that's made across all of marketing.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nAwesome. Well you talked about the growth PM role kind of adjacent to all this. For the typical say PLG startup, in your experience, do you find folks should hire more of a marketing person than a growth person that focuses on say, conversion or optimizing the funnel or SEO or paid or anything like that? What's your experience there?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:33:47):\nFor PLG I think you want to have a marketer that is responsible for getting people into the product, that's a marketing profile. That's using all of these channels that's driving inbound, that's focused on web conversion, making sure your website converts, that's a marketing skillset. Because it's really likely you have to work with to get this done is really how I think about it. And you have to work with the people that own the website which is marketing for all of these sort of inbound stuff you are going to work with a lot of people on the marketing team. So that piece is really a marketing piece.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:34:16):\nThe product experiments and the product test, that's a person with a product skill set because they know how to work with other PMs, they know how to work with engineers and marketers don't. And then there's these gray areas like the onboarding experience or when you first get into the product. And that is an area where there needs to be a ton of collaboration. So my view is that if you're going to have a growth PM, it's probably helpful for them to have EM experience or product experience, but they should be paired as soon as they can be with someone that also understands that top of model piece.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:34:50):\nOr maybe that person isn't in a full-time growth role, but know who on the marketing team is going to work with them on these areas of crossover like onboarding or that first use experience. And making sure that the signup flow from filling out something on the website to getting in the product is really consistent. Because that area of I'll fill out a handoff, we talk about the marketing to sales handoff all the time on the go to market side, but there's a marketing to product handoff. And that's the handoff that's really important in PLG. And that feels weird to a user, it's two different teams inside of a company.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:35:24):\nBut if that that feels weird to a user, you're going to notice that all of a sudden feels extremely disjoined. Or if I'm getting a bunch of product transactional emails while I'm getting a bunch of marketing drip emails. So that handoff or that experience needs to be ironed out or consistent or there needs to be tons of collaboration there. So however that is done, I don't really care what the teams look like. Lots of different companies have different versions of how they do this. But the idea is that experience needs to feel consistent and you need to have collaboration across people that have those skill sets and you need to have a clear process for how that looks.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:36:00):\nAnd so it's just getting that marketing sales handoff in my opinion. It's like how do you get the marketing to product handoff right? And if it means you have someone that owns onboarding, it's in a hybrid role, then great. If it means there's a committee sort of situation with one person at the DRI, that's great too. So I think my answer is, I don't think there's one way to structure it, it's just highly dependent on the company overall. And I think you need both skill sets.\n\nLenny (00:36:22):\nYou touched on an area of tension that often comes up between marketing and product. I imagine many listeners hear you saying, marketing should own the website and conversion and net flow. And thinking about the idea of product led growth. The idea that is product will grow our business and oftentimes PMs do that work and oftentimes they're really good at it. And so I guess the question is, in your experience, do you find that it should be marketing more than product or product people?\n\nLenny (00:36:58):\nIs it depending on the person, maybe they're called the product person, but they actually are really good at marketing. Any insights there? And then we're going to talk about just collaboration between the two functions.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:37:08):\nSo I think that product led growth is a misnomer. I think people will do anything they can possibly do not call marketing marketing. I think we always see this. And so I think that product led growth really means not as much sales, which means product plus marketing. And so that's probably a hot take. But product led growth is just another name for what we like. I mean, product led growth is a little different than premium or sales server, these things. But you are being handheld by the product, you aren't being handheld by the sales team.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:37:37):\nSo really to me, and you can have a sales assist with product led grow as well. But typically what's more at odds in my mind is product led growth means you are going to have a huge sales team early on. It doesn't mean you're not going to have a huge marketing team early on. In fact, to me it means you are going to have a bigger marketing team early on because you're not going to have those sales. Sales is not communicating with customers. So I think it comes back to what are these teams typically good at? And marketing is typically good at the communication piece of one to many. That's what they're good at.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:38:07):\nAnd so they're usually good. They should be good at figuring out all the channels to have a funnel to communicate with people. And product is really using product as a channel by which to communicate with customers prospects, et cetera. So that's one way of thinking about the difference. On conversion, conversion also means lots of different things. There's top of funnel conversion, getting on the website and filling out some other form. There's conversion once you're in the product becoming an active user or inviting people. So it's like, well, which part of conversion? Web conversion, I typically think of something that's owned by marketing because usually product doesn't want to own the website.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:38:46):\nEarly on products will sometimes own the website because marketing wasn't there. But the website is something that's going to need to be updated like 5,000 times and it needs to be on Webflow preferably at this point or DMS that's easy update. And if it's built into the code base that's like it, or it's on a headless CMS or it's not touchable by marketing, that's a huge problem. When it comes to once they click the signup button, who should be mostly involved in that process? I think again, there needs to be, I think there's lots of ways to handle that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:39:15):\nAnd I think if it's product it kind of has that skillset and the testing skillset and there's enough volume that you can be doing a bunch of tests, maybe that's the person that owns that. But I think there's still going to be a lot of collaboration on the exact words that are used and things like that. So I think it's just whatever it is, make it clear where the handoff is. And so maybe it's not marketing on the entire website because maybe they don't own those flows, but there's this gray area. And I think the other big thing is sometimes the forms, the literal forms that are used are built in your website and sometimes they're built in the product.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:39:47):\nAnd I think that also drives a lot of it because it's who do you need to help you build these things? And if they're built into the product, then the product team needs to own that. But it shouldn't to me like this, let's not argue about it, we're trying to move this and here's the things that marketing is going to do and here's the things that product is going to do, and here are the areas of overlap. But I don't think products should be in the business of owning the whole website and all the top of funnel messaging and all of that stuff. That's not the best use of anyone's time really.\n\nLenny (00:40:18):\nI know you had a lot of success with marketing and product working together at Asana, and kind of double clicking on the same thread. What have you seen to be an important part of this collaboration and making one plus one equal three, when product and marketing and working together at a B2B company?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:40:36):\nAnd look like there were definitely ups and down marketing working with product at Asana as well. But I think overall we did a good job because of some of the systems that Asana had in place. Which is and we talked about this before but something that Asana did well is they had this list in Asana of course, everything at Asana was in Asana through Asana by Asana. But we had a list of areas of responsibility which is just who owns what, it's not your job title. It's what are the things that you are the DRI for? It doesn't mean you're not going to collaborate with people on those things. So what are you the directly responsible individual for?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:41:11):\nAnd this made it really easy to know who to go to. I'm just going to use DRI because I can't keep saying directly responsible individuals. So the DRI on tests on the onboarding experience is Jennifer the PM. But the copywriter for that is, I don't know, I'm sure who think of exactly who the person was, is Devin on marketing. So we broke it down that's simply so you knew who to go to. Because often what happens with product is they're like, I'm doing a launch, I don't know, especially when there's 15 marketers, I don't know if I'm supposed to go for this product launch or to figure out if this is a launchable feature, so I'm just going to skip it.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:41:49):\nSo it's really helpful to say the product marketer owner for this part of the product is this and to just have this list. So just having clear ownership is what this comes down to. But it's one thing to have clear ownership but it's quite another to for other teams to know who that clear owner is. So I think having a clear list beyond titles and just like who owns what is really helpful. And then as you hire new people, you can break down those, the list kind of gets longer because you're going to break things down more. It goes from Emily owning all of marketing to me breaking that down and not owning all of it.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:42:22):\nSo I found that really helpful. I also found at Asana we did something called Roadmap Week, which was before every quarter. Where we had of open meetings, sometimes they were open and sometimes they weren't. But we had cross-functional meetings to help plan for what you were going to do that quarter on your team. So I could sit in on the product road mapping for X as the head of marketing. And that was really helpful to just get a sense for what was going on. And sometimes there'd be people in those that were silent participators, and then adopting that would be made so you could see this.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:42:56):\nAnd maybe it doesn't scale forever, but it worked really well early on for people being able to be looped on things, to have these sort of out loud landing meetings where you were talking through here are our biggest decisions. Here's what we're wrestling between and getting input, kind of knowing what was going on. I think another thing that we did well was also having clear review processes. And all of this sounds like a lot of process, but once you actually make an AORs list, it kind of runs itself. Someone new gets hired, they're excited to put in their AORs or someone gets the new responsibility and they're stoked to take it over from the head of marketing or whatever it is.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:43:32):\nI finally have handed you the master managing editor AOR and it becomes a big deal. The other thing that I think we did well from a marketing perspective is another newsletter that I have is this framework that I use called the GACCS or the GACCS. Which GACCS sounds more fun to say than the GACCS. But this is just a marketing brief that I recommend you do before you make anything big in marketing or do any big projects. And it's just what are the goals? What's the audience? What's the creative or unique end goal? What's this thing? I guess what's going to make it different and stand out from other companies?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:44:17):\nThe second C is the channels or how this is going to be distributed. How are you going to get the word out about this? Deep thinking there. And then the last few are the stakeholders. Who's the DRI and who needs to weigh in and who's going to be the helper? Who are the contributors? And that's where you can include some product people and you can share this before you start doing any work. So for instance, if you're doing a product launch, product manager communicates with the marketing team. Maybe you have a meeting, maybe you share some brief from the product guide or you share sort of what's being built.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:44:43):\nAnd then marketing comes back to you with the GACCS. And you can kind weigh in on, here are the channels that are going to be using. The creative C has maybe the highest level messaging. And you get buy in early on and then you can go much faster. And then you're not just sharing with product, here's a blog post that I wrote for the launch. And you're like, what? This is the wrong audience, the wrong thing. You just save so much time sharing these types of things up front. So I find there's a handful of different practices that need to be in place, but it's sharing the right information at the right level of information at the right times and having a culture of doing that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:45:21):\nAnd it needs to go both ways. Product needs to loop marketing and they are like, here's what we're working on this quarter here are going to be some of the things that we're launching or any of these interesting that you want to double down on and do what public launch for or whatever it is. Or we really think onboarding needs to be approved. Let's put together a group that's going to work on this quarter and let's kind of have a spring plan that's cross-functional. It's a lot of that. So a lot of this happens in a planning process. So if you as a company don't have a good planning process, you're not going to have good cross-functional collaboration, especially between product and marketing.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:45:54):\nAnd I think the last thing is just a respect for the skillset. Recognizing you are good at this or you have access to engineers, you know how to get them to do things. I don't want to do that as a marketer. I'm good at storytelling and I know how to get people in the door in the funnel. And let's respect what each person is good at and let them go do their thing. So those are just some of the tactical practices and things that we did in Asana that I thought worked well. But it's hard.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:46:24):\nI mean, everyone wants the other team to be doing something a little bit differently and that's always going to be the case. And those tensions in some cases are good because that's why you have the benefit of having different teams and different perspectives. But it gets out of hand when people are just working in silos and aren't communicating with each other, aren't looping people in on things that they're experts on.\n\nLenny (00:46:43):\nAwesome. All the templates and frameworks that you mentioned we're going to link to in the show notes. One of the things I love about is you're like a PM minded marketer where you make everything super concrete and templated and assigned.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:46:56):\nI like a framework, I like a framework and I like a template. And I am pretty PM minded because I'm pretty well rounded when it comes to the marketing skillset. I don't really consider myself a growth marketer or a product marketer or a content marketer. I just consider myself a marketer who builds teams and that's a different mindset. And I also love goals and planning. No, I don't love annual planning processes that companies do and overdone OKR exercise. It's where you're making this crazy cascade that then nobody can follow.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:47:31):\nBut basic sort of simple planning so that you kind of go a little slower up front so then you can just fly out getting things out the door. That's the kind of teams I like to lead.\n\nLenny (00:47:44):\nAwesome.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:47:44):\nIt's like upfront buy in and then move back, do what you need to do.\n\nLenny (00:47:48):\nI love the sound of that. We're also working on a guest post that may come out before this comes out or after around a lot of this templates. So I'm excited to get that out the door. Coming back to this kind of tension that often happens between PMs and marketing people. Tell me if you agree, but I find that product teams are always often very skeptical of marketing and find that there's just all this time, energy, resources put into marketing efforts. And it's hard to measure who knows what's happening there.\n\nLenny (00:48:19):\nWhile the product continues to evolve, you can tell what it's doing. It's often driving most of the growth. And so my main question here is, as a product person, what tells you that the marketing person and team is good and awesome and you should trust them and they know what they're doing, versus maybe they're not amazing and we should try to push back? Any advice there?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:48:45):\nYeah, I recently did a talk with my friend Jenny, who was the head of content at Asana and now is the head of content in Palms at Clear Lake. And she was sort of joking. We were coming up for the name of the talk and she was like, \"I want to call it content splatergy versus content strategy.\" And I was like, \"We'll work that in, but maybe that won't be the title, splatergy is really weird word.\" But it's true. But I think it's funny because a lot of what marketing is that splatergy not strategy, meaning it's just like you just throw a bunch of stuff out there.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:49:17):\nAnd if you're doing a bunch of work and it's like a lot of busy work and you want to look busy, but it's not impact focus. The best marketing teams are impact focus. They can tell you of all the things they're doing, what are the core things that are of driving that linear growth or just keeping the lights on. They can tell you what their big bets are. What are the things that we are doing right now that we believe can cause step change, top of the funnel growth? Or step change growth on signups or whatever it might be? What are those things? What are the big bets that you're taking? And then what are the foundational pieces of marketing that aren't done yet that might be taking up time?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:49:54):\nWe would love to be able to move faster here, but we're like, we don't have a good lead scoring system or we're working on this. We need to redo our website and here's why we need to get it into Webflow and then we'll be able to move faster. So they should be able to break down. Here are the core things we have to do. We're measuring that the core work is working by these TBIs and it's sort of a full funnel view. And we are working on these big bets and here's the foundational things that are broken. So if you ask a marketing lead and you're like, What are their big bets? And they're like, I don't know.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:50:26):\nYou can't grow at the rate of venture back startups, you grow by just continuing to do incremental things. That's the same as product I would imagine as well. So they need to have this sort of framework going on. And the other thing that I think is a sign that you're not being impact focused or you're not being effective as a marketing team is this is my favorite thing to pick on And I see it all the time. And I understand why it happens, but don't do it. If our goal is to write 10 blog posts this month. And I'm like, no, that's not a goal, that's maybe a tactic. But the goal should be traffic and the conversion rate from that traffic or the signups that come from that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:51:02):\nSo you shouldn't have activity goals, you should have impact goals. And so the best marketing teams are focused on these funnel metrics. They're not just focused on a certain number signups or qualified leads. They're focused on that number plus maintaining or improving the conversion rate that comes after it. So they're focused on signups with a conversion rate to activated user of the same or better than it is now. Because I can get a lot more people to sign up for a product, but they might be really shitty quality. So you need to have sort of that other threshold. So these are some of the things that I look at to say, is marketing team impact focused?\n\nEmily Kramer (00:51:40):\nAnd when I talk to companies or work with marketers and look at what are they doing and what are their projects, these are the things I usually point out. You need to be more impact focused and here's what you need to do. So that's the big thing that's like are they doing a bunch of busy work or are they doing a bunch of things that can actually lead to tangible growth and what metrics are they using to track that? The other thing is if they're not tracking to my point about not just looking at the raw numbers at each stage of the funnel, but looking at the conversion rates.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:52:12):\nIf they're not looking at conversion anywhere at all, there's a huge problem. Because again, I can throw a bunch of people into a funnel stage but they don't convert to the next one, it might not be helping anything. So their focus on conversion not just at the stage of the funnel that they own, but throughout the entire funnel, I think also is a good indicator on if they're being successful as marketers or not.\n\nLenny (00:52:33):\nYeah, these are great. I feel like everything you're saying is music to every PM's ears. That great marketing people should be impact focused, have clear goals in KPIs. You also talked about how it's important to DRIs, like who is responsible for what, being really clear about that, communicating really clearly and often. And then there's this piece about just setting the foundations, like a strong foundation that helps make all these other things successful. This is great.\n\nLenny (00:52:57):\nI imagine every PM would be like, This is exactly what I want from my marketing team. And your point here is, if your marketing team and lead is not doing these things well, maybe there's an issue and maybe it's not the right marketing person.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:53:09):\nYeah. And look, if it's not the team lead, because sometimes you do have, especially at a larger company, you have a team lead that's either on the, you could have someone that's extremely sort of creative and on the brand side of things. But they need to have someone that's working with them that is really good at all of this stuff. It's almost like we need marketing PMs then those tend to be the product marketers or the lead. Because there's so many different projects going on and lots of different things happening. And it's hard to put it all together and say, what are we doing as a marketing team that's moving the needle.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:53:40):\nBut I think the other thing about communicating often, it's also communicating at the right level. I find that marketers, even though they're often good at communicating with the audience, they're not good at communicating internally. And I think I've struggled here too as they move to leading larger teams and being on executive teams which is like, what level of information do you need to communicate? And you need to educate people about what marketing does. Because one, marketing often has a bad reputation and so you need to be like, here's what we're actually doing and moving.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:54:06):\nAnd two, there's a lot of jargon in marketing and you got to separate that out and communicate the right level of information at the right time. So I think that's hard too. And so that's why I like things like the DAXs framework and other things like that. And what exactly am I communicating about and at what level. It's hard to get right there too.\n\nLenny (00:54:25):\nAmazing. One last question before we get to our very exciting lightning round.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:54:30):\nI can't wait.\n\nLenny (00:54:30):\nYou've been waiting all week. So you mentioned that you're a full-time investor basically at this point and the newsletter is a part of that. You've become a really active angel investor and it's really cool to have seen the way you've turned your experience in this really smart way of getting into great deals and supporting founders. And so I'm curious if you have any advice for folks that are thinking about becoming angel investors in the future, just how to leverage their expertise to become successful in investing.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:55:03):\nI think there's a big need for investors that have functional expertise. In traditional VCs. They don't necessarily, maybe they founded companies, maybe they've always been investors or sometimes VC and they really come from sales roles or PM roles. But for me and for marketing and maybe for some of the roles of other people are in, there's not a lot of investors or even advisors from that function and they need help there. And so I think more and more founders are seeing, instead of having advisors or even hiring someone at a function early, it's like, let me lean on angel investors for that.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:55:37):\nAnd so I make it very clear when I talk to founders, this is how I'm going to help. I'm going to help you build your marketing function. I'm definitely going to help you hire, or I'm going to help you shape the job description of the process. I'm probably going to refer you some candidates. I might even refer the candidate that you hire which has happened a bunch of times. And then I'm going to work with that person to make sure that they're setting the right strategy and doing the right things. And so being that clear on here's my exact value add is incredibly helpful.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:56:04):\nAnd I mean, we get into every deal that we want to. We being I have a business partner named Kathleen, that I do all this with and we can get into any deal. Which I think as an early angel investor, I'm like, why are people saying it's hard to get into a deal? I don't have this problem. And that's not me tapping myself on the shoulder. It's just showing there's huge shortage here. So your skillset might be really valuable to founders and even if you feel like, I don't understand how everything works at a company or things like that, your skillset could be really valuable and they might not see it.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:56:32):\nIt's also when you have a unique skill set and a unique way that you help well articulated. We're going to help you build marketing, it's easy to understand. It makes me easier for other people to bring you into deals. Versus here's another generalist investor that's just going to help. So it's almost like you got to product market yourself. What's the product that you're offering? And then it's so easy, you know Lenny to bring me into deals where they might need some marketing help and there's tons of investors that do that which gets us to deal flow that we need.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:57:00):\nSo I just think if you have a niche or you have an area where you're particularly skilled, you can really leverage that into being a sought after angle. Now, if that makes you a good investor, I'm not sure, there's lots of other things you need to get up to speed on to actually be a good investor. But from the standpoint of helping founders and getting into deals, that can be really helpful.\n\nLenny (00:57:19):\nAwesome. And the other part is you actually have to deliver because then people share more deals with you. And as I said earlier, I've heard so often how helpfully you've been to founders and so that's an important element.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:57:30):\nYeah, you definitely have to deliver. And again, I think that's where it's really helpful to say where you're going to deliver. So they're not necessarily expecting you to deliver on every little thing. They're expecting me to help them hire their marketer, hire contractors in marketing, fill in gaps until they have the marketing team that they need. And so they know when to come to you and then you respond. I think that's also like when people have full-time jobs, I think it's hard to be able to do that full-time jobs that aren't this, it's hard to be able to just tap in and do this kind of stuff.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:58:01):\nSo it's like don't go overboard because your reputation really, really matters and that's how we've always seen it. We want to be the most helpful angel investors or now we have a small client, but the helpful sort of most helpful investors that you have in your cap table regardless, not just within marketing but within everything. And we do that because we can go really deep on an area and we're always responsible on those areas. And it's good to hear it's working because that's what we're trying to do is be really, really helpful.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:58:27):\nAnd the other thing too, the last thing I'll say on that is each founder probably thinks, maybe they don't, that it takes us a lot more time than it actually does to be helpful in that area. I had the same conversations over and over again about how to hire a marketer. I can do it in my sleep. So me having that conversation with you and dropping knowledge that you haven't heard, this is what I do all day. But it feels really new because they don't have a lot of people talking to them about marketing. We just have a bunch of candidates that we talk to and our newsletter generates candidates that we talk to.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:58:57):\nSo anyone can go on our website and get on our list of candidates that we're referring. I talk to one or two candidates a week from that to just meet more marketers. So I have a list of marketers I can refer and say, it's really easy when clients ask me for referrals. So it starts to scale pretty well if you have that niche where you help.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nYeah, I was actually going to add that it may sound scary to feel like you commit to all these startups as an investor, you have to help founders all day. I can say I've invested over 150 companies at this point, which on the surface could feel overwhelming. Like holy shit, all these founders are probably asking you for advice all the time. But I find it's not that, most founders just leave me alone, I'm good.\n\nLenny (00:59:39):\nOr maybe once a quarter, here's something I could really use help with. But it's not as much time as you think and when it is it's really powerful, but it's not an overwhelming amount of time commitment.\n\nEmily Kramer (00:59:53):\nThe other thing there too is if you refer someone that a company hires, they're going to lobby you forever. You remember that because you sit there and you look at that, I mean, you're maybe not anymore looking at them in an office, but you see and are aware of them every day. And you remember, they came from this person. So one of the most valuable things you could do is refer candidates. And so that's where I think you can add a ton of leverage. You're just referring the right people. So if you have a network and a bunch of people that you know in a certain area like that scenario where you can really do a lot of good for a startup.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nAbsolutely. Speaking of doing good, we've reached our exciting lightning round.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:00:31):\nOh, great.\n\nLenny (01:00:32):\nSo I'm just going to ask you five questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, let me know. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to people?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:00:41):\nI like the classic marketing book, maybe because I think if they're not a classic and they're recency based, marketing changes so fast, like most things in startups and technology. It changes so fast that I like the things that have stood the test of time. And those are things like The Tipping Point and Crossing The Chasm. And I like Seth Godin's Purple Cow, which is just having something that makes you stand out. So those are the classic marketing books and I think every marketer or some of them should have read at some point. I think April Dunford's Obviously Awesome is sort of becoming one of those books that every marketer should have read on positioning.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:01:16):\nIt's really helpful even if you're not a product marketer doing positioning, I think it's really helpful. And then the book I read most recently is not related to marketing at all. I read is my partner's favorite book and she was always like, I don't think you're going to like this book, I don't think you'll like it, but it's her favorite book. And it's All The Light We Cannot See about World War II which is of a depressing topic giving all of the tumultuousness in the world. But I thought it was just a very beautifully written book.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:01:42):\nAnd when you read a lot of business writing a lot, it's kind of nice to step back and just read really beautiful pros on a really heavy topic that isn't just startup marketing. So it was kind of fun to go back and read sort of a older book that was really beautifully written. Next one, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nNext question, okay. What's a favorite podcast for you?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:02:02):\nBesides yours, obviously. No, I mean, you're doing a great job for someone who's just started off doing podcast. You go deep with people which I think is good, it's not just the service level stuff. Look like the podcast I listen to most is like every night when I go to sleep, I listen to The Daily, the New York Times Daily just gets me to know what's going on. I also like some true crime podcasts but I won't talk about that because maybe that's a little embarrassing and basic. And I think for just getting understanding founders and startups over the years, I found How I Built This to be really helpful.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:02:33):\nAnd I think the main thing I learned from How I Built This is that most startups are really happy. And so if you feel at the beginning if you feel like, we're are just a mess, we're doing everything wrong, that's kind of common. So it's helpful in that regard too. It's like, it's not just me. But I think there's really interesting founder story and hearing how things are built is always helpful. So those are some that I like.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:02:57):\nMy favorite TV show from this year was Yellowjackets on Showtime, which is kind of Lord of the Flies, which had a bunch of women. Lord of the Flies meets lost. It's really good. So it has Christina Ricci in it, the person who was in Casper and now in [inaudible 01:03:14] if you were a girl that grew up in the late 80s and 90s, you will know who Christina Ricci is, or a guy, any gender. I really liked Yellowjackets. I think it's great.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:03:24):\nAnd it was the first show in a while that I've been watching it where I like for the first couple of episodes, I wasn't on my phone half the time. So that's like my measure for, is it good? And then the best movie I've seen recently was we watched CODA, which I think it won some Oscars or something.\n\nLenny (01:03:39):\nI think it won best picture.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:03:41):\nOh, okay. So it wasn't the Oscar. So I'm really original in my picks here. I'm like, I just watched the Oscar Best Picture, I thought it was great. No, but CODA was like, I think I cried, or at least I almost cried.\n\nLenny (01:03:54):\nNo, I actually cried. Yes.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:03:55):\nYeah, it's about a family who can't hear and then their daughter can hear and they become really interested in music. And there's the story of a family and they're a family of fisherman in Massachusetts, which my brother is a clamor in Massachusetts that's his job. Not his only job, but one of his job that he clams. So he doesn't quite have that fisherman vibe, but somewhat relevant. Yeah, really, really good movie.\n\nLenny (01:04:25):\nAnd that last scene, powerful. Too much, I'm going to start crying.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:04:30):\nIt's a good one, it's a good family story. Lenny is crying right now. He's just in tears remembering the movie CODA. Lenny is going to spend the rest of the day weeping. You won't get a newsletter next week. It's just because he is rewatching CODA.\n\nLenny (01:04:42):\nIt's going to be an emotional newsletter. Speaking of that, what's a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:04:49):\nOh, there's so many interview questions that I like to ask. I mean, one of the basic interview questions in marketing that I like to ask is just the company that you're working on, what's the product? Why is it better? Who is it for? It's the most basic positioning question you can ask, but a lot of people can't answer it. So that's a good one. And also if you're writing positioning at your company or if you're on marketing your company and you can't tell me what the product is, why it's better, who it's for, go figure that out if that's what the home page of your website should cover. In fact, the hero of your website and so many don't.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:05:23):\nA fun question that I like to ask. It's a mix of getting to know you but also seeing how you communicate is describe something, and I didn't come up with this question, but I really like it. Describe something complicated that you know well that others don't and describe it as simply as you can. And it's just interesting to hear what people pick. Most people pick things related to cooking which is really strange. I ask that question every interview for a long time just as the final question because you learn something about people. And so many people pick cooking.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:05:57):\nAnd I'm like, that's a good choice because I find cooking really complicated and I have no idea how to do it. So describe these various aspects of cooking to me. But that's always a fun one. There's other questions that I always ask like walk me through a project you've done recently from start to finish and I'm listening for things can you tell me the goal? And can you tell the audience? But those are more boring, so I'll stop there.\n\nLenny (01:06:17):\nAwesome.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:06:18):\nWhat's your favorite interview question Lenny?\n\nLenny (01:06:19):\nOh no, I'm asking you questions here.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:06:22):\nI know I wanted to flip the lightning round back on you. Have you ever done your own lightning round?\n\nLenny (01:06:27):\nI haven't but I'll answer the question I met away. I'm finding the most popular answer to this question is that second one you just gave which is teach me something I don't know. That comes up a lot in these answers.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:06:38):\nYeah. Teach me something I don't know. This is a variation on teach me something I don't know. Because it's really about how simply can you communicate it. Teach me something you don't know comes across as a little, I don't want to say pretentious, but it's like it's overwhelming.\n\nLenny (01:06:53):\nWell, I'll add a little flavor to it as they often say, you have a minute to explain something I don't know, something interesting to you. And so it kind of forces you to be simple about it. But I like the framing.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:07:05):\nYeah. It's a complicated framing. And then sometimes what I'll do, especially if they're going to be someone that's going to be writing is I'll be like, okay, make it simpler. And then I'll have them describe it to me again simpler. And I've probably done that in one interview, I've probably done it four times. Which that part isn't super fun but it depends on the person. If I think they can handle kind of joking around, make it simpler. And if I think the topic's interesting, of course, and I'll like want to hear about something so over and over again.\n\nLenny (01:07:32):\nAwesome.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:07:33):\nYeah, I mean it's good to have interview questions that maybe teach you something about how they're going to do at the job, but also learn something about the person. And in a way that's not just tell me about yourself.\n\nLenny (01:07:47):\nFinal question, who else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:07:51):\nThe word thought leader here is getting me down but I'll answer the first part of your question. As marketers, we love to paint the phrase thought leader. Some of the other marketer that I think are doing interesting things beyond just marketing is Ashley Meyer is someone who is a marketer who also has a fund now. She was comms at Glossier as well as she used to be at Box and things like that. And is big on Twitter, but she's just someone else who is a marketer in return fund manager. So it's always nice to have other people like that to kind of compare notes with.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:08:22):\nI think that Arielle Jackson from First Round is an amazing support system to founders and marketers at startup. So if you're a first round company, she's a great resource and I think she's just a great resource in general. I also think Kevin Lee, the head of Marketing and Oyster, he's an LPN in our fund, he puts out a newsletter and has a full-time job growing a rapidly growing marketing team. So I have a lot of respect. He's coming to speak to the people in a course that I'm running next week. So he's top of mind. But those are some people that come to mind.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:08:51):\nBut I mean, I have a lot of marketers that I admire. I'm lucky that in our fund we have over 50 marketers so I have a pretty big arsenal of people I can go to just from that as well. So I lean on the people there for a lot of different things.\n\nLenny (01:09:06):\nAnd you're probably going to be raising another fund, and I know you try to raise from marketers and so is that true? Anything you want to add there?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:09:13):\nIf you're a marketer, we have a fund and we allow for lower minimums for marketers. One of my goals is I don't think there are enough marketers who are investors or know how to get into investing. And I know how much founders need marketing help, so love to encourage more people to get involved in investing and can be the on-ramp for that through our fund. So if you're interested in that at all, or a marketer who's interested in angel investing, I'm always happy to have that conversation with you.\n\nLenny (01:09:39):\nEmily, this was everything I was hoping it would be and more. I feel like we've helped a lot of founders understand the fog of marketing and I think we are probably going to help a lot of PMs and marketing people work together a lot more effectively.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:09:55):\nHopefully. The fog of marketing, marketing is the San Francisco of functions in a company.\n\nLenny (01:10:00):\nKarl the marketing fog.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:10:02):\nKarl the marketing fog.\n\nLenny (01:10:03):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEmily Kramer (01:10:08):\nYeah, I am on Twitter and LinkedIn just Emily Kramer, my name, pretty simple. You can find links to the courses that I run, to the newsletter, to our job board, to talking to me about angel investing as a marketer on our website mkt1.co. And that should set you off in the right direction. And we have lots of things going on to help marketers build out their teams and help founders build out their marketing teams. So if that's you and you're in a situation where you're mostly at a B2B company trying to build out marketing, get in touch with me through my website or through Twitter.\n\nLenny (01:10:44):\nAmazing. Emily, thank you for being here.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:10:46):\nThanks for having me. This was really fun and I'm looking forward to also having that guest newsletter come out with you and just getting Lenny Lennyaised. It's a weird phrase, I won't use that again.\n\nLenny (01:10:58):\nLet's move on.\n\nEmily Kramer (01:10:59):\nWe're going to move on. All right. Thanks Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:11:01):\nOkay, thanks Emily. Thank you so much for listening.
