It's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. If your listeners are like, \"I don't do that.\" I'm like, \"Think about it for a second. This is extremely common.\" Every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, \"Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions,\" that's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. One of my big mantras was, \"We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.\" Many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate, and that's user-centered performance.\n\nLenny (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Judd Anton. Judd helped build the user research practice at Facebook. He was a longtime head of research at Airbnb, and his direct reports have gone on to lead research teams at Figma, Notion, Slack, Robinhood, Duolingo, Fair, and other amazing companies. These days, Judd spends his time consulting, helping companies with organizational challenges, product strategy, design, research, hiring, onboarding, and crisis management. In our conversation, we unpack a conclusion that Jud has come to recently about how the user research field is going through a reckoning and what needs to change both within the user research field and how companies leverage user research going forward. \n\n(00:01:37):\nJudd shares what the user research field has gotten wrong over the last decade, how PMs and designers rely on user research too often, and to answer the wrong questions, where user research will continue to provide significant value, and how to best leverage your researchers, why it's important for researchers to think about the business goals more versus just what the users need, what to look for when you're hiring a user researcher, how PMs can be better partners to researchers, and also a phenomenon that I love that Judd describes and often witnesses, that he calls user-centered performance, where everyone acts like they care about the user, but they're just doing it for show and already know what they want to do. This episode has a lot of spicy takes and will probably upset some people, but Judd is sharing some real talk, here, that I think we all need to hear.

Judd, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast,\n\nJudd Antin (00:04:22):\nLenny, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:24):\nIt's my pleasure. So we actually worked together at Airbnb for many years. And as I was preparing for this, I realized how many of the people that you managed went on to do amazing things. So I'm just going to read a list of people that worked for you and what they do now. We had Matt Gallivan, who now leads research at Slack. We have Janna Bray, who leads research at Notion, Celeste Ridlen, who leads research at Robinhood. Rebecca Grey, who leads research at Fair, Hannah Pileggi, who I think was leading research at Duolingo, Louise Beryl, who leads research at Figma, and then Noam, who was leading research at Wealthfront. I think he moved on to something else. What a fricking crazy alumni community and group from this one team that you hired and incubated.\n\nJudd Antin (00:05:11):\nNo, I've never looked at that list, but I'll tell you, I have been so privileged to work with all these amazing humans. I can't take credit for it. They're just outstanding people. And I'm glad the diaspora is out there, because these people, rock stars.\n\nLenny (00:05:23):\nOkay. The main reason that I wanted to do a podcast episode with you is that you wrote this piece that was titled The User Research Reckoning is Here, which I understand caused quite a stir in the research community and I think adjacent communities. And let me just read one of your takeaways at the top of your post to give people a sense of what it was about. You wrote, \"The user research discipline over the last 15 years is dying. The reckoning is here. The discipline can still survive and thrive, but we'd better adapt, and quick.\" Before we get into the meat of the piece, could you share a bit about just the reaction to this piece and maybe if it was a surprise and what you expected would happen when you put this out?\n\nJudd Antin (00:06:06):\nYeah, I was definitely surprised. I wrote it because I wanted to start a conversation about something I was thinking about. I didn't really know who would read it. And in the end it turned out a lot of people read it. I learned that using the word reckoning may have been a mistake because it inspires a lot of drama in a conversation that I wanted to be really productive and positive. Overall, I would say, though, that the response was very positive. It seemed to resonate with a lot of people who reached out to me. I spent a lot of time talking to teams, to designers, to researchers, but there were also a ton of critiques. \n\n(00:06:43):\nI would say some of it was like people thought I was throwing research or researchers under the bus, like, \"It's researchers' fault. We're doing it wrong.\" Which I don't believe at all. And that I wasn't taking responsibility as a research leader or a design leader myself. And the most interesting one I would say was the anti-capitalist crew, because one of my points that we'll talk about is that I think researchers need to be more profit focused. And there are a lot of people out there who, I think they think that's not cool or not research's job, and I'm like, \"Well, what are we doing then, if we're not helping businesses succeed?\" But that was the most surprising critique, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:07:23):\nI've worked with some of those people who are just like, \"Why are we growing? Why do we focus so much on growth? Why do we need to grow this business?\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:07:29):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:07:29):\nSo I get that. \n\nJudd Antin (00:07:30):\nMaybe it's the wrong industry for them.\n\nLenny (00:07:32):\nYeah. I'm not a fan of that. Okay. Let's actually dig into the meat of your message, and the big takeaway, and the conclusion of what you're finding is happening in user research. And I know a lot of this comes from a lot of user researchers have been laid off at a lot of companies. It was one of the hardest hit teams. And so I think a lot of this comes from that. So yeah, so let's just start big and then see where it goes.\n\nJudd Antin (00:07:53):\nSo yeah, everybody who's paying attention has noticed that there have been a bunch of layoffs. And I think back in the summer I was thinking, \"Listen, this seems to be hitting UX and UX research particularly hard. Is there something going on? Is there a bigger picture?\" The reason I use the word reckoning is because to me that's like, \"Hey, a moment to take stock.\" And triggered by the fact that a lot of wonderful humans may have lost their jobs, and many more are afraid of losing their jobs. And so if it's a sign, the fact that research has been hit so hard, it's a sign of what? And so the thesis of my article is really, it's a sign that maybe the system is a little more broken than we think and that research is not driving the value or impact that it should or could. And that's for a bunch of reasons, I think. Some of it is stuff that research can do better, and a lot of it is how research is integrated and positioned in companies. \n\n(00:08:46):\nAnd at the root of all that, I think, is that we're just doing too much of what I would consider the wrong type of research. And what I mean by the wrong type of research is I have this framework, and it's in the article, macro, middle range, and micro research, at least three ways to talk about it. And it's pretty simple, the intuition of what those are. So macro research is big picture, strategic, business focused, forward-looking innovation, look at the market, look at competitors, long-term research to understand where the product should go next, stuff like that. \n\n(00:09:20):\nAnd then you have micro research, which a lot of really technical usability falls into this, all the beautiful stuff that researchers do to enable a really high quality, excellent, pixel perfect thing to go out the door, laser-focused research to understand AB test results, stuff like that. And then you have this middle range, which is this blobular place where the research questions are middle altitude and a lot of the core, let's say user understanding questions fall here. And a lot of what research is doing is research in that space. It's, \"Let's take a group of people and ask some questions about how they think, feel, behave, how they're using a product or not using a product.\" And it's just this devastating mix of really interesting to many, including researchers, and not impactful enough for the business. That's the core thesis. Researchers do it because it's interesting, but honestly, and a thing we should talk about, Lenny, is researchers also do it because it's the kind of work we most often get asked to do. \n\nLenny (00:10:22):\nYeah. That's exactly what I was thinking. As a PM, that's what I want to get answers to, is like, \"How should we think about this one product?\" And I totally get this.\n\nJudd Antin (00:10:31):\nYeah. The questions turn out to be really interesting and there are many cases at many companies where it's super impactful. But the problem with those types of questions is they tend to, they trigger all the worst stuff that researchers experience. So they yield results which are interesting, but sometimes hard to operationalize. They trigger the post hoc bias, really, really, really well where a lot of people can say confidently like, \"Oh, that was obvious. We knew that already.\" And they fulfill this need for us to feel and be customer obsessed, user-centered, without changing anything. So doing too much of that research to me is a symptom of a broken system, and where companies are really different from each other. I heard from so many after this article and they're like, \"Well, my company and my industry is like this or not like this.\" \n\n(00:11:24):\nBut in tech, we spent the last many years hiring, hiring, hiring researchers, but maybe, I'm sure most of your listeners are familiar with the idea of a ZIRP. Maybe it was a zero interest base phenomenon, where it was okay when the money was easy, to hire researchers, even though we were not setting them up properly. We're were going to set them up to fail. We set them up as a service function. We didn't know what research was for. We didn't know how to really drive impact with it. And that's where the reckoning comes from. It's like that era is over. Research, I think, is more crucial than ever. Good, great researchers are more impactful than ever. But it's in a new space. We're in a new space now.\n\nLenny (00:12:05):\nI want to make sure people understand this framework. And specifically, how would you best describe the difference between this middle range research and macro research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:12:16):\nMiddle range research is usually focused on a more specific set of research questions or a constituency. So if macro is like, \"Let's understand the overall competitive landscape. Let's do a concept car type project where we really look ahead. Let's get involved with strategic planning,\" which is a wonderful thing for researchers to do, do TAM studies, other things like that, that stuff lives in the macro space. \n\n(00:12:42):\nThe middle range space is like, what's a good example? \"We want to know how Airbnb hosts feel about their payment options.\" That's a really interesting, reasonable question. And we can go out and do research on that, but it's not that specific. It's not really targeted at a business problem yet. It could be. Maybe that's a result of the research, but it yields these middle range insights in which we've learned things like, \"Well, hosts want flexibility about their payment options.\" I'm making this up. And that's a good example where it's like, \"It's not that that's not an interesting set of questions, it's just not quite pointed enough.\" And it's not framed in the language of the funnel, or the business strategy, or the OKRs. It's not quite enough aligned enough to that. It's too blobular in that middle level and it ends up not driving impact.\n\nLenny (00:13:38):\nI think it also leads to a lot of the things as you described, people don't like about research. It delays everything. You have to wait for the research to be done to have an answer, to make a clear decision. It also creates this issue that people complain about, that PMs and product teams don't want to just make a decision on their own. They're like, \"I will get this additional data point and make sure research tells us this is the right answer instead of just trusting there.\" God, I guess maybe along those lines, this might be going off a little track, but what's your advice there for, say, product managers or PMs or product teams to not necessarily rely on research for that middle research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:14:14):\nI think the reason why so many PMs ask for those middle range questions is because they haven't really gotten deep with their researcher in a way which can leverage it for maximum impact. So if the question is like, \"Hey, Judd, you just pointed out a bunch of problems, can you be more solutions oriented?\" Well, the solution is simple but not easy to me. It's that we need to restructure the way we make products in a way which integrates research much more fully. It looks like consistent relationships in which researchers, and the work, and the insights they provide are a part of the process from beginning to end.\n\n(00:14:51):\nAnd I think, Lenny, you as a PM, that's how you worked. I remember you, I know who you worked with. You worked with great researchers. But honestly, most product processes are not that way. And so that's when research is a service function. It gets called in right at the end. It's reactive in the sense that a researcher in the room listening and participating in the conversation could have a ton of impact on framing exactly the right question that will drive maximum business impact, maximum product improvement at that moment, and then go do it quick, and get back, and we're onto the next. But they weren't there, the relationship wasn't there. They're not engaged in the project from the beginning. And that's the number one root of the problem. As long as research is a service discipline, I think we're going to be stuck in this spot.\n\nLenny (00:15:37):\nWhen people might be hearing this, on the one hand, it's research has been not as helpful to teams as they thought, and researchers have been spending time on the wrong thing. On the other hand, your advice is integrate research from the beginning, make them more involved throughout. And I think that might confuse people. How should people think about, like, \"Research is actually more important? You should integrate them more deeply.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:15:59):\nThere's a vicious cycle that's been happening, is from where I sit, and this is what I hear from many, many researchers and research leaders, which is a lot of companies hired a lot of researchers with great intentions, didn't quite know how to integrate them. And UX research is a newer discipline, so maybe that's not surprising. We're still learning how to use it. \"Cool, let's evolve.\" But a lot of companies hired these people, but they hired them into kind of like a service discipline, very reactive, not in the room, not integrated in the way I said. \n\n(00:16:30):\nAnd so they had less input on the questions to ask, or they're included, but only at the end. And then they're unable to build those direct relationships, to be there in the room to actually drive the questions and insert insights. Because a good researcher is like the repository of insights you need for growth, but they're not there. They don't participate in the decision. So they end up doing research. They have jobs to do, so they do research that is too reactive, it doesn't matter, and then it's less impactful. Executives conclude that therefore researchers are not as impactful and then they get sidelined or laid off and the cycle continues. \n\n(00:17:07):\nSo I think the short circuit is the constant engagement. If you take a great researcher and you insert them consistently in a product process, I feel confident that researcher will drive a product improvement, metrics impact, growth, all the things that you want to see as a PM and a product leader. It's just that's the exception, not the norm these days.\n\nLenny (00:17:31):\nThis may be a hard question to answer, but when people hear, \"If you have a great researcher, here's how you approach it.\" What are signals that your researchers is great versus not great? What are some things people could look for to tell them, like, \"Oh, maybe I have the wrong researcher on my team.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:17:44):\nThe best researchers I think are first of all, multi method. The first iteration of user research was primarily a qualitative discipline. But a strong opinion that I have is that is largely one of those models that needs to evolve. It's not that qualitative user research is no longer important. It's that the best researchers have five tools. I think they have five tools. And those five tools are number one, what we would call formative or generative user experience research. So looking ahead, innovation focused, really open-ended, maybe more ethnographic, \"Let's go out into the field and talk to host and guests on Airbnb. Let's see people using our product in the field,\" stuff like that. So that's formative. \n\n(00:18:27):\nThe second type is evaluative, so more like usability testing. The third tool is a basic rigorous survey design. It's the best scaled way to get responses from communities small and large. You can get a lot out of really well crafted surveys. But to do that, you have to have the fourth tool, which is applied statistics, the best research, know a little bit of stats. You can't interact in a world of AB testing without knowing basic statistics. \n\n(00:18:56):\nAnd then in the old version of this, the fifth tool was SQL, because I think good researchers need to be able to run their own queries. These days, so much of that is dashboarded, that the fifth tool may now be prompt engineering, which is a thing we could talk about, but I think maybe that's the fifth tool is somewhere, is it technical skills that fall in between querying your own data, understanding it very well in companies that are awash with data and then interacting with generative AI.\n\nLenny (00:19:24):\nAmazing. That's such a cool list. Okay, so just to playback, formative, generative, innovative skills to think bigger and come up with new ideas, usability.\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:35):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:19:35):\nYeah, usability. How did you describe it? I have a different word, here. Evaluate? Evaluative?\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:41):\nEvaluative, right.\n\nLenny (00:19:41):\nOkay.\n\nJudd Antin (00:19:41):\nSo we're evaluating products and doing more. Really that's the micro level of research. \n\nLenny (00:19:47):\nSurvey design, being really rigorous about it, applied statistics, and then SQL/dashboard/prompt engineering. \n\nJudd Antin (00:19:53):\nRight. \n\nLenny (00:19:54):\nMaybe just one last question along this thread, also a big question, but any advice for how to evaluate these skills/interview for them? I know this is its own deep topic, but any advice for someone trying to find this person?\n\nJudd Antin (00:20:05):\nI've interviewed hundreds or thousands of researchers, and the way I usually approach that is you want a researcher who's got a Swiss army knife, because if all you have is a hammer, then everything looks like a nail. And so if you give in the context of an interview, let's say, a researcher, a pretty juicy, open-ended research question, and you want to see how they handle it, and a good answer is usually multi-method. We're not going to handle it in any one way. We're going to say, \"Well, here's a couple of ways we could deal with this. Here's how we could do this in a day, or a week, or a month.\" We usually don't have a month, but sometimes big research projects go on for that long. \"And here are the different sets of methods that we can use.\" \n\n(00:20:44):\nSo see where they go. It's actually pretty simple. Most researchers are deeper in one than the other, and sometimes you can make up for those five tools with the team. So you have experts who are t-shaped, but maybe deeper in one or several of those ways. But when I built a team at Meta and at Airbnb, that was my goal, is individually as researchers build up those tools and then as a team build deep expertise that would fill all the gaps.\n\nLenny (00:21:10):\nComing back to the main premise of your post, one of your big takeaways is, \"Researchers need to be much more business oriented, thinking about what helps the business versus the user.\" Which I think to a lot of researchers will feel really weird. Can you just talk about your takeaways there?\n\nJudd Antin (00:21:25):\nSo much of user experience practice, not just research, but design too, is focused on empathy and very user-centered. This is beautiful. I'm not saying that we should abandon that. I think what I'm saying is there's an overlapping event, where you have the user and profit or the business. And what researchers need to do is be way more explicit about finding that overlap. So one thing, when researchers ask for advice, they're like, \"Well, what should I do to be more business or profit focused?\" I say something like, \"Did you read the last quarterly report, If it's a public company? Did you listen to the shareholder call?\" And they're probably like, \"No, it's full of a bunch of language I didn't quite get.\" \n\n(00:22:12):\nAnd I'm like, \"Yep.\" So there you go. That's the language you need to learn. Scour your Google Drive folder, your internal folder and look for all of the documents that are about this quarter, or this halves, or next half strategy. What are the OKRs? Understand the metrics and the conversion funnel, know it back and forward, because then what you're doing is you're proposing, if you're in the active conversation, you're saying, 'Cool, I hear you asking that research question. I've identified this is exactly the spot in the funnel where I think we need to do work. There's an opportunity here. Or that competitor is eating our lunch with this group of users. I know that because I read the competitive report and I understand it deeply.'\" So those are skills that some researchers have and a lot are building these days, but historically, last 15 years, it hasn't been a thing we've been as focused on, and I think that's an evolution that needs to happen.\n\nLenny (00:23:06):\nI think a lot of PMs listening to this are going to be like, \"Hallelujah.\" This is exactly what I've been trying to convince people of. It's what I've been trying to convince my researchers of, and design often falls into this.\n\nJudd Antin (00:23:17):\nBut Lenny, the opposite is true, too, because you got to take the average PM who lives in that land, all day, every day, and what they do is not in the Venn. I think those are people who are also performing customer centricity and performing user-centeredness a lot, when they're really not interested. And so this is not about researcher. This takes two sides. Fixing this broken system takes everyone, researchers, PMs, designers, everyone at a company, but also the way that organization is structured, and integrating itself in a different way. Everybody's got to come to the table.\n\nLenny (00:23:55):\nSuch a good point. And you have this actual term that you call user-centered performance, where it's the performance of being user-centered. Can you talk about that and then just what advice you'd give to PMs that, hearing this, are like, \"Yes, I love everything you're saying,\" and then not realizing maybe they're too far in that extreme?\n\nJudd Antin (00:24:11):\nUser-centered performance is a term I made up, because it's fun to make up terms. And it refers to customer obsession or a user-centered practice that is symbolic rather than focused on learning. So it's hugely common, I would argue. It's work we do to signal to each other how customer obsessed we are, not because we want to make a different decision. And if your listeners are like, \"I don't do that.\" I'm like, \"Think about it for a second.\" Because this is extremely common. It shows up in explicit ways and implicit ways. \n\n(00:24:52):\nSo explicitly, I would say every time a PM comes to a researcher at the end of a product process and says, \"Can you just run a quick user study just to validate our assumptions?\" That's user-centered performance. It's too late to matter. That PM is not interested in being wrong at all. It's too late in the game for that. We got to ship it. What they want is to check the box. So any check the box style research is a wild example of user-centered performance. \n\n(00:25:22):\nI would argue every researcher has probably had to do executive listening sessions because a lot of PMs, founders, product people, but designers, too, they want to get close to the customer. And so, like, \"Can I do some focus groups? I want to be there. I want to ask them questions.\" This is 97% performance. It's well-intentioned, but it isn't focused on learning. It isn't going to drive better outcomes or more impact. \n\n(00:25:49):\nAnd then there's all these implicit ways that people engage in that kind of user performance, too. A lot of it comes down to cognitive biases, confirmation bias, ego. One of my big mantras was, \"We don't validate, we falsify. We are looking to be wrong.\" That is the mindset you should use when you're approaching insights and research. \"I want to be wrong. I want you to do research that shows we were off base in the following ways. Tell me exactly how and why in a way that allows me to fix it quickly.\" But many PMs, many designers are not in that place. They do not want to be wrong. They're looking to validate. And that's user-centered performance.\n\nLenny (00:26:29):\nOh, man. I think a lot of people are hearing this and feeling exposed.\n\nJudd Antin (00:26:33):\nExposed.\n\nLenny (00:26:35):\nI feel like you're like this Deep Throat person coming from sharing these things people don't want to talk about at the office.\n\nJudd Antin (00:26:35):\nI know.\n\nLenny (00:26:42):\nThere's this quote in your post I'm going to read. \"Product managers love to ask for middle range research that they can use to justify decisions they're reluctant to make on their own. User designers love to ask for middle range research because it fits their model of what proper design process should look like. Executives love to ask for middle range because they don't really understand what research is for, and helps them do performative user-centeredness. In the end, they will decide based on their own opinions.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:27:07):\nThere is an important place for intuition in product development, of course. The best designers, researchers, product people develop strong intuition for the product. But you got to understand, intuition is where all of those biases lie. It's where all your blind spots are. And what great insights people do, what great researchers do when you're next to them all the time, is they'll expose you. I don't have to be the Deep Throat, because you have somebody who's professional job is ... Keeping you honest is probably the wrong way to put it, but as somebody whose capabilities are about expanding your horizons, making it so that your intuition is constantly improving, you don't have to rely on it when your intuition and the evidence sort of collide in a way that either affirms or falsifies the product decision you made. Now something really good is happening. \n\n(00:28:00):\nAnd the other thing that is inherent in that quote is I, at Airbnb, wore many hats over the years. I was head of research two different times. I was head of design for guest products. And my last job was I was head of the design studio, so UX research, UX design, writing, localization, they all reported up to me. So I've seen this from many disciplinary angles in the UX field. And researchers aren't the only ones who are guilty of this. I would say design has a ton of performance. And it comes from the fact that we have figured out user-centered design, this process, or design thinking, which IDEO popularized. Like, \"That's what we're supposed to do, right? Bezos told us that we, as PMs, had to be customer obsessed. So that's what we're supposed to do.\"\n\n(00:28:48):\nIt's a really common and damaging thing when we don't genuinely have that growth learning mindset, and it's easy to sideline researchers. We don't need them in that situation. We've got our guts. Isn't the gut where a great PM, a great founder needs to have that gut? And they do, but they need to be open to the fact that your gut, is limited, and biased, and narrow, and wrong sometimes.\n\nLenny (00:29:13):\nThe two sides of this is trust your gut opinion, \"I don't need research, I don't need data. I have opinions, and my own experience, and I'm going to use the product, and let's just go with what feels right to me.\" Versus pure data-driven research driven for designers that are maybe listening for product managers. Do you have any advice for just where to fall on that spectrum and just how to best leverage research to inform that opinion?\n\nJudd Antin (00:29:36):\nYeah, I taught a class at UC Berkeley this semester on leadership, and we talk about that a lot, because great leaders develop intuition. It's the pattern matching part of experience, where you develop heuristics which allow you to make good judgments even if you can't quite explain where that judgment came from. That's what the gut is. But it's also, like I said, where bias comes from, where all the cognitive biases, there's a list of 151 of them on Wikipedia, I won't name them, but all those thorny things that lead us astray, the behavioral economists and social psychologists study, those live in the gut. And so the advice is when you are looking to check your gut, you have to do that thing. A lot of your listeners have probably read Thinking Fast and Slow, System 1, System 2. Right? \n\nLenny (00:30:29):\nI have it here, right under my laptop, actually, holding up my laptop screen. \n\nJudd Antin (00:30:32):\nThat's so appropriate, Lenny. So the secret is not that sexy. It's System 2. So you engage that slow, methodical process in which you do analytic thinking as a means of checking your gut. Slow in the grand scheme of things. Slow meaning not a split second decision, not like months of analysis. That's not what I mean. \n\n(00:30:54):\nThe other thing you can do, and there's really great research on this, is you bring in the wisdom of the crowd. So the wisdom of the crowd is a phrase a lot of people are familiar with, and it works in a specific situation. The wisdom of the crowd works when the people involved with the decision are bringing diverse sources of information and judgment to the table. Obviously, if everybody has the same sources of information, then it doesn't matter how many people are out there. So if you want to check your gut, get a bunch of different guts together, get a bunch of different people in the room who can bring evidence and intuition to bear, and have an open, direct end kind conversation in which we might disagree. You know who's great at that? Researchers\n\nLenny (00:31:38):\nLeading those discussions essentially, and getting a bunch of people's opinions.\n\nJudd Antin (00:31:41):\nYeah, this is the structural solution I'm talking about, Lenny, is like, \"I never asked for research teams to have their own separate OKRs.\" I said two things, \"Number one, what's the teams? Shouldn't the PMs, the engineers, the designers and the research, everybody should have the same set of metrics for success because either we're doing it together or we're not.\" And then I said, \"My metric for success is when they won't have that meeting without you.\" That's my metric for success. If they cannot have that decision making meeting without the researcher there, that means you've developed influence, strong, trusting relationships, you're an active participant in the process, not just somebody who provides input into someone else's process. And that is when researchers can have huge impact.\n\nLenny (00:32:29):\nI think of the PM role in a similar way, even though people won't have these meetings with PMs, because they're often at the center of lot of the stuff, but you want to be a PM that people want on their team. There's a lot of teams that are like, \"We don't want and PMs, we don't need product managers. They just get in the way.\" And I find that that's only the case when the product manager's not great, and not really good at their job, because most great PMs just make everyone's life easier.\n\nJudd Antin (00:32:50):\nThey do. The grease, I-\n\nLenny (00:32:51):\nThe grease.\n\nJudd Antin (00:32:53):\n... love it.\n\nLenny (00:32:54):\nYou mentioned also, before we started recording, that the biggest challenge for user researchers is in their relationship with their product manager. Can you speak to that and what you've seen there?\n\nJudd Antin (00:33:04):\nI'm wary of overgeneralizing, but I can tell you that from my experience and from what I hear, the product research or product insights relationship is one of the most challenged. And I think it comes from the fact that fundamentally, many researchers are just not included in the process that PMs are running. And then, actually, I did some asking around before this podcast, and so I thought, \"There are some tropes that researchers have about PMs that are worth PMs knowing, just like four or five of them, the things that researchers know PMs say, which drive us nuts because they're not true.\" \n\n(00:33:51):\nSo the first one is that research just slows us down. Research is too slow. This is bullshit. A great research team can do research in a day, a week, or a month. It just depends on what you want to get out of it, like, \"How much detail do you need? How many people do we need to talk to? What is the depth or breadth? Do we need to go to seven different countries to talk about our constituencies in Latin America?\" Well, that's not going to happen overnight, but we don't often need that. The other way to look at that is that is it slower to get it wrong and fix it than to take a hot second to do the work to get it right the first time? So that's BS. Good research doesn't slow us down, it speeds us up.\n\nLenny (00:34:36):\nAnd also just along those lines, a big part of your premise is you don't need to do as much research as people are doing, like this middle research that a lot of the time is put into. \n\nJudd Antin (00:34:45):\nYeah. Research can go super fast. I think especially, so the macro level research, I hope what it is tied to things like annual planning processes. We did a thing at Airbnb several years that we called, it was like Insights 2019, Insights 2020. They were concept car projects. And we spent quite a long time synthesizing the entire year's worth of insights from every place we could get them and then developing with designers and engineers like a concept car for five years in the future. So that's a long process. \n\n(00:35:16):\nBut the micro level, there's so much business value to be derived there, so much business value, and it can go so fast, Lenny, it can go so fast. You can have results in 48 hours on these things. We did a thing at Airbnb. There's a famous story which I'll only tell in the abstract, because I don't want to out anything, but we call it the multimillion dollar button. And basically we did research which revealed that people weren't going down the purchase funnel because they were afraid. The calls to actions on the button was making them afraid that it would initiate a purchase when really it was just taking the next step. \n\n(00:35:58):\nWe changed the text on the button with help from our amazing content design, our UX writing team. We basically changed seven characters and made Airbnb millions of dollars, because what we found out was really simple. It was just like, \"Hey, this button feels scary. The CTA on the button feels scary.\" So that's a great example of how micro ... And that happened in like 48 hours, we would discover that insight, or overnight, basically. And we were like, \"Hm, maybe we should test some other CTAs.\" We did the conversion, we added like 1%, which is really, really hard to do. So that's a quick example of how that type of quick research can drive a huge amount of business value.\n\nLenny (00:36:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Ahrefs. Many of you already know Ahrefs as one of the top tools for search engine optimization. It's used by thousands of SEOs and companies like IBM, Adidas and eBay. What you may not know is that there's a free version that was made with small website owners in mind. It's called Ahrefs Webmaster Tools. It's free and it can help you bring more traffic to your website. Ahrefs Webmaster Tools will show you keywords that you rank for and backlinks that you can get. It also performs automated site audits to find what issues prevent your website from ranking higher on Google. Every detected issue comes with a detailed explanation and advice on how to fix it. Visit ahrefs.com/awt, set up a free account, connect your website, and start improving it. That's A-H-R-E-F-S.com/A-W-T. \n\n(00:37:29):\nSo just to make this even clearer, I think this middle research zone is the stuff that does slow people down, I imagine. It's like, \"What are the challenges hosts have with payments on Airbnb?\" What you're basically saying is, \"Spend your time doing the micro stuff like usability research and then the bigger stuff that's part of overall planning. That's part of the planning cycle. It's not like every project you're working on, you need to have a whole research project on.\"\n\nJudd Antin (00:37:55):\nExactly. The micro research should be much more common. A lot of researchers think that that's scut work, that usability is something junior researchers do. I completely disagree. I think we need to get back there as an industry and be like, \"When you make a product easier to use, when you discover problems with functionality, business metrics we care about will go up.\" I've seen it happen. But that's not just work for interns and new grads, that's for sure. \n\n(00:38:24):\nAnd then the planning process, absolutely. If we're integrated from beginning to end, we can help. And the thing about that middle range, I think you're right. That's the stuff that makes the stereotype that research is slow, and a lot of times it's also because it's just not pointed enough. The researcher can also say in that moment, \"I have studied the business plan. I know exactly where, I've seen the metrics trend, I have an idea about exactly where that's going to go.\" We still need to do that middle range research. The question is valuable, but it's now very pointed and the time is worth it.\n\nLenny (00:38:58):\nAmazing. Okay, I want to cure the rest of these tropes.\n\nJudd Antin (00:39:01):\nOkay, research is too slow is the first one. The second one, I can do my own research. Why do I need researchers? And that's true, as product people, I hope you are engaging with customers and listening well. But no offense, garbage in, garbage out. The thing is, anyone can talk to a user. That does not constitute research or insights work because one user can be powerful, but one user can be idiosyncratic. And a researcher knows how to get to the heart of that really quick. They know how to take that conversation, and understand, and situate it in a way which means like, \"Sure, democratize research. That's happening. There are tools out there that will let anybody get customer feedback, voice a customer type stuff.\" But a researcher is there to help you turn garbage into something that's not garbage and avoid the bias that can come from you just reaching out to your cousin's family and then doing whatever they thought you should do to the product. So that's the second trope. \n\n(00:40:08):\nThe third one is AB test everything. And AB tests are great, but one of my most painful things to do is to sit in a room full of PMs and data scientists who have just seen the results of an experiment that flipped a stat sig, and then they're like, \"Cool, I was significantly down over this course of time for these users.\" And then they just start speculating about why that is, because the AB test rarely tells you why it changed in the way it did. And then this endless flywheel of AB testing goes and I'm like, \"Hey, you don't have to guess. I know somebody who can get you an answer or at least evidence that addresses the question of why did we see the test result we did in a very short amount of time? Or you could use your customers as Guinea pigs, and throw more experiments at them over and over, and spend a long time on it, and come to the same place in the end.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:03):\nI think a similar critique that PMs often have is AB testing is conclusive scientifically, statistically, user research is just talking to a bunch of people. Why would I trust that? What is your best way to help PMs realize that this is actually very valuable data and you should listen to it? It's not just, you know, a story here and there. \n\nJudd Antin (00:41:26):\nYeah. No, I think they're both right. AB testing is as close as we can get to making causal claims about products. Research is usually not oriented towards making causal claims or it should not be, but those causal claims rarely tell you how and why things happen. And if you want to not make that mistake again in the future, you need to know how and why. If you want to build a better product in a way that doesn't just answer this narrow question that an AB test answered, you need to know how and why. And so you need both. Beautiful partnerships between data scientists and research and insights people are, I think what we're going to see in that next evolution. And if you set that virtuous cycle up, if you set up the engagement where those people are involved from the beginning, you don't make those mistakes. You get the causal relationship, which is valuable for one reason and the hows and whys, which are valuable for other reasons. \n\nLenny (00:42:19):\nAwesome. Okay. I think there's two more tropes you had. \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:23):\nOne of them is a simple one, which is like everyone loves to quote that it turns out a totally apocryphal Henry Ford quote about, \"If I'd asked my users.\" It turns out to the best of our knowledge, he did not say that. And-\n\nLenny (00:42:35):\nReally? What?\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:36):\nYeah, I know. Isn't that sad? \n\nLenny (00:42:36):\nI didn't know that.\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:38):\nI know. Sorry to burst your bubble, Lenny. \n\nLenny (00:42:40):\nOh, wow. \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:41):\nWho was-\n\nLenny (00:42:41):\nDoes anyone say anything? I feel like every quote is-\n\nJudd Antin (00:42:44):\nIs apocryphal, now? I know. \n\nLenny (00:42:46):\nYeah. What is reality? Geez, can we? Well, let's just- \n\nJudd Antin (00:42:49):\nOkay, maybe he said that. He certainly believed that. That's what the historians say. But the reason that makes researchers so angry is because that's not research. That's not what researchers do. A researcher who's going to ask customers what they want is a bad researcher. You need a different researcher. I've never done that in my career. No one on my team has ever run a study that's like that. So that just makes researchers mad.\n\n(00:43:16):\nAnd then the last one is about post-hoc bias. It's, \"We knew this already. That was obvious.\" And I think a lot about this book, which I would recommend to your listeners. The author is a sociologist at UPenn named Duncan Watts, and the title is Everything is Obvious If You Already Know the Answer. And it's about hindsight bias. He makes the argument that we rely too much on intuition, heuristics, and pattern matching in a way that is inappropriate to our experience. And it's like it leads us astray. It's like a form of self gaslighting. And it happens because we end up selectively remembering things and then constructing narratives around them in a way which makes us feel like we already knew that, when we in fact did not.\n\n(00:44:05):\nAnd he talks about this other, one of those cognitive biases called the narrative fallacy, which is the idea that people love to make convenient, simple stories about the past. If I asked you about your career, Lenny, and how you got to be this amazing podcast host, you'd be like, \"Well, let me tell you about this series of events.\" And we do that. It's part of how we make sense of our lives and the information around us, but it would probably be a lie in the sense that we all twist the evidence we have to fit the narrative we want to be true, because it's simple, and lovely, and makes us happy.\n\nLenny (00:44:36):\nThis is going to sound self-serving, but I find I'm the opposite. I'm like, \"I have no idea how this all came about. Here's some things that happened, and somehow I ended up here.\" But maybe I'm being very modest and try to not give myself any credit.\n\nJudd Antin (00:44:49):\nThat's beautiful.\n\nLenny (00:44:50):\nThank you for these tropes, by the way. This was fun. I didn't know you were going to do that. So that's a fun, little collection we've got, here. \n\nJudd Antin (00:44:54):\nThanks.\n\nLenny (00:44:56):\nI wanted to ask about, there's this tweet by Patrick Collison that I've brought up a couple of times on this podcast, that I think is really interesting. And his tweet is this, \"In my opinion, the best product will stem from a very strong mental model of the domain and user. User research can help you get such a model and validate it along the way. But it's important to view the syllogism of UXR as model of user research, to improving your mental model of the user, to what product you should build versus user research tells you what product to build.\" Does that resonate in any way thoughts on that way of thinking about user research?\n\nJudd Antin (00:45:34):\nYeah, there's a double-edged sword we talk about a lot in the research community, which is about making recommendations for design. So the best research doesn't leave it at that. It tells you, and it's like the what, the so what, and then the then what. But the problem with that is some researchers go too far in the other direction, where they're like, \"We ran this study, it yielded these insights, and therefore this is what we should build.\" And everyone else on the team is like, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. Glad to hear your thoughts on the matter, but there's a lot going on here. Maybe we should talk about it.\" And that makes perfect sense. That's a failure of communication. \n\n(00:46:19):\nAnd I think that speaks to the thing that Patrick is saying, is like, \"Good research can sometimes tell us exactly what the problem is and exactly how to fix it.\" An example of that is the multimillion dollar button I told you about. But in a lot of the bigger picture questions, especially the macro ones and maybe also the really pointed middle range ones, the point isn't really, \"This is exactly what we should do and this is exactly what we should build.\" It is, \"Let us develop a framework which is based on actual evidence, and then together as a team figure out how we want to experiment our way to a successful product.\"\n\nLenny (00:46:53):\nTo close the loop on this specific thread, what is your advice to teams, researchers to help move out of this reckoning, and to move forward, and help the field, both from a user researcher perspective and also from just a company that maybe laid off a bunch of user researchers or is trying to decide what to do with their researchers?\n\nJudd Antin (00:47:14):\nThank you for asking. I think I said to you earlier, and I feel some pressure as maybe the first conversation that you've had specifically about research on this podcast.\n\nLenny (00:47:23):\nYeah, I think so. \n\nJudd Antin (00:47:25):\nAnd I want to help. I believe so much in this discipline of research and insights, and I think when I said, \"The UX research discipline of the last 15 years is dying,\" I didn't mean that I think research is dying, far from it. I think that there's a version of it, which we're now moving past and into a new version. We're going through an evolution, as many do. And so the question for me is like, \"How can researchers, and the companies, and the other people with whom they work create a new version, a different version, an evolution, which is hugely impactful for the business?\" \n\n(00:47:57):\nAnd so the advice I'd give to researchers about that is develop diverse research skills. Remembering the five or five and a half tool list that I mentioned earlier, really go deep on that business knowledge, so speaking the language of product, and business, and metrics, and understanding exactly how to use your insights like a scalpel, building those strong relationships, which is not a thing that researchers can do by themselves. It requires two-way engagements, and also in a way which allows researchers to do fewer things better. \n\n(00:48:30):\nSo most researchers that I know are working on teams where they're like, \"I'm the only researcher, and I have seven PMs and 20 designers, and I'm trying to do 10 projects.\" And no one's going to do a good job that way. So researchers have to learn with their partners about how to say no and focus on the most important things. But that's only half of it, right? That's the research side. \n\n(00:48:51):\nI have two thoughts about what companies should be doing. The first one, it's a little bit of an aside, but not really. One thing I learned by through the responses to the article was everybody came out of the woodworks from the variety of insights disciplines that are out there. Because I come from a tradition of user experience research or user research, but there are many insights disciplines in many industries, and they all wanted to claim one type of research or another, and say, \"Oh, well, we overhear in consumer insights or market research have been doing that well for years.\" And there are many insights disciplines. And generally I think creating silos is stupid. \n\n(00:49:33):\nActually, I'm curious what you think, because here's the number one thing I heard when I joined Airbnb and you were there, is I did it a quick listening tour where I talked to a bunch of product people. And they all said the same thing. They were like, \"Listen, we have all these different people throwing insights over the transom. And it's great. We want to hear from the data scientists, from the product specialists, from the customer service people, and the voice of the customer, whatever, all that stuff. But they're all coming over the side and we don't know what to make of it. It's too much.\"\n\n(00:50:03):\nAnd that, as much as anything, is an argument for companies to stop siloing research disciplines. So when I joined Airbnb, I set out to create an integrated insights function where it's like, \"Let's do UX research, let's talk about the market and competitors when we have to. Let's integrate smartly with data science functions. Let's integrate all the stuff we're getting from customer service feedback.\" We brought over what was then the NPS program and said, \"Hey, if we're getting customer feedback there, let's all just use it all to fuel this one insights machine.\" So that's the first piece of advice I'd give companies.\n\n(00:50:38):\nAnd the second one, without being a broken record, is to think differently about the broken cycle. So integrate researchers into a unified, lean process. So if the researcher is not there from beginning to end, if there are not strong relationships between product people and design people at every level, engineering people at every level, and somebody who's their insights partner, we're going to fall back into this problem where we're just a service discipline, we're not extracting the maximum value, it comes too late, we don't know what questions to ask, we're ignorant about what research can do. And so creating that integrated, lean process where a researcher is arm in arm from the beginning, is the most important advice I'd give.\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nThat last piece may be the answer to this next question, but the question is how can product managers be better partners to user researchers/get more leverage out of user researchers?\n\nJudd Antin (00:51:31):\nI think that is in many ways the answer, making sure that they are creating a process for the product, for their products, that it integrates user researchers and insights from beginning to end. Also, being willing to partner with the research on the roofless prioritization. I used to say that, \"A full plate for a researcher was probably three things, two big projects and a small project, like a side project. More than that, your researcher is probably not doing a very good job. And a project may take 48 hours. That's okay. But so they need your help to prioritize, they need you to participate. Great PMs will take the time to be with researchers to go into the field, even to travel.\" Did you ever do that, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:52:15):\nI did. I went with Louise, who introduced, we came up with this, basically told me to chat with you about this topic. \n\nJudd Antin (00:52:23):\nThanks, Louise.\n\nLenny (00:52:24):\nThanks, Louise. We did a whole tour to Paris, our whole team, or the leads of our team went to Paris to do a bunch of focus groups and a bunch of user research behind actual mirrors. I've never done that before that trip, and it was amazing. We learned a ton.\n\nJudd Antin (00:52:38):\nCan I tell you a quick story about behind the mirror? \n\nLenny (00:52:40):\nPlease.\n\nJudd Antin (00:52:41):\nThis is back from when I was at Facebook. And there was the high times there, it was like 2012, '13, and newsfeed is really taking off, ads are going into newsfeed. And I was a leader of a team that was working among other things on how to address post quality. Like, \"How do we think about what's a good post and how do we get feedback about it?\" And so there was a team of engineers that thought, \"One thing that you can do on Facebook is hide a post.\" So they were like, \"This is easy. Let's look at the posts that are hidden the most and use that as the signal of what's a good post on Facebook?\" Seems reasonable. And something tripped me on this one. And so I did two things.\n\n(00:53:26):\nSo the first thing I did is I looked at the distribution of hiding by user, and found out that it's power law distributed, like everything on the internet. There are a few people on Facebook who hide a ton, and then most people don't hide at all. And so then what we did was, we call these super hiders, we called them super hiders. And so we said, \"Let's find super hiders around the office, and we'll get a super hider in, and we'll do a really traditional user interview.\" We just wanted to see. So literally the first person who walked in, I remember, because this was a person who had those fingernails that are so long, you don't know how they can do touchscreens, but they did. They were amazing at it. And it was one of those rooms with the glass. And I insisted that the ENG directors, the product people, and they were willing, whatever.\n\n(00:54:20):\nSo everybody's behind the glass, and I'm there with them, and the excellent researcher is in the room, and they come in, and we're just doing a traditional think aloud study. And so they go, \"Hey, can you open up your Facebook app? We would just love to see what your experience is like.\" So they open up Facebook, and were looking, and they look at the first story, and they hide it. They go to the second story and they hide it. And this went on for a while. \n\n(00:54:43):\nAnd she's definitely using Facebook, but every time she'd finish with a story, she'd hide it. And the people in the back room were starting to chatter. And they're like, \"Wait, what? What is happening right now?\" And like the good researcher that this person was, they let it continue, and they're like, \"Whoa, can you tell me what you're thinking right now?\" Come to find out that she was like, \"Well, I hid that story because I'd seen it already.\" The model she was going for was inbox zero, which was sad, because it was infinitely scrolling. She would never get there. \n\n(00:55:16):\nAnd the reason I liked that story is because the people in the back room had their minds blown. It was not that we assumed that was common behavior, like this person could have been unique, but it was enough, because those people were there, experiencing the research, that N of one allowed them to burst their own bubble and realize, \"Okay, we can't think so naïvely about hides as a signal anymore.\" And we came up with a better solution.\n\nLenny (00:55:47):\nThat is an awesome story and such a good example of you don't need statistical significance to get massive insights. One example just gives you a, \"Wow, this might be exactly what's happening. Let's go validate that.\" Versus, like, \"We are confident, 100%, this is what happened.\" I love that. It reminds me actually in the mirror study that I was talking about in Paris, there's a Facebook element to it, too. We were trying to convince hosts how to feel more comfortable accepting guests who are booking instantly. And one of our theories was if they were connected on Facebook, they would be more comfortable letting someone book instantly. \n\nJudd Antin (00:55:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:21):\nAnd we're just like, \"Hey, what if you were to connect Facebook and see if they're friends?\" And everybody in Paris was very afraid of connecting and giving Facebook any data, way ahead of what the US hosts were feeling. \n\nJudd Antin (00:56:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:34):\nSo it just made it very clear nobody wants to actually give Facebook any data. So it was very anti-Facebook at that point.\n\nJudd Antin (00:56:40):\nYeah, that's so interesting. Germany and France were always our bellwethers for what the rest of the world would be thinking with data privacy concerns.\n\nLenny (00:56:49):\nOh, man. Okay, a couple more things. A lot of this started with a lot of layoffs within user research. And I think between the lines, there's a sense of teams don't need as many researchers as they hired during the ZIRP era. I think a question in everyone's mind is just like, \"How many researchers do we need? What is a good ratio?\" I imagine there's not a simple answer, here, but just what's your general advice to companies of how many researchers is it right?\n\nJudd Antin (00:57:15):\nThis is a thing I've thought a lot about, especially in my role as the head of the design studio, that was my fundamental question. It's like, \"You have all these writers, designers, researchers, how do you structure them, how many, and where, and who works on what?\" And the organizing principle for me was always relationships. You know you have enough when the people who need to have a concept research partner have them. And I would much rather create pain in that situation than spread someone too thinly. So my advice was always like, \"Don't try to create a researcher to cover this entire product space. Pair a researcher up with somebody who's going to involve them in a consistent, engaged process, and let them go to work, and see the impact they're going to have, but protect their time. And then other people are like, \"Wait a second, that person's doing great work. I want some of that.\"\n\n(00:58:02):\nAnd creating that pain for them, because it's a pain of loss, is the number one way to grow headcount. That's how I always approached getting more headcount, was not arguing abstractly for why research is important, but by asking partners who wish they had it, to do the arguing for me. And so you're right, there isn't a clean answer for like, \"Hey, this is the right ratio,\" because it really depends on the nature of the product. Like, \"Is it a early stage product? Is it a late stage product? Are we talking about a startup or a late stage company?\" But I would argue there's always room for a researcher. Lenny, I'll tell you, and I used this in a keynote talk I gave lately. You published recently a list of, I think it was about 20 B2B companies and their first 10 employees. Do you remember doing that?\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJudd Antin (00:58:52):\nDo you remember how many researchers are anywhere on that list? I'll give you a hint.\n\nLenny (00:58:57):\nNot too many.\n\nJudd Antin (00:58:57):\nIt's between zero and two. It's one. There's one researcher on that list, anywhere. Anywhere. And that's messed up to me. Now, look, it's just these 20 companies, and each is in their own space, so I'm not going to overgeneralize. But a researcher can drive incredible value no matter what stage a company is at, because a good researcher makes you go faster, not slower, and they drive impact because they answer questions which are impossible to answer in any other way. That's true if you're a startup. It's true if you're a late stage company. Now, if it's your first 10 employees, one researcher is going to go a long way. As you grow, making sure that you're matching up researchers so that they have strong partners in the key parts of the business is the best way to figure out if you have enough.\n\nLenny (00:59:45):\nInteresting. So your advice is, as you're starting a company, your pitch is that you'll have a lot more leverage and move faster hiring a researcher versus generally an engineers, but you'd be trading off, essentially. That's what most of the hires end up being.\n\nJudd Antin (00:59:58):\nI am reluctant to overgeneralize, and I would say I know many founders who are in startup mode are like, \"I know what I need to build. The problem is that I need people who can help me execute.\" And I think that's right. And so everything's a trade off. But remember, imagine that you could have that Swiss army knife at your disposal. Maybe you've got an MVP out the door, and you're looking to make your first major iteration, or like many startups, you need to pivot. This is where it's like, \"Hey, you don't have to do that alone.\" We deify startup founders who pivot appropriately, but I think that is what we would might call moral luck, where we deify the ones who got it right, and even though they made exactly the same decisions as the one who got them wrong. \n\n(01:00:46):\nAnd the fact of the matter is, if you have an insights person with you who has that Swiss army knife of tools, you're not in it alone. You don't have to guess. Ultimately, it will still come down to a tough decision that you and founders have to make, but you can have evidence that bears on that decision, which you wouldn't be able to get any other way.\n\nLenny (01:01:05):\nTo close out on this, and I have just a couple more questions on this thread, I think one of your big messages to researchers is, \"You can be empowered. It's up to you to do the right sort of research and to move your career in the right direction, not become a researcher people don't need.\" And there's this quote that you have at the top of your post, where a lot of the reaction, or I guess the way you put it is, \"I know what you're thinking, they just don't get it. We're so misunderstood. Our plight is to deliver insights that users use to drive business value while we're forgotten, never driving the roadmap, no seat at the table, consistently miscast, only to be laid off in the end.\" And what I'm hearing from you is like, \"You can change that. You can push back on doing research that isn't actually contributing.\" But let me ask you, what's your lasting, I don't know, advice you would leave researchers with to be successful?\n\nJudd Antin (01:01:56):\nYeah, it's tough to be operating in a broken system, and so I feel that response, where you feel kind of powerless, but I think that's not likely to lead us past this moment to the next evolution of research. So that's where it's like I don't blame any researcher at all for being in the spot they're in. It's been a tough go. However, crying about our lot is not going to get us anywhere. So I think the point of the article for me, and this is advice I give companies all the time when I do consulting with them, is like, \"Hey, we can set this up in a different way, which responds to the current environment in a way which will drive a huge amount of impact.\" Now, that takes companies making the right choices. It also takes researchers owning up and developing skills, pushing back, understanding what research can have the most value, developing the skills, and the knowledge, and language around the business, becoming more influential, being excellent communicators.\n\n(01:02:55):\nIt's one of the things I would evaluate the most in hiring, especially research leaders, because I needed them to show and teach by example, is like isn't just rigorous research. It's like if a tree fell in the forest and no one was there to hear it, you need to communicate it effectively, and you need to do it in a way that's appropriate to the audience. Because If I'm talking to you, Lenny, it's different than I'm talking to Brian Chesky at Airbnb. And so I got to be able to give that presentation effectively, and get right to the heart of it, and speak the right language. And so if you're a researcher, it's not hopeless. Actually the discipline, the future is so bright, and we can help it along by continuing to develop these different skills as companies build a model that's more inclusive.\n\nLenny (01:03:38):\nAwesome. Okay. I have one just random, tangential question about NPS. You have strong opinions about NPS, and I just wanted to hear your perspective on the value of NPS, your experience with NPS. \n\nJudd Antin (01:03:50):\nYeah. I do have a strong opinion about NPS. I like to say, \"NPS is the best example of the marketing industry marketing itself.\" And the problem is this threatens many people's livelihoods, because there's an entire industry of consultants and software providers that want you to believe NPS is a useful and accurate metric. The problem is, the consensus in the survey science community is that NPS makes all the mistakes. So it's a garbage in, garbage out problem. So the likelihood to recommend question is bad for a whole variety of reasons. So it's bad because it's a zero to 11 scale. It's bad because it's usually unlabeled. So we label the polls, but that's not the gold standard for research. It's bad because it's 11 items. \n\n(01:04:37):\nAnd there's a couple of problems with that. Number one, we find that precision goes down after five items on average, maybe seven. Number two, especially on mobile, if you're taking this survey, what percentage of those options are below the fold? We are not going to get accurate survey data. And so from a survey perspective, it's really bad. There's also this intuition, which is like, \"How likely are you to recommend Windows 11 to your friends and family?\" I am not a person who goes around recommending operating systems. The question is fundamentally flawed. \n\n(01:05:11):\nThe argument is that that question is a good indicator of loyalty, but there's a really simple solution, Lenny. Customer satisfaction, a simple CSAT metric, is better. It has better data properties, it is more precise, it is more correlated to business outcomes. I wanted to prove this. This is something that survey scientists know and marketers don't want you to know. And so we did the work with Mike Murakami, who led survey science at Airbnb, and he's still there, great researcher. And we basically redid all that work to find out if all that stuff was true just for Airbnb. And it is. It's simple. Don't ask NPS, ask customer satisfaction\n\nLenny (01:05:50):\nAnd the customer satisfaction question, what's the actual question for people to make sure?\n\nJudd Antin (01:05:54):\nOverall, how satisfied are you with your experience with Airbnb? Or it could be some version of that, which is like, \"Overall, how satisfied are you with your experience with customer service when you had a problem?\" So there could be a more specific version of that question, but those questions have better properties. And a lot of people say, \"Well, hey, everybody's using NPS. So at least it gives me a benchmark because I can compare my NPS to industry NPS.\" The problem with that is the research shows that NPS is idiosyncratic, so it goes up and downs in ways that we don't understand, and there's a lot of inconsistency in how it's asked, that creates variations in the data, which means it's not apples to apples, so you can't even compare your NPS meaningfully to somebody else's.\n\nLenny (01:06:37):\nI love these hot takes. I'm curious to see who comes out of the woodwork, too, when-\n\nJudd Antin (01:06:41):\nPeople are going to be so mad, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:06:42):\nI love that. I think, yeah, I've heard this many times and people don't talk about it. Okay. Is there anything else you want to share or leave people with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJudd Antin (01:06:54):\nCan I? Yeah, I want to add one thing if I could, because this has come up on your podcast a few times recently, which is about the idea of people doing their own product walkthroughs. So should a PM just rely on their own dog fooding of the product and their own walkthrough to figure out how to fix it? And a couple of times recently this has come up, and I think the consensus seems to be, \"Yes, this is a good thing.\" And I have a contrarian opinion there, too, which is that I think it is really important for everyone to dog food their own products. The problem is related to relying on your intuition about those products, which is the thing most PMs have trouble with is realizing, \"You are nothing like the user. You are nothing like them in ways that will bias the way you think about what's good and bad in your product in ways that you can't necessarily recognize. Some things with a product, some problems with a product, you need a pulse to recognize.\"\n\n(01:07:57):\nAnd most good PMs that I know have a pulse and so cool. But a lot of them require context of use, priorities, constraints that you just don't have and you can't imagine purely on the basis of your own usage. So what I think that means is that you should definitely dog food your own product. Doing product walkthroughs to identify lists of potential issues is a great thing to do. Prioritizing that list, figuring out which ones are more or less a problem, and for whom is an area where you should be extremely wary of relying on your own opinion, expertise, or intuition when you are dog fooding your own product.\n\nLenny (01:08:39):\nThank you for sharing that. It's definitely come up a bunch on this podcast, so I think that's an important lesson for people to take away. Anything else before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJudd Antin (01:08:49):\nI appreciate you, Lenny. Thanks for having me on. \n\nLenny (01:08:51):\nI appreciate you, Judd. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJudd Antin (01:08:56):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:08:57):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJudd Antin (01:09:02):\nI recently read a business book by Barbara Kellerman called Bad Leadership. And what I love about it is that we spend a lot of time talking about good leaders, and she really dives into the worst leaders and what makes them bad leaders in a way that I think is really valuable for everybody. \n\n(01:09:19):\nI'd also recommend, I read a lot of fiction, so two recommendations, there. One, a recent Pulitzer Prize winner, Demon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver. It's an outstanding read that also is really sad, and moving, and illustrative, especially if you want to understand rural poverty. And then completely other side of the fiction spectrum, if you're interested in science fiction, which I am, read the Murderbot Diaries, it's about a sarcastic killer robot. And who doesn't love them?\n\nLenny (01:09:48):\nI love these fiction recommendations. I feel like we need more of these on the podcast, so thank you. \n\nJudd Antin (01:09:52):\nYeah. Everybody goes to business books.\n\nLenny (01:09:53):\nYeah, absolutely. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nJudd Antin (01:09:59):\nWe recently watched The Last of Us and it blew our mind. I watched it after I played the video game after long last, if you are a person who plays video games and you haven't played The Last of Us, play it. If you don't know, the show is based on the video game, not the other way around.\n\nLenny (01:10:14):\nDo you have a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nJudd Antin (01:10:19):\nThink of a topic that you had to explain lately that was the most complex, and then explain it to me like I'm five. And there are a lot of ways to vary that question, but the reason I like it is because I think, and I've asked this question to VP and C-suite candidates in multiple disciplines, and sometimes it's related to a conversation, like I might ask them to explain something complicated about quantum computing, or music theory, or it could be a complex business decision, but I want to see if somebody can break a complex problem down in a really simple way, and give me an intuition for it in a short amount of time. I think that is a differentiator between good and great for many people.\n\nLenny (01:11:02):\nDo you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJudd Antin (01:11:06):\nYeah, this is a really weird one, but my whole family started indoor rock climbing recently, and there's a challenge you have when you top rope, which is that you're looking up all the time. So they make these glasses, which are called belay glasses, and they have an angled mirror embedded in the lens, so that you can look straight ahead, and the view you see is up towards the person who you're belaying. And I just thought that product is so perfect for that. That's a niche problem and there isn't a better way to solve it.\n\nLenny (01:11:37):\nDo you have a favorite motto that you often come back to, that you share with friends either in work or in life that you find useful?\n\nJudd Antin (01:11:44):\nYeah. This is going to seem like pandering, Lenny, but I don't know if you remember a conversation that you and I had, it must've been eight years ago. I remember where we were sitting. And it was about stoicism. Do you remember this? Anyway, we had this conversation.\n\nLenny (01:11:59):\nI don't, but I was into stoicism for a while.\n\nJudd Antin (01:12:01):\nI know you were, because we talked about it. And so the motto comes from stoicism, which is basically, \"Focus on the things you can control and ignore the rest.\" And a lot of people think of this as the serenity prayer or the serenity saying, that was a 20th century invention, but Epictetus was writing about this BC, and I think about it all the time. So much of the stress, and pain, and worry that we have in life comes from things we can't control. So I try to let those things go.\n\nLenny (01:12:34):\nAmazing. I learned that lesson from 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, and just the importance of thinking about these circles of you can control, you can influence, and you have no control over, and there's no reason to think about those other things.\n\nJudd Antin (01:12:46):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (01:12:47):\nJudd, this was everything I hoped it would be. We got into some really good stuff. I'm excited to hear how people react. Two final questions, where can folks find you if they want to learn about what you're up to, actually share what you're up to these days, and how people can find you, and then also how can listeners be useful to you? \n\nJudd Antin (01:13:01):\nYeah. Thanks for asking those questions. People can find me at juddantin.com. That's the best way to find out what I'm up to. These days, I'm a consultant. I help people with UX strategy, org design, and crisis management. Somehow I love dealing with other people's dumpster fires, and I've found that I'm constitutionally good at it somehow. So juddantin.com is the place to find out. I also write. I write a medium post that you can find at onebigthought.com. And you'll find a lot of the topics we talked about today, including the original post that started this at onebigthought.com. If there's one thing I could ask your listeners to do is to get next to your researcher. I just think if you build those relationships and involve a researcher and insights person early and often, beautiful things will happen for you and for the business. So that's the thing everyone can do for me.\n\nLenny (01:13:56):\nI love that. I've always done that. I loved my researchers that I've worked with, many of them reporting to you, and so beautiful takeaway. Judd, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJudd Antin (01:14:07):\nLenny, thank you. It's been a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:14:09):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

This is super helpful,\" because people are like, \"Oh, he actually likes the feedback.\" Now, inside my heart might be melting. I'm like, \"Oh, I thought I got better at this.\" You know what I mean? \n\nLenny (00:00:14):\nYeah. \n\nJules Walter (00:00:14):\nBut externally, I'm like, \"Hey, thank you,\" and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.\n\nLenny (00:00:26):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today, my guest is Jules Walter. Jules is a product leader at YouTube. Before that, he spent four and a half years at Slack, where he was their first growth PM and then went on to lead their monetization teams and also their mobile team. He's also the co-founder and a board member of the Black Product Managers Network and CodePath, both of which are nonprofits that aim to increase diversity within tech. Jules and I have collaborated on a number of projects over the years, including a killer guest post on building product sense that continues to be one of the most shared and beloved posts in my newsletter. \n\n(00:01:04):\nIn our conversation, we focus on what skills matter most in advancing a PM's career, and more importantly, all the ways Jules has found to build those skills. We also go deep on mentorship, how to find a mentor, what to look for in a mentor, how to get someone to agree to be a mentor, and a lot more. I super enjoyed this conversation, which I'm sure you can tell. Jules is such a gem of a human. I can't wait for you to hear this episode. With that, I bring you Jules Walter after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:36):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. Beginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta. Just go to vanta.com/lenny, that's V-A-N-T-A.com/lenny, to learn more and to claim your discount. Get started today.\n\n(00:02:54):\nThis episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful, and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all. Learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod. Take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again, at notion.com/lennyspod.\n\n(00:03:49):\nJules, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJules Walter (00:03:52):\nHey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. I'm really excited.\n\nLenny (00:03:54):\nI am even more excited. This chat has been a long time coming. I've been hoping to get you on this podcast ever since this podcast even launched. And then in the meantime, while we've been waiting to schedule it, a number of guests have mentioned how useful you've been to them in their career, and so I'm just really excited to finally have you on.\n\nJules Walter (00:04:11):\nYeah, same here.\n\nLenny (00:04:12):\nLet's just start with a quick overview of your background. Could you share some of the wonderful places you've worked, some of the wonderful projects you've worked on, and then just a bit about what you're working on today?\n\nJules Walter (00:04:25):\nYeah, happy to. Some quick background, grew up in Haiti, studied computer science in college, went to business school. My first career was actually not in tech; it was in medical devices. I was a GM for a company based out of France and also overseeing West Africa business for them. After doing that, I moved back to the US, launched my own startup, which didn't work out, and then I moved to the Bay Area roughly eight years ago. In the Bay Area I wanted to become a PM, which was really hard to get into. At first, I joined a startup, series a company, became head of product for them, and then join Slack as the first PM on their growth team. Then from their, help scale the growth team at Slack. When I joined revenue was around 50 million; when I left roughly four years ago was 10x that. And then after Slack I recently joined YouTube Google about two years ago. At Google I'm a product lead at YouTube, where I'm driving a product called Primetime Channels, which actually recently launched in November in the US. And in that product, we're bringing streaming services to YouTube so that users can watch their favorite movies, shows, and sports content.\n\nLenny (00:05:35):\nAmazing. The reason that I think we pushed this schedule of this podcast recording out is because you've been working on that product for many months and I'm glad to hear that it's finally launched. How did the launch go?\n\nJules Walter (00:05:45):\nSo far so good. It's really exciting to take a product from nothing to something. \n\nLenny (00:05:49):\nEspecially at a company like Google.\n\nJules Walter (00:05:51):\nYeah. And then over time we are adding more exciting content onto the product. We just recently you announced that we're adding NFL Sunday Ticket in 2023 to primetime channels and also to YouTube TV. It's been a really exciting project.\n\nLenny (00:06:05):\nThat's awesome. I bet there's a lot of stories there, but I know you can't talk too much about what's happening at Google, so we'll move on. I like the point that you made about joining a startup, like you were trying to get into product management and you joined a startup as their first PM. I think you mentioned that's how you got into the PM path or I guess... Correct me if I'm wrong, but that's an interesting example of one of the paths into product management: joining a startup, getting into product there.\n\nJules Walter (00:06:27):\nNot as their first PM, but I joined as one of their first PMs. Yeah. \n\nLenny (00:06:31):\nAs one of their first PMs? \n\nJules Walter (00:06:32):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:06:33):\nThat's something I hear often is just one of the paths to product management is join a startup, start doing product, and then you're a PM. And then you have a PM title on your resume and you can now join other companies. Is that something you found or anything you can take away from that experience?\n\nJules Walter (00:06:46):\nYeah. It's really, really hard to get into product and there isn't a really set path to do that. What I've seen is the path that we just talked about, join a startup and then from there go into different companies. And then the other path that is typical is being at a company and then switching product management, especially if you develop domain expertise and there's a need for a PM. So, that's even more frequent. Of course there's also acquisitions that sort of thing, but making that initial transition is really hard.\n\nLenny (00:07:19):\nI didn't realize you were the first growth PM at Slack. That is a big role. How did that work out? How did you become the first growth PM at Slack? Was that the first time you're doing growth? What's the story there?\n\nJules Walter (00:07:30):\nI joined Slack early 2016 and the role that was available at the time was growth. I did not know anything about growth, but I was like, \"Hey, this is my way in at such a great company.\" So, that's what I joined to do. And then what I did there was really take a learning mindset and lean on mentors, and we can talk about that to really learn the practice of growth and applied for Slack.\n\nLenny (00:08:00):\nCool. We're definitely going to talk about some of those things. Just thinking about that experience and that ride at Slack, what's like maybe the most tangible memory or most, I don't know, interesting story of just riding that rocket ship of Slack growth as one of their early PMs?\n\nJules Walter (00:08:14):\nThere's many, many stories. My experience was I got in, didn't know much about growth, and then through mentorship, in particular, one mentor, Bangaly Kaba, sort of learned how to apply growth frameworks to my work. And then when I did that within six months, I was able to ship changes in the new user experience, especially on mobile. That moved the needle by a lot, like double-digit percentages within your [inaudible 00:08:38]. And we're talking about top line metrics like activation. It was just interesting being able to have such impact very quickly at a company, and then the company itself went through all these milestones. I mentioned I joined 50 million, the next thing it's a hundred, and it keep doubling, going through a public offering. So, there's just so many stories that are unique to hyper growth.\n\nLenny (00:09:01):\nYou also didn't mention in your background all these kind of extracurricular activities that you have. I've always been impressed with how much time you put into things that are kind of just volunteer projects on the side. Can you talk about some of the stuff that you do outside of your actual day job?\n\nJules Walter (00:09:15):\nOutside of my work at YouTube now and also my family and young kids, I'm also involved with two nonprofits that I co-founded. Both of them are actually about improving diversity in tech, which is something I'm really passionate about. The first one is called CodePath and it's improving diversity for software engineers, and the second one is Black PMs focused on product management. With CodePath specifically, what we do is we train over 5,000 students every year at universities, typically the university with strong underrepresented populations, and we help them find internships and jobs at top tech companies. And then with Black PMs, we have a community of over a thousand PMs and aspiring PMs and then we help them find community and also grow their skills. Both of them are nonprofits that I wasn't actually setting out to build them. It's more like I had the need myself or I wish I had those sort of support when I was earlier in my career. And then I started helping folks and then one thing led to the other, especially my co-founders, and then these became big.\n\nLenny (00:10:22):\nSounds like a classic startup story, solve your own problem and turns into a larger and larger thing. I think I try to work with Black PMs as much as I can, and I know that you recently had a conference, which is so cool. I don't know, it was a really big conference that you organized. I don't know how you all had time for all that, but anything you can share about this conference and is there another one coming?\n\nJules Walter (00:10:42):\nNow we have a really good team at Black PMs. The CEO, Brittany Bankston and the team, Benin Saffo and others, have helped put together that amazing conference that I was able to attend. It's amazing that it's hard for underrepresented community to see themselves in podcasts, at conferences, at speakers, that sort of thing. So, it gave that opportunity and it also enables us to realize that you're not alone. Because part of why I created Black PMs with my co-founders is... Actually, I'll tell you the story. \n\n(00:11:17):\nI think it was around 2016, I was at a barbecue. I met another Black PM, Maryanna Quigless. I didn't know her and I was like, \"Oh, you're a Black PM at Facebook. How many of you are there at the company?\" And we're joking and we're like, \"Hey, I bet we can list all the Black PMs we know.\" And we had basically roughly 15 between the two of us and we're like, \"Hey, let's bring them all together in a room and to have a community.\" From there, started helping each other and that grew from 15 to now over a thousand.\n\nLenny (00:11:45):\nWow. Amazing. It's really inspiring, the work that you do. I don't know how you find time for all this. I love that you found ways to kind of delegate this and have other people run the program now.\n\nJules Walter (00:11:55):\nYeah. Now, I'm mostly on the board of these organizations. We have really solid teams for both Black PMs and CodePath, and the teams are just really amazing.\n\nLenny (00:12:03):\nThis touches on the stuff that I want to spend most of our time on our chat, which is around mentorship and just generally becoming a stronger product manager through all the ways you can become a stronger product manager. You mentioned you had a lot of great mentors. I've heard from other people, you've been a great mentor to them and you've also just been really successful at a number of really world-class companies. What I want to chat about is just, what have you found to be the most important skills to develop as a PM as you advance in your career, and then how to actually build those skills partly with mentorship, partly other ways? Maybe just to start, what have you found to be the most important skills in your career that have most helped you advance in your career and other PMs around you?\n\nJules Walter (00:12:50):\nIn terms of skills, I think of it in terms of two buckets. One are IQ skills, intellectual skills, like what sometimes people call hard skills. And then the other things are the EQ skills, oftentimes called soft skills. What I've seen in my career is that early on, I leaned more into the hard skills, the IQ stuff. That was what was most helpful to me. And then later on, I spent more time getting better at the EQ skills. The reality with PMs is that within each of these buckets, there's so many skills and then you can feel overwhelmed, so my advice is really just start skill by skill. What I did specifically is I joined Slack, I was in ICPM. When you join a new company, especially if you're earlier in the mid-career, you really want to get good at things like execution, IQ skills, execution, product sense, strategy. So, those were critical for me, especially my first year at Slack. \n\n(00:13:51):\nThe other skill that I'll also call out, which nobody talks about for some reason, is interview skills, because so much of what gives you a chance to become better as a PM is working at a great company. How you get that job beyond networking is actually becoming good at interviewing. If you think about my career, getting into Slack changed my trajectory and I was able to do that because I got slightly somewhat good enough at interviewing. I barely got the job and then I was really good at execution and got better at these other things, product sense, strategy, et cetera. In that phase, the things that I was working on, as I mentioned earlier, were things like improving user activation. So, it relies on those skills: identifying the opportunities, running experiments, executing quickly, and so on. That's the first set of skills.\n\nLenny (00:14:49):\nBefore we move on, and the second set is EQ, right? Is that where you're going? \n\nJules Walter (00:14:51):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:14:52):\nCool. Maybe just one quick thread I want to pull on is this interviewing skill. That's really interesting. Your point here is you're not... And I think you're going to get to this of just how to get better at these skills. You mentioned one of the best ways is to be surrounded by amazing people who can help you get better at these skills, but you won't get there if you can't actually get into a company like Slack. Is there something you've found to be useful in building these interview skills? When you say interview, it's being interviewed, not interviewing other people, like passing these interview tests. \n\nJules Walter (00:15:22):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:15:22):\nYeah. I guess what have you found has been most helpful in helping you become a better interviewee?\n\nJules Walter (00:15:28):\nWhen people tell me, \"Hey, I'm going to a interview at this company.\" First question I ask is, \"How many mock interviews have you done?\" And the answer typically is zero. It's, \"Oh, I read a bunch of stuff. I practiced in my head.\" But I'm like, \"How many actual mock interviews have you done?\" And I would recommend people to do dozens of those mock interviews. Now, the other thing about practice is it's always better if you deliberate practice. If you mock interview with somebody who's actually good at interviewing, then you'll get better faster. But even if you don't do that, just going from zero mocks to practicing in your head to actually doing mocks with peers and others is going to get you to another level. And then the other thing I'll say is interviewing can be quite traumatic and difficult for a lot of people, even me. I mean before I got this job, I interviewed at Google, I don't know how many times, over the last decade or two.\n\nLenny (00:16:22):\nWait. You're saying you're interviewed at Google many times and you didn't get in then you kept looking for new opportunities?\n\nJules Walter (00:16:27):\nYeah. I graduated from MIT and I think even since internship times in '07, I'd interviewed for roles at Google and I didn't get those roles or Meta or various other companies. It's because I wasn't good at interviewing and I didn't know people at those companies. By the way, most things you do, people give you some feedback so you can get better at it, but interviewing you never get any feedback. That's the thing people don't talk about, but it's actually an important skill or a barrier to underrepresented folks.\n\nLenny (00:17:01):\nTo actually get feedback?\n\nJules Walter (00:17:02):\nYeah. You won't get feedback after an interview at any company.\n\nLenny (00:17:05):\nThat's a really good insight of just people see you join a YouTube and are like, \"Oh, yeah, of course he's going to get into YouTube.\" But you're saying that you actually tried to interview and get into Google many times and it took a number of attempts and advancing your career a little bit before you actually... So, don't feel so discouraged if it doesn't work out. \n\nJules Walter (00:17:23):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:17:24):\nIn terms of this mock, that's a really important point of just actually doing the interviews, like practicing, practicing, practicing. Not just reading questions but actually testing and practicing interview. If you were interviewed at a big company, there's a lot of videos out there of like, \"Here's the questions they ask. Here's what they look for.\" And you're saying find people that work at the company and do these sorts of interviews with them. For companies that are smaller that maybe don't... It's not as obvious what they're going to ask you. Do you have any advice on how to find someone to do a mock interview with or how or what to actually be talking through?\n\nJules Walter (00:17:56):\nYeah, it's hard at smaller companies. However, I think interviewing even at bigger companies will help you [inaudible 00:18:04]. A lot of the times the bigger companies have more rigorous processes. So if you can do well there, then it is a bit easier elsewhere. But the key is really that practice part, which people overlook.\n\nLenny (00:18:18):\nCool. Well, maybe one last question there and we'll move on. Do you have any favorite resources or just advice of where to go find the questions to mock interview with and then who do you look forward to do these interviews with, like just find someone at the company or one of these larger companies that you respect to mock interview with?\n\nJules Walter (00:18:34):\nI mentor a bunch of people who talk about various communities that exist out there. I can follow up on those, but there are large communities of people prepping for these companies. The key is really just being a part of a community and doing the mocks. And then the last thing I'll say on this is interviewing is hard and especially, I think, hard for underrepresented folks because it's high pressure. It's high stress, high ambiguity-\n\nLenny (00:19:02):\nSo much stress.\n\nJules Walter (00:19:03):\n... coming into a company. I've gone into companies like an interview and then the whole panel, nobody looks like me. I walk into the cafeteria, nobody looks like me. And then you are interviewing and you have all this self-talk about, \"Hey, do I even want to work there? Will I belong,\" while you're trying to solve complex problems. So, that's also the other part companies don't think about. What I do, like folks at Black PMs that I coach, is really help them find groups of people, like small groups. Let's say three of us, et cetera, three to five, and then you practice with that group who are going through the process. And because you like the people, then it makes it a bit more fun and it also can help you prep for your own nerves in those interviews.\n\nLenny (00:19:48):\nWhat I'm hearing is, and I know we hear this all the time, if you're, say, a Black product manager, it's so much harder to not just get in because there's potentially bias at the company, but you're just psychologically not feeling as comfortable because nobody looks like you. You're worried that they're going to have bias against you. Is that what you find?\n\nJules Walter (00:20:07):\nYeah, that has been my experience and it's also what I hear from a lot of people I mentor.\n\nLenny (00:20:13):\nYour advice there, and this is helpful to anyone also, is just practice even more because that's probably the best way to get over that as much as you can.\n\nJules Walter (00:20:21):\nYeah. You want to basically practice so much that even at your worst, you're good enough. I've always felt like most interviews, I literally did my worst. It's just that it was good enough to pass. You're so stressed out, you don't relate to the person, et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:20:38):\nGot it. Okay. Let's go back to the question I asked that I pushed us away from. We were talking about what skills as a PM you want to be focusing on that mostly will help you in your career, and we started with IQ. I wrote a couple notes, so there's the concrete skills, execution, products and strategy, interviewing, and then there's a second bucket of EQ.\n\nJules Walter (00:20:57):\nSo, the IQ I already talked about. Those are the skills that help me at, especially in my first year at Slack, drive big good experiments, design good product experiences, and then drive results. But then what happened is as I get promoted, managed people and then start having larger scope, then there's a lot of ambiguity and stress that comes in with that increase in scope. And that's where the EQ stuff shows up a lot, specifically things like communications, because it's no longer my team. It's like cross-functional partners, other teams, executives, so you have to communicate all the time to different people. And then the other thing is things like leadership. Now, I'm driving initiatives that involve multiple teams, basic company level OKRs, and then the other thing too is beyond leadership, which is managing your team as well. How do you be a good manager? How do you deal with the ambiguity, stress? How do you influence various people? \n\n(00:21:58):\nThese are the EQ skills. What I've seen is, number one, it's much harder to learn these skills than the IQ stuff. The IQ is very intellectual. Sometimes, you just need a mental model, practice a bit. The EQ, I'm still learning these things. It's just like every... I'm trying to get better. Then the other thing beyond it being hard to learn is that the EQ stuff... What you need to focus on is specific to you, so you learn it. You probably work on something different than what I would work on versus if we're both trying to be better at strategy or execution, there's a lot more overlap. So, there's a lot of self-awareness that you need to have to know even what to work on and then you need to continuously practice it.\n\nLenny (00:22:44):\nWhat did you find was the most important EQ skill for your career that helped you in this journey?\n\nJules Walter (00:22:50):\nI don't know if there is one that single-handedly was the most important. I had to develop on many of these things. I can tell you, for example, communication is something that is helpful, especially as I become more senior. What happened for me is, early in my career, it was more about clarity and then conciseness. Then later it became more about how do you tell a story, and then also how do you communicate in an empathetic way. Specifically, you're telling the same story or presentation but to different audiences, and each time you have to adjust it because the CEO will care about this part, the CFO will care about this other part, and so on. I think that's one area where I spend a lot of time. And then the other thing also that has been helpful is the self-awareness part that I mentioned, where through mentorship, especially mentors who were very honest and help me see my blind spots, I was able to see my own patterns.\n\n(00:23:54):\nWhen I'm under stress, for example, I tend to withdraw and not see anything. So, then you might think I'm disengaged. By the way, in an interview context you might be like, \"Oh, does this person even want to work here?\" Then once you know these patterns you know, \"Okay, I'm stressed right now, but I need to say something so that people see that I'm actually interested in this problem; I'm just thinking through it. Well, let me verbalize my thought process.\" So, that's me as an example. For you, it might be the opposite. The self-awareness piece has been really helpful and it's something I continue to work on.\n\nLenny (00:24:26):\nThat's an interesting point that it's important to understand how you react and to figure out what's unique about you that you want to be working on, especially within EQ. For this example you gave about how stress impacts you, how did you actually discover that? Was that this mentor just pointing out, \"Hey, Jules, I've noticed this happens,\" or is there anything else there that maybe folks would find useful?\n\nJules Walter (00:24:47):\nGenerally, you need someone to put a mirror in front of you irritably. Sometimes, it's like you hire a coach, I talk to, and they see patterns. I've done group coaching too. In this case specifically, he was a mentor. His name is Lawrence Ripsher. He was head of product at Pinterest and became a mentor and now a close friend. One day I was preparing for... I think I need to do a representation and he was like, \"Hey, I've noticed that when you are thinking, you're just quiet. Let me tell you what's going on in my own head when I see that.\" And then he was like, \"Hey, I'm telling myself that he's not interested in what we're doing.\" And I'm like, \"Really? That's the least thing.\" And then I realized that's a pattern I have. Over time, through him and others, I've also observed other patterns.\n\nLenny (00:25:38):\nI missed this, but was he a manager or just a mentor you had within the company?\n\nJules Walter (00:25:42):\nWe didn't work at the same company. When I was at Slack, he was head of product at Pinterest. We met at a dinner and then from there, over time, he became a mentor and then we started meeting. When I would hit difficult situations, sometimes I would call him and ask for advice, and then through those interactions he's helped me identify some of my blind spots.\n\nLenny (00:26:08):\nOkay, awesome. We're definitely going to talk about mentorship and how to work with a mentor, but let's kind of wrap up this EQ piece. You mentioned within EQ, skills to think about working on communication, leadership, and management. Is there anything else and then is there an example of one of these skills and how, I don't know, it helped you in your career or held you back until you figure out how to work on this?\n\nJules Walter (00:26:30):\nHigh level, I think those buckets are pretty broad: comms, leadership, management. Within each of them, there are various skills like setting vision, strategy, listening to learn, those sort of things. It's actually the type of things that Matt Mochary talked about when he came to speak at your podcast. I mentioned communications was one thing, right? What happened was, when I was at Slack, I was pretty good at writing, which by the way I was terrible at long time ago. It took me years, maybe decade, to get better at. But then when it was time to present... I was fine at presenting, but then if you ask me questions, things would crumble. That even happened to me once at an interview, where I did well presenting and then they asked me a question and then I just gave an answer that wasn't good. \n\n(00:27:22):\nThen the self-awareness part helped me figure out what was going on. For me specifically, I realized whenever people ask me questions, if I didn't know the answer, I would have all this negative self-talk and I basically... You'd ask me a question and of course it could be something like, \"Why are we doing it this way?\" And it might come from a place of curiosity, you're just like, \"Hey, I don't know. Can you tell me why you have more context,\" right? But in my head I would hear, \"I don't agree with this.\" And that would be my self-talk. \"Oh, this person doesn't agree with this,\" instead of being present and trying to understand where are they coming from and maybe asking follow-ups like, \"Hey, thanks for asking the question. Is your concern more about, I don't know, scalability of this approach or is it more that you don't think it's effective even if it's not scalable?\" \n\n(00:28:10):\nYou know what I mean? For someone else, it might be the easiest thing, but for me it took me months and months to, first of all, figure out that I had this pattern. And then once I figured out the pattern, it took also a while to now actually act on it so that now I'm comfortable. If you ask me a question, sometimes I don't know and I'll say, \"Hey, let me get back to you.\" Sometimes I don't know and I'll say, \"Hey, I don't know, but here's what I'm thinking.\" This little thing that may seem so obvious to you took me a while and different people have different versions of these blockers.\n\nLenny (00:28:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Linear. Let's be honest, the issue tracker that you're using today isn't very helpful. Why is it that always seems to be working against you instead of working for you?

There's like a bunch of skills we just named, so let's also talk about where you think you start as you're starting off as a PM, which skills to focus on first, second, third. Let me just ask this broad question. We've talked about all these different skills PM should have. What have you found to be most effective broadly at building these skills in your career?\n\nJules Walter (00:30:24):\nI will share my approach. It might not work for everyone and later when we talk about strengths and weaknesses. You might see why that works for me. What I do specifically is when I'm trying to learn something new, I try to think about what is an outcome that I could drive. And if I drive this outcome, it will be proof that I'm better at this thing. If we go back to this story of when I joined Slack, I didn't know anything, literally anything about growth. And I was telling myself, \"I hope they don't fire me.\" But then the outcome I wanted is, within six months, I wanted to ship enough experiments that were successful, that drove activation by, let's say, X percent. So, that's very concrete. \n\n(00:31:06):\nThen once I have this outcome, I work backwards to figure out how am I going to do that. One of the things we can talk about later when we talk about strength is that, for me, I'm really good at asking questions. What I do then is I start asking questions like, \"Okay, I'm trying to drive activation for Slack. What are some frameworks that I should use to drive activation? What are best practices? What are examples?\" I have a sense of the kind of question that, if I were to answer them, I'd be able to drive the outcome. And then what I do is I read a little bit, not a lot about the topic, just to make sure I'm asking the right question. Then I refine my questions and then I find the best people in the field and I just go talk to them. That's where we'll talk later about the mentorship part. \n\n(00:31:54):\nIn the case of activation, I was like, \"Okay, what's the company that defined growth?\" At the time, Facebook. \"Who are the people that I can reach out to that do growth at Facebook?\" And one of them was Bangaly Kaba and also Adriel Frederick who spoke at your podcast. I had met both of them at a random event. Then I'm like, \"I need to find a way to have a chat with these folks and to help answer those questions with them.\" So, that's what I did with Bangaly in particular and also Adriel to a certain extent. I then learned, \"Okay, here are frameworks to use for growth.\" For example, understand, identify, execute. Spend a lot more of your time understanding why people aren't staying on Slack versus anything else, so then I had pointers. \n\n(00:32:40):\nOnce I have the pointers, then I try to go through the thing. I'm like, \"Okay, now let me...\" I call the user researcher, \"Hey, can we do a research on people who are signing up on Slack?\" Data analysts, let's look at the data. What correlates with activation?\" Those sort of things. Then after I go through a look, where I actually see results, whether they're good or bad, I go back to the mentor and I'm like, \"Hey, I did this. It was actually successful. Thanks a lot.\" Now, I'm thinking about this other problem.\" I keep going and that's how I rinse and repeat, and over time I drive the outcome and I also know I'm getting better at this thing by working with the experts.\n\nLenny (00:33:18):\nThere's a few interesting takeaways there. One, is that you kind of create a forcing function for yourself to learn a thing. It's like, \"Hey, I'm going to learn this thing. Let's create a goal that my ass is on the line to hit and then that's going to force me to go figure this out.\" And then two, it's interesting how often you come back to mentors and other people around you helping you out, which is a really good reminder. You don't have to figure things out for yourself; there's people out there that know these things and they're happy to help. A question I want to ask and I'll save this, because I we're going to talk about mentorship specifically a little bit later, just like how to find these people. Not everyone has access to Bangaly and Adriel, and I'm curious just how you found these folks, how you recommend other people find folks like that. But that's an awesome example. One tactic you're talking about here is just work backwards from a forcing function you've created for yourself to learn a thing. And in this case, what was it you were trying to learn? You were trying to learn growth, is that right?\n\nJules Walter (00:34:11):\nYeah, I was trying to learn growth and I wanted to do it in a context of activation, like new onboarding. And then later I also wanted to learn growth but in a different context, which was monetization. How do you drive revenue growth, not just get more users? And then later it was things like, \"How do I learn how to create a growth org? How do I structure my team? How do I set work streams that add up to a coherent strategy?\" And you just keep going\n\nLenny (00:34:42):\nIn those examples, did you do the same thing, you found people to talk to? \n\nJules Walter (00:34:46):\nYeah. Yeah. It's the same approach. Sometimes what happens is I have a few mentors that I just keep going to over the years and it's just a top exchange and sometimes I sort of get new mentors who are experts at these new topics. It's a combination of those two things for me. And the thing is you obviously can learn without this approach, but this approach makes you, at least for me, makes me learn so much faster.\n\nLenny (00:35:14):\nThat's probably one of the most interesting things I've learned about mentors, and you're touching on this, that people want to help. They're happy to help if people come ask, unless they're just dumb questions or they're just overwhelmed. People are generally very happy to help. People are always worried like, \"Why would they spend any time trying to help me with this random thing?\" It's really the opposite; they're happy to help.\n\nJules Walter (00:35:34):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:35:35):\nComing back to the EQ and IQ buckets, are there other examples of ways you've learned to improve, say, strategy, execution, product sense, things like that?\n\nJules Walter (00:35:46):\nWhether you have a mentor or not, there's other things you kind of have to do. For me, for example, one thing I do is I try to identify what's the best practice for something. For example, let's say strategy. There was a phase where I got feedback, \"Hey you need to be better at strategy.\" Then I'm like, \"Okay. Well, can you help me understand what are people at this company that was awhile back, where you think have done a great job at strategy or what are examples of artifacts?\" Then I get these artifacts and I reverse engineering them. I try to think, \"Okay, what are the top questions, the answer? Maybe I'm not answering all these questions. How do they do it?\" And you start seeing the patterns like, \"This person did it in a memo, this person did it in a deck.\" So, it's not about the format, but what is it about? Then this person had a lot of data, this person is quantitative, qualitative. So, that's a big part of what I do as well. It's true for all these things. \n\n(00:36:47):\nFor execution, it would be things like me attending another PMs meeting. \"Oh, I heard this person is amazing at executing. Let me just see how they're on a meeting.\" And then you're like, \"Whoa, things we didn't notice.\" Or somebody is great at communicating and I'm like, \"Okay. Well, did you send this email? It's great. Let me save it.\" I'd have docs where I saved templates of things, and a lot of the reason, I think, people don't learn through osmosis that way is because one is you're not at a company where you can see great artifacts sometimes. That's why I mentioned if you can get a better company, do that. The other thing, too, is even if you see the greatness around you, some people don't try to break it down, to understand: \"Why is this one great and not that one?\" So, I actually do spend a lot of time every week reflecting like, \"Oh, I saw these docs that were great or I saw this presentation this person gave.\" I sometimes crash presentation audits PMs give to executives, just to see how they handle questions or these sort of things. A lot of it is just spending time observing as well.\n\nLenny (00:37:54):\nI love this advice, it's so powerful. Just like, \"Who is amazing at this skill? And let me just go watch them and learn from them.\"\n\nJules Walter (00:38:01):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:38:02):\nSomething that you touched on here is, and I talk about this a bunch, that one of the benefits of working at a large company like Google, like Slack, is that you have access to a ton of real examples of strategy documents and vision documents and roadmaps and things like that, that once you're out of a company, like me, nobody shares these things publicly because they're sensitive. One of the best benefits of working at a large company is they have access to real life strategy documents, vision documents, things like that, so you should really savor that and collect them and, to your point, just study them. And I love your advice of just working backwards from like, \"Okay, here's a strategy that work. What is it about the strategy that I can use when I'm building my strategy? What questions are they answering? How are they structuring it?\" Things like that. That's awesome.\n\nJules Walter (00:38:48):\nSimilar to the mentor point, people are actually happy to talk to you. They're even flattered because no one else asked them. \"Well, hey, I read your doc. Can we talk about it?\"\n\nLenny (00:38:54):\nRight. Whoever gets the... What PM ever gets someone coming to them? \"I love your strategy doc. Tell me all about it. I'd love to talk about that.\"\n\nJules Walter (00:39:06):\nYeah. And then the other thing I'll say, too, is a lot of learning happens through the iterations and not by seeing the final product. We all see these products, like the iPhone and name your favorite product, but you don't know what versions they tried and sort of eliminated. And that's the benefit you also get at a company that has great product management. I actually sometimes tell the PM like, \"Hey, don't just show me the one you just did. When are you going to do your next strategy? Can I join you then? I just want to sit and watch you write down the outline and just understand your thought process,\" or \"I want to see when you're going to write your next exec update and understand how are you...\" And you see them go through these iteration and you see them do things like get feedback that you didn't know they were getting all this feedback from. So, seeing the backstage is also really helpful.\n\nLenny (00:39:58):\nIt's interesting. Just as you're talking, I'm reflecting on how many benefits there are to working at a world class company. You are surrounded by really smart people who you can talk to and ask for advice and watch how they operate. You have access to really incredible documents and artifacts that you can learn from. Also, just the logo on your resume is really powerful for future job opportunities, which then comes back to the interview skills that you talked about and how important it is to be good at that to get into a company like that.\n\nJules Walter (00:40:24):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\nInteresting. Okay. What about on EQ? Any examples of how you learned some of those skills that you talked about communication or leadership or management or anything along those lines?\n\nJules Walter (00:40:36):\nYeah. On the communications side, I read some stuff like Minto's Pyramid Principles. Extremely helpful and I know you had an article on that. \n\nLenny (00:40:44):\nMm-hmm.\n\nJules Walter (00:40:45):\nI mentioned also that whenever I see a great email exec update or whatever, I literally save it in a special folder.\n\nLenny (00:40:54):\nI love that.\n\nJules Walter (00:40:55):\nAlso, by the way, I always ask for feedback more than I think many people and I try to see patterns in feedback. For me, one thing I've observed is I tend to write long sentences, coming from a Haitian-French background, but then I see that because I've seen enough feedback that are about it so I see the patterns. Or as I mentioned earlier, I used to not be clear like, \"Are you saying this solution or that solution?\" It's better sometimes to be wrong but clear than the other way around. That's on the comms side. And then the other things, it's mostly, for me, through mentorship, people like Lawrence helping me be real with myself. I've had a coach for a while and I also do group coaching, which I really love. Right now I'm doing group coaching with a company called Pathways to Leadership.\n\n(00:41:48):\nThese sort of things have helped me infer what my strengths and weaknesses are and then work on them. And then one thing I'll say also about the EQ: it was the most frustrating learning for me. For the IQ stuff, within six months, sometimes three months, I can see clear progress when you see enough documents. You see five, six of them, you start seeing 80% of the patterns. But then with the EQ stuff, it's things I've been working on for years. I am better at them, but I still feel like I'm continuing to work on those things. And a lot of it is like lifting weights or building muscles; you have to do it every day or every week. And then if you stop doing it, over time you atrophy again. That's something that people need to acknowledge, too. Give yourself time and then also learn these skills one at a time ideally.\n\nLenny (00:42:45):\nOh, interesting. Can you talk a bit more about that learning skills one at a time? Is your approach just like, \"Here's the thing, I'm working on this the next six months. I'm going to focus on that.\"\n\nJules Walter (00:42:53):\nYeah. My approach is typically I'll say, \"I'm giving myself, I don't know, three months, six months.\" It depends on what [inaudible 00:43:00] I want to see in my behavior for these things and then I just go all in on that skill. Let's say I wanted to learn strategy, I'll be like, \"Okay, I'm giving myself, let's say, six months.\" Every week, I'm going to do something related to learning strategy. It's going to be maybe I read the strategy for another feature product at my company and you just divide, right? Let's just say there's 10 features or 20, it doesn't matter. You just do one a week, so 20 weeks. You see what I'm saying? And then the other thing is, every week I'm also going to practice it towards my outcome. I'm going to spend, I don't know, three hours a week, maybe one hour a day, just thinking through my own product strategy. And I do that for six months. You do it enough that you get over the hump and then actually develop the skill. Now, the other approach you could take is... What most people do is they read an article on your newsletter or some other place and then like, \"Oh, great. I learned an insight.\" And then you go back to usual.\n\nLenny (00:44:00):\nAnd it's not like at the end of these six months, you're done. I'm strategy expert, I am good on strategy. To your point, it's building this muscle that will never be fully built. It just will get stronger. And every time you invest time learning something, it gets stronger.\n\nJules Walter (00:44:15):\nYeah, exactly. It's not that within six months you are clearly better. Now, you can invest another six months to get to the next level. Or you could say, \"Now I'm going to switch focus to another skill and get that one to a similar level.\"\n\nLenny (00:44:28):\nIs there a skill you're working on right now?\n\nJules Walter (00:44:30):\nAlways working on something. One I can call out is listening. One thing about the EQ stuff, too, by the way is you hear these words, and depending on how familiar you are, you understand or don't understand what it actually means. When I say listening, I'm good at seeking information to solve a problem. If you come to me and you're like, \"Hey, Jules, I have this problem,\" I will know what to listen for and what to ask you. \"Hey, Lenny, can you tell me A, B?\" And then I'll help you solve the problem. However, there's also different listening patterns, one of which is you just create space for someone. It's not like you're seeking a particular information, just give them space to tell you what they want to tell you. And then the other side of it, too, is you help that person feel heard, \"Hey, I feel like you actually understand me and you've heard what I'm saying.\" So, that's the part I am working on.\n\nLenny (00:45:25):\nYou mentioned the Matt Mochary episode. I imagine you've been listening to that, because that has a lot of great advice.\n\nJules Walter (00:45:29):\nYeah. Yeah, exactly. It's those kinds of things, right? And then he talked about saying back to people what you heard, asking for more information, et cetera.\n\nLenny (00:45:38):\nAwesome. You mentioned that you asked for feedback from your peers, and I wrote that down. I wanted to double-click on that a little bit. How do you actually approach asking for feedback? Do you sound like a survey? Do you just ask people in meeting? How do you do that?\n\nJules Walter (00:45:51):\nThe feedback piece, it's something that I had to get better at. Over time, I'm asking for it, because what I realize is if people don't feel comfortable with you, they won't give you feedback. It's depending on the risk, right? Especially if it's constructive feedback. By the way, that's also something that's hard about being underrepresented. People sometimes don't have the same natural level of connection with you. I basically learned to go out of my way to make people comfortable giving me feedback. There's different techniques and Matt Mochary also talks about some of them. Sometime it's basically ask in a very specific way, \"Hey, I did this presentation. I'm working on, I don't know, having more executive presence. Did you feel that? To which extent did you feel that I showed executive presence?\" So, it's a very specific thing versus, \"Hey, how did it go?\" That's one thing you can do. \n\n(00:46:45):\nOther thing you can do sometimes is you give yourself critical feedback in front of them and then you give them a chance to agree or disagree. \"Hey, I feel like this presentation didn't go well for this reason. What do you think? But actually I thought it would've been fine; however, this other thing could have been better.\" And then the other thing I'll say that is very, very important if you're asking people for feedback is if you manage to get them to take the risk to give you the feedback, your answer has to be enthusiastically grateful. That's the key. What people knew at Slack, Google, et cetera, is if you give me feedback, I'll be like, \"Hey, thank you so much. This is super helpful,\" because people are like, \"Oh, he actually likes the feedback.\" Now, inside, my heart might be melting. I'm like, \"Oh, I thought I got better at this.\" You know what I mean?\n\nLenny (00:46:45):\nYeah. \n\nJules Walter (00:47:42):\nBut externally, I'm like, \"Hey, thank you,\" and I mean it. I think that's the key that most people don't sort of focus on. And if you get more feedback, then you'll just get better at the things.\n\nLenny (00:47:51):\nThat is such a good advice, all these very tactical ways of getting actual real feedback from people.\n\nJules Walter (00:47:55):\nYeah. And then one thing I'll say, too, by the way, it's harder to get feedback on the EQ stuff, and that's also why it's harder to develop and why a lot of people reach terminal levels in product, because people are like, \"Oh, they lack emotional intelligence.\" They say that in calibration rooms but not in your face, so that's also what you want when you hear feedback. You don't want just to like, \"Hey, here's my piece of feedback that I can prove.\" You also want the part that is like, \"Here's how you make me feel or how you come across that... If this is taken out of context, it won't be good for... I don't want this to be shared publicly or taken out of context, but I want you to know.\" And it could be things like, \"Hey, when I talk to you, sometimes I feel like, I don't know, you're angry.\" And then I'm like, \"Oh, really? In what scenario?\" And then it's like, \"Oh, I was so focused and listening to you intently that I could see now why I come across that way.\" \n\n(00:48:55):\nBut you could literally go your whole career and then nobody ever says these things, right? And that's the kind of feedback that I personally find most helpful is the subjective feedback, because nobody will tell me those things. Once somebody I trust tell me and I'm like... Oh, here's an example. I mentioned earlier I'm good at asking questions. I had somebody ask like, \"Tell me. Hey, sometimes when you ask questions, you sound more junior.\" And I was like, \"Huh.\" And then I can see that because I asked the question plainly like, \"Hey, why did you do this or how did you that,\" instead of also saying where I'm coming from, \"Hey, I noticed this blah, blah, why, blah?\" You know what I'm saying? Instead of showing I have an understanding of the thing and then asking a follow-up question, I just ask the question bluntly without context and people feel like, \"Hey, I'm asking a very basic question.\" So, that's the kind of feedback that I particularly value.\n\nLenny (00:49:48):\nThe feedback you're getting is pretty incredible, like the stuff you shared about someone saying you come across as angry in a meeting if you ask questions or you sound a junior. I don't know if I've ever gotten anyone to give me that brutally honest feedback. When those specific cases, what was it about these people that helped them give you this feedback? Is that what you talked about, you built trust with them over the years or is there something you did to get that kind of feedback?\n\nJules Walter (00:50:10):\nI mean, it's definitely they trusted me and they cared about me. They trust that if they tell me the feedback without translating, that I would see the intent behind it. And they were able to do that, because after months and years of working together, they know how to respond to feedback. Because what happens is most people, when you have to get feedback, you kind of have to really do a lot of translation work so that it lands, \"I don't want to hurt your feeling. I don't want you to take this.\" I just told people, \"You don't have to that with me.\" That's one. And then the other thing, too, is people reciprocate also how you talk. I'm not saying I talk to people like this, but I try to be vulnerable with people so they know we can be vulnerable and things are safe like, \"I really want to hear things the way you experience it.\"\n\nLenny (00:50:59):\nGot it. So, there's a lot of foundation setting that you do to create this environment where people are like, \"Jules, here's something that's going wrong. You can work on this.\" \n\nJules Walter (00:51:05):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (00:51:06):\nThat's an awesome takeaway. One other thread I wanted to pull on is you mentioned focusing on strengths and how that ends up being really important. Something I'm a big believer in is focusing on strengths versus trying to make your weaknesses much, much stronger. Is there any advice you can share to better understand what your strengths are, why that's an approach to take in developing your skills?\n\nJules Walter (00:51:28):\nFor the strengths, breakthroughs. For me, a lot of it was talking to my mentor, Lawrence Ripsher. And I organized this event for Black PMs at Pinterest, where Lawrence was speaking, and then we were talking about, \"Hey, watch should we talk about, et cetera.\" I don't know how, but in the conversation he talked about doubling down your strengths more than on fixing your weaknesses, and then he used me as an example. Then the fun part is he had this approach of how you actually find your strength. It's a very simple question, where basically he's like, \"Hey, what is something that a lot of people say you're good at, but you think it's not a big deal or it's not that important?\" And that's the key. I always that's what resonated with me. I was like, \"Oh, a lot of people keep saying I'm really good at networking.\"\n\n(00:52:26):\nI'm like semi-introvert, so I'm like, \"Hold on, I don't know.\" [inaudible 00:52:32] not everyone or people will tell me, \"Hey, you have asked great questions.\" And I'm like, \"I asked basic questions.\" And then he helped me understand, \"Actually, that's how you know it's a strength.\" Now, what you need to figure out is how do you get more out of that strength. An analogy, by the way, is imagine that you saw a fish and you were like, \"Hey, you're really good at swimming.\" And then the fish would be like, \"Oh. Duh, doesn't everybody swim?\" And so, that's the key and I invite people to think about that question like, \"What's something people keep telling you you're good at, but you yourself don't think is a big deal?\" And that's how I was able to find a bunch of my strengths. ]\n\n(00:53:09):\nFor me, generally I'm thoughtful, ask great questions. I also simplify problems a lot. I mean, we work together on a product sense article, which is a very complex thing, made it more simple. And then once you identify the strength, then it helps to also think about why are you good at this thing? Because that's the underlying resource that you have. A big part for me is I'm actually quite curious. And fun fact, I don't think of myself as curious, but people keep telling me I am. And even my mom was telling me when I was a kid, I used to always try to unscrew toys to see how they work in the inside. That's one thing: being curious help me ask the questions and so on. And then the other thing, too, is once you have the strength, you want to understand the shadow side of it, and that's the connection between your strength and weaknesses.\n\n(00:54:02):\nThat was a key breakthrough for me, especially Lawrence helped me understand that. Strengthen and weakness, it's not a binary thing. It's like the same thing, but it's a dial. In some context it's good, in other contexts it's serving you. An example in my cases is... I talked about I ask great questions, but sometimes I ask a question without context, I might come across as less knowledgeable. Or another thing for me is I'm able to take very complex problems and then create a mental model that's much simpler, whether it's growth or other things. But until I come up with that mental model, if I'm in a meeting with you, I won't talk much about that topic. Basically, I'm more quiet than other people when people want to hear my point of view because I'm just listening and trying to create a mental model of the situation. You're seeing how the same strength is perceived as a weakness depending on context. And once you have that... For me, I feel more empowered. I'm like, \"Oh, I just have to dial down a little bit here or dial a little bit here,\" and I also know this thing is serving me, which is why I keep doing the bad side of it.\n\nLenny (00:55:10):\nAwesome. This all often comes back to mentors in your life. I want to get to talking about mentorship and how you find your mentors, how you work with them, all that kind of stuff; something we've been touching on a bunch and I'm excited to begin to. Maybe to start, can you just talk about some of the mentors you've had in your life, some of the most impactful mentors that you've had?\n\nJules Walter (00:55:35):\nI've definitely had a large number of mentors over the years. Fun fact, when I came to the area eight years ago, I didn't know anyone.\n\nLenny (00:55:42):\nWow.\n\nJules Walter (00:55:43):\nIt took a while to build those relationships. I talked earlier about Bangaly Kaba who sort of helped me figure out how to grow Slack even though he wasn't working outside, but helped me have the frameworks. I talked about Lawrence Ripsher. He helped me discover my strengths and also how to lean into them. Aaron Teague is another friend and mentor who brought me to Google, actually. And there's also Bradley Horowitz, former VP of Google Photos, also helped me in terms of how do you think about leadership and so on. Many other folks, Nikhyl Singhal, VP at Meta helped me with PM career. So, lots of mentors for sure.\n\nLenny (00:56:23):\nOkay, that's the killer list. Two questions. One, what do you look for in a mentor when you're trying to find someone to work with? And then two, how do you actually find these people? Most people listening are like, \"Wow, I would love an amazing mentor to help me in my career. I don't know how to find one.\" What advice do you have for folks to finding a mentor?\n\nJules Walter (00:56:41):\nI look for two things. One is, are you good at one specific thing I'm trying to get better at? And then two is, are you good at explaining it? Those two, at least for me, they're important. I know people are really good at their roles, at their job and at the subject, but they don't actually know how they do it or they don't really want to explain or cannot explain easily. So, that's what I look for. And then in terms of where I find these people, it's really everywhere. If you look at the list I mentioned earlier, Bangaly I met at an event. Facebook had a recruiting event, I showed up, I see this guy, I'm like, \"Oh. Hi.\" Chat a little bit. I talked about Lawrence, who's now a close friend. I met Lawrence at a dinner. He organized a dinner for underrepresented PMs, we chatted, one thing led to the other, and then he became a mentor and friend. Bradley was at a fundraiser. And Nikhyl was an intro via email. Somebody was like, \"Oh, you should meet Nikhyl.\" \n\n(00:57:41):\nI know this sounds counterintuitive. I don't think the hard part is where to find them; it's more about finding the right person and then how do you get a foot in? Now, what I've seen... A lot of people, sometimes they get mentors who are too senior or who don't actually think about the topic they're interested in. Maybe they did five years ago, but once you find the right person, the key is like, \"How do you have that initial conversation? How do you get the foot in the door?\" And what I've found is you should make the smallest ask possible, which is the opposite of what 95% of people do. 95% of people is like, \"Hey, I've never met you, but I heard your talk or I saw you on LinkedIn or whatever. Can we set up a call?\"\n\n(00:58:29):\nThat's like a big ask. What I do... For example, there's this person who came to Slack, he was head of product of a major company and then he gave a talk about different methods to improve products. He had this concept of finding the heat for products. He spoke at the company, I got his email, and I reached out in the evening and I was like, \"Hey, thanks so much for speaking today. We talked about finding the heat for products. Is there an example of product that you think was created with this approach?\" Something he could answer in literally two minutes via email? That was my question. It wasn't like, \"Hey, you talked. Now, I feel entitled to meet with you.\" But then the key is once you get that foot in the door, it could be a quick email, a tweet, a quick chat at an event, that sort of thing, and you get some advice that's useful, the key is to circle back with them at a later point and show that you've actually made good use of the advice. \n\n(00:59:30):\nI think that's the thing nobody does. What I would do... For example, there's currently the CEO of a top tech company I met an event. She spoke there and then she gave some advice that was useful. I emailed her a follow-up type thing and then she gave me advice about how to rethink the mission statement for my nonprofit, all via email. Then at some point I was like, \"Hey, I've applied your problem trend competency framework to crafting the mission for my nonprofit. Here's where we landed. That was super helpful. Thank you so much.\" Replies back. And then what I would do then later is maybe a month later or two months, X months later, I can reach out again for another problem and maybe I could say, \"Hey, this time it's a little bit more nuanced. Can we grab 15 minutes?\" And the person was like, \"Yeah, sure.\" That person was very, very busy. I was like, \"Hey, let's do it.\" And then over time we become Facebook friends, that sort of thing, but that's the approach I take.\n\nLenny (01:00:29):\nThat's such a good advice. It reminds me of Tim Ferris's advice also, which is just like, \"Don't go up to someone and be like, 'Will you be my mentor?'\" Everyone's going to be like, \"I don't have time for that.\" Instead, to your point, it's the exact opposite. Just start asking simple questions and then over time build up relationship, and then over time, maybe you start meeting regularly. But don't start big; start small.\n\nJules Walter (01:00:50):\nYou. As small as possible.\n\nLenny (01:00:53):\nIt's not like you just have one mentor. You've listed a whole bunch of people that have helped you over your career. It's not like, \"Here's the person, they have to be perfect.\" It sounds like you kind of identify, \"Here's a skill or an area I want to focus and this person is going to be really good at that.\" \n\nJules Walter (01:01:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:07):\nThen I also just love the point about it feels really hard to find an amazing mentor. From what I'm hearing, the main thing you do is just go to things, attend events, basically go events, meet people, right? That's kind of the foundation in which you're sharing is just meet as many people as you can, and amongst that group, you'll find people that are probably going to be helpful.\n\nJules Walter (01:01:26):\nYeah. And I understand it can be harder for some folks. I mean, now I have two young kids, so I don't do as many events. I've also met quite a few people through introductions, sometimes being cold outreach. I had a chat with Shishir through cold outreach [inaudible 01:01:44] a very clear question, and then he offered to come to Black PMs and share some insights. Those kinds of things happen, too, but you have to show the person that you're going to make really good use of their time. You have to give really specific contexts like, \"Hey, let's grab coffee.\" It's like, \"Hey, here's a very specific question. Can you share some thoughts or point via email?\" And then they might offer, \"Hey, why don't we just talk?\" That sort of thing, too. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:09):\nThat works really well. Anytime I get an email request of, \"Hey, could we do a 15-minute Zoom or a copy chat,\" I quickly do not have time for that. But an actual question that I can be really helpful with really quickly, that's so much easier, so that makes a lot of sense. The next thing I wanted to ask you is: how do you build and continue this relationship? And then once you actually start engaging regularly, what do you suggest folks talk about in these meetings if they're ongoing.\n\nJules Walter (01:02:37):\nI make sure to bring something very specific that I'm dealing with where they can provide input. And this is the opposite of what many people do where they're like, \"Hey, can you tell me about how you... Whatever, your path to PM,\" which may or may not be relevant to them, versus, \"Hey, I've interviewed for three companies. I'm trying to decide among those three. Can I walk you through my thought process and get your feedback?\" So, it's very different. I definitely make sure I bring a very specific context, and sometime it could be... I mentioned the example of Bangali like, \"Hey, I'm now a growth PM at Slack. I'm trying to improve activation. Can I talk to you about how you approach growth in general?\" Or it could be, \"Hey, I'm having internal...\" Let's say I have internal mentors at Google and I have a few, then it's like, \"Hey, I'm about to have this negotiation with this team. Can I walk you through my thought process and hear your advice?\" So, it's very specific things. \n\n(01:03:37):\nAnd then the other thing I'll say, too, is when I talk to mentors, I always take notes. I mean, I'm seeing you even here in this interview. You're taking notes. These are basic things people don't actually think about it sometimes. And then when I follow up, whether it's via email or in person, I bring up older conversations. It's like, \"Hey, remember last time we told about X? I did it,\" or \"Hey, how's your daughter? I know she was going to college this semester. How did that go?\" So, it always feels like a continuation of a conversation and it feels like an actual relationship instead of transactional interactions. And then the other thing, too, is I try really hard to identify ways that I can be helpful. Sometimes, at the end of chat I'll be like, \"Hey, is there anything I can help you with? Anything top of mind for you?\" And sometimes the person could be senior or wealthy, doesn't matter, and they're like, \"Actually, yes. I'd love to better understand how the team is really doing. Nobody will tell me the truth,\" or \"Hey, I am trying to hire for this role. You have [inaudible 01:04:43] Black PMs. Do you mind sharing?\" There's always ways you can help, but most people are so focused on themselves that they miss out on these opportunities.\n\nLenny (01:04:52):\nThe point about coming back to the person and sharing what impact their advice had and how it went is so good, because to your point, it just feels like you're sharing all this advice and just isn't going anywhere. And then note-taking, such great stuff. This is really good advice. I could see how it would work on me if someone's asking me for advice.\n\nJules Walter (01:05:10):\nBy the way, I mean we didn't know each other two years ago, right?\n\nLenny (01:05:10):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nJules Walter (01:05:14):\nYeah. It's like a similar process, where we got to know each other mostly via email and led to the other, and we try to help each other.\n\nLenny (01:05:22):\nAnd look at us now. Any final thoughts before we wrap up and head to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJules Walter (01:05:31):\nI have found the process of learning how to be a PM very difficult and I also find it quite rewarding. And I want to set expectation, especially for people who are early in their career, people may be frustrated by the process, because you have all these skills. We listed, I don't know, half a dozen, a dozen that you want to get better at. So, be patient. Then also it takes a while to see massive differences, but once you see those differences, you set yourself apart from your peers. That's one thing. And then the other thing, too, is it's really building muscles more so for the EQ stuff, but even for the IQ stuff. You have to practice. It's not just read Lenny's top 10 articles for two hours and then you're good. Read them, do what they say, get feedback after you do what they say and say like, \"Huh, it worked for me. It didn't work for me.\" Reread them again, find mentors, et cetera. It's a long process and I don't think people have that mental model around how to learn in general, but also specifically how to learn the PM skills.\n\nLenny (01:06:41):\nAnd I imagine there's also this one step forward, two step back experience that often happens, too, where you're just like, \"Oh, I thought I figured out how to think about strategy, and this one failed.\" And you're like, \"Oh, that was useless.\" No, this is how you learn. You fail sometimes. Oftentimes, it works out slowly but surely you move forward.\n\nJules Walter (01:06:57):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (01:06:58):\nAmazing. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. Since we've gone a little long, I'm going to keep it just four questions. I'm just going to go through them pretty fast, whatever comes to mind. Fire off. You ready? \n\nJules Walter (01:07:10):\nYeah. \n\nLenny (01:07:10):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJules Walter (01:07:15):\nOne of them is Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss. It's about negotiations. There's actually also a masterclass on it.\n\nLenny (01:07:21):\nI was just going to say that. I watched that. That was really good. \n\nJules Walter (01:07:24):\nYeah. Yeah. And then another one is Connect by Carole Robin. It's inspired by Stanford's Touchy-Feely class, if you've ever heard of it.\n\nLenny (01:07:33):\nYeah. She did a guest post for the newsletter, actually.\n\nJules Walter (01:07:35):\nOh, really? Awesome. Yeah. It's really a helpful especially as you are thinking about the EQ skills and how to improve your relationships with people.\n\nLenny (01:07:44):\nAwesome. I highly recommend that book. I haven't read it, but I read a lot of things about the class and my friends have been in that class and she wrote this guest post. That sounds like a really good pick for EQ, so I'm actually going to re-pick it up. Next question: favorite other podcast that isn't this podcast.\n\nJules Walter (01:08:02):\nLex Fridman is one I'll call out. Brings really interesting speakers and also on diverse topics, so I find it really helpful.\n\nLenny (01:08:11):\nAwesome. I also love that podcast. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJules Walter (01:08:15):\nI watch fewer now. Top Gun: Maverick is a movie I really like. I'm sure many people have seen it. For me, it's like just going back in the 80s. And then TV show is Never Have I Ever. It's coming of age in America, Indian teenager. Pretty funny and also deep.\n\nLenny (01:08:34):\nAwesome. I haven't heard of that one. We'll check it out. Final question: favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you're interviewing them?\n\nJules Walter (01:08:41):\nOne I used to ask a lot is: what's something work related that you're trying to get better at? Sometimes I change the wording of it, but a big part of it is trying to understand how self-aware people are, to which extent they have a growth mindset, and then also how honest and vulnerable they can be. What I will say, though, about interview question, by the way, is I don't anchor a lot on the first question. What I find the most value from are the follow-ups. Once you ask that question, you can take in various directions like, \"Why did you focus on this versus other things? How did this come to your attention? Was it feedback you sought or feedback people gave you, et cetera?\" Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:09:24):\nAwesome advice. Jules, this interview was a longtime coming. It was everything I hoped it would be and more. Thank you again so much for being here. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you? \n\nJules Walter (01:09:39):\nIn terms of finding me, Twitter is one place to start. My handle is @julesdwalt. And then in terms of how people can be useful, it's really about paying it forward and then sharing this with others, especially parts that people find useful.\n\nLenny (01:09:55):\nAmazing. Jules, thank you so much. We'll chat again soon.\n\nJules Walter (01:10:00):\nYeah, thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:10:03):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# M&A, competition, pricing, and investing | Julia Schottenstein (dbt Labs)\n\n## Transcript\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:00:00):\nM&A is always about creating plan Bs. And the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do in how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage. And I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, \"Well, what's going on with this company?\"\n\n(00:00:33):\nThe really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.\n\nLenny (00:01:04):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Julia Schottenstein. Julia is a product leader at dbt Labs where she leads the dbt Cloud product. She's also the co-host of the dbt Labs podcast called Analytics Engineering Podcast, a show about data trends that impact analytics engineers work. As you'll hear in this episode, Julia actually led the acquisition of a startup that I'm an investor in called Transform from the side of dbt Labs.\n\n(00:01:37):\nAnd in our conversation, we dig into the M&A process and get into a bunch of advice for how to improve your odds of having a good outcome and just approaching M&A broadly. We also dig into the story of dbt, which is one of the most successful startups out there that you probably don't know about. And we talked about what they did right to get to where they are now. We also cover how to best think about competition, a bunch of frameworks for thinking about product and advice on how to approach pricing and also open source.

Usually it's the other way around. Usually PMs become VCs and it's right to see this version of it. So I wanted to start with just a question of just how did that come to be?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:04:34):\nI do have an unusual background, but it doesn't surprise me that people who are interested in product are also interested in investing and vice versa. For me, I've always had three interests broadly and that's an interest in business, an interest in technology and an interest in markets. And I get to express those interests both in investing and in product, but just with different weights. So in product you go a lot deeper on the tech and markets is less of a focus, but you still get to do all three. So I have a unusual background and I used to be a professional investor at NEA. Spent all my time investing in early stage startups that built for technical audiences. So think dev tools, infra data companies.\n\n(00:05:22):\nAnd in 2019 I first discovered dbt, which was an open source data transformation framework. And I got really very, very excited about dbt because when I talked to people that were using it, the way that they described their experience on dbt was like unlike anything I had heard before. It was much more of an identity for them than just a tool that they were using to get their job done. And that really struck me. And as I thought about what was happening in the market, there was a lot going on in 2019. The markets were changing quite a bit. Cloud data warehouses were starting to explode. This was the year where Snowflake went from a 4 billion company to a 12 billion company. And I thought to myself, if dbt worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way. And I naturally tried to spend all my time getting close to Tristan, who's the CEO and founder and I wanted to invest.\n\nLenny (00:06:24):\nOkay. So at this point you're a spec at NEA, you're trying to invest in dbt and okay, keep going.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:06:29):\nYeah. So I was very, very excited. I thought if this worked, it could work in a really extraordinary way and I spent all my time trying to get Tristan to like me so that I could invest in the company. And then in 2020, I finally got the call that I was waiting for. Tristan said, \"We're going to raise some money.\" He had a term sheet from a firm that he liked. It was a good venture fund, but he also liked me and he wanted to give me a shot and I was super excited to get that message because this is my chance. And unfortunately I ended up losing that deal to Sequoia. It's a formidable partner.\n\nLenny (00:07:04):\nReasonable loss.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:07:05):\nI was just so convicted that if was going to be a special company that I asked to even put my personal money in and I asked to put a very irresponsible, irrational amount, nearly like 20% of my liquid net worth into dbt because I was so convinced that this was special. And sometimes when deals don't work out as an investor, you can create this narrative in your head like, \"Good, I dodged a bullet or better off without them or screw them.\" But for me that was quite the opposite with dbt. I really felt like dbt was this runaway train and it was special and I wanted to jump on board. So a few months later I ended up calling Tristan and asked him if I could be a part of the company that built the product that I thought was so special. So that was my unique path into product and to dbt.\n\nLenny (00:08:02):\nSo you invested in dbt and then an opportunity opened up where you ended up working there?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:08:08):\nNo, I think if I was able to invest I wouldn't be here. So I got no, the board ended up vetoing my personal investment, but it's okay because I ended up dedicating all of my personal time to building the company.\n\nLenny (00:08:23):\nAwesome. Okay. So something you touched on there that was really interesting of what you saw about dbt that was so interesting and I think this is maybe a broader question of just in your time investing and finding a company like dbt early, what have you learned about just picking well, finding companies early especially? What are signs in your experience of just that this is going to be something really interesting that you might want to join? And this is more for people listening that are thinking about joining a company early on. What do you think they should look for?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:08:52):\nSo the way I would look at joining an early stage company would be the same way I would evaluate investing in one. So there are four things that I care about when I'm looking at really early stage companies and it's people, market, product and distribution. And I'll touch on each of those four to say a little bit more about what specifically I'm looking at. So people, this is really the CEO, the founder of the company put simply do you trust this person to lead. And for me, Tristan had this really rare ability to paint a very compelling future of the industry and how dbt was going to be a part of making that vision a reality. But he also was really, really detailed in the day-to-day work of the analytics engineering work. And it was that range in scale that made me feel like this is a founder that's very rare and compelling.\n\n(00:09:42):\nThe next is markets. We touched on it a little bit, but what I'm looking for in markets it's like is it growing? Is there space for new entrant to make its mark? And when it came to dbt, it was an explosive time in cloud data warehouses and it was that chaos that was really the opportunity for dbt because they created some orderliness and structure to the way that people worked with their data in the cloud data warehouse. So that was very compelling. The next is product. Everyone who's listening hopefully either is interested in products or has a product background. So I won't say too much there, but can you talk to users or potential customers, are they building something that's really special, unique? Can you hear that, spark that enthusiasm and figure out if this is going to be special.\n\n(00:10:31):\nAnd then the last, I think this is more important arguably than if they have a good product but is distribution, do they have an advantage on how are they going to get to market because that's really, really hard? And think about how they think about their competitive advantage on either the ecosystem or distribution and how they're going to ultimately sell the product. You're not going to get a 10 out of 10 on all four dimensions. So when you're joining a company, you also have the benefit of dedicating your time. So try to think if they're weaker on one dimension, what is it that you bring to the table or what are you special at that could potentially de-risk the success of the company\n\nLenny (00:11:11):\nIn terms of spark with a product. Right now on product market fit, now how do you know if you have product market fit? And a lot of it often comes down to there's a emotional reaction from someone you're talking to about the product you're building. There's like, \"Holy shit, I want this now.\" Is there anything even more specific you've seen of just what is a sign that this, there's a spark that people are just really enthused? You talked about people made dbt part of their identity. Is there anything else there?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:11:36):\nYeah. It's can they not stop talking about it and that's the chatter about a product, they want to share it with their teammates or to other people at different companies. That just top of mind love and wanting to share what they've found with others is really a great sign that you're onto something. And then that spark will help do a lot of the work on how do you get to market because your evangelists are really your users of people that love what you're building.\n\nLenny (00:12:06):\nWhat about in terms of the distribution bucket? What are some examples of just really important, I don't know, unique or effective distribution strategies or I don't know, unfair advantages you've seen maybe with dbt, maybe other companies? What are some examples of that?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:12:20):\nSo dbt had an ecosystem advantage and they were open source and this helped really dramatically for lots of people to have low barrier friction to just try it out and spread organically. They first got started with very horizontal. People could just get started without ever even talking to sales and think that was a competitive advantage. But not all companies need to be product led. Some companies are enterprise top-down sales. So in those situations think about does the team really know how to land a complex enterprise sale? Do they have a background in that particular space? Do they have a network of connections? Can be different depending on what the company is selling, but you either want to see a company that's really strong at enterprise or really strong at the bottoms up.\n\nLenny (00:13:11):\nOkay, cool. So I want to shift a bit to talking about an area that you have a lot of experience in which a lot of people are also really interested in right now, which is M&A. I've invested in a lot of companies and maybe, I don't know, once a month I'm getting an email from a startup I've been investor in. There's just like, we're looking at maybe selling the company, things aren't working out the way we were hoping. And you've been on I think maybe all sides of the table of M&A transactions, including I think you led the acquisition of a company... I was an investor in the dbt acquired that I think is public company called Transform. So my question is just for founders who are currently thinking about M&A meaning acquisition essentially. What's your best advice for them for how to be most successful in M&A outcome for themselves?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:13:57):\nWhen it comes to acquisitions, the time to start thinking about an M&A strategy is hopefully when you don't need one. And the best strategy that I could give a founder is to have a really strong offense in building their company. And when founders start their businesses, they don't usually set out to start a company to sell it to another business. They start it to be an enduring independent standalone company. And if you have that path, then you'll have the upper hand in absolutely every single M&A conversation because you have a viable alternative, which is do nothing, stay the course, you don't have to sell. But of course that's not the case for most companies. Most companies don't have a viable path to being an independent company forever. So they have to think about M&A. So M&A is always about creating plan Bs.\n\n(00:14:49):\nAnd the way I would think about it is for any one company, there's only ever two to three buyers that find what you're building to be extremely strategic. And the strategy that I would do and how do you get noticed is I would figure out the area that you bring a competitive advantage and I would inflict pain on that potential buyer. Make it impossible for them to not notice you because that's when they're going to have their ears perk up and say, \"Well, what's going on with this company?\" We just bought this company Transform. They are playing a really good playbook here.\n\n(00:15:25):\nAnd the really important piece here is you want to do that in a way that's still friendly and open. I see a lot of founders get this wrong and they prematurely will shut down a conversation or they won't talk to an incumbent or a potential future buyer because they take too competitive of a stance. But that's a mistake because M&A is all about creating plan Bs and you don't want to shut that door down prematurely because you don't know if you can really go the distance and be an independent company. So you want to have optionality.\n\nLenny (00:15:54):\nI love this term with pain on your potential acquirers. What are some examples of that? Who's done that well or what's an example of that interaction?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:16:03):\nYeah. I mean I can share the transform stories of a company we just acquired, we announced it in February. So dbt Labs, we build transformations, that's our main product. And we were venturing into a new product area that we call the semantic layer. And to describe what that is quickly, it's allowing companies to define their business metrics and so that whenever anyone queries it, we always serve back consistent data on those business metrics and transform. They were a pure play company only in this metrics layer, semantic layer. And they had a really strong product.\n\n(00:16:41):\nThey had figured out some of the technical challenges and they had solved it early on. They had the benefit of having worked at Airbnb, which and Airbnb in the data world is famous for having a really successful semantic layer metrics layer called Minerva. And what we had at dbt Labs is really good distribution and ecosystem, but we were a little behind in bringing a product to market and we felt that pressure from Transform because they were doing such a great job at being vocal and loud about how their semantic layer solves these really hard technical problems.\n\n(00:17:20):\nBut they didn't have any distribution. So that was really tough for them and they were putting pressure, but they were still positioning their company as a partner to us because they wanted our community to be excited about what they were building and hopefully lure them over to use their product. So because they had positioned themselves as a friendly partner when really we were trying to compete for this similar use case, when it came time to do an acquisition, we were really excited because we knew their product was good and they had already done a lot of the work to make integrating with dbt possible and that helps us post acquisition do the integration much more easily.\n\nLenny (00:18:01):\nHow do you just think about either as a startup or even an incumbent about how to think about competition, how much emphasis, how much energy to put into thinking what competitors are doing and just how that informs your strategy?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:18:15):\nSo we recently codified our philosophy when it comes to competition. And I'll give Nick Handel the founder of Transform who led this exercise at dbt Labs. But we really have three pillars when it comes to competition. So the first is hold true to our vision. We're really excited about the path and the journey that we're going on at dbt Labs and we don't want the distraction. So occasionally you'll have competitors maybe throw shade or throw stones, but most of that is just noise. If you have a lot of conviction that you're going in the right journey, you want to just keep your eyes straight ahead and run your best race and not be too distracted by what maybe some critics are saying.\n\n(00:19:00):\nThe second philosophy we have is really a grow the pie philosophy. So we want to work with our partners in our ecosystem to make the opportunity set even larger and we see that today. We mostly serve reporting and BI use cases, we're seeing lots of companies start to operationalize their data. Now with this big wave of ML, clean Transform data assets are being used to train machine learning models so that the pie continues to grow. Let's focus on that as our target and work with people to make the opportunity set really attractive and not try to slice it up too thinly.\n\n(00:19:37):\nAnd then the last one is we want to lean into our strengths. So we have an ambition to be a platform company and we know what we're good at, but we also want to leave space for our ecosystem to offer solutions to our users that help them out. And we really want to foster an ecosystem where we can partner with lots of companies in the modern data stack. And generally speaking, when it comes to competition, we take a really long-term view and there are a few areas that we do want to hold our ground and that's in our transformation standard as well as our semantic standard because we believe those two are better served together for the user's sake. But for everything else, we really feel like we can work with our ecosystem and accomplish what we want to accomplish and also help them accomplish their goals too.\n\nLenny (00:20:27):\nThis might be a good time to just chat about dbt and the success the company has had. So many startups have tried to become a standard default layer of what's now called the modern data stack. And I don't know any startup doesn't use dbt or planning to use dbt. It's just a incredibly rare success story somewhere to snowflake where it's just like it's the default for building large data startups and most startups these days work with a lot of data. So my question is just like what do you think dbt did most right to win in this and continue to win?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:21:01):\nSo I think dbt did a lot of things right, but I'll point out too that really stick out to me. And the first is just power and simplicity and the second is a commitment to being open. And I'll touch on what I mean by those two things. So when dbt was first getting started, you would hear a lot from companies, I don't understand, what's so special about dbt? We have a SQL templating tool at our company, we built one in-house. Like this is really straightforward and simple and it's true like dbt is really simple, but that is the power of it.\n\n(00:21:37):\nSo our founders, Tristan, Drew and Connor, they had a belief that the people who do data analysis work, that really work closely with their business stakeholders should also be the ones to contribute to creating clean data assets in production because that data prep work is a necessary prerequisite for any analysis that you do. So dbt was really this belief that if you know SQL, we want to invite you to do these workflows that were traditionally held by data engineers but you had to earn that. So dbt has this nice framework where it's harder to mess up, keeps data quality really high, but it is pretty simple to get started and learn and learn. And that was really the unlock in the industry. We were definitely solving a pain point at the right time.\n\n(00:22:26):\nAnd then the second thing is this commitment to being open. So dbt is open source and that's the main guts of dbt where you write your business logic and it helps in a number of ways. Specifically it helps with flywheel, keep the flywheel running and also with network effects. And I'll explain what that looks like. So dbt is really easy to get started with at your company with reduced friction. We're building a product that people, so they talk about it, they want to share it both at their organization and with other companies. Other companies get started with dbt again with reduced friction.\n\n(00:23:05):\nWe now get to see this really diverse set of use cases for dbt across company sizes, across industries and it allows us to build a truly horizontal company. As our company grows, we get to invest back into our community and our product and the flywheel begins to spin faster. And then meanwhile we have a really large user base. So we have 20,000 companies using dbt every single week and that attracts partners to want to build for dbt and so they share best practices, build workflows, and now if you're a company and you've standardized on dbt, you've really unlocked an integrated modern data ecosystem that wasn't available for you before. So that has a flywheel and also benefits everyone that decides to be on the standard. So it's those two really important trends that made dbt so powerful today.\n\nLenny (00:24:02):\nSo what I'm hearing there is essentially the product was right for what people needed to solve. There's also a product led component, open source, free self-serve piece that people adopted, used and started working and then scaled and started paying for it. And then there's an alignment of the vision of where this was going and how it fit with how people wanted this to work for them. Is there anything else? Because a lot of startups do that and that all sounds really smart and good, but a lot of startups try to do those things and no one cares. Maybe their product isn't necessarily what people are looking for, maybe they don't get the right distribution. I don't know. Is there anything else that you think they did really well that helped them kickstart this to even be a thing? Is it timing that was really great? Is it specific influencers early on?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:24:48):\nYeah. I think timing was really important with the success of dbt. That they were there when the cloud data warehouses were really exploding and growing in an enormous way. And dbt Labs started as Fishtown Analytics, a consulting firm. So they worked really, really closely and hands-on with all of their consulting partners to get the pain point and really solve firsthand challenges that they saw. I think that combination of being at the right place at the right time and also getting to work really closely with people's day-to-day problems created a really special experience.\n\nLenny (00:25:29):\nI didn't know that. That's a really important element of the story is basically they were focused... How long did they do that Fishtown Analytics consultancy?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:25:38):\nBoard consulting part of the business was almost two years.\n\nLenny (00:25:42):\nOkay. So they basically spent two years solving this problem basically manually for people, and that's such a great way to understand real pain and figure out how to solve it.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:25:53):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:25:54):\nAwesome. Okay, so that's a really interesting insight. Just spend a few years. It sounds like it was almost manually helping people transform their data using whatever tools already existed.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:26:05):\nYeah. Well, they were building dbt and using dbt to help them do their jobs better and supporting their clients. And whenever they encountered paper cuts or friction or the workflow was taking longer than they expected, they would build that into dbt. And that really matured the experience of the product because the people who were building it, the founders were also day-to-day working with these customers or clients that had pain points.\n\nLenny (00:26:36):\nThat reminds me of a story you told me about how you made your eng team do some manual work of an algorithm involved in transformation. Can you share that?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:26:47):\nOkay. So I'm going to preface this story by sharing that I'm a huge math nerd and one of my favorite books on logic is called Girdle Escher Bach. And in this book there's a fun scene where there's an ant farm that bands together to do the work of a computer flipping bits from zero to one to solve logic gates. So this chapter of that book was really the inspiration for an exercise that I ran my team through. So about a year ago we were doing a big zero to one new project at dbt Labs and we were going to change the algorithm for how we built customers data transformation graphs. And I needed a way for the team to really internalize all of the changes that we were going to be making and I needed them to own it because otherwise they wouldn't be able to anticipate all of the edge cases and it wouldn't be quite as durable. You couldn't copy paste the algorithm.\n\n(00:27:41):\nSo I showed up to a team offsite with a spool of rope and sticky notes and I think my team looked at me crazy, went with two heads when I started to tie people up to create a graph. So each note of the graph was an engineer and the rope was the edges of the graph to connect them. And then we worked through the new algorithm extremely slowly, step by step. And it was a way that you couldn't leave that exercise without knowing exactly what was going on because everyone had a role to play.\n\n(00:28:16):\nSo I think a lot of times when you're starting something new, you get into a situation where a few people really understand it and they're running way ahead of the rest of the pack. But I needed a way for the whole team to go along for the journey. So I'm constantly trying to create these important moments or memorable moments for the team so that it's centered around our mission and they can have the ownership of taking the project and making it successful. So it was perhaps a overly creative or kooky way to spend the day, but it was really successful.\n\nLenny (00:28:49):\nWhat was the actual algorithm you were trying to implement?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:28:53):\nWe were trying to figure out how to make flipping the way that we run people's dags from an imperative way to a declarative way. So instead of running things left to when data arrived in your warehouse. You think about it as reverse, like what would need to happen to make your data SLAs be materialized in time.\n\nLenny (00:29:16):\nAwesome. And sounds like the team found that valuable.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:29:20):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:29:20):\nOkay. Reminds me of a clip from this last season of Ted Lasso where they have used red strings and I won't get into it, but if you've seen it you will know what I'm talking about. I want to come back to your chatting about open source versus not open source. So some part of dbt was is open source and some isn't. I'm curious how the team decides what is open source and what should be open source, what isn't open source and what to charge for?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:29:50):\nWe think about dbt open source. It's really the guts of the data transformation. It's where you describe your business logic. And then on the cloud side we build proprietary software that supercharges the development life cycle and the productionization of dbt at scale. So what we think about as leaving for our cloud offering is we deal with state, so stateful interactions and also any cross team or structural collaboration. We want to reserve that for our proprietary offering. And I think it's really important to have that distinction of what do you believe should be open source or what is the open standard that really matters? And ecosystem to us is really important. So it's important that that remains open source, but then we want to supercharge that experience with an open core model and build proprietary software that makes people much more successful at using dbt.\n\nLenny (00:30:48):\nToday's episode is brought to you by AssemblyAI. If you're looking to build AI powered features in your audio and video products, then you need to know about AssemblyAI, which makes it easy to transcribe and understand speech at scale.

Visit assemblyai.com/lenny to try their API for free and start testing their models with their no code playground. That's assemblyai.com/lenny. I know you also spent a lot of time thinking about pricing and willingness to pay and things along those lines.\n\n(00:32:03):\nIs there anything you could share about which is what you've learned about how to think about pricing for a tool like this or even in general?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:32:09):\nPricing and willingness to pay is such a hard conversation and lots of startups don't do this early enough in their company journey. Likely a side effect of zero interest rates where investors were happy funding GitHub stars and usage and companies never thought about how am I going to make revenue or make money, which is it's important. So for us at dbt Labs, I don't claim to be perfect at it, but we're trying to get a better muscle around it. And I always think about Madhavan who wrote this book Pricing Innovation. I know you've had him on the show before, but he shares that you don't get to decide if you're going to have a pricing or willingness to pay a conversation. You only get to decide what. So it's much better to have that conversation before you build the product than have it when your sales team's trying to sell something and people aren't excited about what you've built, aren't willing to pay for it.\n\n(00:33:04):\nAnd at dbt Labs we have this value, it's one of our core values that says we are more concerned with value creation than value capture. And we really mean this. When we talk about what is the value of dbt Labs to our customers, they often talk about how it's either 20 to 35% as valuable as what they spend on their cloud data warehouse. But what we charge our customers is a very small fraction of that 20 to 35% and that's by design. And last year we did our first ever pricing change in the company history and you learn a tremendous amount when you have that event because you get to test the price elasticity by of your customers.\n\n(00:33:49):\nAnd it's so important to learn that lesson while the company is still smaller or the stakes are lower because pricing just is always evolving. It's not a fixed thing, it gets more complex over time. So we have to think about it quite a bit because my team builds proprietary software for dbt cloud and when we lose a deal we most often lose it to dbt open source and we like it that way. We're happy to lose to ourselves, but we have to really think very deeply about what are people willing to pay for and what moves the needle for them and focus on that.\n\nLenny (00:34:26):\nI'm so curious what that pricing process was like to figure out what to change. Is there anything you could share about just what that was for you or what are some just surprises that came out of that process or just like, \"Wow, we didn't expect that in these conversations?\"\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:34:42):\nIt's really like an all hands on deck conversation. Pricing is so cross-cutting because it's a finance discussion as well. You're modeling out things in spreadsheets and figuring out how that might impact the business. But you can't just solve these problems in spreadsheets. You have to go talk to customers, test the waters, understand where people's appetites are and sussing that out is really hard. And then of course there's a product piece to it too where you have to affect it and communicate it as well. So it was very cross-cutting. We learned a lot. We track our conversion rates really carefully. We track our turn rates very carefully and I think largely we were happy with the change that we made and we felt like one of the big things that we were trying to solve for was have our pricing catch up to how people valued the tool.\n\nLenny (00:35:40):\nHow many people did you end up talking to, who was doing these conversations and is there anything really important you learned about how to ask these questions and these sorts of leanness to pay conversations?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:35:50):\nSo we talked to dozens. It was combination of product and product marketing, having the conversations and people aren't very willing to share explicitly what they will pay. But there's some tools that we use on relative value. People most think about what is the relative value of dbt in their cloud warehouse. And we also tried to employ some of the tactics that we tried to suss out what do people view as very inexpensive? What's a price point that's very cheap or a no-brainer? What price point is maybe fair or comfortable for them and what would be too expensive? And then we had all the data back to figure out where we landed.\n\nLenny (00:36:34):\nI want to come back to M&A for a bit. I had a few more questions there and I moved on from that. So again, you've done a lot of work within the M&A realm. Something that I saw recently, and this connects to the fact that a lot of startups now are looking to get sold. This VC hunter walk, he's a founder of Home Brew Ventures, had this interesting blog post where he basically suggested you should actually think about being public about the fact that you're selling your company. Which is crazy because in the past you never want to come across as too selly. I don't want people to think I'm desperate. And his point is many startups are desperate right now and it's okay to be public about that. And then in theory creates more of a bidding situation where many people know versus keeping it secret and in closed rooms. So my question is just what do you think of that? Do you think that's effective strategy? Is it not?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:37:28):\nI think it's good advice. If you're in a Hail Mary situation where you're looking for a home or you need an exit for your business, it's better to be transparent and cast a wider net. And you're right, in previous times founders tried to be a little bit cute or obfuscate that they were evasive the situation that they were in because they wanted to drum up some competitive interest when there really wasn't any. But unfortunately in today's climate, too many companies are in that spot so it's impossible to hide it. So the better approach is just to be transparent and I see it pretty regularly and there's absolutely no shame in sending a note that says something like, \"Hey, we're looking for an exit for our company X, Y, and Z didn't pan out as we expected. We built a really interesting product and we want to keep the team together. We're running a process. Are you interested?\" Really just as simple as that.\n\nLenny (00:38:24):\nI've seen a lot of companies put together these really detailed decks or even websites of just like, here's the team, here's what we built to be very promotional about it. Is that something you've seen? Is that something you'd recommend?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:38:35):\nYeah. Usually in these situations people are acquiring the teams and so having your data room together, really the most important thing is these are the team members that are going to come along with the acquisition is the biggest motivator for why a buyer would get excited.\n\nLenny (00:38:52):\nYou made this point earlier that a lot of the seeds need to be planted early for you to have the best outcome. And this reminded me... So I had a startup local mine that we sold to Airbnb and I met Airbnb initially at a year before we actually started exploring the process at a random party at South by Southwest where I was, I actually have no memory of this party, but the head of product at Airbnb, Joe bought, remembered it and came back to us a year later and just like, \"Hey, what are you guys up to? Maybe we could collaborate on some stuff,\" and that led to an acquisition. So I think that's just wanted to touch a ban on that point of just the power of, the way I thought about it is let a thousand flowers bloom, just like meet everyone. Get the word out that you're around and what you're doing so that in the future when someone has that problem they're like, \"That company, maybe we should talk to them.\"\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:39:37):\nYeah, you want to make sure that the buyer knows who you are before the acquisition moment and hopefully that's because you've made an impact and they like what you're building. Maybe you've inflicted some pain on them. But yeah, certainly creating those connections well ahead of an exit event is important.\n\nLenny (00:39:58):\nAnd specifically there it's meet people at your competitors potentially. For us, Airbnb was never even a potential company we would sell to because it had nothing to do with it but ended up making sense down the road. What's like the realm of the companies and people that you think people should think about meeting?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:40:12):\nIf the company is buying a lot or they're active, they often have corp dev teams and so use that corp dev team to your advantage. It's their job to meet absolutely every company that could be potentially interested. So take that meeting, say you're not interested in an acquisition just yet, but push them to make an introduction to someone that could sponsor the deal. So usually that's someone in product or maybe a GM and use that as a starting point for maybe just a conversation, maybe something more like a partnership but get the corp dev team to work for you.\n\nLenny (00:40:50):\nWhat if you're at the other end of the spectrum and you're in dire straits right now and you're just like, \"Man, what do we do to potentially sell this company?\" I know odds are not going to be great, but just what do you suggest folks do in terms of I guess finding connections to potential companies that might be acquirers?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:41:07):\nYeah. I mean use your network. Usually your venture capitalist has a really big network and one of the things that I hear founders feeling the most nervous about is a duty to return the money to the investors. And maybe this is a unpopular thing to say on a podcast, but your investors understand that they're not making their money back. And what they want to do instead is have you end up at a really great company like an Airbnb because that will help them down the road. So it's all about the long game, but use your investors to help you find connections at different companies that could be buying and don't worry so much about disappointing them or being really realistic about where you are in your company journey.\n\nLenny (00:41:55):\nTo build on that, I'm just an angel investor, I'm not like the lead fund and they feel differently I imagine. But the last thing I want for a founders to get stuck at a company they hate and just so that they could return some money or have some outcome rather they just give up, move on. Life is short.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:42:11):\nYeah. I think founders forget that it is so risky investing in early stage companies that 50% of portfolios investments don't return anything. And that's just part of the game and it's a very acceptable path where hey, we gave it our best shot. It didn't work out and moving on.\n\nLenny (00:42:36):\nWhich is tough a lot of times for founders that are told like it's all about grit and not giving up and don't quit. Sometimes you should quit.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:42:43):\nGosh, yeah. I don't want to say that. I think being founders, it's an extremely lonely role sometimes and it is very hard to know what your next chapter will look like or what the journey will look like and sometimes you really are out of cash and you do have to find a home. But I hope that you can continue to fight and find a way forward.\n\nLenny (00:43:08):\nAgreed. Specifically for people thinking about selling their company, are there any companies you think are good companies for people to look at right now that are actively acquiring or open to M&A?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:43:19):\nThis is a tough one. I think a lot of companies are on the sidelines for a number of reasons. And they could be on the sidelines because they just did an acquisition and they're trying to digest or integrate that company. They could be on the sidelines because they're not growing headcount as much and M&A is often org chart gymnastics of folding the target companies headcount into your budget and plan and maybe just don't have a lot of space. Or probably more common right now is there's just a general uncertainty about the future. And in highly volatile markets people want to take care of their own and even the best M&A deals at a level of complexity that a lot of buyers are just not looking to take on right now.\n\n(00:44:07):\nSo there are a number of reasons why people might sit out, but what I would do if I were in a position of wanting to sell my company is I would come up with a buyer set of maybe a dozen and really there aren't more than a dozen companies that will find what you're doing to be a very good fit. Start with your buyer set and then start calling the list by looking at some of the criteria that might count people out. And then go have those conversations. And if you're in a Hail Mary situation, be very transparent about it. Maybe open up the buyer list. But if you still have some room, I would maybe focus on two to three partner or buyers and really play a different playbook, which is inflict pain. Make it really hard for them to not notice you but do it with a smile and be friendly at while you do that.\n\nLenny (00:44:57):\nSometimes with M&A discussions, there's a lot of subtlety to the way you communicate where you don't come out and be like, please we'd love to sell our company to you. Any advice on just the phrasing and how to approach it or do you think it's just, it's fine, just tell us we're looking to sell our company. Are you interested in being buyer?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:45:15):\nYeah. I just wouldn't be too clever here. Everyone understands like I'm evaluating strategic alternatives. It means you're looking to sell your company and it depends. Do you have time? If you have time, yeah. Don't come out and say, \"Hey, I'm for sale.\" That's not going to end up in a good outcome. But depends where you are in your company journey. If you have time, then don't talk about M&A at all. That's the last thing that you want to speak about. Instead, you're talking about maybe collaborating or partnerships. How do we work together? Knowledge sharing and M&A is a dirty word if you have a lot of runway and you're going to try to continue to pursue an independent path, but if you're out of time, you're out of time.\n\nLenny (00:46:08):\nThat's such good advice. I remember the term we used was we want to explore a strategic partnership and everyone's just like, I knows what you mean by that, but you just don't want to say it.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:46:19):\nYeah. It's like everyone in the room's looking like yeah. Okay. Strategic partnership or a strategic alternative, it's like we all know these code words and we understand the situation you're in.\n\nLenny (00:46:31):\nYeah. When do you think M&A market might pick up again? I know it's impossible to predict. Do you have any sense?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:46:37):\nYeah. I wish I had a magic ball. That'd be pretty sweet. I think what is happening though is we're far enough out from the peak of the markets. So the peak was really November of 2021. And why does that matter? Two things. One, founders are coming to terms with valuations that they maybe received at the highest of the market, are no longer going to hold in this market and companies are out of cash or maybe out of options. We'll be better assets entering the market soon. And at a certain point the opportunities will just be too great. That will incentivize a lot of the buyers that have been on the bench to start participating again in the M&A market. And I don't know exactly when that will be, but I think we're pretty close. I think we're pretty close.\n\nLenny (00:47:28):\nAnd you mentioned a value that you have at dbt. I forget exactly what it was, but I'm curious what are the other values that you have at dbt, whatever you can share. Always curious what principles and values companies come down to help drive the way they think.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:47:42):\nThe value that I shared is we are more concerned with value creation than value capture and that really drives everything that we do. We try to put a lot of good out into the world and it pays back slowly. The whole mission of dbt Labs is to help analytics engineers disseminate organizational knowledge through data. So we really believe also being participants of sharing that information and getting more people knowledgeable about all sorts of things.\n\n(00:48:13):\nTransparency wins. We're a really transparent company. We share our board decks. We have lots of communication and participation in all of our Slacks. We're writing culture. We have hard conversations in the open. So that's another a big one. Transparency always wins. We are humble. We don't ever feel like we are successful. We come at this from a very humble space where we feel like we have to serve our community and our users and that really motivates us. And then another one is just work done well as its own end and it's really focusing on the journey and not the end destination.\n\nLenny (00:48:56):\nAwesome. I want to do a post someday of just like, here's the values all these different successful companies have come to and see if there's any patterns. I'm actually doing a post right now on Snowflake and on Figma and what you touched on. There's such a connection and a thread of obsessing with your users and making sure they're happy at Figma. I forget exactly what it is, but it's just like in this article, it's going to come out tomorrow actually. So people get a sense of when we recorded this where they think of their company as software as a service where service is their number one goal. They actually provide service and software is just a way to do that. And then it's Snowflake. Their number one core value is put customers first and they talk a lot about how they just actually informs their prioritization all I think, and all their thinking. So it's interesting. That also comes up a lot in what you're talking about, which I think it's easy to say, but I think what actually separates companies that succeed is they actually put this into practice.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:49:51):\nIt's really interesting too because a lot of the people who work at dbt Labs came from the community, so they feel this real ownership in making the experience an excellent one because they were so compelled to come join dbt Labs because the product changed the way that they work or changed their lives. So that commitment to the community and product experience is really, really strong.\n\nLenny (00:50:14):\nThis isn't another thread. Maybe we'll go down real quick. I'm working on a different post around Reddit and how to work with really opinionated users that strong opinions about changes to the product and the way they described it, these guys were there for five years working with the community on the product. Is that to your users, the product is their baby, basically. It's like they think it's theirs versus the companies. And I'm curious, having a really strong opinionated community, what it sounds like you also have, what have you learned about just working with them to build product that makes them happy and avoid revolts and really upsetness?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:50:51):\nIt's hard as you grow. I think it's just a challenge cause our community gets bigger. You can't service everybody's needs. But I think what we've done is everyone is very deep in our own product. I think one of the cool stats is at dbt Labs we have over 30% of our employee headcount has contributed to our data transformation workflow. So that's across every discipline. It's in obviously product, obviously in our data team. Our marketing team also contributes to data transformation. And our engineering team will also contribute to our internal dbt analytics project and that sense of really understanding what the experience is like and then soliciting as much feedback as we possibly can. We have a dbt Slack community of 50,000 and all of our employees are in that Slack channel regularly and can feel when we mess up or we don't quite deliver an experience that we're proud of, you will just see dozens of people trying to jump on board and try to make it better.\n\nLenny (00:52:02):\nIs there any other frameworks or just general processes that you found to be release useful in building awesome product running teams?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:52:10):\nI'm not a big framework person, but there's two sayings that I find myself repeating or I either to myself or to others. And it's worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem. And what do I mean by that? It's really to help me combat this perfectionism because perfect doesn't exist and you should instead go with good enough because when you ship, that's the moment when you get to learn a lot from your users and you just can't anticipate it. You try very hard to understand exactly how people will use the product and get all the edges ironed out. But you can't until you ship. And I'll share an example. So my team helps support the dbt cloud scheduler and the initial version of the dbt cloud scheduler was pretty naive. We were a little embarrassed by it.\n\n(00:53:02):\nIt was a big old for loop over a big old jobs table. So we would look like is it time for this job to run? Okay. Yes, run this job. Okay. It's not time for this job to run next, continue on. Is it time? Yes, run this job. And it would just loop over and it's extremely naive and very simple, but it got the job done. And I try to remind the engineers, we would be so lucky to have tech debt because that means people are using the product. And now we've had to rebuild our scheduler several times over because we do have meaningful scale. We have 8,000 companies using our scheduler. We have to manage 10 million runs per month. But what we didn't need at launch was a distributed scheduler with coworkers and RabbitMQ. We just didn't need it because we had no users. So these two sayings that worse is better and tech debt is a champagne problem, just really reminds people like, let's ship, let's get it out into the user's hands and then we'll learn and iterate and it'll be a better experience for them.\n\nLenny (00:54:08):\nThat's a good segue to my last question. So weren't a PM before this role. You have strong experience in investing, investment banking business in general. I'm curious what you think product managers should maybe focus on more or learn more or lean into to become stronger product leaders based on the experience you've had moving into product.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:54:30):\nSo I pull a lot on my experience or some of the things that I did was as an investor in my current role in product. And maybe I'll touch on what is the scale of a venture capitalist might be a little bit foreign for people, but venture capitalists, they spend all their day meeting lots of different companies, context switching. They have to know a little bit about quite a lot of different things. And they do this to refine their investment tastes or find their investor judgment. And they're also investing a lot in their network and connecting people, supporting people, and mining people for ideas that are way smarter than they are. So you do that all the time in Venture and I've brought a lot of those skills with me into product and it translates really well.\n\n(00:55:17):\nThe first is I still spend a lot of time investing in my network and I think it's an underrated way for a PM to spend their time. And I try to build a network of operators at other companies that are like dbt Labs that are growing nicely, maybe a little bit ahead of where we are. And I ask them questions, how did you navigate open source? How did you navigate pricing? How did you navigate acquisitions? And then I take the best ideas, figure out which ones I can apply and bring it back to dbt Labs. The second thing is I really think my special T or my superpower is that I'm a T-shaped generalist. So I know a little about a lot of things from finance to business to product. I have to go a lot deeper in product in the areas that I specialize in. That's where the tail of the tea comes in. But it's precisely because I've had a diverse background that makes me more effective when I'm trying to get things done within the organization. Because I have just more credible experiences that I can pull from.\n\n(00:56:18):\nAnd then the last thing that I think maybe doesn't show up day to day in my product work, but in investing, you're constantly thinking about risk and the power laws, and we touched on this before, but most investments don't work out. You lose the dollars that you put in, but all the returns come from these rare events that make up for all the losses. You have to think about what are the uncapped upside opportunities in investing. And I think in product, you still have to do the same thing. If 50% of the things I worked on went to zero, we'd have a problem. But it encourages me to continue to make bets for the company that has the chance of bending the trajectory of our business.\n\nLenny (00:57:03):\nWe've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:57:07):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:57:08):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:57:12):\nOkay. So two books that helped me learn a lot about myself. Range, it's a book about generalist and also Quiet, it's a book about introverts. And then I like a lot of biographies. So a few of my favorites are Snowball about Warren Buffet, Made in America, about Sam Walton and Leonardo da Vinci.\n\nLenny (00:57:31):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:57:34):\nSo I almost watched a movie in preparation for this podcast, but I really don't watch things except in the holiday. During the holidays, I like Succession, but I have not seen the latest season.\n\nLenny (00:57:46):\nWow. You're in store for a treat. Favorite interview question you like to ask?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:57:53):\nWhen's the last time you had to teach yourself something new and how'd you do it? So I like to test for growth mindset and a thirst for learning. And then also why dbt Labs. I think a lot of people who come to dbt Labs have very authentic reasons why they're drawn to the company. And in moments where in things are tough, it's the answer to that question of why are you here, it's going to make all the difference.\n\nLenny (00:58:17):\nAnd sounds like what you look for is just like an genuine enthusiasm.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:58:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:22):\nAwesome. What are some favorite products you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:58:27):\nI like Belly. It's a consumer social app that lets you find and discover restaurants and rate them with your friends. It's been a lot of fun looking at the New York City restaurant scene.\n\nLenny (00:58:37):\nI've never heard of that. Awesome. What is something relatively minor you've changed in the way you all do? Product that has had a lot of impact?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:58:42):\nDo fewer things and try to single thread the team as much as possible.\n\nLenny (00:58:50):\nAnd single thread meaning like one main priority, one goal?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:58:53):\nOne mission. Yeah. We're all working rowing in the same direction.\n\nLenny (00:58:57):\nFinal question. You have a podcast, first of all, tell us what it's called, but second of all, what's a favorite podcast of yours other than this podcast and your podcast?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:59:05):\nYeah. It's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast, so if you want to learn more about the data industry, I host it every other week with our CEO Tristan Handy. It's a lot of fun. Check it out. Other podcasts that I really like are In Depth, it's First Rounds podcast by Bretton. He interviews a lot of operators about how they do their very best work. And another podcast that I really like is the Logan Bartlett Show, which touches on timely trends in tech.\n\nLenny (00:59:34):\nAnd In Depth I think Todd Jackson actually hosts a lot of the episodes too. Also, a huge fan of the podcast. Definitely check it out. And then say your podcast again and how can folks find it?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:59:43):\nIt's called the Analytics Engineering Podcast.\n\nLenny (00:59:47):\nAnd it's just in podcasting apps?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (00:59:48):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:59:49):\nAmazing. Check it out. Julia, we've talked about inflicting pain and strategic partnerships and why worse is better. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJulia Schottenstein (01:00:03):\nYou can find me on Twitter J_Schottenstein, and you can also find me in the dbt community Slack also, Julia Schottenstein. Send me a note, reach me there and I'd love to hear from you if you have data problems or we can help serve your needs better, would love to chat.\n\nLenny (01:00:22):\nThank you so much for being here, Julia.\n\nJulia Schottenstein (01:00:24):\nAwesome. Thanks Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness. Then it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold.\n\nLenny (00:37):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world class product leaders, and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies today. My guest is Julian Shapiro. I actually spend a bunch of time introducing the wondrous Julian at the beginning of the episode. Instead, let me just share some of the things that we talk about. We get into a framework he calls product-led acquisition, which is work that has come out of his working with thousands of companies, helping to figure out their growth strategies.\n\nLenny (01:10):\nWe get into ways to increase your product's retention. Then we talk a lot about writing, the importance of novelty in your writing, how to choose a topic when you plan to write, and then a framework that Julian calls the Creativity Faucet. Julian is such a fascinating human, and I'm really excited to bring you this episode. With that, I bring you Julian Shapiro. I'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:37):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (01:39):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics. But now you're getting into experimentation and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:50):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop. Think collect data, inform that, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. The big aha was seeing how many customers we're using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (02:11):\nSupporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (02:15):\nYeah. Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growth.\n\nLenny (02:24):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John, and head to Amplitude.com to get started. Hey, Ashley, head of marketing and Flatfile. How many B2B SaaS companies would you estimate need to import CSV files from their customers?\n\nAshley (02:38):\nAt least 40%.\n\nLenny (02:40):\nHow many of them screw that up and what happens when they do?\n\nAshley (02:42):\nWell? Based on our data, about a third of people will consider switching to another company after just one bad experience during onboarding. If your CSV importer doesn't work right, which is super common, considering customer files are chock- full of unexpected data and formatting, they'll leave.\n\nLenny (03:03):\nI am 0% surprised to hear that. I've consistently seen that improving onboarding is one of the highest leverage opportunities for both signup conversion and increasing long-term retention. Getting people to your aha moment more quickly and reliably is so incredibly important.\n\nAshley (03:17):\nTotally. It's incredible to see how our customers like Square, Spotify, and Zuora are able to grow their businesses on top of Flatfile. It's because flawless data onboarding acts like a catalyst to get them and their customers where they need to go faster.\n\nLenny (03:34):\nIf you'd like to learn more or get started, check out flat file at flatfile.com/lenny. Julian Shapiro is what I'd call a polymath of the internet. He's an amazing writer, marketer and growth mind, investor, community builder, podcaster, tweeter. He's also an expert on building muscle. He's maybe most known for being the founder of Demand Curve, a YC startup that trains people on growth and marketing. Prior to that, he was a part-time columnist at TechCrunch. He was also VP of marketing at Webflow, which I had no idea about.\n\nLenny (04:09):\nHe also created a JavaScript web animation engine that is used by Uber and WhatsApp and Samsung and thousands of companies. Currently he is a full-time investor with his own fund and as a partner at Hyper. He's also one of the most hilarious and generous humans that I know. With that, Julian, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJulian Shapiro (04:28):\nThis is the greatest honor of my life. Thank you.\n\nLenny (04:31):\nWow!\n\nJulian Shapiro (04:32):\nI'm crying from that intro. Very nice of you.\n\nLenny (04:35):\nThat's the idea. This is the greatest honor of my life. We match.\n\nJulian Shapiro (04:40):\nExcellent. We'll cancel each other out and we'll see how interesting this is.\n\nLenny (04:43):\nThat's right. There's a lot of hype. I know you have something like 250,000 Twitter followers. You're very good at Twitter, but I've noticed that you've only tweeted three times this past year. What is going on there?\n\nJulian Shapiro (04:58):\nThere's a few things in parallel. One is a lot of people are writing threads and I found this to be very cringe. They're like these fortune cookie threads like here's 21 ways to rework your startup or something. I found them all cringe. What they actually do when you write that stuff is they attract people who think that's valuable information, and then they cause people who you actually want to follow you to unfollow you. I remember just seeing people unfollow me early days of threads when no one was doing them and I was experimenting. They were pissing off people that I actually cared to have dialogue with.\n\nJulian Shapiro (05:36):\nI kind of lost the momentum and enthusiasm for writing that sort of stuff. And now I'm only writing anything when it's basically a reflection or a condensed version of a blog post that I happen to be writing from my website. I know it's high quality. I know it's original. I know it's thoughtful. It's not for the click bait. That was part of it. The other thing is that it's kind of like too... Here's a mental model for thinking about the quality of your followers. You have people who follow you for the quality of your brain, and you have people who follow you for sort of you being a glorified curator. If they're following you for being a curator, they're sort of what I call labor followers.\n\nJulian Shapiro (06:16):\nThey're following you for the work that you're doing, where you're finding cool, funny memes. You're posting cool, funny jokes. You're doing these fortune cookie threads. In contrast, if they're following you for your mind, which is category one, it means they're following you for the original thoughts and insights and takes that you have on the world. Someone like Paul Graham, the founder of Y Combinator, is doing original takes. He's not trying to write threads for the sake of gaining followers. He's trying to write interesting novel ideas. When he does that, he strengthens the affinity that his followers have for him and his mind, because like, \"Wow! That was an original interesting take.\"\n\nJulian Shapiro (06:49):\nThey're following you for your mind, not for the labor you're doing, putting together a virtual Buzzfeed to count on Twitter. When people follow you for your mind, when they're mind followers, not labor followers, higher affinity means more loyalty, means they pay closer attention to what you're saying. And if you actually try to get them to do something with you, you have an event offline, there's something you're selling, there's a cause you care about, they're way more likely to indulge.\n\nJulian Shapiro (07:12):\nWhereas if they're following you for your labor, you're interchangeable with all these other meme accounts and there's no real affinity for you as the individual. I just care more about the quality of the follower than I do the volume.\n\nLenny (07:23):\nI love that. That's such a good reminder, not to just focus on follower, follower, follower. I'm curious if someone... You have a lot of followers at this point and it's just so valuable to have Twitter followers. I've learned for me, anytime I have a question about anything, I just ask and I get so many amazing answers from people. There's this power to having a large following. I'm curious while we're on this topic, if you're just starting out on Twitter, do you have any advice for someone that's just thinking about building their following?\n\nJulian Shapiro (07:50):\nI mean, generally speaking, threads, despite everything I've said, are the primary way to get followers. There's a reason why people do threads as opposed to single tweets is because when people get exposure to a thread, they're basically getting exposure to the length of thoughts equivalent to you having sent a newsletter edition or a blog post in many cases. The more exposure, the more surface area you have, the more you give people of your brain in a single tweet, the more they're able to confirm that what you're sharing is actually a consistency from you.\n\nJulian Shapiro (08:21):\nWhereas if you just tweet one clever thing, they're like, \"Oh, that's probably just a drop in the bucket. Who knows if that person can consistently generate clever stuff?\" But in a long thread where it's 30 tweets and they're all good, they're like, \"Whoa! This person is a machine. If I follow them reliably, I'll get more great stuff.\" It reaffirms to readers they should follow you, which is why threads trigger more follows. Basically you do want to do threads, frankly, and that's the backbone of it. Threads with very clickbaity opening tweets kind of how it works.\n\nJulian Shapiro (08:52):\nYou can also port followers over from other places like your website and newsletter, just to start giving yourself an initial sample audience through which the threads can actually take fire pretty much.\n\nLenny (09:02):\nAwesome. I wasn't expecting to go into Twitter as strategy, but this is interesting because you're really good at it. As you've said, your stuff is actually very thoughtful. It's not just a thirsty Twitter thread trying to find followers and retweets. Thanks for sharing that.\n\nJulian Shapiro (09:18):\nWell, it sort of started that way, because me and a few other friends of mine, I felt like we were the first people doing threads at scale. And then when we realized what it turned into, that's when we just stopped.\n\nLenny (09:28):\nI love that. I know what you mean about these cringy Twitter threads. Anyway, what I want to do is instead of asking a bunch of random questions is to focus on five big topics and kind of go deep on these topics. These are topics that are maybe most popular of the stuff that you've put out across your handbooks and writing and courses and things like that and also things that I've found to be most interesting. Does that sound good?\n\nJulian Shapiro (09:51):\nYeah, I would love to.\n\nLenny (09:53):\nCool. First, a little context, you write these super in depth handbooks on a bunch of different topics on growth and writing and muscle building and things like that. First of all, could you just explain what these handbooks are and why you create them?\n\nJulian Shapiro (10:05):\nThey're forcing functions for me to hold myself accountable and to be thorough when learning something for my own benefit. That's all they are. Basically if I want to go learn growth or writing well or some other topic, I will go ahead and do a ton of research, read everything I can get my hands on, do a ton of experimentation to try to build a set of novel insights that you couldn't find from other people's research hopefully, and then the next stage is try to make it as concise and actionable as possible so that I can reference it for my own selfish benefit. Here's my guidebook for myself on writing better blog posts, for example.\n\nJulian Shapiro (10:40):\nAnd then by the time I've done that work, what usually happens is its only like, I'm going to make up a number here, an extra 30 hours of work to make it palatable and digestible for the public. If I've done all this work privately, why not make it accessible publicly? At that point, it winds up being acquisition fodder for essentially building an audience and distributing my thoughts further. That's why I do that. But the thing that I pride myself on with them is by no means are they thoroughly unique, but in every one there's a lot of original stuff folks on average have never heard of before.\n\nJulian Shapiro (11:14):\nAnd that's what I'm proud of, is coming up with those insights between the lines that make that thing, whatever the topic is, much more approachable. I've succeeded, in my view, if I've made something that people often mistakenly think of as overwhelmingly complex very simple for them to follow. I think that's where the dopamine hit comes from for them.\n\nLenny (11:34):\nWell, my experience, you definitely hit the nail in my head with the handbooks you put out. It's an interesting middle ground between a newsletter and a book. It's cool to just have a digital way of doing that, of just kind of consolidating a bunch of ideas and going really in depth, but not having to write a book. Well, speaking of the contract there.\n\nJulian Shapiro (11:51):\nYou have a very large newsletter that goes very in depth. That arguably is a more valuable asset than my handbooks for someone building an audience, because the newsletter has this built-in form of retention recurrence, where they get pinged in their inbox when you have new content, and then it becomes a referable thing and people refer each other and then they sign up for the newsletter. I do love the emphasis on longform via newsletter, but the reason I do it on the web is, and we'll talk about the trade-offs in a second, is it's much more digestible and referencable.\n\nJulian Shapiro (12:24):\nNo one's going to go refer to the epic guide in their email inbox that's very hard to navigate for building muscle or something. One, it's a UX decision. Two, I get the SEO traffic, which you don't. And then three, it's basically a living asset that I can keep updating over time. It's not stuck in someone's inbox and getting printed out. One of the things that might separate me from other writers, at least many other writers online, is I'm spending as many hours going back and rewriting old blog posts and handbooks as I am writing ones.\n\nJulian Shapiro (12:55):\nIf you come back to anything I've written over the course of a year or year and a half, it'll be updated, because I consider everything I write to be evergreen. I avoid writing things that I feel like are a drop in the pan, just like talking about a trend or something, something very newsy. I avoid that altogether and I'm just interested in writing stuff that'll be relevant for a long time.\n\nLenny (13:13):\nI didn't know that. That is very cool. I love that you do that. You should make that clear. That's so interesting that this is not stale. Last updated, last week. I don't know if you already do that.\n\nJulian Shapiro (13:21):\nYeah, no, I actually don't and I probably should. People have complained to me that I haven't, so maybe I will one day.\n\nLenny (13:25):\nAll right. We got a good idea out of this, if nothing else.\n\nJulian Shapiro (13:28):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny (13:28):\nOkay. The first idea that I want to chat about is something that you call product-led acquisition. I believe it's the most popular page in any of your handbooks. It comes from you working with thousands of companies to help them figure out their growth strategies through Demand Curve. I'm curious to hear what this concept is and how people can use it to help their products grow.\n\nJulian Shapiro (13:51):\nProduct-led acquisition to your audience will be more commonly known as product-led growth, but I think product-led growth is a bit of a misnomer. It's often used, as you know, to basically refer to SaaS companies who are using self-serve sales funnels where a salesperson isn't required, right? Bypassing sales and allowing the product to grow itself. That's fine. But I think the term we really care about as growth marketers is product-led acquisition, meaning the use of the product grows the product. For example, if I'm using PayPal and I'm sending $1,000 to somebody else, there is no way they will not create a PayPal account to accept the $1,000.\n\nJulian Shapiro (14:31):\nBy me trying to use PayPal in its everyday intention and me getting value out of it to settle a debt, I'm automatically enticing someone else, very strongly so, to also become a PayPal customer. That's product-led acquisition. There's a few different categories I've identified, and I think the reason why people like this part of this article I wrote is because it's, in my opinion, the absolute best way to grow any startup. If your startup can grow via product-led acquisition, not all can, maybe some are enterprise-base and all they're going to make work is sales, then it is by far the best way to grow because zero marginal cost to have users invite other users.\n\nJulian Shapiro (15:12):\nIt's scalable. It creates network graphs typically and has compounding effects there in terms of both moats and the ability to acquire more customers quickly. Basically to the point I just mentioned is basically viral. The other interesting thing here is there are far fewer dependencies. Let's say your company primarily grows via content and SEO, where you're at the mercy of Google releasing an algorithmic update let's say twice a year, which occasionally will absolutely tank your traffic and most people know what I mean by that if they've experienced that. It's awful.\n\nJulian Shapiro (15:41):\nOr ff you're a paid acquisition-led company, as opposed to a content-led acquisition company, meaning you're running Facebook Ads, let's just stick a Facebook for now, Facebook and Instagram, you're also at the mercy of the volatility of CPMs and whatever weird updates Facebook introduces or whatever targeting options they suddenly remove. Your entire acquisition strategy is anchored on something that is completely out of your hands and very volatile. Product-led acquisition is like the better you craft your product and the incentive structures for existing users inviting other users, that's entirely in your control and the better you grow.\n\nJulian Shapiro (16:19):\nThat's the quick context. Now, I'll go into some examples. We started with the example of... Actually one thing that came to mind that I love is Paul Graham, who we mentioned earlier, Paul Graham from YC, has this quote which is \"don't start a startup where you need to go through someone else to get users.\" That always really resonated with me. Here are the categories of product-led acquisition that I've identified. Number one, like I mentioned, is users inviting other users to settle debts.\n\nJulian Shapiro (16:51):\nIf I'm going to pay you money I owe you for splitting dinner on Venmo, or a business expense that I'm paying you, you're my vendor on PayPal, or anything that's allowing me to just pay you money I owe you and I have to use a product to do so, whoever is collecting the money from me is going to make an account on that product if necessary to claim their hard earned money. Almost guaranteed way for you to have user-led growth, product-led growth. Now, it doesn't have to be money. It can be settling a debt of like an NFT, for example.\n\nJulian Shapiro (17:19):\nSomeone buys an NFT from you on OpenSea and the only way for them to receive their NFT, I'm just making this up right now, is to also have an OpenSea account or a wallet that's specific to that collection. Again, making this up. The point is if you're settling the debt of something you owe someone and they must make an account to capture the thing owed, they're going to sign up. That's category one. Category two is when you're inviting someone to join the product you're using to partake in a conversation that the otherwise cannot access. Why does Telegram, WhatsApp, iMessage, all these chat apps, Discord, grow so quickly?\n\nJulian Shapiro (17:58):\nPretty obviously because if you and your little clique of friends are having your conversation in that app, then the person who's also in your real life friend group, but who hasn't yet installed the app has to install the app in order to have the conversation with you. Inviting people to critical, social, or business conversations in an app is the other way that you can nearly guarantee you'll grow very quickly from product-led acquisition. The business version of this is Slack. You sign up for Slack. You invite all your friends or all your coworkers. Then you even invite all your vendors via Slack Connect.\n\nJulian Shapiro (18:34):\nSlack Connect was a brilliant Slack feature where they're saying, \"Hey, we're now going to encourage you to invite people who aren't using Slack who are outside of your work.\" I don't know how that's done for them as a feature, but in theory, it's a brilliant way to expand the surface area for inviting people via product-led acquisition. Just to recap where we are real quick, one of the ways of acquiring customers is to encourage existing users, to pay other people or to encourage them to come into your app to have conversation that's only happening on the app.\n\nJulian Shapiro (19:04):\nIf I'm a product person and I'm road mapping my product, I will think, is there anything in my product conducive to either one of those two functionalities, settling debts, or can I introduce chat within my product? And if so, you might be cracking open an amazing channel. When I tell people about product-led acquisition, I'm usually doing it in the context of let's rethink your product feature roadmap to prioritize features that facilitate these things that can lead to explosive growth. I'll pause if there's anything you want to dive in there, but I have three more categories we could chat about if you want to, three more ways of doing PLA.\n\nLenny (19:44):\nYeah, absolutely. I just want to lob a question over there as you're going through these to maybe touch on this. Most founders would love to find a way to grow through virality and invites and all the things you're talking about. I find that it's often hard to lop onto something they're doing, if it's not a natural fit. As you're going through this, I'd love to know how often have you seen startups succeed adding something like this when their app is not a money exchange app or a chat app? I'm curious how often it works to add something like this when your app's kind of something else, if that makes sense?\n\nJulian Shapiro (20:17):\nWell, the real lesson is don't start a company if you have no idea how it's going to grow. Now, that's not categorically true for all startups. It's irrelevant for deep tech and biotech and climate tech and all that stuff, but for a lot of these people starting SaaS companies where they intend to grow very quickly among B2B customers or B2C. The real point of what I'm saying is if you have three ideas before you as a founder and one of them lends itself to product-led acquisition really beautifully, then lean in that direction perhaps if you think that growth is the key differentiator between them for what's going to lead to success.\n\nJulian Shapiro (20:51):\nIt's like make life easier on yourself. Because if we're relying so heavily on SEO and content, which is extremely saturated, or paid acquisition, meaning ad channels which are extremely saturated, especially if you have low LTVs where we can't really tolerate the volatility of paid CAC or just the cost in general of those CACs, then we have to be thinking more strategically at the product level. It's less about tacking it on later, but sometimes this will work brilliantly if it's very organic. When we cover my next category, we'll actually see some examples of how you can pack it on more seamlessly.\n\nJulian Shapiro (21:24):\nBut the other response to your question, which is a great question, is people mistake product-led acquisition for referral programs, which it is not. Because the referral programs are a tact on incentive trying to give people something to encourage them to invite because they otherwise are not inviting. Whereas PLA, as I've currently defined it, is through the natural use of the product, you get more value when you invite others. You settle your debt with the payment recipient. You get have a better conversation because now your friend Jack is part of the conversation. You don't have to incentivize them with anything artificial, with any rewards.\n\nJulian Shapiro (22:00):\nReferral programs generally are not exciting to me because you're usually trying to... Again, you're like self-selecting for folks who just want the reward very often. And then the people they invite might also just want the dual ended reward and they're not even here for the app really. And then they can bounce. And then they don't invite other people typicall.y. It doesn't have the same compounding sticky retentive nature of PLA. I'm not a fan of it. If you can make a work though, fantastic. Anyway, third category is what I call billboarding. Billboarding is this idea that the use of the product is inherently visible to people around you.\n\nJulian Shapiro (22:40):\nThe product advertises itself. A few examples. Actually, where I got the term from is I was looking at these billboards above the highway in San Francisco, where I was seeing the company that actually hosts the billboards advertise their own logo on the billboard while also showing you whatever ad they were being paid to show. They were using their own surface area to advertise themselves. Another example is when you're seeing an ad network across the web, like Google banner ads perhaps, and it says they're brought to you by Google Ads, they're using their own surface area to advertise themselves.\n\nJulian Shapiro (23:14):\nThat's billboarding. It's a brilliant free way to get a ton more exposure. There's a few ways to do billboarding. One is the classic example of Hotmail and iPhone. When you send an email via Hotmail, at the end, it pens a signature saying sent via Hotmail. Same thing, sent from my iPhone. Every single email sent from an iPhone device, unless you remove that signature, is a free billboard for Apple itself, which further furthers the brand awareness and gets more people buying.\n\nJulian Shapiro (23:45):\nFor example, if you have a feature in your application where people are sending emails or communications to other users outside of the org, like it's an app for sending SMS messages or it's like a way to send invoices to your vendors, when you're facilitating that generated messaging, say brought to you by the name of your startup in the signature of it, really use your own surface area to increase your own awareness. That's billboarding in two different ways. The third way is the very obvious way of having something unmistakably recognizable out in the world.\n\nJulian Shapiro (24:21):\nIf I drive a Tesla, if I wear Nike shoes, if I have Apple AirPods, all of these are immediately visible to everyone around me, which is why sometimes physical products can really explode because they're just free walking billboards all over the world. And then the sort of most topical hot example right now on Twitter is when you switch your Twitter profile to an NFT in a particular collection, you're billboarding for that NFT collection, right? Same phenomenon that occurred with the Bitcoin laser eyes.\n\nLenny (24:50):\nAnd also for Twitter Blue, to be able to even do that.\n\nJulian Shapiro (24:53):\nYes, exactly. Exactly right. Like Telegram right now, they released something like Twitter Blue. I forget, I don't know what it's called. But now when you're a Telegram premium paying user, it has a little star thing next to your name that everyone else sees. \"Wait, what is that? Oh, that's Telegram Pro. Let me take a look at that.\" Last example, which is one of my favorites, is billboarding via the nature of your product being something people are compelled to share in order to use. If I have a Calendly account, I have to share my Calendly link with the world in order to create an event on my calendar.\n\nJulian Shapiro (25:28):\nIf you're like me, you get a million Calendly links every week. That's the phenomenal form of billboarding, people are sharing it willingly. No wonder they've exploded. Same thing with Dropbox sharing file links and you're seeing the Dropbox URL, or GoFundMe, when people share the GoFundMe page. You get the gist. Billboarding costs you nothing, scales infinitely, can have compounding effects. And if your product lends itself to billboarding, it's just a phenomenal way to grow if possible. That's category three, I guess. We'll cover one last one, if you'd like me too, which is basically UGC, so user generated content.\n\nJulian Shapiro (26:05):\nSame sort of thing. Basically I hop on YouTube or TikTok or Insta or whatever. I make content. I share it with the world. In so sharing that content, the platforms brand themselves on the content. At the end of every TikTok video on Twitter that you've ever seen or Insta, at the end it'll say, \"Here's the TikTok user's account.\" They're billboarding themselves into the content that users themselves are generating, and the users are incentivized to share that content off platform, which brings users to the platform, because users want to get customers wherever they can. They're going to cross-sell to their YouTube channel and so on.\n\nJulian Shapiro (26:41):\nIf you have a marketplace like eBay or some marketplace for selling collectible shoes or something where you're encouraging users to create beautiful content of the items being sold, like these cool landing pages that show off the products, and they share it elsewhere, then that's an example of users making content they're sharing off platform that is useful for their own followers. Another example of UGC that people often overlook is Quora or Reddit or Stack Overflow or TripAdvisor, where you're encouraging users to create content in the form of conversation that then surface itself on Google and SEO.\n\nJulian Shapiro (27:23):\nBasically if you just encourage users to have conversations that are publicly indexed, that increases your surface area on Google for hitting more keywords and you get way more search traffic. Basically the question that this boils down to is to leverage UGC in your product, you ask yourself, do users use my product to make content in any way, shape, or form? If so, what type of content that they make should we encourage them to then share? And then how can we make the page that they use to share the content as appealing and as easily to consume as possible? And that's basically UGC. We'll pause there, but basically that's PLA in a nutshell.\n\nJulian Shapiro (28:03):\nThe thing that all of these have in common is you're not spending a dollar. They scale super quickly. You're not reliant on, well, maybe to some extent with SEO, but you're not relying on third party volatility. It's a much healthier narrative for how you're going to grow and scale.\n\nLenny (28:17):\nAwesome. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage.\n\nLenny (28:57):\nEppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic clickthrough metrics, and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments. Eppo supports test on the front end, the backend, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, getE-P-P-O.com, and 10X your experiment velocity. I have many questions I'd love to ask, but I also want to make sure we get to the other topics.\n\nLenny (29:34):\nWe talked about acquisition, which we'll link to in the show notes, by the way, this whole post. The flip side you could say is retention. If you're a reader of my newsletter, you know how much time I spend thinking about retention and how important that is. I know that's a second topic that we wanted to chat about, because you've also helped a lot of companies think through their retention strategies and to help them retain more users. I'm curious to hear what you've found to be the best strategies for retaining users and increasing retention.\n\nJulian Shapiro (30:01):\nYeah, sure. The way I think about retention, my favorite strategy is what I call building state. It's a concept I stole from video games, where basically the more you play any given game, the more state you're accruing. That might be your armor, your weapons, your character skins, and whatever. As a player of the game, the more state you build, the more you're compelled to stick around, because you don't want to lose everything you've worked so hard for. The more state you have, the more you can exploit that state to get more. The rich keep getting richer. The same mental models apply to let's say SaaS retention.\n\nJulian Shapiro (30:38):\nThis is as old as time, or at least as old as modern capitalism. If you think of credit card rewards or frequent flyer programs, you spend money. You accrue points. You convert the points into rewards. Once users build momentum doing that, they're less likely to switch to a competitor. That's the age old example of building state. Software, it's unbelievably powerful. This building state concept is why mediocre companies like eBay or Craigslist remain completely unbeatable for decades. Even though the UX is bad, people don't like using them, they fail to innovate, no one topples them and it's because of state.\n\nJulian Shapiro (31:16):\nLet's walk through some examples. State, kind of like my PLA mega spiel, mega rant there, subdivides into a few categories, but I'll make this one shorter and less boring. The first subcategory of building state is when you're encouraging your users to accrue non-transferrable reputation, meaning they're doing stuff to build reputation on the platform and they cannot take that reputation to them off platform. They're stuck there to get the compounding advantage of that reputation. For example, let's say you've spent years getting 10,000 or more feedback ratings as an eBay seller.\n\nJulian Shapiro (31:56):\nYou are not leaving eBay anytime soon, because that reputation's just too valuable. It's producing a huge boost in revenue because of the trust it engenders with buyers on eBay. It probably results in you ranking better in search results for an eBay query. Because you cannot move those 10,000 feedbacks to an eBay competitor, you're not incentivized to go use an eBay competitor. This type of stickiness, this non-transferrable reputation, basically applies to all marketplaces and directories. Same thing on Yelp. You as a restaurant build your reputation on Yelp. The momentum keeps you stuck there. You want to keep getting reviews and hone your reviews.\n\nJulian Shapiro (32:32):\nAirbnb with your properties, Etsy, for you as a seller, Alibaba, all of this stuff are examples of companies that are kind of old now, cannot be top old or haven't been yet. People are like, why? Well, because of this exact reason. This is why those companies pester you so much to leave reviews and provide feedback all the time. They want you to play into this game of in market reputation building. The second state building technique that a startup could adopt, and again, this is all under the guise of how do we maximize retention and build somewhat of a moat, for example, the second way you can do this is you encourage your users to accrue a non-transferable audience.\n\nJulian Shapiro (33:14):\nIf I'm a big YouTuber and I've acquired a million subs, those subs can't be transferred anywhere else. I can't bring them to Twitter. In fact, YouTube doesn't even tell me their email, so I can't even bring them to a newsletter if I wanted to. The more subs you acquire on YouTube, the easier it is for you to go viral on YouTube. This is what I mean earlier by the rich keep getting richer. It's this momentum trap. It's very, very hard to convince any YouTuber to get off YouTube. If anything, they'll dabble with another network in parallel at best.\n\nJulian Shapiro (33:43):\nBasically if you have a startup where you're creating a marketplace or an audience graph, you want to encourage users to build a follower graph within that product that they can take advantage of by pushing their product or their content or their insights too. This is why Twitter... By the way, a big shout out to Substack, which actually allows customers to export emails off of Substack. Substack is not playing that same game, which is better for users and a very nice thing for the ecosystem. But this is why Twitch and Instagram and Twitter are just irreplaceable. I mean, not necessarily. Everything dies over time like Facebook, but they're just so darn hard to topple.\n\nJulian Shapiro (34:26):\nLet's maybe touch one more. I don't want to ramble so much about this. Well, this one's kind of similar. Basically if you spent a lot of time building a social graph in a product, like if I spent the last 10 years trying to remember the names of all my high school friends and elementary school friends and add them one at a time over the years to Facebook, or I've added all my colleagues for the last 20 years onto LinkedIn and I've built a social graph on these products where I've curated and found people, that's really sticky. You're building state in the form of taking time to expand the graph. The graph is a representative of the state, the work you've put in.\n\nJulian Shapiro (35:04):\nYou don't want to lose those connections with people. That makes that product extra sticky. This is why social networks in general can be sticky. It's not just the fact that you have your audience there, it's that you've invested time. If Facebook doesn't allow you to export your graph out, then that makes it extra sticky as well, because you don't know how else to talk to old Jimmy from elementary other than Facebook. Anyway, there's actually many more of these examples of building state. I'm going to just stop with that. But the basic concept is what can you encourage users to do within your product that makes them more deeper entrenched in the product, and most apps just completely lack this.\n\nLenny (35:39):\nI like that. It's a little bit like the concept of having skin in the game and just building more skin in the game with the product that you're using. One quick question, is there a company that you've seen do this, like add it on, and succeed and increased retention that you've worked with or out there? Just like is there a good example that comes to mind that added this piece?\n\nJulian Shapiro (35:58):\nAgain, none of this is really under the context of telling people to add it on after they've decided what they're building. This is all in the DNA of the product you're choosing to build. I'm not sure. I haven't thought of those examples. I'm thinking more so in whose DNA, which company's DNA are they doing this brilliantly? For example, one form of state is... One I did not cover is when you're embedded infrastructure. If you're Twilio, Striper, AWS, it's really hard to move off or segment because it's so much work to redo your code and introduce all this risk to screwing up your code base. People have built patterns around how they work with your API.\n\nJulian Shapiro (36:36):\nA lot of modern API startups automatically capture the stickiness by virtue of being so deeply embedded into a product. Generally speaking, none of this is in the context of like, hey, add it on post hoc, pretty much.\n\nLenny (36:46):\nGot it. I like that lens actually through a lot of these things you're talking about is maybe it's less like change your product to make this happen, and it's more idea selection. I know you're also an investor, and so it's a really good lens on how many of these things does this company have that I'm investing in.\n\nJulian Shapiro (37:01):\nEarlier I was mentioning why do I write handbooks, I wrote the handbook that PLA and state building come from to cement my diligence criteria for companies I believe might grow super fast and retain customers. You're exactly right. My investor's perspective is if you have a zero cost of acquisition mechanism for customer acquisition, such as PLA, and you can retain them through something like state building, but there are other ways to retain customers, then I lean in harder because I think you'll be more defensible as a company. Actually interesting little side note is you'll often hear retention and stickiness refer to as a moat, right?\n\nJulian Shapiro (37:41):\nBut I find this term actually very misleading because very few companies have actual moats. To have a real moat, you're basically exploiting kleptocratic, meaning you're friends with the government and they're creating a literal barrier to entry for your competitors, or you have a scientific moat where you have an actual scientific breakthrough in the fusion energy space, plus protected by patents. Those are real moats. But the way most people use the word moat is wrong. In practice, your \"moat\" is just your mechanism for retaining users a little bit more than the average company.\n\nJulian Shapiro (38:21):\nI believe state building is one of the best ways to do exactly that. Really it just comes down to what are you doing to help users build state and get more value over time out of the product, not the same level of value over any time period.\n\nLenny (38:35):\nAwesome. Shifting a little bit away from growth and into writing, which I know you've spent a lot of time writing about, very meta, and sharing on Twitter and all the ways, you have a handbook where you go into this concept of novelty and a framework for how to be novel and why that's important in writing. I'd love for you to talk about why novelty is important in writing and ideally share your framework for creating something novel that keeps people engaged in reading.\n\nJulian Shapiro (39:03):\nSure. This actually goes back to your question about Twitter. What can one do to build an audience on Twitter? It often comes down to writing things that are novel. Novel is what powers click bait in most cases. The other way is via curiosity gap, where you raise a question you don't answer, but the other half is novelty is what gets people to click into a thread and read it. Novelty, I define, as new idea, so something I haven't heard of before, that's also significant, so it's not some trivial fact about Kim Kardashian, and it's something that I wouldn't have easily intuited on my own.\n\nJulian Shapiro (39:44):\nWhen you have those ingredients, it's new, it's significant, and you wouldn't have easily thought of it on your own, that's when you trigger that dopamine hit reaction, I'm not being scientifically accurate here, but you're going to get that dopamine hit like, \"Whoa! That's super cool.\" The more you have readers pausing going, \"Whoa! That was interesting,\" the more novel your writing is. My whole approach to writing is write something out, and then point out all the points of novelty. I do that by actually having 20 friends read something I've written and highlight the sentences that made them go, \"Whoa.\"\n\nJulian Shapiro (40:17):\nAnd then I have this visualized map in a given blog post, where are the areas that people go, \"That's really interesting,\" and then I can see all the white space between the interesting parts. I go in and I condense that white space. I chop it down so that the frequency of novelties as high as possible. This is how you get a blog post that just has this phenomenal momentum that gets the read to completion rate to be very high. The question is, what exactly does novelty look like? I've identified about five different categories for it, and this is the backbone of how I write in many cases.\n\nJulian Shapiro (40:51):\nThe first category of novelty is what I call counterintuitive information. You tell people something and they go, \"Oh wow. I never realized that the world worked that way,\" or different categories and you tell people counter-narrative information. That's where people respond, \"Wow. That's not how I was told the world worked.\" Whereas counterintuitive novelty is, \"That's not how I would've thought the world worked,\" counter-narrative novelty is, \"That's not what I've been told. I've been lied to. Now you're telling me the truth.\" That also triggers a dopamine hit. Third category of novelty is just pure shock and awe like, \"That's crazy. I would've never believed that's true.\"\n\nJulian Shapiro (41:30):\nFor example, there's a volcano that's going to erupt the next 15 years that's going to swallow this whole island. Wow, that's shocking. Holy moly. Next category is what a lot of popular Twitter users do is what I call elegant articulation, where you're taking an idea... Naval does this, Naval on Twitter, the founder of AngelList. He'll say something that's a complicated rich thought and boil it down into a very concise sentence. And then the reader goes, \"Wow, that's beautiful. I couldn't have said that any better myself.\"\n\nJulian Shapiro (42:02):\nThat also triggers that dopamine reaction. There's a few more, but the point I want to get at here is all of these are formats for identifying the types of things you could say to get people to go, \"Whoa.\" That's what I think of as novelty.\n\nLenny (42:17):\nSomething I've found to kind of identify something that I've written is going to be interesting is I just read it myself and I feel what I feel when I'm reading it the first time. Often I find that if I'm like, \"Oh wow, this is really good and really exciting,\" I've learned to trust that feeling wherever that comes from. That's just like another way of knowing if your thing is interesting is like, are you excited about it? Are you interested in it as you're reading it? And that fades after you read it like 10 times and kind of edit and edit, but that's just a small tip I've learned, just kind of trust your own gut feeling when you're excited about something that you're writing about.\n\nJulian Shapiro (42:53):\nI agree. And that's why I tell people when you first encounter something that to you is novel, write down with a score, like let's say out a five, zero to five, how novel that thing was to you when you first heard it. You want to remember and capture the degree of novelty, because to your point, Lenny, it's going to become less novel over time. And then if you pull that out of your idea bank for a blog post in two years, it'll like, oh yeah, that will blow people's minds, even it doesn't blow my mind today.\n\nLenny (43:16):\nGood tip.\n\nJulian Shapiro (43:17):\nTo your point, the way you basically get novel ideas is you go live your life and write down every time you come across something that interests or surprises you, or any time you come across something that makes you think, \"Well, that's obviously not true,\" meaning you found something that people say that you know the lie and you're about to tell people the way the world really works. Some examples of novelty... I'm scrolling through Twitter up here. This is a tweet I wrote where I wrote, \"Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults.\" I give zero kudos for reading a hundred books a year, but I give you massive kudos for learning efficiently and making interesting things.\n\nJulian Shapiro (43:59):\nThis tweet is an example of me using novelty. As we read the key novel part, it's where I say, \"Reading many books is the most socially accepted vanity metric for adults.\" That is counter-narrative novelty, because the prevailing narrative is all the smart people I've ever met, they read a ton of books. They always have a book in their hand. They're reading five books a month, blah blah, blah, blah, blah. I'm saying no, that's a vanity metric how many books you read. That's counter-narrative. That gives people a dopamine hit. They lean in. They want to see what my punchline is and that tweet got a lot of engagement.\n\nJulian Shapiro (44:33):\nOne more example. See if you can catch the novelty here. New tweet, \"The world is not run by exceptional people. This is the hidden reason for imposter syndrome. We mistakenly think imposter syndrome is due to low confidence or low anxiety. No. It's caused by not accepting that your new world-class peers aren't that special. It's just discipline.\" The key statement there that has the novelty is the world is not run by exceptional people, and the type of novelty being used there is counterintuitive. Your intuition is the world's run by the best of the best or many of these experts are there for a reason.\n\nJulian Shapiro (45:15):\nI'm saying not in most cases. Anyway, those are some examples of novelty. Of course, these tweets took off largely due to that reason. People love having their eyes opened. They'll reflexively retweet you to agree with your worldview if they feel like you're finally speaking truth, the power, in some sense, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny (45:34):\nWe'll link to those in the show notes. By the way, I love your reading your own tweets voice that you have.\n\nJulian Shapiro (45:40):\nI'm adopting my... Who's the guy from Star Trek who's amazing, who reads the kids?\n\nLenny (45:45):\nOh yeah, LeVar Burton. Reading Rainbow.\n\nJulian Shapiro (45:49):\nThere you go. That's my voice.\n\nLenny (45:50):\nJulian Shapiro, the new LeVar Burton. I know you have to run in not too long from now. We have two more topics. How about I set up both topics and then you kind of talk through as much as you want with each? That sound good?\n\nJulian Shapiro (46:01):\nSure.\n\nLenny (46:01):\nCool. The fourth topic we want to talk about is topic selection, how meta, essentially picking what to write about, and you have a bunch of great advice on what's worth writing about and the framework around that. And then the fifth idea is something you called it the Creativity Faucet, which is essentially how to get more creative. I will turn it over to you to share your thoughts on these topics.\n\nJulian Shapiro (46:22):\nSure, sure. My pleasure. The way I think about topic selection, meaning what is it you should write about for your blog posts, for your newsletter, Twitter, company blog, whatever, books, is you choose topics based on two factors, what would you actually be able to complete so you're not going to give a pathway through and what will actually be high quality. I have a framework for helping you figure out what that is. Basically I believe that your likelihood to follow through on something you start writing is a function of the objective you have with writing that piece and how strong your motivation is for seeing that objective to fruition.\n\nJulian Shapiro (47:00):\nHere's what that looks like more specifically. Anytime that I write something, I'm first trying to identify what is my objective. Here's a few examples of objectives that I'll use before sitting down to write. Number one, I want to open people's eyes to prove the status quo wrong, or two, I want to articulate something that everyone's thinking about, but no one is saying. I want to cut through the noise. Another objective might be, I want to contribute original insights to my own research and experimentation. Hence, some of my handbooks. Another objective is just telling a suspenseful and emotional story that maybe imparts a lesson.\n\nJulian Shapiro (47:34):\nThese are all clear cut objectives that give me a guidepost. I know that I'm done writing a piece if I can read the piece and say, \"I've accomplished that particular objective,\" because people don't know when they're done writing, \"Oh, I petered out here and this seems like a good place for an outro.\" With an objective, you know whether you should actually stop. But then the question is, how do you sustain the motivation to see through an objective? Again, an objective might be something like open people's eyes by proving the status quo wrong. To do all the work necessary to accomplish that, you need a motivation in my opinion.\n\nJulian Shapiro (48:08):\nI'll pair one of those objectives that I've selected with a motivation. Some example motivations are, does writing this piece get something off my chest that I really badly need to get off? Or does it help me solve a nagging unsolved problem that I've been dealing with and this piece is way for me to explore and find the solution? Or is it like me obsessing over a topic that I want others to also geek out about? These are all powerful motivations that I pair with an objective to guarantee my follow through to get done writing the piece.\n\nJulian Shapiro (48:41):\nBy the way, everything I've mentioned in this entire chat with you, the novelty stuff, the topic selection, PLA, state building, everything we've covered, I have tons of examples on Julian.com. That's why I'm not trying to go through every single one.\n\nLenny (48:55):\nYeah, and we'll link to all that.\n\nJulian Shapiro (48:57):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (48:57):\nAwesome.\n\nJulian Shapiro (48:58):\nThe flip side I'll point out is that I think writing quality overall is... Again, these are all me being hand wavy and these are not rules. There's no right way to write, just like there's no right way to paint. These are just frameworks I've developed, that when I use them, I'm more frequently arriving at success as far as I define it. The thing I want to point out though is that very closely tied to everything I'm talking about is my framework or my equation for determining how good any piece of writing is, is novelty times resonance. Writing quality equals novelty times resonance.\n\nJulian Shapiro (49:36):\nNovelty is like we discussed, here are all these things that are giving you dopamine hits where I'm opening your eyes about how the world really works and shocking you and elegantly synthesizing things, times resonance and resonance means I can tell you the most novel thing on the planet. But if I don't wrap it in a way that resonates and really lifts off the page and into your mind and is something you remember, then it's fairly ineffective novelty. It's more like just trivia. It's bland, dry trivia. When you add resonance to the novelty, now it becomes a beautifully written piece. Resonance is a matter of including examples, analogies, metaphors, stories.\n\nJulian Shapiro (50:14):\nReally writing quality is novelty times the storytelling power you have to make the novelty resonate in the back of people's minds. The way that I structure my writing process is draft one, I'm just focused on finding my novelty, just the backbone of what makes anything interesting. And then draft two, I come back and try to increase the resonance by embedding story and analogy and examples. That's basically my process there.\n\nLenny (50:41):\nI like that a lot. Just to add real quick, something I've learned is that if your stuff is really useful, it doesn't have to be written beautifully. A lot of people I think are afraid of writing because they think they have to write really well, like be real good writers. What I've learned is it's okay if you're not like. You just be good enough and you'll get better the more you do it. The most important thing is the content is valuable and interesting, which I think you're describing as novelty. I just want to make sure people don't get scared away and be like, \"Oh my god, I need stories and metaphors and all these beautiful writing.\" Initially you don't is my experience, but it helps in a big way.\n\nJulian Shapiro (51:17):\nI agree. In fact, the biggest criticism of my writing is that it is too dry, it's too novelty focused, and there's a lack of the resonance, but I do that purposely because oftentimes people can over-indulge in resonance and then it really bloats the piece. As a reader myself, I like reading super concise pieces, like reference manuals almost. I'm looking for the length from personal anecdotes, personal stories of people's lives or life lessons they've learned that they want to share with me, or actual fiction. To each their own. You're spot on. Do what you would want to read to me is the golden rule.\n\nLenny (51:52):\nAwesome, and also don't be afraid. Don't feel like the bar's that high if you want to get started.\n\nJulian Shapiro (51:58):\nWhat have been your frameworks for sitting down and knowing that one of your newsletter editions is where you want it to be? And what do you think is the framework justifying that a piece is or explaining why a piece is good?\n\nLenny (52:10):\nThe thing that I always strive for is this needs to be actionable and useful. It's something someone could take and do something with that day versus just a bunch of theory and pontification and philosophy. It's like, oh, here's a thing you can go do today.\n\nJulian Shapiro (52:25):\nThat's kind of my bar is make it very actionable, which I think is specific to the type of newsletter I have, not necessarily broad writing the way you're describing, but that's what I try.\n\nLenny (52:35):\nI love that. I agree with you, my rules of thumb are like it has to be actionable, concise, and novel. I'm not sure if you've seen this as well, but to make something truly actionable, I have to leave them with a cheat sheet. Because if I have all these actionable steps, but they're spread throughout a monster newsletter edition, it's too much mental work to go and make my own cheat sheet out of and have a quick to follow series of steps. I feel like compression is a key part of making something actionable as well.\n\nJulian Shapiro (53:06):\nThere's a book called On Writing Well that taught me a lot about cutting two-thirds of what you've written to get to the core of it. I'm curious, what else are you doing to try to harden each newsletter edition to make sure it's good? Is it just like, hey, this is actionable and we were pretty comprehensive and I checked it past experts? Is that the extent of it, or what are you trying to do to feel like it's fantastic? What's your review process when you pass it by others as well?\n\nLenny (53:30):\nI'm happy to answer that, but I also know you got to run soon. I guess we could touch on... We could just save the fifth topic maybe for a follow up episode is one idea, or we could touch on it.\n\nJulian Shapiro (53:40):\nSure. Up to you. Anything you want, my friend. If you want me to cover the next topic, super happy to. Up to you. Everyone listening right now is like, \"Man, Julian's just been fucking rambling for an hour.\" I realized we were not having a conversation. Now I feel bad because I was so in my momentum of sharing some concepts that I didn't really have a conversation with.\n\nLenny (53:59):\nThis is very normal for this podcast, so do not stress.\n\nJulian Shapiro (54:04):\nAll right. Good. Actually, you should leave this all in here so they know I feel bad. I'm not cutting anything. What was the last topic again? Remind me.\n\nLenny (54:12):\nI was just saying, I think one of the things people really like about this podcast from what I hear often is they like that I'm not talking a lot. They kind of like that I'm letting the guests speak mostly, because a lot of podcast, the guest thinks they know at all, or sorry, the host and they just talk, talk, talk.\n\nJulian Shapiro (54:27):\nOh, got you. The thing is you are brilliant. You're an actual host who is a useful, amazing human being and we want to hear your thoughts.\n\nLenny (54:35):\nWhat was the last topic again?\n\nJulian Shapiro (54:36):\nThe last topic was the Creativity Faucet. We can save that for another talk, or if you want to touch on it, we can do that too.\n\nLenny (54:43):\nSure. Yeah, let's do it.\n\nJulian Shapiro (54:45):\nThe quick version here is that this is an idea that I saw recur across three of the most prolific creators in the world, John Mayer, Ed Sheeran, Neil Gaiman. Ed Sheeran might work with other producers and so on, but the basic thing between the three is they're very independent creators who are constantly making blockbusters in large part on their own. I was curious, what on earth are those three doing that very few other people are doing? Taylor Swift also. One day I actually found the answer, what is their approach to consistently making phenomenal content? The way I found it was interesting.\n\nJulian Shapiro (55:23):\nI was watching a masterclass, like Masterclass.com, with Neil Gaman and he explained his process for writing fiction novels. And then in the same year, I watched the documentary of Ed Sheeran explaining his process for writing songs and they were identical. And then a year later, I came across a YouTube video that I posted on Twitter with John Mayer spinning his process, also identical. I'm like, fuck, there's the answer. They don't have a name for their process, so I just call it the Creativity Faucet. Very quickly, what they do is they visualize their creativity as a backed up pipe of water. The first mile is packed with wastewater, and this wastewater has to be emptied before the clear water behind it can arrive.\n\nJulian Shapiro (56:10):\nBecause your creativity pipe or Creativity Faucet only has one faucet, there's no shortcut to achieving the clarity, the clear water of good ideas, until you first empty the wastewater out. If we apply that to creativity at the beginning of every writing session, write out every bad idea that comes to mind. Instead of being self-critical and resisting these bad ideas, you have to recognize bad ideas is progress. Because once they are emptied out of you, the better ideas begin to arrive. Here's the key part, why do good ideas arrive after the bad ideas are empty? It's because when you've gone through a bunch of bad ideas, your brain, your mind starts reflexively identifying what elements are causing the badness.\n\nJulian Shapiro (56:53):\nThen it becomes way better at avoiding those bad elements and you become way better at pattern matching the novel ideas with way greater intuition. Most creators are resisting their bad ideas. If you sat down, scribbled a few thoughts in a blank document, and just walked away because you weren't struck with gold, then you never actually finished the creative process. There's no way you would've come up with gold. Like Neil and Ed, for example, they know they're not superhuman. What they're doing is in every creative session, they simply have the discipline to allot time no matter how long it takes, it could be an hour, to empty all of the bad ideas.\n\nJulian Shapiro (57:28):\nAnd then they're not worried about whether good ideas will come after the bad ones because they know the following process. You start with a weak imitation. You identify what makes your invitation weak, and then you iterate the imitation until it's finally original. And that is the process you have to just throw yourself into.\n\nLenny (57:46):\nI love that. I feel like I don't do that enough. I feel like when I get to writing, I'm just like, \"Okay, let's make this awesome.\" This is a really good reminder just to get stuff out. It connects to the concept of the shitty first draft. Just write. It'll be bad. And then you edit. You asked me this question, what my process is for writing, and most of it is just refining like a thousand times. I just kind of take a first pass and then I look at it, make it better, look at it, make it better, and just kind of keep editing for days and days and days until it's not bad.\n\nJulian Shapiro (58:15):\nI love that. That's what I've always done, until one day I was like, \"I need a process here.\" Anyway dude, pleasure chatting. You're a gent. Sorry to all the listeners for rambling so much at a high pace. Cut anything you want. You can cut all of that. I don't care. Whatever you find interesting, go with. We're just going to have this final goodbye and that's it.\n\nLenny (58:36):\nThat was very anti-climactic. Cool, man. Where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJulian Shapiro (58:41):\nSure. You can go to Julian.com. It has everything, Twitter, handbooks, all that good stuff. And that's it. I hope you guys find the handbooks useful.\n\nLenny (58:50):\nAmazing, Julian. I know you don't do a lot of podcasts. I really appreciate you being here. This was awesome. I'm excited to get this out.\n\nJulian Shapiro (58:56):\nDude, truly my pleasure. I think you're awesome and you're why I'm doing the podcast. Really my pleasure, man. Have a great day.\n\nLenny (59:02):\nThanks, man. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# From managing people to managing AI: The leadership skills everyone needs now | Julie Zhuo\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nWe're seeing this kind of flattening of orgs. Everyone's becoming an IC again.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:00:04):\nIt used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, but now with AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. We need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles and call ourselves builders. I'd love for us to get to the world where that's the title.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nI also just saw a stat Google let go of so many of their middle managers.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:00:22):\nManagement is still really critical. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. Used to be people, but now it's basically models and different models have different strengths. You have to assemble the Avengers so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nWhat do you feel is the biggest change in the role in life of a manager these days?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:00:43):\nIt's always been manager's job to manage change. I just think the rate of change is accelerating. Today management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible. So I think about this metaphor a lot of the willow tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nYou have such an interesting trajectory from being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:01:05):\nYou want to diagnose with data and treat with design. Data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build. I don't actually think a lot of the fast growing companies are using data well at this point. Traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. These companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes, but what always happens is eventually things stop growing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):\nToday my guest is Julie Zhuo. Julie was my first ever guest on this podcast, which I recorded over three years ago, so this is a very special conversation as I've shared many times before in other places, Julie's newsletter The Looking Glass was the inspiration for my newsletter and basically led to everything that I do now. If you're not familiar with Julie, she was the longtime head of design for the Facebook app used by over three billion people. She's also the author of the best selling and very important book The Making of a Manager. And most recently she started her own company, Sundial, which is an AI parent analyst used by companies like OpenAI Gamma and Character.AI. Julie is one of the most thoughtful and insightful product leaders that I've ever come across and she's also got one of the most interesting perspectives on product building.\n\n(00:02:18):\nHaving worked at a mega large corp like Meta as head of design and now as a founder at a tiny startup that's all about using data to help you make decisions, it's really rare for someone to have this spectrum of experiences. In our conversation, we talk about how learning to be a great manager directly translates to learning how to use AI tools extremely well, which specific skills will become more valuable in the next couple of years, her most valuable and timeless advice for new managers, why she's not hiring product managers at her startup, her simple heuristic for knowing when to use data and when to use intuition in making decisions.

I'm so excited to be here. I've been looking forward to this all week. I love your podcast. I love where you've taken it since our very first conversation and I'm super excited to have a fun and engaging chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:38):\nCan you believe that first episode, the very first episode of this podcast, was over three years ago at this point? Holy shit.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:05:46):\nI'm not sure you had that fire in the background back then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:49):\nSo funny enough, I don't know how many people have noticed this Easter egg that I've stuck with, in that first studio, I was just watching the episode, I had this funny little mirror. I don't know if I had in the first episode with a fireplace that was showing up in that mirror because the mirror was showing something stupid. And so I've just kind of kept this fireplace across every studio I've moved across in my various places.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:06:12):\nI even remember we chatted. Video was kind of a newer thing. You're like, \"We'll record it, but it's really about the audio.\" And now we moved into the video era.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:21):\nSo as you were saying that, I realized my fire was broken, so I just had to turn that on. So we just cut a little piece. Yeah, that fire was my little funny strike for myself and I don't think anyone's ever realized this.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:06:32):\nIt's very cozy. I love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:33):\nThat's the idea. I was actually just looking at the stats. So since that first episode, this podcast has done over 20 million downloads. It's approaching 30 million downloads.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:06:43):\nIt's really incredible. I think it is a testament to just your curiosity and how much you really care about the craft of building great products and sharing that with the world. And I know I listen to your podcast and read your newsletter, my team does. We're constantly sharing things from all of the amazing speakers that you've had, so thank you for doing this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:01):\nMy pleasure. I really appreciate that. So the reason we are chatting again three years later is you're re-releasing your incredible book, The Making of a Manager. I've got it right here. You've sold a bazillion copies. It's been on every list that I've seen. You're releasing the paperback version, you're adding some chapters. I guess first of all, just how do you feel on reflecting back on the success of this book?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:07:24):\nIt honestly went beyond my expectations, so I'm super happy with it. My big motivation to write it was I think largely because I felt if I had to write this thing, I was likely going to become a better manager. And that was actually a huge part of it because thinking about and writing something I've been blogging for a long time. And I know that part of my process is when I really sit down to try and put down everything I feel and write letters to myself, it really helps me. And so that was honestly a huge motivation. I hoped that it would go out there and it would sell some books. I was thinking about that maybe for people who grew up in companies like mine, like Facebook, high-scale Silicon Valley, it might resonate. I couldn't have expected that it would have much wider reach than that and that's been really awesome.\n\n(00:08:11):\nAnd just how many people will tell me things like I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but this book made me realize that, hey, these are very normal feelings. And that's certainly how I felt, just stumbling through and feeling like an imposter for so many years. And so it really is very gratifying to hear that from readers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:29):\nI feel like it's the modern-day high output management. That's the book that's been mentioned most on this podcast and it feels like this is just a modern version. I feel like that book is actually out of date in a lot of ways, so I can see why people are really drawn to it. And this is a great segue to the first area I want to spend some time on, which is it feels like a lot of the skills you learn as a manager translate to being really good with AI and using AI tools really well. And I want to talk through a few trends that I want to get your take on that relate to this general theme. The first is it feels like just everyone is going to become a manager in the near future because of agents being so integrated into our workflows. There's this agentic society that we're coming to and it feels like the same skills of being a manager make you really good working with agents. Just thoughts on that and where you think that's going to go.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:09:20):\nI 100% believe that and agree with that, which is that management is just about, in my mind, having an outcome. So you want to get something done. That's the thing. You have a north star, you have a vision, and you're just trying to figure out how to use the resources that you have to get that thing done. And typically when we talk about management in traditional settings, we talk about the resources being people, and getting the right talent, and making sure that you've got the assemble the Avengers, so you've got the right mix of skills that you need. The second lever is around, okay, what's the purpose? Does everyone know what they're supposed to do with their talents? Do we have a goal? Do we have a purpose? And then the third thing is process, which is how should all of these different people and tools come together?\n\n(00:10:07):\nAnd these are still the fundamentals of working with agentic systems. You still need a goal. You need to be very clear about what the outcome is and you have to understand the strengths of, used to be people, but now it's basically models. And different models have different strengths, so it's like they have different personalities. And so you kind have to get to know it, develop an intuition for it so that you can use the right tools for the right purposes. And I mean, we talk about agents, but we also talk about what are the tools that agents have access to? So you still have to make decisions around that and then there's of course process, which is how you do it. And now I think with better and better models, perhaps the agents get smarter so they can deal with higher and higher levels of figuring out how to do something, but I think it's still very important for us to be able to provide the right context, provide the right high level instruction so that we get what we want.\n\n(00:10:59):\nSo really, it's the same principles and I absolutely agree with you that more and more of us are going to have to double down on these skills to be able to use these tools very effectively.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:09):\nSo along those lines, I have your book right here. You have this list of a manager's job is to build a team that works well together, support members in reaching their career goals and create processes to get work done smoothly and efficiently, which is basically exactly what you just said. Interestingly, that middle bullet is the part you don't have to worry about anymore with agents. You don't have to worry about their career development and progress in [inaudible 00:11:29]\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:11:28):\nThat's true. That's true, though some people do joke that if we don't treat our agents nice, what's going to happen when AGI comes? And maybe it still might benefit us to be kind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:39):\nI'm one of those people that says thank you to the Waymo when I leave and just thanks ChatGPT when I'm in voice mode. Just like, \"Thank you. That was really helpful.\" So along these lines, I know there's a lot of ways to go here, but just in terms of skills that are important to a manager, which do you think are most valuable to develop in working with agents in AI systems? I think about things like clarity, communication. Just what comes to mind when you think about here's the things you want to double down on as you're learning to be manager that will also help you be really good at AI tooling and working with agents?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:12:16):\nThe first is defining the goal and defining the outcome and being really, really crystal clear on what does success look like. If you ask a company to do this, we'll know that this is challenging for humans. I think a lot of times when you talk about why is alignment so difficult at a big company, it often comes down to this question, which is different people may have different pictures of what success looks like. And even if I describe in human words, Lenny, I want to build this product and it's going to be amazing, or this podcast episode, which you asked me, want lots of people to hear it and take away things, that's very general. How do we get even more specific so that we know without question whether we've hit it or not. And this is actually a really, really difficult problem.\n\n(00:13:06):\nIt's a difficult question for us because, again, we tend to think very high level. So figuring out how to boil it down so that an agent can really understand what success and failure looks like is a lot of the game. And I think this also relates to things like, well, that's why we have to write evals and that's why they're so important, because they're helping us understand what is the objective criteria. And these days I work in data and my company is all about trying to automate data analysis. And the forever question goes the whole point of data and the whole point of metrics and KPIs is we're trying to put a little bit more of an objective measure or get as crystal clear as possible about what success looks like. And I think it's really an art more than it is like a science, but that's the first thing. I think if you're really unclear about what success looks like, the prompt, you're probably not going to get the most amazing work. I think that's true for managing teams and it's very much true for managing AIs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:01):\nOkay, so let me actually flip this on you and talk about another trend that we're seeing, which is this kind of flattening of orgs, managers being let go. Everyone's becoming an IC again. I just had the CEO of Airtable on the podcast and his whole shtick was that CEOs have to become ICs again. He's coding more than he's ever coded again and his feeling is you have to know what's possible by being in the weeds in order to figure out what your product should be. I also just saw a stat that Google let go of so many of their middle managers of smaller teams. It's just like this flattening trend. So do we even need managers, I guess is one question in the future, and then just thoughts on how this will play out?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:14:42):\nSo I think the real promise and magic of AI that we're seeing in the workplace is that it leads us to each individual is far more empowered. So it used to be, okay, I don't have the skills to do 10 different jobs, so I need to supplement by hiring people to do these jobs. I need someone who's really good at design, I need someone who's really good at coding, I need someone who's really good at data analysis, and then I'll assemble that team. But now with AI and my companion, it's like, wait a second, AI allows me to do many of those jobs myself. Now, I'm not going to do them at what's called the PhD or the highest 1%, 10% level, but if I was at the zero or 10th percentile, it can certainly get me even today very quickly up to the 60th, 70th in terms of what the state of the art is.\n\n(00:15:34):\nAnd I think that that unlocks so many doors. And so the main thing that I felt so excited about, and this is something I tell my team all the time, is we need to dissolve the boundaries of these traditional roles. So in the past, again, we would have a traditional team, engineers, product manager, designer, researcher, data scientist. And I think now the teams can look more like, well, it's just two people. And they could be any of these traditional disciplines, but the key thing is they can now use AI to help themselves do a lot of the things that the other folks used to be able to do. So in some ways we can drop all of these different role distinctions and call ourselves builders. I think that's sort of the most general purpose way of thinking about what we can all be. We can all be builders. We can all be builders and I'd love for us to get to the world where that's like the title.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):\nThat's funny. That's the term I've been actually using more and more. I used to orient this podcast as a newsletter around product managers and then I started using just product to be a little more broad. And now I'm actually using that term builder and I love that term because it's exactly what you're saying. And this is very much a theme that comes up often in these conversations more and more, just the lines are blurring. I'm curious at your company, how does that look? What are you doing differently? What are you seeing on the ground within your company that maybe would be different from a few years ago?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:17:01):\nSo we have eliminated more roles. For example, we thought we would need a bunch of product managers. It's turned out that actually if you don't have a product manager, I know this might be going against a little bit of the ethos of where Lenny started, but I find that sometimes when you have a designer or a product manager, and let's say I'm an engineer, then when I have a problem, like I need to figure out the product definition, my default will be, well, I've got these people and that's kind of their job description, so I'm just going to delegate that to them. And I think that in doing so, again, we want to be polite, we want to respect everyone's lanes. I think that's a missed opportunity for that, if I'm the engineer, to be like, \"Wait a second, I should probably focus a lot, too.\"I need to understand and have an opinion about what to build or what the user experience is.\n\n(00:17:54):\nAnd so we found that if we actually make teams smaller and we even in the past, pre-AI, just have fewer of these, it allowed everyone to be like, \"Wait, we don't have product manager on the team, so communication's up to me. Figuring out how we get greatest value to users is something that is now strictly in my charter. And so that's why I'm such a big fan of we can make teams smaller and we can eliminate these lines. Sure. Again, I'm not trying to say everyone has to do everything. We still can respect the fact that you might be much better at this particular skill than me, but it's less about the role and it's more about the specific context that we're in.\n\n(00:18:32):\nAnd I find that whenever you have teams and you empower them to be able to take more action on their specific context rather than having these higher level of rules or policies or this is how it's supposed to be, then you get better work. You get faster work and you get happier employees because people feel like they actually can have the power to create the thing that they want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):\nThat's really interesting, just that constraint of not having a PM makes the engineer realize they're not going to wait for someone else to do it. They have to figure it out. The obvious trick there is they have to be good at this. It's a very different job from engineering to be really good at articulating here's the problem we're going to solve, here's why it's important that we're solving, here's how we're going to prioritize everything we're thinking about, here's how we get alignment. Is there something you do differently when you're hiring these engineers, knowing you're going to probably not hire PM? And just that feels really hard to hire for someone that's really good at all these things.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:19:30):\nIt is true and I'm not trying to say again that everyone needs to be good at everything. I don't think that's very realistic. I do think, for example, if we were going to create a team and we're going to have a couple engineers and none of them are very good at thinking through product requirements or what the user angle is, we probably do need to supplement the team with somebody with that skill set. And that might be a designer, or that might be another engineer who's really good at that, or that might be a traditional product manager, or even sometimes a data analyst who's really good at it. So that skill is still important and the team still needs to have that skill, otherwise it's probably not going to produce the best outcome. But I like to think of it as what are the skills that are needed for this and can we now find a couple people?\n\n(00:20:13):\nBut it doesn't mean we just automatically go to that script of need a PM, need a designer, need three engineers, need that. Another example for us is even thinking about front end, back end engineering. And it used to be like some people are front engineers. So if you have a project and it's got some front end, some back end, the shortcut is like I need one of these and one of these and that's how it's going to go. But if you say, look, you're an engineer, you're a builder, this has a little bit of front end, but you know what? You can probably figure that out. Use AI to help you figure it out. Get obviously someone who's a specialist to review the code or to give you some high level guidance on things, but just do it. And ever since we started to implement that as well, we see again a little bit of you have to invest a little bit in the beginning. So people are not as comfortable.\n\n(00:21:01):\nThey have to learn, so initially things take longer, takes a little bit of extra time, versus if you did slot in a front-end specialist and this is a front end project. It probably would've gone a little bit shorter, but in the long run that investment really pays off because now you have a lot more people who are, again, a little more well rounded and can take on many more pieces just on their own. And then in specific scenarios this is super front and heavy. Sure, let's still bring in somebody who is more specialized in that particular skill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):\nI love that you've had the experience of working at a mega large company at Meta and now you're building your own startup that's small and in the middle of this trend of just staying very small and staying really lean and just everyone doing more things. It's so cool that you're experiencing that. So a couple of questions there, just which functions are you seeing most accelerated with all these AI tools? Is it engineering? Is it something else? And then are there tools that have been most helpful to you? Just AI tools for folks who'd be like, \"I should check it out.\" I'm guessing Cursor, but curious if there's anything else.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:22:04):\nYeah, certainly engineering is one that, I mean, most of our company is engineers, so that's the one that we focused on a bunch. I certainly do see more people also prototyping things. We have two designers, but we also see engineers. We have a team that's called product science, which is this interesting blend of you can think about it as like a forward deployed person who has a lot of data analysis background and is kind of playing a customer success role and also kind of playing a product role. And you see them starting to take on building more prototypes or getting into some of the engineering. And so it's really lovely to see that blend of everyone can do a little bit of everything else and we're all encouraging each other. The other thing that recently we've also been trying to do a lot more is just obviously we say, \"Hey, engineer, now you can do analysis.\"\n\n(00:22:59):\nAnd their first thing is like, \"Oh, I don't really know analysis.\" This is where ChatGPT comes in. And it's like traditionally we would say, \"Well, I have to learn that from a human. I have to ask this person and now I'm going to take a bunch of their time because I want them to explain everything to me.\" And in fact, I think these days ChatGPT or these other AI tools are better teachers. I find that we tend to maybe not use them quite as much just for the purposes of accelerating our education or even going through something. Sometimes what I'll do is I'll find a curriculum online. And if you take a course, it'll be like this 12 week curriculum and I'll just feed it into ChatGPT and I'll say, \"Help me customize a program for me using the ways that I like to learn.\"\n\n(00:23:43):\nI am a person who really needs examples. I need a lot of explain like I'm five. Give me an analogy. And I know some other people on my team are like, \"These examples don't make any sense.\" We're different types of learners and so the idea of a tool that personalizes learning for each of us really helps us, I think, accelerate and just learn these skills much faster than before. So yes, the tools are great. We can use Cursor, it helps us, it autocompletes, it writes a bunch of things, but the acceleration of learning I think is another maybe underutilized tool in all of our arsenals just because I know whenever I talk to people, we forget. We don't think that, wait, yes, we could be doing that and just sitting down and probably in 30 minutes or an hour learn so much faster than what we used to be able to do before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:33):\nThat's such an interesting point. There's these tools that are in the just in time, helping you move faster, but you also need to learn how to do something, some foundational lessons. What's an area that your team did that? What did they work on learning?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:24:49):\nSo I'll give you an example. I was just talking to an engineer this morning and he's written a bunch of these algorithms. So one of the things our company does is we're trying to automate data analysis, so one of the things we have to do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question ...\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:25:00):\n... To do is obviously understand the best practices. If there's a type of question, \"Hey, what features are really the ones that people pay for?\" We need to kind of figure out what is the right analysis to do. And so the engineer was saying to me, \"Julie, I feel like I really understand the how. I know the algorithms, I know we do root cause analysis, how we do that. But what I don't really understand is why or when this would be most useful. In what context in a company would this company come up?\" Because he's an engineer, he hasn't done that job of being a PM or an executive that asks these types of questions. And that was like the perfect thing where yeah, traditionally you might've asked someone, but this is more general purpose. There's so much resources in the world on the internet about it. This is like the perfect type of question where if you just talk to ChatGPT, it's probably going to give you a much better answer and allow you to go deeper.\n\n(00:25:55):\nAnd a secondary thing we've been learning too is this idea of, almost like as a... Using ChatGPT it's for to test your learning. So explains a bunch of things. And so what I often like to do is like, \"Okay, I read this, so this...\" I try to explain back what I heard. \"So does this mean... Is that right way to think about it, that this is kind of like this analogy?\" And ChatGPT will critique me. \"Yes, that is right,\" or \"No, you didn't quite get that right. In fact...\" And it always tries to say it nicely. This is a funny part. It'll be like, \"That's close, and then eventually it's like, \"You were completely wrong.\" Just in the style. But it helps so much because it's interactive and so we can really test whether we really understand the concept by trying to retell it back in our own way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:40):\nIt's incredible just how many ways all this AI breakthrough is helping us advance and do more and learn more and become better. I know there's some downsides, but this is incredible. So many ways of getting better and faster. I want to spend a little more time on this data analysis stuff. So again, you have such an interesting trajectory from working at a big company to starting your own small company. From being head of design to now being obsessed with data and analytics. So let me spend a little time there. What do AI companies that have kind of figured out how to use AI for data analysis and data work, doing differently, what are people missing and sleeping on in terms of getting better at working with data? And let me just add this point. It feels like we're almost working through , here's all the blockers to a team moving forward. There's like waiting for the PM to write the PRD and then there's waiting for the data scientists to give you answers analysis. So this is another really cool unblock that every team member will have.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:27:38):\nSo your first question was how are a bunch of AI companies using data? So the funny thing, my funny answer to this is, I don't actually think a lot of the fast-growing companies are using data well at this point. And the main reason why is because traditionally things just didn't grow that fast. And so if you got to a hundred million users, your company has probably been around for a while, and if your company has been around for a while, you've had time to set up things like logging and you've hired a growth team at that point and you've hired a data team and they've done a bunch of work to log an instrument and then transform the data. And we've talked about what is the observability for our business. And you just usually had years to build and develop that, because of the rate of growth.\n\n(00:28:25):\nAnd so today we see companies that are growing insane and there's still about 10 people or two people or however many people, but they've got hundreds of millions in ARR and hundreds of millions of users. And you know what? They don't actually have all of that infrastructure, that logging, to be able to truly do data analysis. So I would say that these companies are totally getting by on just good instincts and good vibes and we see that. You don't really need data analysis to sometimes make something that works. But I think what data helps us do is in my mind it sort of is helping us reflect back what is really reality. And so of course if ARR growing, awesome, great, keep doing what you're doing. But what always happens is eventually things stop growing. Growth does not happen forever. And usually when growth stops, everyone has this question of, \"What's going on? Why did it happen?\".\n\n(00:29:22):\nAnd then you start to be able to see the power of, if you've instrumented everything very well and you have a very good observability model for your business, it's much easier to start to get into the root cause, it's easier to even predict whether growth will slow down at a certain point, it's easier to catch these trends earlier. If you don't have good observability over how your business runs and what the company's key levers are, then you will be scrambling, and at that point, that's usually when people start investing a ton in data. So I wouldn't say that a lot of these hot companies are quite there yet, but what I also think is a trend is that every time there's a new technological shift, we actually have to change the way that we think about... Analysis has to answer the questions that we have, and if technology changes or context changes, we need new methodologies of analysis.\n\n(00:30:16):\nSo for example, when mobile came to the forefront, looking at sessions or sessions per day or time spent on mobile, or length of sessions became something that was important for us to understand, are people getting value in this new medium? I think that's the same with what we have today. Conversational analytics is totally different. Used to be, let's say in the Google world, I knew you were interested in shopping if you click the shopping tab, I know you're interested in maps if you click the maps tab, we can measure clicks. Today it's just all conversation, and so it's actually harder for us to tease apart what is the user intent.\n\n(00:30:55):\nIf I worked on any of these LLM, I would say one of probably the biggest questions is, hey, what use cases are growing or what use cases are shrinking? And that's much harder to tell today because it's not just clicks on tabs or pages. It's like we have to probably use an LLM or a machine learning model to bucket user intent. We probably have to ask questions like, is the flow going really well in conversations? Like, if I just ask one question and I don't go back and forth, did the user get value? It's always trying to get back to, we're trying to figure out if this was a good experience, but now it's like we need to actually invent new methodologies to help us analyze that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:40):\nYeah, I think the question is always like with conversation, do you want it to be a long conversation, do you want it to be a short conversation? What's the right answer, what's better?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:31:47):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:48):\nI had a ChatGPT on the podcast, Nick Turley, and turns out one of the ways they found the most common use cases early on was watching TikTok comments and things going viral on TikTok after they launched. How about that?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:32:01):\nYep, yep\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:02):\nOkay, so I want to come back to this really interesting, unusual path that you took from being a head of design at Facebook, you're an inspiration to so many designers, now you spend your time on a data startup obsessed with data. I don't know, classically designers aren't the biggest fans of experiments and data and making decisions based on data. When you look at designers and you hear designers kind of push back on like, \"No, we don't want to be super data driven, we know better than... We have a sense of what's beautiful and great and intuition,\" all these things, what do you think designers are missing when they feel that and say that when they're afraid of writing experiments and data and kind of want to push that out?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:32:46):\nThere's one phrase that my co-founder and I would always discuss with amongst ourselves very early on in which we shared with a lot of the companies that we work with, which is, what you really want is you want to diagnose with data and treat with design. So data is not a tool that's going to tell you what you should build or what the solution is or how we're going to cure the fact that you don't have really great retention. It's just not. But it can tell you if you have a problem and where that problem or opportunity might be. But you still need to go back and undergo a very creative process to figure out what's the best way to solve that. So that's the first thing I would say, is this framework of, data helps you figure out what's actually happening, what do people like, what are they engaging with, what what not.\n\n(00:33:32):\nIt just gives you a story that better reflects reality. Because again, we all have stories. We're like, \"Oh, my company's amazing, people love us,\" blah, blah. That's the story I want to believe, but reality may be a different picture. And so what data is trying to do is capture reality. And by the way, I don't think of data just as it's an AB test and it's quantitative things we can measure. To me data is also, well, what did people put onto TikTok and which things went viral, and what are they saying in the Twitter verse or X verse I guess is what it's called now.\n\n(00:34:07):\nAnd if you do a customer interview, that's still all data, it's just that that is a little harder to distill and quantify. Although now with AI, we have better tools for synthesizing. So that's all data in my mind and it's just all trying to help us understand what is really happening, what is the phenomenon that's happening in reality and how do we understand it? You still have to go and invent and create and dream, and there's no formula and there's no science that will tell you exactly how you're going to make a hit. You can experiment, which allows you to try more things maybe and more rigorously understand what that does in the short term. It's all very contextualized. A-B tests don't tell you what will happen in the very long run, and again, it's all still data, you still have to synthesize and figure out what to do.\n\n(00:34:57):\nSo that's the thing, I'll say. Diagnose with data and treat with design. The second thing I will usually tell designers about, is I find that sometimes, and maybe it's the, let's call it the false precision of numbers that we kind of fall into, right? Because it's like, okay, we got these numbers and the numbers go up. It's like no, the fact that you still have to choose which things you look at, is an art, not a science. And your interpretation of if the number went up 5%, is that good, is that not good, is also an interpretation and is an art, not a science. It's just that sometimes I think we can give ourselves this feeling, and I get it, sometimes there's this instinct to want to control things and we want everything to be buttoned up, and we want to know that if we did ABC, everything will be great, our career's going to be awesome, our product's going to rocket ship.\n\n(00:35:49):\nAnd I think designers are rightly often pushing back and saying, \"No, the reality is this stuff is ambiguous and there's uncertainty and we can never know for sure.\" And I think all that is quite true. So the other thing I would say that I really support is you just actually can't make a really great product by thinking you can A-B test your way into it. So I fundamentally believe that, but I don't think we should throw the baby out with the bathwater. I think there's actually... You know? It's not either or, it's not like data or design.\n\n(00:36:18):\nIt's like these are just tools for us to use, and I would say every amazing designer that I've ever met is absolutely obsessed with trying to get a better understanding of reality. They want to know what users really think, they want to know what they're really doing. If they could read every user's minds, that's the thing we would all want as a designer is like, if I could just know what everyone is thinking, feeling every time they used it, my life would be a lot easier, because then I would be able to build better and better things. And so that's what it's trying to help us do. It isn't perfect, no metric is going to tell you whatever we hope that it can in terms of the true certainty and precision, but it doesn't mean we can't use it to better our product development.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:03):\nI was going to say exactly what you just said, which is every great designer that I've worked with was obsessed with data in the most leaning into the data, versus designers that are just like, \"Nah, I think I'm good, I have a sense of what's right, and why would we let that tell us what to do?\" And to your point, it's not going to tell you what to do, it'll tell you where opportunities arise. Let me take us back to the management chat and maybe just let me ask something broad. What do you feel is the biggest change in the role and day-to-day work and life of a manager these days with the rise of AI?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:37:34):\nI think that managing change. It's always been manager's job to manage change, and there's always the chaos of what's going on. I just think the rate of change is accelerating, and we've seen that over the last couple of decades. And so I find that there's just a great deal more uncertainty that people have about things, like where is AI going to be in two years from now? I don't know. Who really knows? And so are we going to have AGI in five years? That kind of changes a lot about the landscape. Not to mention, I think there's quite a lot of fear that many organizations are feeling. It's like if my career has always been in design and now these tools are getting better and better at what I'm doing, then holy shit, what happens to my career and my future? And do I need to pivot? Do I need to learn different things?\n\n(00:38:25):\nAnd so it's this change, it's this feeling of uncertainty. And I think a lot of times managers have to deal with that in addition to what you were saying before, which is they also have to learn these new skills, which is managing AI and managing these more powerful tools in their arsenal of trying to get things done. So that is very different, I think, than maybe 10, 20, 30 years ago. And so I think that the skills that become more important are obviously communication, feedback, compassion, but just being able to work with humans and to have them understand that yes, we are in a state of change. I think every leader has to do this now, every startup founder that I know, every CEO, is how do you land this message that things are changing and we need to be very open to change?\n\n(00:39:16):\nIf we go and stick to our old ways, we're probably going to get left behind, our product's going to get left behind, even our way of doing things is going to be left behind. So we need to change. We need to change our product and we need to change the way that we work, as we all talked about in terms of smaller teams, more nimble, blah, blah, blah. But at the same time it's like, how do we do that in a way that doesn't just freak everyone out? And it's like, \"Ah, it's chaos. Everything's changing.\".\n\n(00:39:44):\nSo I think about this metaphor a lot, of the willow tree, which is the willow tree is a very sturdy tree. It can survive a lot of storms, disasters, et cetera, but it's also very flexible. The branches are very, very flexible, and that's in some ways what allows it to be very sturdy. So I think today, management is really about this idea of be sturdy while being flexible, and that is a very hard thing to pull off, but I think that's at least when I even go into... I'm like, \"Be like the willow tree, Julie. Just imagine the willow tree and try and channel that as the kind of feeling of what it is that we're trying to do together.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):\nThis reminds me of a couple things from other guests. I had Marc Benioff on the podcast and I asked him, \"Just how do you deal with all this change? It's like agents now, it was, I don't know, there's AGI coming as you said, just like, \"How do you survive through this?\" And his advice is just, he's like, \"I'm always just like, 'Good. This is great. This is what we want. This is exciting. We have so much opportunity, it's just not boring. We can always reinvent.'\" And he's always embracing with \"This is good.\" And just I'll never forget the way he responded to that.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:40:55):\nI think if you don't think it's good, it's kind of a painful way to live. It'll be very, very difficult over these next. So I do think that all things be equal, lean into it. If you can wake up every day and see it as opportunity and excitement rather than fear, again, they're all flip sides of the same coin, but I think if we can lean more into what could it be, while recognizing that the other side does exist and it's still there. And I think if managers who try to pretend like it isn't there, it's all good, no one's upset, et cetera, there's something also missing about just addressing and being able to be like, yeah, it's hard. Change is hard. We're probably going to get upset. We're going to have some chaos. This is going to happen, but we will work through it because we're going to be flexible and we're going to be able to put our eyes on the big picture of what is possible, which is exciting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:45):\nThere's another quote that and came up as you were talking. I forget who it was exactly, maybe Kevin Wheal, maybe Mike Krieger. They said that this is the most normal things will be, ever. Like, it will only get weirder. And I think giving people that sense of like, okay, just enjoy this normal, because this is going to be only weirder, is we'll at least give people an expectation, real expectations where things might be going.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:42:11):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:11):\nWhat a time to be alive.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:42:12):\nWhat a time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:14):\nOkay, let me zoom out even further and chat about... I want to ask you just outside of AI, management in many ways is unchanged. It's still a lot of the same work, managing people, helping them be successful, producing great work. What are just some of the, I'd say most timeless, most important lessons that you think managers, especially new managers still don't totally understand, need to hear more? What are just some that come to mind? And then we'll see where this goes.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:42:43):\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the importance of managing yourself and understanding yourself. This was chapter five of my book. It's called Managing Yourself. In fact, when I wrote it, I kind of wanted it to be chapter one, and then my publisher was like, \"Well, maybe you should get into some of the tactical...\" People don't necessarily think managing other people or manage a team starts with them, but I really do fundamentally believe this, because I think all of us, of course, like any human being, we have things that we're strong at, we have things that we're weak at. And I am a very big believer that every strength is its own weakness, and every weakness is a strength.\n\n(00:43:18):\nThere's no such thing as you're going to somehow get every dimension to be 100%. In fact, I think one of the most interesting concepts or frameworks for myself, and also even, this is also kind of like a data framework concept, is this concept of dimensionality. So what dimensionality means is you're a human being, but we can kind of look at you in infinite dimensions. There is, for example, how good is Lenny at throwing an ax? That's one dimension\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:49):\nPretty good.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:43:51):\nHow good is Lenny at being a podcast moderator? Fantastic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:56):\nSo-so. Okay, thank you.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:43:58):\nHow good is Lenny at doing a zero to one type of project in the AI space? Right? So again, just can think about these as infinite dimensions. And the reality is each of our profiles is very unique, it's like a fingerprint. So for you it's like these are all these areas that you're really great at, much better, like in the top 1%. And then there's some areas where in the top 10%, then there's some areas where you're kind of average, and then there's some dimensions in which you're worse than average compared to other people. And that's just true for all of us. And what I like about that is therefore if you take that as the model, you realize that none of these dimensions are you entirely. So I can make a comment like \"Lenny, your ax throwing really could use some improvement.\"\n\n(00:44:48):\nAnd ideally you're not like, \"Julie is saying I'm a bad person, my identity is at risk,\" right? Because it's just one dimension of who you are. But what happens sometimes is that we can get very attached to certain dimensions because we start to think that that's who we are. And I think managers can do that, and clearly individuals on their teams. And when that happens, it starts to get very difficult to have, I think more objective conversations about, okay, what can you get better at? What can get worse at? And so I say all this because I think this framework for me at least, and many people that I've talked to, has helped them realize that somebody can give you feedback or you can be maybe not great at certain dimensions, you can have room to improve, and that's not who you are because you are all of these infinite dimensions in one, and none of them is representative of your true worth as an individual.\n\n(00:45:42):\nI'm a big believer that we are all beautiful and worthy, and sure we have all of these skills and we want to improve those skills, but it does not speak to whether we are worthy or not by saying whether we are strong or weak in these skills. And so I think if you can take that and really internalize that, then you can look at yourself a little bit more objectively as a manager, and you can realize that there are areas where you're going to be really strong, there are areas where you have biases, and often they are one and the same. So I'll give an example. People have often told me, I would get this in my performance reviews from managers in the past, like, \"Hey Julie, you're really thoughtful. So when you think about something, you have a way to think about it, you've clearly thought about it in depth and you've got these frameworks and all this. That's a great thing.\". And then on the flip side, I'll get feedback like, \"Well, Julie, you don't really say a lot in a dynamic discussion. You're kind of quiet and you don't really think that quickly on your feet.\" And what you realize is these are kind of, again two... Because I don't do that and I'm not just off the cuff, that's what allows me to oftentimes be very, very thoughtful, or at least, okay, when I was younger, it's very clear that that particular weakness also very much is speaking to a particular strength, which is I am the kind of person that doesn't always have a snap judgment. I have to really think about it and internalize it and sometimes get to how I feel, and then I can share it and present it in the world.\n\n(00:47:18):\nAnd so just knowing that about me is supremely helpful. Now doesn't mean of course that I can never get better at this thing, but what I often think about is mastery is where we realize that both of these we can get better at, and what we want to do is just figure out in the context, what makes sense to be. So I got this feedback and I'm like, \"Cool, one of the things I need to work on, is figuring out how to be more open in person, how to speak a little bit more clearly in person, maybe say things like, 'I don't know exactly how I feel about it yet, but this is what I'm thinking right now,'\" if there's still clear tactics that will allow me to be a more effective team member and to do a better job in the context of what I'm trying to do with my team.\n\n(00:48:04):\nSo I've tried to build those skills, but the meta skill is now being able to step back and say, okay, in certain context it is really important that we move fast and we are decisive and we just do something. And even if it's not perfect, we just kind of have to do it. And if I struggle with that, I should realize that that's an area to improve upon. But there are other contexts in which the right thing to do is actually to take a step back and be very thoughtful and to not rush into decisions.\n\n(00:48:31):\nAnd that's so what I want to get to is not like let's reject this strength or this weakness, but just know that that's where we come from, that naturally, we might be wired in a particular way. Our growth often looks like getting better at doing the opposite, but not rejecting again the thing that we're good at, but rather over time getting to this balance where we can read the context and the situation and know, \"Should I lean a little more thoughtful or is this a time where I need to try and be a little more decisive and just share what's on my mind right now?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:04):\nI love this advice that things that we are incredible at and have a downside, and oftentimes the feedback we're getting is something we're not great at, there's a good version of that that people appreciate. And I was going to ask you, and I think you answered most of this, but just when you got this feedback of, \"Hey Julie, you're not speaking enough in these meetings, you're not contributing quickly enough,\" it sounds like, so one option is just like, \"Okay, cool, that's me, that's how I am, and I'm just going to solve the problem this other way and then just not going to change anything.\" What I heard you say is, find opportunities where you want to actually change that behavior, even though it doesn't come naturally in specific situations where things are moving fast. I guess just how far do you recommend people push themselves in things they're not great at, versus leaning further into their strength, let's say?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:49:54):\nOo, I think that's a really great question. So the way I think about it is it's very dependent on what is your goal. So for example, let's say that you are...\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:50:00):\n... on what is your goal? So for example, let's say that you are... Let's even take, for example, ICs versus managers. I think often about the pathway of an IC, an individual contributor, as wanting to deepen a craft. You love this thing and you just want to get better and better and better at this very specific skill or this craft, right? So think about in our dimension, infinite... It's like you pick a couple dimensions, \"I just want these to be... I want to be the top 0.01%,\" and that's kind of the pathway of extending it as an IC. Now, if that's your high level goal and you're like, \"I want to be able...\" Let's say your high level goal is, \"I want to be able to do this 10 hours a day because I love it and I want to be able to support myself doing it, meaning I get paid and I have a great job, and I want to have a bunch of impact in the world by doing this thing.\"\n\n(00:50:53):\nSo again, you still have goals. Then you have to see, okay, \"Does my strategy of just deepening these things, is there a pathway to reach my goals according to that?\"\n\n(00:51:03):\nAnd if there is, awesome. Then if someone's like, \"Hey, do you want to be a manager?\"\n\n(00:51:06):\nYou're like, \"Nope, don't need to because these are my goals and this pathway actually allows me to do that.\"\n\n(00:51:13):\nBut if somehow you get to a point where the skill you really want to perfect is not something that may be commercially viable in the world, that's going to somehow allow you to buy the big mansion that you want to buy to support your family, then I think you have to ask yourself, \"Okay, so if I just do this, it's not going to cut it. I might actually need to learn some of these other skills in order to be able to fulfill the job that is going to be valuable enough that people are going to pay me a bunch of money at this certain level so that I can afford my mansion.\"\n\n(00:51:43):\nSo I just think it has to go back to, what are your goals? And there are cases in which yes, it'll support your goal to do this and to deepen your craft. And there are cases in which it won't. And I think it's important, it's a very individual question for each person. But what I often think suffering is, is when these things are not aligned. So what you want is the giant mansion and all of that, but you're like, \"But I also just want to spend on my time perfecting my egg omelet.\"\n\n(00:52:12):\nAnd then, you're just in this tension place, and it's very hard to feel satisfied and fulfilled because you're a little bit like, \"Oh, why doesn't the world value my deep egg omelet skills?\"\n\n(00:52:26):\nYou can [inaudible 00:52:27] egg omelet, you should maybe not do this thing. Or if you want this thing, you may actually need to be better at just egg omelets. Perhaps you need to expand your repertoire of cuisines, and go and build a Michelin star restaurant or something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:39):\nThis is really good advice. It's not just definitely always work on your weaknesses or don't worry about them, it's if you need to do this thing to achieve this goal that you have, make sure you understand what your goal is. And then is this thing a thing you need to work on? For example, [inaudible 00:52:52] become a VP, you probably need to be really good in big important meetings, and being on the spot, and just not waiting until everything's over and then sharing an email of all your thoughts.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:53:01):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:02):\nYeah. For me, I actually went through a period where I was like, \"I do not want to get promoted. I'm so happy in this very specific role, just leave me alone.\" And that path is very different from the skills I need to build to be a manager. And then things changed and then, okay, now these are the things I need to work on.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:53:17):\nYeah. I love that you knew that about yourself, because I think it's so easy for a young person to go into their career and everyone is telling them, maybe their whole family has been telling them, \"You need to level up, you need to get paid more. You need to get that manager title. You need to get a VP.\"\n\n(00:53:33):\nAnd at a certain point, I think sometimes people opt into this without knowing what they're actually signing up for. What are the trade-offs? And is that really what you want to do? Does that really align with your passions? And of course, sometimes we have to... Again, it's a compromise for us, but we get to design. We get to design what are goals and what's the right pathway. And I go back to, usually when people are unhappy, it's because these things are a little bit out of sync. They want this big thing, but they're not actually excited about what it takes to do that thing, and therefore it's just going to be a mismatch.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:09):\nAnd along those lines it sounds like, oh, sure, I can design my life and design my role. But what I find is if you at least first of all know what you'd love and ideally do, and then at least mention that to your manager, it often is a lot more possible than you think.\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:54:26):\nA hundred percent. I think it's so important to be... We often also have this mental model like, \"Oh, our managers are our judge, and they're going to judge me on whether or not I did well, I should get a promotion, I should be fired.\"\n\n(00:54:39):\nSo there's this sometimes fear that people have, but I think in the very best relationships, the manager is like a guide. It's like, look, the manager has a job, and if you understand your manager's job, which is how to get better outcomes from the team, and also you understand what exactly would your manager consider success for the team, it also makes it easier for you to then be like, \"Oh, well if I do this project, then that clearly seems like it's a very direct path to creating value for the team. And that also is a kind of project that suits my skills. It's something I'm excited about.\" You should suggest that to your manager.\n\n(00:55:16):\nBut the other is true, right? So you would know that if you actually asked your manager, \"What is your job and what do you consider success to be, and what is your greatest hopes and dreams?\"\n\n(00:55:25):\nAnd then you might be able to help your own career and yourself because you would know that context. And conversely, if you say, \"Hey, manager, these are my hopes and dreams. This is what I think I'm good at. I really want to get better at this skill. I really want to get that VP promotion, but I don't know what it entails. Can you tell me, what does it take?\"\n\n(00:55:45):\nThat's a really wonderful conversation as well because then you'll get all of that context, and then you can actually decide whether you want to do it or not. And if you want to, then ask your manager for help, \"Okay, if you see opportunities that are going to help me become a better presenter or increase my communication, please tell me.\" Even better, \"If you have feedback for me about communication, I want to hear it, because that's what's going to help me grow in this particular skill.\"\n\n(00:56:11):\nAnd so, it becomes this collaborative relationship much more so than this almost adversarial, like I'm trying to get you to give me a promotion, and you're trying to get me to work harder. That is not a very good vibe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:28):\nIt reminds me of a guest post by Ethan Evans that I'll link to that has a really good framework for how to actually do exactly what you're talking about called, The Magic Loop, where it's kind of a framework for figuring out what to work on and how to help your manager see you're capable of stuff and earn that trust.\n\n(00:56:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog, the product platform your engineers actually want to use.

Is there anything else that you think is really important, really interesting, valuable?\n\nJulie Zhuo (00:57:59):\nFeedback is one of the other topics that I am super, duper passionate about. And my general impression for both myself, everyone I've worked with, is that we don't value feedback enough or we don't think about it enough. Again, companies have these performance cycles, and so we're all like, yes, every six months we're going to go and do these reviews. That's when I'll get feedback. But feedback really, in my mind, ideally, should be a daily practice. Because the thing that matters for us in the long run as a team is how quickly are we getting better? So a team that just gets 1% better every week compared to a team that gets 1% better a month, even if they start off at a much lower baseline, is going to outperform in a very short amount of time the team that doesn't get better.\n\n(00:58:50):\nAnd so, what is the best tool for us to get better? It is feedback. And what I think about in feedback, it's very similar to what we said earlier about data metrics. It's essentially trying to put your hypotheses and test them against reality. So as an example, maybe I have this perception right now that I am a positive and engaging speaker. So, I have this sense that I'm smiling and I'm very engaging, and I'm telling great stories, but is that really true? I don't know. The reality is that I'm often biased, and we know these psychological effects where sometimes the Dunning-Kruger effect, people think they're way more expert at something than they actually are. You ask people, \"Hey, are you a better than average driver?\"\n\n(00:59:35):\nAnd it's like 70 or 80% of people, \"Yes, I'm better than average.\"\n\n(00:59:38):\nHow could that possibly be? We have biases. And imposter syndrome is a bias on the other side, it's like me feeling, \"Oh, I suck. I don't actually belong here.\" Whereas, that also is a bias. It may not actually be true. In fact, I might very well be here and other people value my contribution.\n\n(00:59:56):\nSo we are just wildly out of sync a lot of times in our perceptions of ourselves, our strengths, our weaknesses, what's going on. And the way that we're going to understand and truly get better is we need other people to reflect back what is actually their truth. And the way I think about it is like, I'm going to ask you for feedback after this podcast episode and you're going to tell me something. And what you're going to do is you're going to give me a gift. Because it'll be a gift of reflecting something back of what you see that I can't see. Just like if I have a leaf in the back of my head, I can't see that. And so if you're telling me, \"Hey, Julie, you have a leaf.\"\n\n(01:00:33):\n\"Oh, wow, thank you.\" Okay, maybe I can get rid of the leaf or whatnot. But that is what feedback is. It is essentially reflection back. It helps us calibrate to reality, and it allows me to get this information about whether or not I'm moving in the direction of my goals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:50):\nI love that. I completely agree. The challenge for most people, as you know, is giving feedback that people receive and don't feel defensive about, and then receiving feedback and not being like, \"Oh, no, they don't know. They don't know anything. How dare they say this about me?\"\n\n(01:01:06):\nCould you give us maybe a tip or two for delivering feedback well and for receiving feedback well? And maybe even just seeking, how do you get more feedback? This all makes a lot of sense. Most of the time people don't get any feedback.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:01:18):\nThe best way... The first tip on getting feedback or delivering hard feedback is first go and actually establish that our relationship is one in which we value each other's contribution, we want to help each other grow, and therefore we're going to be the kind of people that want to give feedback to each other every week. So when you first start working with someone, don't wait until something bad has happened [inaudible 01:01:42] given feedback, because that's already a pressurized situation. Start by saying, \"Hey, really excited to work with you. I feel like our best collaboration is I want you to help me get better. I think I'm good at this stuff. I'm not so good at this stuff. What about you? Okay, you think you're good at this stuff? How about we just work together and we just help each other get better at these things? And the way we're going to do that is, all feedback is open. I want you to tell me everything. Ideally, you're going to then say, 'Yeah, I want you to tell me everything.'\" And we've already established that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):\nAnd this is colleagues or manager or all colleagues?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:02:13):\nIt's like everyone. It's like people you're dating, it's like your children. It can be with everyone, just establishing what kind of relationship do we want to have? I think most people want to opt into a relationship where you can be close, you can be tight with one another. You can say things to one another and not have to hide behind... I think most people will opt into it, and if you opt into it, everything gets easier down the road. So the first thing is get everyone to opt in that this is the kind of relationship that we want to have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:41):\nOne trickle throughout that I've heard that worked really well along these same lines is asking people, \"Do you prefer feedback in the moment or do you prefer it kind of every month or every week or something like that?\"\n\n(01:02:53):\nAnd everyone's like, \"No, no in the moment and just tell me as soon as something happens.\"\n\n(01:02:57):\nAnd then that gives you that freedom to just, \" Okay, yeah, let me give you feedback here.\"\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:03:09):\nSo if you get people to opt in, \"Yes, I want us to have a great relationship. I want us to help each other get better. I want feedback.\" That's 60% of the hard part of delivering difficult feedback later on.\n\n(01:03:13):\nThen the second tactic I will say is that when you actually give the feedback, it helps a lot. First, you have to check, \"Am I actually giving this feedback because it's in the spirit of trying to help one another?\" And if the answer is yes, then we've moved from 60% to 80%, it's going to go well.\n\n(01:03:37):\nBut what can often happen is something happens. You do something, it triggers me, because I don't know, I had a bad experience about that type of thing before. And so, I'm kind of feeling mad and I want to be right. If my real rationale for why I want to give you feedback is I want to validate myself, I want to be right, I want to tell you you're wrong, I want to punish you, it's not going to go well. It's just already there. There's no way you can deliver it, unless you're a tremendous actor. It's just not going to go well. So you have to first check your intention.\n\n(01:04:16):\nBut if you've done that, you're like, \"No, no, no. I thought about it. I'm calm now. I'm not seeing red. I really think that Lenny is just not aware that when he says this, it makes me and other people feel left out,\" or whatever it is, right? Then I need to be able to give it to you.\n\n(01:04:33):\nAnd so usually then if you're like, \"Okay, now I might be nervous because I don't want to offend you. I really value our relationship. How am I going to tell you. I don't want you to get defensive?\"\n\n(01:04:44):\nThen the third tactic is, just say that out loud. If I sit down with you and I say, \"Lenny, I'm so nervous right now. I want to give you some feedback and I'm really worried that it's going to impact our relationship, and I so value our relationship and I don't want that to happen. But I also feel like it's just going to help you to hear it if you can.\"\n\n(01:05:06):\nThat does so much of the work of... It's humanizing. You're going to realize that I'm going out on the limb, I'm being really vulnerable, and likely you're going to hear that so much more than if I just find a way to drop it, just lobby it over because it's so difficult. Just actually lean into the fact that it is difficult and expose that because that builds a lot of human connection.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):\nThis is amazing advice. Very tactical. Okay, is there anything else? So we've talked about a bunch of timeless pieces of manager wisdom, things that people need to hear, especially as new managers. Is there anything else that you think is really important that you think people are just not fully grokking for being great managers?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:05:53):\nI think the idea of win-win, I think about that all the time in my mind. And I go back to it, because I think that often we have the story in our heads that sometimes things are adversarial. As a manager, I'm trying to get people to be more productive, so I'm trying to get them to do a thing that maybe they don't want to do. I'm going to try and get them to work harder or I'm going to somehow put more pressure on them. If you start thinking like that, that's not a win-win way to be thinking, right? That's like you saying, \"My getting better outcomes has to come at the expense of somebody else losing something.\"\n\n(01:06:33):\nAnd I think if you start thinking like that, it's very difficult to come up with a strategy or to truly be successful. But if you say, \"Look, actually, my job is to figure out how to create win-wins.\" So I actually don't want somebody over the long run to feel like what I've done is just create a ton of pressure for them and now they're super burnt out, real quick, because that's not good for our team, that's not good for me, that's not good for our long-term relationship. How do we find the solution that can be a win-win? And I think if you think like that, a lot of things get easier. So for example, with new managers, I think this is true for me, too, the first time I had to tell someone that they shouldn't be a part of this team was extremely fraught for me. And the main reason was because I'm putting myself in their shoes, and I'm imagining that this is truly horrible, and I've just done a huge disservice to this person, and that's the most awful thing.\n\n(01:07:32):\nBut there's another way to look at it, which is, hey, if there's persons on the team, they probably want to be successful. They want to do great work, they want to be valued, they want to grow their career. If this is not the place for them, because it doesn't align with their true interests and the things that are going to help them be successful is just not the thing that they either want to do or can do at this point, it doesn't do that person any good for me to somehow try to continue to make it. It's actually going to be miserable. I'm going back to prolonging that misery state.\n\n(01:08:06):\nAnd so, sometimes a win-win thing is to just say, \"Look, it's not working, and I respect and value you so much that I know you want to do something that you can be proud of and you can grow in, and that's going to be really valued. And right here, what we got, this isn't it.\"\n\n(01:08:22):\nThat's like a win-win way of looking at the situation, not a like, \"Oh, my firing them is just definitely going to be a horrible...\"\n\n(01:08:31):\nI'm not trying to say it's not going to be hard, obviously it's hard, but it's in the mentality and the mental model I think makes all the difference. Because it's going to be different in the way that I convey it to them. It's going to be different and why this actually in the grander scheme of things may be great, and it's going to reduce this adversarial feeling where they're now going to see me as an enemy or somebody with all this power who's making choices that impact them and they feel powerless. It has to be a collaboration. And I think if it's not win-win... And I could be wrong. I would say I don't think it's right. The person could actually say, \"No, you're wrong.\" And that would actually be great information, because then maybe we can go back and we can find a way to make it win-win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):\nYeah, I was just going to say, they have to believe this. You can't just make it sound like this, \"Here's the win you're getting let go. It's a huge win for you.\" But in reality, the way you phrased it, it is actually almost always true, \"This is just not a place that you'll be happy and succeed at, and it's better you go do something else.\"\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:09:27):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:28):\nOkay. I'm going to keep fishing in this pool to see what else we got, but when we run out, let me know. Is there anything else that you think people should know, should hear, especially new managers that they're still not fully getting?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:09:41):\nI think being aware of your own energy and conviction is really, really important. So a lot of these themes, as you can see, go back to, you have to first understand this about yourself and have the right mindset, and when you do, it becomes much easier to be able to be impactful with other people. So this is another one. I think it's very difficult for managers to be able... We talked a lot about the three pillars of what are the major tools of a manager. The first is people. And so, we talked a lot about the importance of dimensionality and feedback and helping reflect and grow people.\n\n(01:10:21):\nI think the second one is around purpose. Purpose is like, \"What are we here to do? What's our North Star?\"\n\n(01:10:28):\nAnd I think it's very hard to actually convey that if you don't have conviction yourself. And so watching your conviction is really important, particularly since a lot of people who are managers, you often start out not as the founder of the CEO of the company, but you might be a middle manager. So in some ways, you didn't create the vision, but you are in some ways expected to execute it or take a piece of it and do it. And I find that sometimes what new managers don't pay attention to enough is what is their true belief. They feel like they might have to be a soldier, so they just get orders and they have to execute it. But it really makes a difference if they themselves have gone through the work of thinking through, \"Wait, why are we doing this? Do I believe this strategy? Does it make sense or not?\"\n\n(01:11:18):\nAnd if it doesn't make sense, to go and actually have the conversation with their manager or whoever else, just so they can get to alignment on, \"I really believe in what I'm doing.\"\n\n(01:11:29):\nBecause if you don't really believe in what you're doing or you're just parroting the thing that got passed through the organization, it's very hard for you to then be able to help other people see what that magic is or to be actually really effective as a person who can hold that vision and that purpose. So I just think you have to really check in with yourself on like, \"Wait, I know we're told to do this and this is what we have to do, but how do we really feel about it?\"\n\n(01:11:56):\nBecause if you don't feel good about it, then it's not going to be very likely that the project's going to succeed. I can tell you right now, every single manager I've ever managed where they're like, \"I don't really think this is a good idea,\" there's no case where I can think of where the project somehow turned out to be wildly successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:13):\nThis is such a classic challenge of managers, is getting things done that you don't really agree with. And I can't help but ask you for advice on someone that isn't in that place of just, \"Okay, we have this feature our CEO's prioritizing. This is not a good idea, but I need to have a brave face and not make it sound like I'm just being told what to do and I'm just reporting orders. I don't believe in this.\" You don't want to do that. You become a terrible unsuccessful manager and people lose trust in you. What's your advice to folks that are in that place of just how to find that balance?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:12:44):\nSo I think, first, if you feel that way, you got to actually find a way to get it out and engage in dialogue. So if you're like, \"My manager told me to do this, I think it's a terrible idea,\" you've got to talk to your manager about it or you've got to talk to the CEO or whoever and feel... Because once you engage in a dialogue, what will often happen is you'll learn more, you'll have new information, you'll have new assumptions, and maybe you'll have influenced a project in some manner. But often, the more you can learn about, \"Okay, why did some other smart people feel like we should do this? And what parts of it do I believe and what parts am I more skeptical about?\"\n\n(01:13:20):\nYou can probably decompose it from a blanket it's good or bad to like, \"Okay, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis, this is a hypothesis. I might kind of believe this one. The reason I don't like the proposal, I don't believe this particular hypothesis, but I believe these other ones.\"\n\n(01:13:36):\nAnd so, when you can start to get one level deeper into breaking it down into a set of assumptions, that makes it much easier, because then likely find something that you do kind of resonate with. And you might be able to then steer things like, \"Okay, if that hypothesis doesn't... I believe in disagree and commit, but now we can be very specific. We can isolate the thing that...\"\n\n(01:13:59):\nAnd what we can also often do is like, \"Okay, the reason I didn't like this proposal is because I believe that this assumption is wrong.\"\n\n(01:14:07):\nI'm going to come up with a really stupid example. But your suggestion is, \"I know we have a great idea. We're going to go and put a lemonade stand on every block. And my core assumption is people do not like lemonade. That's not the hot beverage right now. And so therefore, I think this is a stupid plan.\"\n\n(01:14:25):\nBut if I talk to you about it and you're like, \"No, no, this is the core assumption we disagree on.\"\n\n(01:14:29):\nLikely what starts to unfold is like, \"Well, can we get some data? Can we get some information? Is there a quicker way to validate whether people like lemonade? Perhaps we should just test it in one market before we go and open up the lemonade stands across the entire 50 states.\"\n\n(01:14:45):\nAnd so what happens is we can likely get to the actual specific area and come up with something. And then, if I have to now share with my team, We're going to try this hypothesis. I'm not sure how I feel about it, but I actually do think... I don't know for sure and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it.\"\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:15:00):\nFor sure, and our CEO seems to think this is... But we're just going to test it, and we're going to do the test in a way where... That's what we want to find out, is do 18 to 25-year-olds love lemonade if we put them on these neighborhood college campuses? It becomes very specific and everyone's like, \"Well, yeah, I don't know for sure, but I'm happy to go in, and test that, and commit to it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:24):\nThis is such a good advice, and there's also, you could layer on, \"Here's the things I do agree with and believe. Here's the ways that I see this as totally right. Here's the piece that I'm not so sure about, but that's why we're going to run this test, and here's why it's the smallest version of this test and why it's a great idea just to figure it out.\" We'll show them. You probably don't want to say that. As you give this answer, it's so interesting, I almost want to do a whole new episode with you later of just common conundrums managers have, challenges that every manager runs into that are really difficult to figure out on the spot. We could save that for the future. Okay, I'm going to take us to a couple of recurring themes on this podcast, occasional recurring that every episode corners that we take guests to.\n\n(01:16:07):\nThe first is I want to take us to AI corner. What I like to do in AI corner is ask, what's a way that you've figured out to use AI in your work or your life that's just really interesting, really useful?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:16:19):\nWell, I already shared a lot about education and learning, but I'll share maybe a more fun story. It's my kid's birthdays. One of them just passed. My middle son's birthday is in two weeks and my daughter's birthday is in a month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:32):\nBy the way, the birthday just passed. The kid didn't pass.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:16:34):\nOkay. Yes, the birthday passed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:35):\n[inaudible 01:16:35].\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:16:35):\nThat's right, that's right. The birthday passed, my kid's birthday. One of my goals this year was to try and build them something, so give them a present that has me going back to being the IC and making something for them. AI makes this really fun, and so just from my youngest son who was six years old, this is an idea that I stole from Eric Antonow, if you know Eric. Have you had him on your podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:59):\nI haven't, I am trying to. He actually sent me the... What is it? The-\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:16:59):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):\nWhat is it called? The metha-\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:17:06):\nMethaphone?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):\nMethaphone.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:17:06):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:06):\nMethaphone, check this out.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:17:08):\nYeah, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\nIt's like instead of holding the phone in your pocket, you hold this thing, and then you walk around with it and everyone's like, \"What the hell is that?\" Methaphone.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:17:16):\nYeah. I, too, am the proud owner of a methaphone and the next version upgrades with the little stickers, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:23):\nNo, I don't have that one yet.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:17:24):\n... Eric is great. You should definitely have him on your... He's such a creative character. One time, I saw him with a parrot on his shoulder, and I was like, \"Why do you have a parrot on your shoulder?\"\n\n(01:17:35):\nHe's like, \"Well, you can talk to my parrot. It's a talking parrot,\" and then I spoke to the parrot and the parrot spoke back to me. What had happened is that he had hooked up a microphone, he surgically went into the parrot and added a microphone, a speaker, and connected it to voice mode on ChatGPT so that... It spoken I think like a pirate voice.\n\n(01:17:55):\nI was like, \"This is the best idea.\" My six-year-old son is really into raccoons. He has a huge amount of raccoon stuffies. I was like, \"I want a raccoon that can talk to him,\" so I made that using the Eric Antonow method, but it was great. It was a huge hit. Now, my middle son's birthday's coming up, and he is really into parody. He loves video games, so Minecraft, but what he often listens to on his Alexa are these parody songs. It'll be like Justin Bieber's hit or Gangnam Style, but they've changed the lyrics so it becomes a video game parody of some video game that he's playing, and they're horribly sung. They're like off-tune, it's just like some person who produced it. I was like, \"Well, if he doesn't seem to mind off-key singing, I'm going to create him an album of video game parody songs, and I'm going to create an...\"\n\n(01:18:47):\nI created an app on Replit, and what it does is you just give it a song. This is Justin Bieber's Baby and you link to a Spotify song, and I give him some context like, \"Oh, Locke likes playing Kingdom Rush right now. We have an inside joke about the gargoyles being free money.\" Whatever it is, I just give it a bunch of context. I'm like, \"Write me a song that just personalizes it and it's a parody of this particular video game.\" It writes me the lyrics. It's pretty good at doing this. It's pretty high quality. Again, it does it according to the beats of the music, and then I just sing it and record it, and then I got myself a song, so I'm creating an album of this, which I'm going to give to him. He's not going to hear this podcast, so no one spoil it to him. I think this is going to go publish after his birthday, but I'm very excited about this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:34):\nWait, so you're going to be the one singing the song?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:19:37):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:37):\nI thought you were going to use Suna or some AI thing to actually sing it.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:19:40):\nNo, I think I'm going to sing it myself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:41):\nWow.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:19:43):\nAll of this made it so easy. All I have to do is just record. Again, I'm not a very good singer, but it doesn't turn him off to hear off-key singing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:54):\nYeah. Wow, that is so beautiful. This gave me so many ideas for gifts I can give to kids in my life, and I just love how AI is making it, I don't know, easier to be a parent and, in some ways, more delightful. These are awesome examples. Okay, I'm going to take us to a different corner, contrarian corner. What's something that you believe that most other people don't, people would disagree with?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:20:20):\nI believe that there's infinity in every direction. That makes me pretty contrarian on pretty much everything that anyone says. If someone says something like on Twitter, I sometimes play this game with myself, which is in what context would that actually not be true? I think the reality is that the world is so, or at least my reality and my understanding of the reality, is that the world is just infinitely complex. For example, if my kids say something like going outside is boring, or taking a walk is boring, or doing something is boring, my general response will be, \"Well, it's because you're not seeing the infinity that's in that direction.\"\n\n(01:21:05):\nEven, for example, something really mundane like staring at a blank wall, I think that you can make that actually deeply, deeply interesting, because you can use that as an opportunity to go into your own mind and to figure out how you can make time pass, or you can meditate on the existence or meditate on your breath, or just be grateful for the purpose of being alive. Two people, one person you can say, \"Sit in front of a wall for an hour,\" and, like my kid, they will super complain and be like, \"This is the worst thing ever,\" but you can put somebody else like a monk and they'll have a wonderful experience. It's not really about the environment or the wall. It's really about how we see it and whether we can find the thing that is deep, and rich, and infinite in that direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):\nWow, these are some deep answers. This is very, I don't know, Buddhist, very mindfulness-oriented. I did a retreat once and their advice was just anytime you're bored, just notice all the things that are going on around you. What does your seat feel like right now? What does the air feel like? What are you hearing right now? It's exactly what you're saying, there's infinite things to pay attention to and keep you interested. It's hard.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:21:56):\nIt's hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:21):\nHard to actually do that for a long time and practice. That's why it's a practice.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:22:24):\nThat's why it's a practice. But I repeat that to myself, because oftentimes, if I have a bad experience feeling a certain way, it helps me to realize that it's often probably in my head. It's because I haven't gained the skills to be able to see the richness and infinity in that... I can maybe work on that. That feels better than feeling like, \"Oh, I'm a victim of my circumstances. This thing happened to me,\" and that's so awful but not powerless, I can't do anything about it. That, to me, is a worse feeling than the alternative, which is I just don't have the skill yet. I can recognize it for what it is. I don't have the skill yet, but I can grow. I can maybe get better at it. There is a person out there who had the same situation as me and feels much more positively than I do, and don't I want to be more like that person?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:15):\nIt's such a beautiful circle back to our very first episode, which a lot of it was on imposter syndrome and overcoming that and your story there, so I love that that's maybe a way to close this conversation. But before we do that and before we get to our very exciting lightning ground, is there anything else that you wanted to mention, or share, or double down on that we've talked about?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:23:35):\nI just want to say thank you. Honestly, I'm so inspired by the work that you do. I know we've known each other for quite a while, and I just think from the very first idea that you had for this newsletter, for the podcast, has been incredible, and I think the world gets so much from it. I'm sure you hear that a lot, but I am very grateful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:52):\nWell, I really appreciate that, and I say this every time we do a chat, is just this wouldn't have been possible without you, Julie. I was inspired by your longtime newsletter, The Looking Glass. Essentially, my idea was what if I do this for product? I started on Medium just like you did, and then I moved to Substack, and then it's like, \"What if I charge for this?\" That worked, and then I'm like, \"What if I do a podcast?\" and then that worked. But it all began with your concept, so thank you, Julie.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:24:22):\nYeah. I think you do it with so much kindness and curiosity as you always have, so I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:27):\nThat's just who I am. Well, with that, we have reached our very exciting lighting round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:24:34):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:24:39):\nThe first is Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I absolutely love that book. It's beautifully written. It's so deep. My whole philosophy around quality is beautifully... A lot of it comes from that book, the idea and even all the stuff that we talked about change. What does it mean to be at that forefront of change and dynamic quality? I think he just talks about so beautifully and so masterfully in that book. Old classic, but I try to reread it every few years or so. Second is Conscious Business. It is my favorite management book. It's a little bit of a sleeper head because I actually end up recommending this one far more than my own book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:23):\nOh, wow.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:25:24):\nI read this one after I wrote my book, and I always tell people that if I read it before, I'm not sure I would've written my book, because I would've been like, \"Conscious Business is really the book that really, really so much resonates.\" Many of the things I talked about, this idea of win-win, idea of being a player, not a victim, and how to think about work, not just it's a job but how do you really think about aligning it with your own personal values and what you want to do in the world, I think that this book really speaks to that so beautifully. It is also very tactical. It's got a lot of really wonderful examples. I will tell people, the cover isn't very attractive, and I think that if you judge a book by its cover, this seems very corporate-y. The title also seems like, \"What conscious business?\" and the first chapter is a little bit more technical. But if you just get past it and get into chapter two and you start with examples of the soccer team, it's just the best management book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:23):\nThat is good advice to get people over the hump when they look for it. They're like, \"Okay, okay, I'm going to stick with it.\"\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:26:28):\nYes. Okay, third book. I love the book Good Inside by Dr. Becky. It's a parenting book and it's a very wildly popular parenting book, so I really recommend it to all parents, but I also think it's just a wonderful book for thinking about relationships, because parenting is that. It's like a very, very deep and intense relationship and interaction that you have with another human being, and there's so many things that I read in parenting books, including Good Inside by Dr. Becky, that I think could just as well been a management or a team leadership book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:03):\nI am thinking about trying to ask Dr. Becky to come on the podcast. I feel like there could be a lot of synergy exactly for that reason. She uses this term sturdy, which inspired maybe your bullet tree process.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:27:16):\nOh, yeah, I probably got it... I think she talks a lot about sturdiness and that just incepted right in here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:20):\nYes. Yeah. Her whole thing is being a sturdy parent. Strong but flexible, I imagine. Yeah. I love her and I love her stuff. I watch all her videos on TikTok and Emily Oster. Okay, next question. Is there a movie or TV show you recently enjoyed?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:27:36):\nI have not watched anything. I have no good answer for you. I think the only thing I watched this year was a rewatch of La La Land, which I do truly love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):\nSo delightful. Okay. Is there a product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:27:49):\nI don't think there's anything too new. I love Granola, I love Replit. I've used all of the different coding lamps. Cursor is big on me for now. I just got a Matic Robot. I think that's been really delightful so far, at least the setup. I haven't used it long, long term, but it's the setup, the way that it worked. The fact that it had little stickers and you could make it into a dog or a cat was a wonderful experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:17):\nThe Matic Robot, willing to it, I am also a huge fan. I'm not an investor that's... Essentially, Waymo meets Roomba. For folks that don't anything about it, it's like a very sophisticated robot vacuum built by AI vision people.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:28:32):\nOh, I just thought of one more as well, the Limitless Pendant. Disclaimer, I am a small investor in Limitless, but what I love about it is that... Okay. It's a pendant, you wear it, and it just records everything that's going on, and later it summarizes things and it gives you feedback. I don't usually wear it out because I find that maybe other people feel awkward that I'm recording everything, I usually try and get people's permission, but I do wear it at home when I'm with my kids, and one of the best things that the pendant does is it gives me feedback on parenting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:04):\nWhat? Automatically or run into ChatGPT?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:29:08):\nNo, automatically. There's an app and it will sometimes notify me, or if I check it, it'll... Or I can also engage with Ask It, but what it does is essentially... It's like Granola, but for your life in terms of capturing everything, summarizing it, and then giving you tips and feedback. It's said things like, \"Hey, there was that time you were talking about the game and you cut your kid off a lot. Maybe next time, think about letting them speak fully and listening better.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:34):\nThe app itself natively does that?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:29:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:37):\nI did not know that, because I have one. I haven't used it much recently. That is incredible. I wonder if it gives you relationship advice too if you're talking to your partner. I wonder how it even knows.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:29:46):\nYeah. It did a pretty good job of inferring. I think I said person two, but it was kind of eye-opening for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:57):\nIncredible. There's a recent episode of our How I AI podcast, our sister podcast, where somebody wears that in their meetings with their CEO and automatically turns what they're asking for into a prototype from the meeting notes, and then sales teams can start showing it to people to see if they're interested. How about that?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:30:19):\nThat's awesome. That is super cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:20):\nHoly moly. [inaudible 01:30:22], what is even happening? Okay, I'll keep going. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself repeating to yourself, sharing with others?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:30:30):\nI like make it happen. Just a reminder that, at the end of the day, we could have a lot of motion. Maybe this is another one that I really like. I think about this poster. It used to be a poster at Facebook that says \"don't mistake Motion for progress\". There's this idea of be the change We want to be in the world, I guess is other ways of saying the same thing, which is I can do things. We can all do things. We have better and better tools to go out there and make things happen. Make it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:59):\nThe common meme on Twitter, you can just do things.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:31:02):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:03):\nFinal question. I like to ask this question to folks that are really deep in AI, and been working with AI, and getting a sense of where things are going. Is there something that you teach your kids or teaching your kids, think about encouraging them to learn, knowing that AI is going to be a big part of their life?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:31:20):\nEmotional regulation is still really, really, really important. That's probably the thing that I think about the most in terms of what I want my kids to learn. I want my kids to be able to introspect, to have a better understanding of where their state of mind is, because we're still human. We still have the same hardware that humans have had for thousands of years, and that's not changing even as the tools and the environment around us change, and so I feel that you have to really understand yourself and you have to understand what's going on for you and where you are biased and where you're not, because AI can make it... This is my great fear, is that it makes things so much more comfortable. I have this great fear that this has been the trajectory that we've been on with technology. This is, again, going back to every strength is a weakness.\n\n(01:32:05):\nTechnology makes things a lot easier. That's why we invent, that's why we create. Human race has always been about trying to better our circumstances and, in some ways, control our destiny, control our future. But at the same time, all of that control gets to a point where we have so many shortcuts in our lives and you can shortcut a lot of things. You can shortcut relationships, you can shortcut hard feelings, because now you can just watch TikTok instead of actually dealing with a very difficult emotion or tension that you had with a colleague, or with your partner, or with your children. AI makes it even, I think, more attractive, because now there's a person or there's a thing that can be very, very personalized, and if you're like, \"Oh, I want a distraction, I want to do something,\" you got that.\n\n(01:32:51):\nBut how do we actually still learn to sit with what is our true biology that's not changing, and how do we continue to be the kind of people that want to take on the freedom of doing challenging things? Because I find that if we don't do challenging things, we suffer. We suffer in a different way, and so, to me, true freedom is you can pick the things that are hard and you can feel pride in becoming the thing that you want to be. It's not forced upon you. It's not for survival's sake anymore, but you still have to pick. I want to figure out for my children the fact that it is really important to still find the challenge. Yes, you can use AI to do that, but really, don't think about it as a shortcut tool, because if that's the case, I don't actually think that they're going to be able to become the kind of people they want to be in the world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:41):\nWhat a beautiful way to end this conversation. Julie, it feels like this is just some kind of huge milestone of this podcast. Just like having you back three years later, it's like, I don't know, a chapter in the journey. I appreciate you coming back. I appreciate you sharing all this wisdom with us. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe chat about maybe Sundial, maybe whatever else you're up to, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:34:06):\nWell, I would love to work with people who are at companies building really cool things and want better answers to how we build better, and so if you think your company would be interested in working with us at Sundial and figuring out how do we make every single decision maker into their own expert analyst, please reach out. That's one area, sundial@sundial.so. I am on X, so I've been tweeting a lot more, sharing thoughts. Going back to that skill of practicing, just share what's on your mind.\n\n(01:34:40):\nBut for the long form stuff, I have my blog, The Looking Glass. It's on Substack. I share articles and thoughts about AI, product building, leadership periodically, and then, of course, I have my book, the revised edition with two additional chapters. One is around managing remotely and the other one is around managing in a downturn or managing in difficult change scenarios. That will be coming out in two weeks' time. The new content will be in the paperback. That's important. I'll send you a version of this when I get a copy myself, Lenny-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:15):\nSweet.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:35:16):\n... but the paperback has a gradient type of cover. The hardback will eventually get the new content, but it just takes a while to phase out from all of the different retailers, so if you buy one, I cannot guarantee that it's going to have the new content. But certainly, the Kindle and the paperback will have all of the new content.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:33):\nJust for the publish day, because this might come out later, what's the date that's coming up just for folks?\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:35:37):\nSeptember 9th.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:40):\nOkay, amazing. I think it'll be out by the time this is out, so go buy it. I imagine available on Amazon, all your local retailers.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:35:46):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:47):\nAmazing. Julie, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:35:49):\nThank you so much, Lenny. This was so fun. I hope to be back in another three years or whatever the next chapter is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:56):\nHopefully sooner. Bye, everyone.\n\nJulie Zhuo (01:35:58):\nBye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:00):\nThank you so much for listening.
