And if you haven't, you're in for a treat. Jackie is behind two of the most important books in the PM cannon, Cracking the PM Interview and Cracking the PM Career. And she's also one of the smartest people I know on the essential skill of product strategy in our chat. We go deep into all the ways that you can become better at developing your own product strategy, including what is strategy, what makes a good and bad strategy and how to very tactically put together a strategy. We also chat about what she's learned going from the first PM at Asana to head of product at Asana, plus a ton of tactical advice on getting to senior PM and then to manager PMs. A big thank you to Jackie for sharing her wisdom with us.\n\n(00:51):\nThis episode is brought to you by flat file.

We've done a bunch of fire set chats over the years in various events, and you've always been really generous with your time. I just want to say thank you for joining me. And I'm really excited to chat again.\n\nJackie Bavaro (03:01):\nYeah. I'm so excited to chat with you. I'm so excited that you're doing a podcast and I'm glad I get to be one of the early people on it.\n\nLenny (03:08):\nAbsolutely. It's my honor. Okay. You are a famous PM in the world of product management. You rode Cracking the PM Interview, Cracking the PM Career, both of which I own and love. And fun fact, my sister was just interviewing as a PM and she used your book and found it, really helpful. So thank you for that.\n\nJackie Bavaro (03:08):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (03:26):\nYeah. And then also you've written a bunch of classic PM post on Medium that I reference often share with people. And also you were the first PM at Asana ended up being the head of product management at Asana. And that's actually where I left to start. Could you just share how you got into product very early on and then how you worked your way up to the head of product management at Asana?\n\nJackie Bavaro (03:47):\nYeah. I was just really lucky in finding product management. I went to Cornell, studied computer science and economics, and I'd never heard of the job. One of my friends who'd been a PM intern the summer before I was like, \"Jackie, you have to apply for this internship.\" And I said, \"I'm sophomore. I can't be a manager.\" And they're like, \"No, you manage the product, not the people and just go apply.\" I applied having no idea at all what the job was. Through the interviews, I tried to figure it out. I loved the interview questions. I thought they were a lot of fun and got the job, became an intern on Microsoft SharePoint services and stayed with the team. Loved that team. Went there full time. When I moved to New York, that I started to think about changing companies.\n\n(04:29):\nMicrosoft didn't have any product management in New York. So I applied to Google and I was like, \"Yes, I'm a good product manager. I'm sure I'll get this job.\" And I got rejected. And I was shocked. I really had thought that I would pass the interview. A year later I applied again and that's when I got into the Google APM program. And of course at the time I thought this was one of the biggest mistakes in my whole career. But looking back, it certainly is what gave me the impetus to write these books and say, \"You know what? Even good PMs don't know how to answer these questions. There's a lot we can do to help.\" And beyond that also then when I be joined Google, I very quickly got sent into being an interviewer. And immediately I noticed there was this real difference in how people would answer the questions.\n\n(05:08):\nAnd some people didn't seem to understand what the question was trying to get at. And some people sounded really good because they'd say, \"Well, I'll tell you three things. Number one, number two, number three.\" And then when I paid attention to my notes, I'd be like, \"Wait, their three ideas weren't actually good ideas. They just sounded like they knew what they were doing.\" Those really drove me to want to share more about how to do well in these interviews.\n\n(05:28):\nAnd at the same time, I constantly had people saying, \"Jackie, my friend's applying to Google,. Can you talk to them?\" And I was like, \"Sure, of course. I'll like tell them what we're looking for.\" And I'll help them understand the interview process. And after doing this three times, I was like, wait a second, \"If it's only my friends of a friend who are people who work at Stanford and are already very privileged and I'm telling them how to pass these interviews, that's not fair.\"\n\n(05:51):\nIf I'm willing to tell it to a friend of a friend, I have to be willing to put that out on the internet and share that with everyone, because we really want to level the playing field that we don't want to make things more unfair.\n\n(05:59):\nWhile I was at Google, one day, I get an email from a friend, from an engineer I'd worked with at Microsoft. And he's like, \"Hey, you want to grab coffee?\" And I was like, \"Oh, cool, sure. I'll be friendly.\" And at the time I did not realize that that's how all these recruiting chats start. I honestly did not realize that this was like, \"I'm being recruited.\" I thought it was like, let's just catch up. But I said, \"Yes.\" And then he told me about this company and he is like, \"Hey, it's like, imagine if SharePoint was really fast.\" And I was like, \"Oh.\" I love SharePoint, and I would love to work on a fast version of that. And that's how I ended up moving over and becoming the first product manager at Asana and achieve.\n\nLenny (06:32):\nThere's so many things I want to pull on in what you just shared there. On the book, an interesting point you made is that you wrote the book because it was something you were struggling with and then you saw a lot of other people struggling with it. And I find that that's often the case. When you look at books, people have written or posts, it's just like, \"Oh, I had this question and this a way for me to get better at it by forcing myself to write about it.\" Is that basically what happened?\n\nJackie Bavaro (06:53):\nYeah. I had this belief that almost anybody can learn anything. People have different interests, not everybody wants to learn everything. But I find that if you're having trouble learning something, it's just because something's not clicking. There's just something that you're misunderstanding or that other people see that you're not seeing. And if people could just describe it in the way that matched YOUR mental model, then you could learn it.\n\n(07:13):\nThat's how I feel about this interviewing. Is that the reason that some people don't do as well as they could on interviews is just because a lot of these interview questions are trick questions. When they say, \"Oh, how would you design a bathroom?\" I used to think that meant, \"What do you want in a bathroom?\" And that's not what it means at all. It means \"Who is the best customer for a bathroom? What would they want?\" But if you haven't been trained in this, you wouldn't know.\n\nLenny (07:34):\nWe're definitely going to talk about interviewing and career and come back to these topics. But going back to Asana, you look at this journey that you took and it sounds amazing and it went great, and someone that's starting out, they may feel like, \"Man, how am I ever going to not make any mistakes along my journey and get to a place like Jackie ended up?\" A question is just, is there a mistake or some wrong journey took along this journey that you can share?\n\nJackie Bavaro (07:58):\nYeah, I'm sure I've made lots of mistakes. One of the ones that comes to mind is that in probably my first or second year at Asana, I very much saw the PM's role is a person who wants to say no to everybody. I was like, \"All these people want us to do stuff and we would do way too much and we would never get anything important done if we just said yes to them. I need to say no to people.\" And I got into this defensive mindset and sometimes people would come to me with ideas and I'd be like, \"Are you telling me I can't do my job right?\" And I would just try to say no to them as efficiently and effectively as possible.\n\n(08:28):\nAnd I did this one day to my boss and he had some idea for design that I thought was a bad idea. And I was just like, \"No, we're not going to do that.\" And he's like, \"Jackie, you have to stop shutting me down.\" And I was like, \"I'm about to get fired.\" I was like, \"Oh, I have really, really messed up here.\" It definitely made an impression on me and I was lucky enough to have a coach at the time. I went to her to talked to her and really started to rethink how I saw the role, this urgency that I felt of \"I need to shut people down as fast as possible to the save time,\" as opposed to take the time to consider that other people probably have good ideas.\n\n(09:03):\nAnd even if their solution, isn't what I think is going to be the absolute best solution, the problem they're talking about is probably real. And I can interpret their solution as a way of sharing the problem and exploring and brainstorming around that.\n\n(09:17):\nIt wasn't an immediate change, but I remember at one point she challenged me to, \"For the next two weeks, say yes to everything.\" And I was like, \"I can't do that. I wouldn't be doing my job.\" And she's like, \"I think you can find a way to do your job and still say yes to people. You can say, 'yes, I agree. That is a real problem. Yes. I think we could test this design with users' and just see what's different with two weeks of saying yes to people instead of no.\" And I realized that this protectiveness and lockdownness that I had really wasn't something I needed and it wasn't something that was serving me because it meant that I couldn't have real collaboration with the other people around me.\n\nLenny (09:51):\nWow. I love that story. A little thread I want to pull on there, two questions. How far into your time at Asana did this happen? Because it's surprising how often things like that come up really late in a career and you're like, \"Oh, shit. This is a fundamental thing that I imagined isn't maybe as true as I thought in changing course there.\" Maybe let me ask that question, how far into your career was that?\n\nJackie Bavaro (10:10):\nThis was probably pretty early. I'm imagining what room it was in and I'm like, \"Okay. I know what that time was.\" It was definitely the first year, maybe six months in.\n\nLenny (10:17):\nOkay. Okay. Cool. Okay. So you have this coach, what impact have you seen from just having a coach? Something that a lot of PMs ask me about is just like, \"Should I get a coach? How do I find a coach?\" I guess just roughly your experience been with a coach and then any advice for folks thinking about getting a coach.\n\nJackie Bavaro (10:31):\nThere's two different models. Some people like to have a coach all the time and that's a person that they can go to and they can explore their ideas and their feelings and how they're just bounce ideas off of all the time, have this person who isn't in any way going to be the person who evaluates them later on. They can be totally honest with them.\n\n(10:48):\nFor me, I find it's better to have a coach when I have a specific thing I want to work on. I tend to be a little bit results oriented, action oriented, and I don't like to show up and be like, \"So, what are we talking about today?\" Or make something up. I talked to this coach to deal with this issue of how do I not shut people down and how do I still be a good PM if I'm not saying no to people all the time.\n\n(11:10):\nI worked with her for several months, but then once that was gone, then I did start to find that personally I would make things bigger when I had a coach, because I had something that I knew how to solve on my own. And I'd bring it to the coach, and then all of a sudden it felt like it was a big deal rather than a little deal. I've gone in and out of coaching, but I do it when I have a thing that I want to work on.\n\nLenny (11:27):\nGoing back to Asana, you were there for eight years about, what kept you there for that long and then how did you know that it was time to move on?\n\nJackie Bavaro (11:35):\nI loved working at Asana. And Asana, I think today is incredibly successful, but it was not always obvious that it was going to be incredibly successful. We had some lulls in there. There was a time when we were updating our entire engineering framework from an old version to a new version. And we had like a literal 50% of our engineers working on this. Set aside half of our engineers to work on new features, and the other half was just working on updating this framework. Which meant that we felt like we were moving at half speed. It felt like we were moving really slowly. Customers hated how slow the app was and this framework changed was needed to change that. But we really were not sure that the company was going to be successful.\n\n(12:14):\nStaying with the company through those days, it really was this feeling that I was getting good growth opportunities, even if the company itself didn't succeed. One of the things I think was really important for me in my career at Asana and growing into head of product management is, at one point in my career, my manager, one of the co-founders had a meeting with the two co-founders, the planning committee. The planning committee was the two co-founders, the head of engineering and the head of business. And they would meet.\n\n(12:39):\nAnd after these meetings, he would come back to me, my boss, and he'd tell me \"Okay, here's the direction we have. Here's what you're going to need to do.\" And I had to ask some questions and I'd be like, \"Well, what about this? And what about this?\" After a little bit of time, I would start to be like, \"Hey, you have your planning committee today. Here are the three questions I want you to go in and get answered at that committee. And if they say this, I want you to ask this and this.\"\n\n(13:01):\nAnd after a little bit of that, I was like, \"It might be easier if I just go, I might be able save you some time and some energy if I just joined you.\" And it was a way that I took myself into this higher level meeting, framing it as something that was going to help out my boss. And it did. It wasn't dishonest, but it was a pretty effective way of advocating to get into this meeting.\n\n(13:19):\nI think once I was in the planning committee, I just got a real front row seat to understand how a company is built and what kind of decisions are happening, and what goes on beyond the realm, the narrow perspective of building features. Going from features to strategy, but also understanding business strategy and how do the product choices we make impact our financial plans, and whether or not marketing has to hire people, and whether or not that means we need to open our office.\n\n(13:49):\nI really felt like I was getting a lot of personal growth and I was getting an opportunity to learn things that I wouldn't have that opportunity anywhere else. Because of my background and my deep knowledge of this product, that I was able to be exposed to this and have these responsibilities.\n\n(14:06):\nFor me, I really felt like I was learning and I was growing and I didn't know it all yet. That's really kept me there for a long time. And then I'd say, getting closer to the end of that time, I'd become a manager, I had teams, I've become a manager of managers and I was definitely starting to get burned out. It's really, really tough being a manager. One of the ways that I'd always worked as a product manager is a lot of transparency and authenticity. A lot of explaining to people what our goals are and then showing like \"This is the solution I think will hit in our goals, but I'm open to other solutions.\"\n\n(14:38):\nAs a manager, there are times when my goal is backfill for someone I know is quitting in a few weeks, but I can't tell anyone about it. Or there are all these personal secrets that you have to keep for people as a manager. And there are times where, what the person on IT wants is a promotion to make more money, and haven't necessarily earned it yet. And it's not necessarily the right thing to do from a company perspective.\n\n(15:01):\nThose places where you're torn between these two goals or what I want, isn't always perfectly aligned with what's best for the people that report to me, that weighed a lot on me. That was very heavy.\n\n(15:12):\nI was like, \"Okay, maybe I could use a break.\" But for a while I felt like, \"Okay, but I don't want to just leave the company and things be in bad shape.\" So we worked on hiring lots of really, really stellar people, just really talented people and growing people in their roles. And got to a point where I was like, \"Everybody's doing great. They don't need me. They can do fine without me.\" And I thought about, I just felt this surge of energy thinking, \"Yeah. If I left that, I'd be excited for what's next,\" and then started to have this idea of writing the book on careers. That's how I knew it was time to leave.\n\nLenny (15:44):\nIt was also eight years, so it makes a lot of sense that eventually it gets tiring. And then I love the glimpse you shared into the downsides of being a leader in product. Is there anything more you can add there? Just like, people want to be the head of everything and then they get there and they're like, \"Shit. This isn't what I wanted to be doing.\"\n\nJackie Bavaro (16:01):\nDefinitely. Tooth directions I would say. One is just that being a manager is not as much fun as being an IC. It's a lonely job. When your team goes out for drinks, they treat you differently when you're the manager than when you're one of the other ICs. It's more painful and less fun. For all these reasons, you might not want to be a manager. At the same time, I'm like, \"Well, what could I have told younger Jackie, to be like, maybe you don't want to be a manager,\" and there's nothing. There's nothing you could have told me that would've convinced me not to be a manager. I might say that if you want to try it, consider it a two way door, consider a time that you can try for a while, and if you don't like it, a lot of people are now playing with going back to IC. And also to understand the career paths.\n\n(16:44):\nWhen I started as a product manager, I had no idea what salaries people made, none at all. And I knew I wanted to be able to support a family and stuff when I grew up. So I assumed that I needed to make it to junior VP level to be able to do that. And I just had no idea what salaries were like. Since then, I've looked at levels.fyi, is one of my favorite sites. They'll show you salaries at different levels at different companies.\n\n(17:06):\nAnd if you make it to senior PM, which is one of the middle levels, this middle senior PM level at most of these big companies, you're making as much as a doctor makes, you're making as much as a lawyer makes, you're making a lot of money. You don't necessarily need to climb that career ladder forever to make a lot of money.\n\n(17:24):\nAnd especially at a company like Google, there's a few companies that are known for being the highest paying companies, you can make a lot of money. Much more that you can make in a lot of startups, just by being in IC path, just by continuing to do that job. And companies really need people to do that.\n\n(17:38):\nI think understanding that there's different ways to grow your impact and grow your career, other than getting promoted to people management. And for me, I think switching companies is one of the really obvious ways, or teams, of there's one kind of impact you're having at your current job, and maybe you could work on a product that affects more people or has a bigger impact on the people that use it, or something that has more of a social impact type work. But just really thinking about different ways to grow your impact so that you don't make a blind choice towards people management because it seems like it's the only way to grow.\n\nLenny (18:05):\nAlong those lines, I know a lot of companies in theory have these kind of IC career tracks. And I find that it's really rare that they end up being really successful, and very few people end up going down to them. Is that what you see too? Or, I don't know, is there a way to actually be really successful going down that path?\n\nJackie Bavaro (18:22):\nYeah. I think that to the extent that you want to be seeing promotions as like, you want your level number to go up, I think that it is pretty rare. I think that there's not that many companies that have principal PMs, and the ones that have a bunch usually have a partner PM role above that, that's the real principal PM at other companies.\n\n(18:38):\nAnd the reason for that is that the reason a company would give you that high of a title is because they have a business need for PM who can have as much impact as a director, but with the team that's small enough that they can PM the whole team. And there's only a few problems out there like that. Platform type teams can fill that role a lot of the time. Partnerships, someone who's working on a partnership between two major companies can often fit that kind of description. But there just aren't that many, it's a lot easier to have a big impact if you're a manager of managers and you can add up the impact of all the people on your teams.\n\n(19:10):\nSo yes, I agree that there's not that many opportunities to go from senior PM to principal PM to partner PM. I don't think you need to. I think that if you want to pursue the IC path, which I think is a great path, I think thinking of ways to grow beyond the official promotion. A lot of companies, you can make a lot of money without getting that promotion title. If you're working at a small company, if you're working with other companies that isn't the highest paying company, you'll make a lot more money by switching companies than you will by getting promoted at your current company.\n\n(19:37):\nAnd like I was saying before, the thinking about the kind of impact your work has, do you want to work on something that's more cutting edge? Do you want to work on something that your product that your friends use? Do you want to work on something that's going to save the environment? All of these things I think are ways to grow. There are a career path that is just not climbing the career ladder.\n\nLenny (19:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog. PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording, and experimentation, all in one easy to use platform. PostHog is open sourced, so you can host it on your own infrastructure, which means that you have control over who has access to your data and makes regulatory compliance a breeze, because you don't need to send user info to third parties.\n\n(20:18):\nPostHog's app system works seamlessly with your data warehouse, both for importing and exporting data, which enables you to bring your data into one place and easily understand user behavior across a range of touchpoints. If you'd like to learn more, check them out at posthog.com/lenny.\n\n(20:36):\nThat's a really important insight that you can keep growing, one as a human and maybe even be happier going down one of these other paths, non-manager path. And maybe you don't get the promotions, but maybe you make just as much money as you go the other path. In theory, it's a lot more interesting.\n\n(20:50):\nAnd then the other point that you made is really great, that if you want to go down that route, it's probably going to be an infrastructure team or a new business unit, unlikely to be a user facing piece, because they probably want to build a large teams there with a lot of layers. Interesting. Great stuff.\n\n(21:04):\nOkay. I want to transition to strategy. You've written a lot about strategy. I share your pieces often with folks. Diving into that a little bit, first of all just, can you describe what strategy even is? It's like this term that everyone uses all the time and they're like, \"Oh, I'm working on strategy. I'm going to get good at strategy.\" What is strategy in your mind?\n\nJackie Bavaro (21:21):\nYeah, when I worked at Google, one of the promotions I went up for, I did not get, and I got the feedback that I needed to be more strategic. I was like, \"Okay, great. What does being more strategic mean?\" And nobody could tell me. And I was like, \"Well, who's more strategic?\" And they were like, \"Oh, this person used to be really strategic before she became a manager. But now she does just those managery stuff.\" And I was like, \"Okay, I have no role models, no words, nothing to explain what it means to be more strategic.\" Quick shout-out to my book is, I've got a whole list of what it means to be more strategic. So if you pick that up, you can read through that.\n\nLenny (21:51):\nCan we find that on Amazon? Where do you find that book?\n\nJackie Bavaro (21:54):\nYes. Just the Cracking the PM Career, that's on Amazon.\n\nLenny (21:57):\nGreat.\n\nJackie Bavaro (21:57):\nAnd it's in the strategy chapter.\n\nLenny (21:59):\nGreat.\n\nJackie Bavaro (22:00):\nWhat I did is I wrote a document on the Local Universal Team, so I called it Local Universal Strategy. And I can't remember what I put in this document. I put it in just random... What my plan was. But once I wrote it down and shared it with people, then I started getting feedback on it. And then I could start to feel my way to what people meant to strategy. Then I get to Asana and I worked really closely with JR, head of product. And I'm starting to get a view of what strategy means, and he's got a robust vision for the product. We talked about this idea that when you're playing guitar, you're left and your right hand know how to work together to play the guitar. Wouldn't it be amazing if at a company, all the teams sort of had that ambient awareness of what other teams were doing together so that you worked seamlessly together?\n\n(22:44):\nAnd Asana was the team brain helping this happen. Imagine a world where you didn't have to have these endless status updates and all this work about work, because the teams knew what each other was doing. And as you kept track of your own task that updated the centralized system, that was always up to date.\n\n(22:59):\nWe had this vision of what the future could be like. And we had our strategy, which got into this team brain. And what's what a good team brain have? Well, has to always be with you. So we need to have good mobile and good security, needs to know about the different kinds of work that exists. So we need to... Right now, Asana understands this kind of work, we need to add this kind of work.\n\n(23:16):\nAnd it has to help you draw insightful connections with the work that it knows. If we know that you have all these tasks with due dates, we need to be able to let you know that maybe you have too many due dates on next Friday. I started to build up this idea of strategy and I was like, \"Okay, I think I've got what strategy is.\" And a few years later we hire Alex Hood, our new head of product. And he's like, \"Can you create a strategy for the platform team?\" And I was like, \"Great, here it is. We have it.\" And he's like, \"That's not a strategy.\" And I was like, \"What?\"\n\n(23:44):\nI was like, \"I've been going all these years thinking I knew what strategy was. And now I, again, find out that I don't know it.\" We had a lot of conversations and figuring out like, \"Well what's missing?\" And through all of this, I basically realized that there's three key components to strategy. And not everybody's thinking of all three, but if you have all three, you'll have something that counts as a strategy for anyone you talk.\n\n(24:01):\nThree parts of strategy are your vision. This is your inspiring picture of what the future looks like. And this is like, \"Hey everybody, this is where we want to get to, don't you want to come join me, come build this future with me? Won't this to be exciting?\"\n\n(24:14):\nAnd then you've got your strategic framework. This is where you're saying, \"Here is the market we're going after. Here's what success looks like. And here are our big bets on what we think it takes to win that market.\" That's where you get your pillars, and it's your unique way of breaking down the problem to understand who you're going after and what it takes to win them.\n\n(24:34):\nAnd then the third part is the roadmap. This is where you work backwards from your vision. You say \"Okay, I think as a company, we can achieve our vision in five years or 10 years or two years or whatever it is.\" And you say \"Working backwards from that, if we're going to be at our vision in five years, what does that mean we're doing in the intermediate years?\" I misunderstood roadmap for the longest time. A roadmap in strategy is not a commitment. Instead, it's a way to double check if your plan makes any sense at all and is even anywhere near feasible. Because what happens to every team I see do these roadmaps, you put it together and you realize \"We're not going to hit our vision in five years or 10. This is like a 30 year vision, if we keep going at the pace we're going.\"\n\n(25:14):\nIt's this wake up call to say, \"Oh, okay. If we want to hit this vision in five years, we need to start working on that big thing now. We need to take much bigger swings at the bat. We need to say no to a lot more of this optional work. Maybe we need to hire a team that's twice as big.\"\n\n(25:31):\nIt gives you a way to say that probably your strategy did not actually fit into the timeframe that you wanted and that roadmap helps you see like, \"Okay, what would it take?\" And then that can be a little bit of an organizing factor for people across the company to understand, \"Okay, we're having a major launch in two years, then we need to make sure that we're going to have the marketing support we need for that launch. Or we might need to have an entirely different business model in two years. We need to do a fundraising round now.\" It really helps kind of pull the pieces together.\n\nLenny (26:00):\nWow, that's so actionable and easy to understand. I've never heard it describe so simply. Along those lines, say someone creates a strategy, what are signs that it's a good strategy versus a meh strategy? Which should they be looking at?\n\nJackie Bavaro (26:15):\nI'm probably going to write something on this soon. In the past month, I'd actually have two totally different people who came to me with the same problem. And they said, \"My CEO brought me a strategy and the strategy is increased revenue by 50%, it's a revenue target number. That doesn't seem like a strategy to me. I don't know what to do.\" Talking to people, I started to get a deeper sense of what the confusion and the mismatch is here.\n\n(26:40):\nI think a good strategy is all about connecting the dots. Connecting the dots from this high level business goal of, \"We want to increase revenue by this much\" to, \"This is the feature we're going to do.\" And it might have many, many dots in between to help get people from one to the other of like \"Given that this is our big picture of view of what we're doing, what's the next step? And what's the next step? And what's the next step?\"\n\n(27:02):\n\"As product managers, if you're given a numerical target, that is not a complete strategy, but it's your job now as a product manager to take all of the great product work you've been doing. Let's say you've been doing lots of customer research and you're getting really deep into what the customer pains are and what their needs are. It's your job to take the things you've got now in your mind, you've got a list of maybe 20 different things your product team could work on. It's your job to take those things you want to work on and the reasons why you think they're important, and match them up against what that larger financial target was or whatever strategy or vision you're getting from the executives. And basically see \"Which of these feature work? Which of this product work that I want to do best matches up with those goals and why?\"\n\n(27:45):\nAnd there's probably a few more missing dots in there. You're like, \"Well, I think that this is going to make us the most money. But why? I think this will make us the most money because it's helping us get more money from our current users. And we think it's going to be really hard to win new users because we're already pretty saturated in the market.\"\n\n(28:01):\nThat's where you start to get into strategy, that level of detail. And then you say, \"Okay, given that we think it's more strategic to get more money from our current users, here's one thing we could do. What are other things we could do? And how do those stack up against each other? Or maybe it should be that 50% of our effort is on getting more money from our current users, and 50% is from going into new markets. Well, which new markets do we think are most promising and what would it take to win those new markets?\"\n\n(28:24):\nI think it's that connecting the dots. And the only way you find out what dots are missing is by talking to people and communicating your strategy and communicating it again and again, and really listening for people's confusion. Because people will try to hide their confusion. They won't get your strategy, there's going to be some assumption that you're making that they are not making. So you have to pay really, really close attention to find those missing assumptions so that you can then explain why this connects to this.\n\nLenny (28:51):\nThat's really good advice of just looking for confusion and that points out where your strategy is lacking. How could PMs get better at strategy at doing this than getting better at this activity? Advice for that?\n\nJackie Bavaro (29:02):\nYeah. Strategy really should be collaborative work. I think that there's some amount to which the PM should go off by themselves and think about what strategy they want and have that in their back pocket, because that way you actually can contribute to the conversation, but real strategy should be very collaborative.\n\n(29:17):\nI think the best way to learn and improve your strategy, one of them is going to be working with the other stakeholders and listening to their feedback and understanding what do they agree with or not agree with. Sometimes it's as easy as a conversation. I can't remember the details here, but there was one conversation on pricing models that we were talking about, and we were each going to go around the room and talk about which of the five pricing models did we think was best. And I think I was like, \"Number three is most [inaudible 00:29:44] number two.\"\n\n(29:44):\nAnd then our CEO gets, and he's like, \"I think really number four is the only reasonable one for these reasons.\" And I was just like, \"I agree, I've changed a mind. You're right. You just saw it in a way that I hadn't seen.\"\n\n(29:58):\nThis accumulation of experiences, I think matter so much for strategy, for data analysis, all of these things where... I'm really, really good at data analysis, but only because I've seen so many experiments that when I see a set of results, I can just instantly remember like four similar experiments and what the conclusion was and what went wrong with it. And so I'll be like, \"Oh yes, this metric is up. But if you check this metric, you can see it's down, which means that it might be this conclusion.\" It's talking to people, listening to them, that builds it up a lot. But that's one half of it, because you can't always just learn something by a bunch of leaders sitting in a room talking to each other.\n\n(30:37):\nI think seeing things through to a certain amount of time really does help. And I think sticking with the team for long enough to be able to measure the results of what you did and ideally iterate, like being one doing it for eight years, I got to try something and then try something different and then try something different. And I got to really notice the patterns and test what works and what didn't and form those conclusions. I think that sticking around long enough to see your results and especially try something else different and see those results, I think can make a big difference.\n\nLenny (31:06):\nWhat I'm hearing is you get better one doing it over and over and over to being in the conversations and learning from people directly. Is there anything else that someone that, I don't know, doesn't have a lot of these experiences yet and in the room for these sorts of things that they could maybe study up on or practice just outside of this to get a little bit stronger in strategy?\n\nJackie Bavaro (31:27):\nYeah. Definitely there's a lot of cross applying of strategy that I think that really is helpful. One of the great ways to learn strategy is to cross apply strategy from other places. One of the people I interviewed for my book was to Shishir Mehrotra, who's CEO of Coda, and he used to work at YouTube. And while he was at YouTube, he had a very big strategic question that the team had to decide about whether if you search for a video that is not on YouTube, but is somewhere else like Hulu, should you link them out to that?\n\n(32:00):\nAnd the team was having a lot of trouble making any progress on that. But one day he went to a product review for Google shopping, totally different product, shopping versus videos. But they were having a similar issue and they talked about this idea of consistency versus comprehensiveness.\n\n(32:16):\nThey said \"Is our product the kind of product where it's better to have consistent results all the time? Like every time you click on a result, it takes you to a Google shopping result or is it better to have comprehensiveness where even though the experience will be different each time we give you a result every time?\" That framing, he was able to take from shopping over to YouTube and ask that same question and the answer didn't have to be the same, but it gave them a new way of looking at the strategy that he was able to use.\n\n(32:40):\nI think having that broad view and looking at lots of other products and seeing how they make their choices and how do they frame their decisions, that's a good way to improve strategy.\n\nLenny (32:49):\nThat's a really good reminder of eigenquestions as a framework. I think if you Google eingenquestions, you can find it and I'll try to link it to it in this podcast. And Shishir has a lot of great stuff that he's put out there. Good call out.\n\n(33:01):\nLet me ask one more quick question on strategy and then I want to move on to career stuff. How long should people, I guess, early PMs maybe, how much time should they spend on strategy development? And then, when does it make sense to start investing in that?\n\nJackie Bavaro (33:15):\nYeah. I think that for your first six months on a product, probably don't worry about strategy. For your six months really, you should be talking to customers, researching your product stuff. Really starting off by saying, \"I'm going to learn the strategy, whatever strategy my company already has, and I'm going to do my research, but I'm going to deliver on that strategy.\"\n\n(33:33):\nBut all this time, while you're doing your regular product work, so you're visiting customers and you're analyzing data and all these things, you are probably having ideas pop up in your mind. You're starting to notice trends. You're starting to notice what are the pain points people have and just stay open to that. And after about six months, I think is when you can start to put together a draft of a strategy for your own team.\n\n(33:53):\nI think you can take half a day. Just block it off, don't take any meetings, put on your headphones, go to a coffee shop, whatever it is you do to get your alone time. And just work on whichever of those three pillars of strategy, whether it's the vision, the strategic framework or the roadmap. Start with whichever one draws you the most and start writing some stuff down, just start getting your ideas out there.\n\n(34:14):\nAnd this will start to give you that framework, you can then go try to take that time, fill it out more, figure out what questions you have, what would you need to know to decide which of these approaches is better, what are the open questions you have. And then you can have something to start meeting with the rest of your product triad. The engineering lead, the design lead, any other key stakeholders you have on your team, and just start working with them and start to figure out how are we feeling about our strategy.\n\n(34:39):\nOne thing I love to look for is repeated disagreements, \"Are there any times when we're fighting over whether to add this feature? And I so strongly believe we shouldn't and you so strongly believe we should,\" and it's just ends up feeling like a battle of wills. Anytime you have these disagreements that feel really torny or they feel like a disagreement in values, that's a sign that really have a disagreement in strategy and that it's worth it to write down what your strategic framework is or what your strategic principle is and address the problem at that level, rather than fighting over individual features or individual decisions.\n\nLenny (35:11):\nIt's such a good tactical tip of just like, if there's continued disagreement, that's a sign, you either craft a strategy or maybe a principle which are related, but sometimes different, just principles of the product or principles of the team. Great advice. And the point you made about not spending the first six months on strategy, I love that because a lot of PMs come in are like, \"Oh, strategy. I'm going to figure everything out. I'm going to tell us how to build this thing. This all sucks. Everything you all have done before.\" Just that rule of thumb, of not allowing yourself to invest deeply there for six months. Love that idea.\n\nJackie Bavaro (35:42):\nNice. Yeah. I think as a manager, you usually have a reason for hiring someone. And usually at least in your head, you think you've hired them to build on the strategy that you've already created, and there will be room for people to create new strategies and change the strategy. But if they come in on day one saying your strategy is all wrong, raises the question of, \"Well then why did you join my team if you didn't believe in my strategy?\"\n\nLenny (36:06):\nA lot of times people just want you to help them execute. They're just like, \"Come on. We know what we're doing. Just help us ship this thing and it's going to be great.\" And a lot of people come in like \"No, let's just rethink it all. Let's take a step back.\"\n\n(36:17):\nOkay. Last area that I want to spend some time on is around career. Career growth as a product manager and product leader. Luckily you wrote a book called Cracking the PM Career. If you just had to boil down the best advice from the book to one suggestion to a PM, let's say starting off in their career and then maybe a mid-career, what would that be?\n\nJackie Bavaro (36:41):\nI'll start with one piece of suggestion for people at any stage of their career, which is to have a conversation with your manager and say, \"I would really like at some point in the future to grow into whatever this goal is,\" whether it's to become a people manager, become a senior PM, become a director, whatever this next step of what you want is. \"I would really love to become a people manager someday. What do you suggest that I work on now so that I'll be ready when the opportunity comes up?\"\n\n(37:03):\nThe reason I love this template is just a really easy way to start off this conversation of saying \"Here's my goal, by the way. I do want to get promoted, I do want to grow, I want to become a senior PM,\" whatever that next step is.\n\n(37:14):\nI'm framing it in the future so that it's not threatening. It's not like going to put my manager on the defensive and be like, \"You're not ready to be a manager yet. I don't have to prove why you're not ready for that promotion yet.\" Which is not the mindset you want your manager in.\n\n(37:26):\nAnd then it brings them onto your side. \"Can you help me out here? Let's you and me work together to get me this promotion. You and me work together to get me ready there.\" It brings them in onto your side, so now they'll be in the mindset of trying to help you. It will target the feedback that you get on what you need to do to get that promotion. Because so much of the time, I think the reason that success as a PM is hard is because you get a gazillion pieces of feedback.\n\n(37:50):\nThey're all true. It's all like \"Yeah. In that meeting, you said a lot of filler words.\" But that's not the thing that's actually holding you back from the next promotion, or it's not the thing that you actually need to improve at to get to that next step.\n\n(38:01):\nBeing able to focus the feedback you get on what you're trying to achieve, makes a huge difference and will really help make sure that you get that feedback. And at any company, either your manager is going to be the person who decides if you get that promotion, what they say is just true, whatever they think you're missing is what you're missing, or there's going to be a committee. And if there's a committee, your manager's feedback matters a lot. And also if they've been at the company a while, they'll know what they look for.\n\n(38:26):\nIf you have a new manager at a big company that uses promotion by committee, at any big company, make friends with your manager's peers, find someone who's been at the company a while, who's gotten someone to promoted and ask them that same question. Get them onto your side to get you the experience and the improvements you need to get that promotion.\n\nLenny (38:41):\nAmazing advice. I found that to be super helpful myself. And you're saying that applies to every role. UPMs, everybody.\n\nJackie Bavaro (38:48):\nYeah. I think you can use that in almost any role because everybody does have different gaps, but then to go into early career people, I think that working at a large company early in your career can be just really, really valuable. If you choose a small company and what's going to be super successful and you pick the winner, that can be better than working at a big company. But big or, I'd say, even medium size companies can be really good here.\n\n(39:10):\nBut a company where you're going to be able to learn best practices, you're going to be able to grow your network, I think that these large companies really give you... And you'll also be able to make usually a higher salary that starts to build your nest egg, I think that that gives you a really good foundation for anything else you want to do later in your career.\n\n(39:27):\nAnd when you're early in the career, really to have that mindset of absorbing and learning how to be a great PM. One mistake I see people make early in their career is they are trying to overdo it. They've been given some project, usually as a early career person, you get assigned a pretty narrow scoped constrained problem. They're like, \"Hey, can you make the print dialogue for our product?\" And the right answer to these narrowly scope defined products is not to invent a whole new print dialogue.\n\n(39:56):\nA lot of times you've been assigned a problem where a huge creative solution is a bad idea. If you're in one of the situations, just do the simple thing, get it done really well. And that'll earn you the trust to be able to take on bigger things in the future, but you don't need to be outstanding to make it past the APM promotions. You just need to be doing a solid, good job. And later in your career, there's a lot more room for being outstanding.\n\nLenny (40:20):\nWhat are some of the most common mistakes that PMs make early on in their career that hurt their career?\n\nJackie Bavaro (40:25):\nYeah. A lot of it is misunderstanding what the role is at different stages in the career and misunderstanding what success looks like. This can show up in a lot of different ways. One of them is, there's lots of APMs who want to become people managers right away, and they poo poo all the regular everyday work you need to do to be a good PM. And that comes across to a manager as immature, certainly, but also just like you don't seem to understand or value what good PMing is, so I certainly wouldn't make you a manager. But also now it's a little hard to convince you to do your day to day job, which makes you a little hard to manage, which might mean put a little bit less of my energy into managing you. It ends up being a bad situation for people.\n\n(41:08):\nIt's a lot better to show some enthusiasm for the job you're supposed to be doing right now. Other ways that can work is just people optimizing for the wrong things, like leaning in too much or too little. On PMs I see get paired with a really strong designer and you let your designer take the lead on everything. And now you just sit back and you're a note taker and you're not contributing anything. You're not really driving anything. You're not adding your own ideas and making the team better.\n\n(41:31):\nThat person needs to step up more, to be somebody who's really contributing and adding and being a multiplier on the work of everybody else on their team. And then some people step too much. They're trying to lead everything and they're crowding people out and they're not giving their engineers a chance to present at all hands, and they're burning bridges with their coworkers. And almost every company peer reviews is a huge part of your review cycle. And as a product manager, you need to get along well with the other people in your team. You'll be pushing them and encouraging them to get more done than they would've otherwise, but you don't want to do this by having everybody say, \"I never want to work with her again.\"\n\nLenny (42:06):\nSo much of advice I find for early careers, it's just like it should done, make impact, just your job, don't overthink it, if it won't earn your right to move up and take on more responsibility, get promoted on all kind of stuff. I love that so much. It's just do the work, just be quiet, do the work, it's going to go great.\n\n(42:23):\nA couple more questions. And before we get to a lightning round. You've exited the PM career path at this point, and I'm curious what made you decide to go in a different direction? And then just, what's next? what's next for Jackie Bavaro?\n\nJackie Bavaro (42:35):\nYeah. I'm not sure that I've exited the PM career path. I really like working in offices with people. I've been waiting for an end to the remote work era. And once I find companies that are in person again, I'm definitely have some curiosity about that. I might go back to in person work.\n\nLenny (42:51):\nOh my God. I'm imagining your LinkedIn is about exploding right now, as people are listening to this.\n\nJackie Bavaro (42:57):\nI'm in San Francisco.\n\nLenny (42:59):\nOh boy. And then were you going to say something else?\n\nJackie Bavaro (43:02):\nNothing is settled, but I've been playing around with the idea about whether or not to update the Cracking the PM Interview book. Lots changed. Some of the companies there are not the top companies anymore. Some top companies aren't in there, some of the companies have changed their interview processes. I think that could be a lot of fun to get that more up to date. Some of the changes that have happened in interviews over the past years.\n\nLenny (43:21):\nAmazing. I imagine many people will be very excited to see a second edition of Correcting the PM Interview. Okay. Let us get to our lightning round. Okay. I'm just going to ask six questions and just tell me whatever comes to mind as we go through them, real quick. And maybe we'll pull out a thread or two as we go through it. Are you ready?\n\nJackie Bavaro (43:39):\nYes.\n\nLenny (43:40):\nOkay. What's a book that you recommend most to other product managers other than your book?\n\nJackie Bavaro (43:45):\nI love Getting Things Done by David Allen.\n\nLenny (43:47):\nOoh, okay. Around productivity. I love that book. That was really transformative for me when I read it many years ago, and I still use a couple of this points. Awesome. Okay. Getting Things Done, David Allen. Other than Asana, what's a company that you recommend to PMs that are looking for a new gig? What are some companies that you're excited about, potentially?\n\nJackie Bavaro (44:06):\nI'm not the most up to date with all of the companies, but I do think that Microsoft is pretty underrated. I had a lot of fun working at Microsoft. I learned a lot of good strategy there. I think I got a really good foundation for a lot of the rest of my career.\n\nLenny (44:19):\nContrarian pick and they've been killing it. That makes a lot of sense. Good choice. What's a favorite app right now for you?\n\nJackie Bavaro (44:25):\nI have a recipe manager called Paprika. I really like it.\n\nLenny (44:30):\nOoh. Does it have actual recipes or is it track other recipes you've found?\n\nJackie Bavaro (44:34):\nIt tracks other recipes. You can save any URL and it'll extract the recipe from there and you can do meal planning in there. You can turn things into a shopping list. You can use it across your phone and your computer for when you want to sit down and browse. But I really enjoy just browsing recipes and a lot of them I'll never cook, but just the idea that, \"Oh, I could imagine cooking that,\" it's a lot of fun. It's a little bit like traveling.\n\nLenny (44:58):\nWow. You could say Paprika. Okay. And then who's someone that you love to follow on Twitter or Instagram currently that maybe people haven't heard of? Or maybe they have.\n\nJackie Bavaro (45:06):\nI love Helen Rosner, @hels, H-E-L-S. She's a food writer for the New Yorker, but it's a lot deeper than food. A lot of it gets into society and bigger topics.\n\nLenny (45:19):\nWow. I see a pattern here around food. Who's your favorite manager that you've had?\n\nJackie Bavaro (45:23):\nI think it's probably JR at Asana who I worked for gazillion years.\n\nLenny (45:28):\nAny particular reason why?\n\nJackie Bavaro (45:29):\nI think there's got to be a match between you and your manager. And I think that we had a lot of mutual respect, and I think that I was really lucky in that he was absolutely amazing at vision. I was able to learn a lot from it from him. And there were a lot of places where I was able to help. A lot of my early experience of even getting to learn strategy and vision he was like, \"Jackie, can you help me with the slides for the vision all hands?\"\n\n(45:54):\nAnd I would be doing busy work of putting the slides together, but then I could make some suggestions, I could ask some questions. And first year I was just basically doing slides. Second year, I had a little bit of shaping. Third year, he let me take the first stab at it and then he reviewed it. I think he was always willing to help me grow and really saw it as a win-win where if I grew into something, then that would free up his time to take on something bigger and better.\n\nLenny (46:20):\nAwesome. Sounds like an awesome manager. And then last but not least, what's a favorite interview question that you love to use?\n\nJackie Bavaro (46:26):\nI love to ask, \"Tell me about a recent project that you're proud of.\" I feel like a lot of interviews don't give people enough chance to shine, to talk about something that they did really, really well and hear about what made it so good and what are they proud of, and how did they achieve those amazing results.\n\nLenny (46:46):\nAnd then what do you look for in an answer there? What are a couple bullet points of a good answer to that?\n\nJackie Bavaro (46:46):\nIt's so different for every question, but I'm definitely looking for try to get something recent, so I want them to be something that matches the level that they're applying for. There's going to be a really big difference between the way that an APM answers this question and the way that a director of PM answers the question. I look to see how did they think about strategy, what was their judgment on different choices, what was hard. I have a framework for this. The pearl framework for answering questions like this is problem, epiphany, action, result and learning.\n\n(47:15):\nIt's a little bit like the star framework, but I want it all like, \"What's the problem that you thought was worth solving, a problem that I think is big enough? What's your epiphany? What's the insight that you had? Do you notice something that nobody else did and how valuable was it?\"\n\n(47:28):\nA lot of times that's what makes these PM stories so interesting. Is that meeting with customers, head on and they said one weird word and you dug into it and you learn this whole new customer need that no one else had seen before. And then there's going to be the action. Like \"What did you actually do to make this happen? And was it hard?\" Because usually it is hard, but understanding the ways in which it's hard and how you overcame each of those challenges. And then obviously a PM should care about results and the thing they pick that they're proud of should have good results or have at least results that they learned from.\n\n(48:00):\nAnd then, yeah, that last part of learning. \"Did you grow from this?\" Especially if it's a failure, which is lots of people love to talk about the products that failed or sometimes the interviewer asks them to talk about a product that fails, but I don't want them to leave it at \"Yeah. It was a big loss. Our company lost $50 million and we couldn't get it back,\" but then you want to say like, \"Okay, but what I learned from that is now I need to always run a load test on a staging server and then I've had many successful launches since then that we didn't have that same problem in.\"\n\nLenny (48:29):\nWow. What a fruitful lightning round. So many nuggets. We got a new framework in there too. Okay. Where can folks find you online and then any last words of wisdom?\n\nJackie Bavaro (48:38):\nYeah. I'm on Twitter, @jackiebo. I'm on Twitter all the time. Send me a message, I'll probably see it pretty fast.\n\nLenny (48:44):\nAmazing.

Duolingo is a $14 billion company, it's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up, but I think it doubled in value in the past six months. Streaks is the most impactful feature. We have, right now, over 9 million users with a year plus streak. If you look at the numbers, I think it's been our biggest growth lever. What Duolingo really focuses on is, how do we help users build habits around language learning? Getting user come back the next day is the biggest problem to solve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nLet's get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:00:30):\nI'd say test everything, we've run in the last four years over 600 experiments on the streaks, so every other day. We've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. We used to say continue, our standard CTA is continue, and we changed that to commit to my goal, and it was a massive win.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:48):\nThere's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:00:55):\nSay that you played a mobile game, or that you've done it for 3,000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3,000 days in a row.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):\nToday, my guest is Jackson Shuttleworth. Jackson is a group product manager at Duolingo, leading the retention team. This is a different kind of episode that I'm experimenting with, where we spent the entire conversation focused on the journey and lessons of a single feature, in this case, Duolingo streaks. Duolingo is a $14 billion business, just over the past six months, they doubled in value, they're hitting all time highs in usage and market cap, they're also one of the very few successful and also the single biggest consumer app business in the world. And as you'll hear from Jackson, the streaks feature is the single most impactful feature that most contributed to this growth and success. In other words, you could argue this one feature created billions of dollars of value, which to me means it is worth studying in depth.\n\n(00:01:59):\nIn our conversation, Jackson shares the history of the streaks feature, all of the biggest wins and wrong turns they've taken along the way, what he and his team have learned about what works and doesn't work with a streaks mechanic, and also how they set up their teams to operate in a way that allows them to run over 600 experiments on this product and continue to find big wins. I hope to do more episodes like this on features and products that you'd love to hear more about, so leave a comment either on YouTube or on Substack, and tell me which product or feature you'd love to see me cover.

Long time listener, first time caller.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):\nI appreciate it. So, this is going to be a really interesting conversation, I've never done an episode like this before, where we basically spent an hour, an hour and a half going into one feature of one product, but this is a very special feature, it's a very special product. Have you ever spent an hour, an hour and a half just talking about this one feature with anyone?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:03:13):\nWell, internally, so when we onboard new folks to the team, we'll do, I actually just did this with somebody that joined the team recently, where we spent, yeah, I was like, hey, let's spend an hour just talking about the streak. We got through an hour and I got through about 30% of what I wanted to share, there's just so much, we'll talk about this, but there's so much that we've learned over the years, but never anything externally like this. I think we've shared bits and pieces of learnings, but this will be the motherload of learnings hopefully-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:14):\nHere we go.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:03:41):\n... of how Duolingo built the streak.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:42):\nWe should title this the Motherload of Learnings of Duolingo Streaks.

What is this feature all about?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:06:10):\nWell, presumably people know, Duolingo is a language learning app, the Duolingo streak tracks, currently anyway, how many days in a row you've done a lesson. So, you come to Duolingo, you do a lesson, your first lesson you'll start a streak, and then every consecutive day that you come use the app, you'll extend your streak. And I should actually put an asterisk around how many days in a row because we also have built flexibility into the feature. So, we have these things called streak freezes, it's like insurance for your streaks. So, it's a pretty simple feature, in theory, but over time we've layered on challenges, and goal setting, and rewards, and social features... A lot of our notifications are tied to the streak. So, pretty simple feature to understand, but it's been a really rich feature for us to build on top of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):\nSome people might be hearing this and be like, Duolingo streaks, what's the big deal? There's other people that are like, holy, I want to learn everything I can possibly learn about Duolingo streaks, so many companies are trying to copy what you've learned from this. Give people a sense of the impact that this one feature has had on Duolingo's success and growth.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:07:15):\nAnd this is not just the subjective retention PM talking, I think this is our biggest feature, with the exception of the lessons. And I think it's actually [inaudible 00:07:24] start that. Streaks are a great engagement hack. I'm of the opinion that any team, any app out there can introduce a streak, and if you figure it out, it probably works to retain users, but at the core, you have to have an app that people want to use, and people really like using Duolingo. It's fun, it's delightful, you learn something. And so, it allows us to layer an engagement mechanic on top of that the streak is really powerful. So, it ships a disgusting amount of DAUs, again, it is one of our golden geese. And again, what's cool is that, you look at notifications, notifications for Duolingo is massive. Us sending better, whether it's copy or timing, so many of our notifications work because they reference the streak, because users care about the streak.\n\n(00:08:10):\nAnd so, not only is it itself, us iterating on the streak a huge driver of DAUs, but it's also something that enables other really high valuable features. I was looking up some stats before I came on, and it's pretty crazy. So, we have right now over 9 million users with a year plus streak.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:30):\nWow.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:08:30):\nSo, 9 million of our users have used Duolingo every year, almost every day, for well over a year. Which is pretty... I don't know, I like to imagine things in terms of like, okay, well, if you put all these people in a city, or in a place, where would it be? I'm like, ah, it's like a very large city, 9 million people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):\nFor a year, have a year long streak.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:08:53):\nFor a year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):\nThat's incredible. I was just looking at the stock of Duolingo, so Duolingo is a $14 billion company at the time we're recording this. It's hitting all-time highs too, it just keeps going up. I think it doubled in value in the past six months, something like that. And what I'm hearing from you is streaks is, other than just the core learning feature, which is just the product of Duolingo, this is the most feature in terms of growth, and in that retention specifically.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:09:24):\nIf you look at the numbers, I think pretty objectively has been our biggest growth lever for driving DAUs, and also say a lot of it's just related to how we think about growth at Duolingo. And a lot of what we try to do is organic growth. We think about growth just as much as bringing new users onto the platform is not losing them. If you're just bringing people onto the platform, then they churn, that's not going to be sustainable. And so, as much as we can do to keep our users coming back and actually retaining as users, it's going to give us a much easier base to continue growing DAUs off of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:57):\nPerfect. Okay. Talk about how this feature originally came to be. What was the original version of it? What was the original insight that led to [inaudible 00:10:05]-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:10:04):\nYeah, so the oldest streaks or as old as Duolingo itself. When we launched Duolingo, we launched with a streak... And I say we, I was just graduating undergrad when Duolingo launched. So, this is well before my time. But we launched with a streak feature. Initially how the feature worked was you'd come to Duolingo and you'd set a goal for yourself, and it was an XP based goal. So, Duolingo, a little bit of nomenclature, we have an experience point based system that drives a lot of our features in the app. And the way you'd set it is you'd say, based on what your language learning goal was, maybe you have a 10 experience point goal versus a 50 experience point goal. And so, extending your streak would be, hey, can you hit 50 experience points? If that's what you set your goal to be.\n\n(00:10:50):\nAnd this worked well, I think this also speaks to how Duolingo initially grew. Luis launched it with a TEDTalk, we probably had a more tech-forward user base initially, and so this whole idea of an experience points based streak system made sense. But what that also meant is that you could have a user come and use the app, do multiple lessons a day, and maybe they just set too hard of a goal for themselves, and then lose their streak. Which, you don't need to be an expert in streaks to understand that's probably not good. The nice thing with how we initially set it up though is it really did connect with what your goal was. So, if you were serious, let's track how good you are at being a serious language learner.\n\n(00:11:28):\nBut I'd say one of the most impactful experiments we ran was about, this was actually as I was joining, or just after I joined we had run this experiment, was to move it from a XP based streak to just do one lesson a day, and you'd extend your streak. And the risk that you can sort of imagine is, well, then users kind of care less about it because it's not connected with their goal. And we saw none of that. This was a huge driver of DAUs, just making it easier to extend your streak, but I think really importantly it's still meaningful. The unit of use, and as you're thinking about building a streak, I think it's really important to think about what the unit of use of your app is. The unit of use for Duolingo is doing a lesson. And so, if what we care about is users coming back every day and doing a lesson, because it shows that they're actually engaging with the app, then it doesn't hurt us to make our streak focus on just do one unit versus multiple.\n\n(00:12:23):\nAnd so, that was probably the big [inaudible 00:12:25] change experiment that we ran at the time was moving from an XP-based streak to a one lesson streak. It's also simple, and I think that's one of the things to think about with streaks. It's always easy as a PM to have a million goals or objectives for what you want your feature to be and potentially build a more complex feature, and a one lesson streak, it's just easy for more users to understand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:46):\nYeah, that's exactly what I was going to say. And just for folks that aren't super familiar with XP, it's basically experience points and you get them from doing things, it's like a [inaudible 00:12:53]-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:12:53):\nYeah, you do stuff on Duolingo, and then based on what you did and how well you did it, we give you experience points, this actually drives a number of our features in our apps. So, leaderboards is the big one, we have a leaderboard system, where you try over the course of the week, you battle with 29 other people, and you want to win, that's all driven by XP. So, we do have other features in the app that really benefit from this XP system-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:16):\nCool.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:13:16):\n... the streak is just no longer one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):\nAwesome. Okay, so I want to talk about the journey from that point to what it is today, but a quick tangent, I saw Luis tweet just this week, someone asked him, \"How do you decide whether to optimize for learning or engagement?\" And he's like, \"No question, everything we do is focused on engagement because you won't learn anything if you're not coming back to the app.\"\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:13:39):\nAs an engagement PM, that was the coolest thing he could have ever said. It's, well, again, very much as subjectively I guess as an engagement PM, that's how I've... I am sure the learning folks at Duolingo will cringe when they hear it, I see myself as a learning PM as much as an engagement PM, because the easiest way not to learn on Duolingo is not to come back the next day. And so, if we don't make the app retentive, you will have no opportunity to engage with our learning features. Now, I do think that there is a long tail of learning, where, if you start to dumb down, and honestly this is something we wrestle with the streak as well, you start to dumb down the experience, and your users aren't actually learning, they're not going to care.\n\n(00:14:20):\nStreaks work best when they're sitting on top of an app that users care about. But yeah, if you don't come learn on Duolingo.... If you don't come back to Duolingo, then you're not learning. We track a lot of this with, the work that we do, we make sure that as we're making changes to the streak, we're not hurting the learning experience and we don't have a ton of interaction with it. So, we're constantly thinking about this, but thank you Luis for saying that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):\nIt makes sense to me. Okay, so lets get into the motherload of learnings from the journey of streaks. So, the first version went from XP to one lesson, talk about the key lessons, insights, and also wrong turns along the way to what we see today.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:15:03):\nDuolingo has very much, has a strong test it philosophy, we're willing to test a lot of different... Honestly, we'd much rather test it than debate it for days and days. So, we actually followed up this experiment with, and this is a little bit later, with hey, what if we make it even easier to extend your streak? And so, we actually tested, hey, if you do one exercise, just one exercise in a lesson will extend your streak. A lot of the insight was good, you look at the funnel, hey, there's a lot of users who are starting but not finishing lessons, they're not extending your streak, the loss aversion doesn't kick in, they don't come back... So, this followed that train of thought. What we realized when we ran this experiment is DAUs moved not one bit. And what we were doing by... And if we go back to unit of measure, we had dumbed down the unit of... Nobody thinks about, oh, I just want to come do one question on Duolingo, nobody thinks about that.\n\n(00:16:05):\nSo, we had a less clear unit of measure that we were basing our streak around, and the users that we were capturing with our streak, you come, you do one or two questions on Duolingo, then you leave, were the least engaged users imaginable. And so, I think that's something also to think about as you're building your streak, is like what is the user that you're solving for? So, not only what is the habit that you're building for, but what is the level of commitment, and that was an example where we over indexed on a type of user who we honestly just weren't going to keep, that was a very easy shutdown decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:39):\nThat's an awesome story, just to comment in that real quick. Just you went, let's just go to the extreme and make it just like streaks, yeah, get everyone going streaks forever, and then... I love that it turned out and it's not bringing users that you want, and it's dumbing down experience. It makes me think of Farmville, where you have to go and harvest your crops every, whatever, hour, that lasts for a bit and then eventually people are like, what the hell am I doing with my life?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:17:04):\nYeah, exactly. We test every, I was looking at the numbers as well, we've run in the last four years, over 600 experiments on the streaks. So, every other day effectively-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:14):\n600, wow.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:17:15):\n... we're running an experiment. And they range from big, like this, changing how the mechanic works, to let's swap a string with another string and see if that copy is better for users. So, we're constantly testing on everything. I do think that, I'd be more careful running that experiment now, at some point your streak gets big enough that, again, I got 9 million users on the streak, I got to be really careful... Those are our best retaining users, you got to be careful. But in the early days of the streak, I'd say test everything. See what... Don't get super caught up in it has to be like this, just test a bunch of stuff and see what speaks most to users. Because I think, again, you will constantly be surprised by the insights that you get from whether you... We shut down about half of our experiments, so half of our experiments lose, we still learned a ton by virtue of running them. So, super, super valuable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:08):\nThat's actually a good success rate, a lot of companies have only 20% of experiments be positive. What's your policy on if it's neutral, do you ship it, or do you kill it?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:18:18):\nIt really depends. If we're adding something and it's neutral, we tend to shut it down because it's just more cognitive load, it's something that we're going to have to start building around, a new UI element that we have to figure out how it fits into our system. I'd say when we do ship a neutral experiment is, something that we have real conviction around, okay, yeah, maybe this was neutral but it's going to give us a new platform to then build on top of, so that experience might be neutral, but now we can build these DAU positive experiments. My general take there is though, in that case, build that in as part of your V1 so that you make sure that at least your hypothesis around this roadmap has play should probably be the case, but in general, shutting down a neutral experiment so you don't introduce more complexity to the app is the way we tend to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):\nMakes sense. All right, what else? What else have you learned along the journey?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:19:13):\nWell, maybe I can talk about a few different ways that we structure, a few different themes that I think we lean on. So, the first is focusing on the zero to seven day user experience. And I would say this is, if you look at whatever our breakdown of experiments are, we run definitely more than average number of experiments on getting users to go from a zero to seven day streak. And a lot of this is because we've looked at the data for our retention curves, and what we found is that once you get to seven days, loss aversion kicks in, and you retain. So, going from a one to a two-day streak, huge jump in retention, two to three day streak, slightly less but still huge and it's up until day seven. Once you hit day seven, it flans out. And it's not to say that if you have a 30-day streak, you're way more attentive than day seven, but not in the order of magnitude that it is from day one through seven.\n\n(00:20:05):\nSo, we do a ton of work to get users to that point where loss aversion kicks in, and then they don't want to lead the app. One of the fun ones that we did, and it's honestly as much about process as it is about the feature itself, was we have a feature called streak goal, and it is... Again, so much of this stuff seems so obvious in retrospect, but it was really novel at the time. We had this idea of like, hey, maybe we'll just goal users to hitting a certain streak length. As you can imagine, this is pretty powerful user psychology, and we started with the simplest version of this. And this is how Duolingo does a lot of our testing. Rather than design the big complex feature for V1, just do the simplest encapsulation of what that feature can be, see if it has legs, and then just add to it iteratively over time, this is partially how we get to 600+ experiments on streaks, they're not all big ones.\n\n(00:21:01):\nBut we started... And it was funny, we actually took a learning from our monetization win teams. One of the strings that they had, the pieces of copy that they had, worked really, really well was, I think it was your 5.6 x more likely to finish the course if you subscribe to Plus. Now, it's Super, our subscription. It was a really good hook that if you really cared, you'd sign up. And so, we had a similar thought, where it's like, oh, let's just tell you how much more likely you are to finish the course if you get a 30-day streak.\n\n(00:21:34):\nAnd so, we started with that, and I think it was like you're seven times more likely to finish the course if you have a 30-day streak, and just that message when you started your streak, I telling you that, was awesome. Huge win. Indicating an outcome... And Duolingo doesn't have, we have a gem economy but we don't actually have, it's all you learning. But being able to actually talk about it in terms of the outcomes that a user would think about, in this case, trying to finish the course, was a huge win. So, this is where we started and we're like, ah, goal setting, all right, we should go much harder on this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:06):\nFound a-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:22:06):\nYeah, we found our thing, and now let's just beat the heck out of it. So, we followed that up with another experiment, where we tested different lengths. So, we test 14 days and 50 days, and we found that they were all good, but they appealed to different users. And so, we started to realize, all right, well, we probably need to be more thoughtful about who we give these different options to. And so, then we followed that experiment up with, all right, let's start with 30 days, and then we're going to let you opt out, we'll say, no, I don't think I can hit it. And our thinking was, and then if you say no, we'll hit you with an easier goal. Because we just wanted to get you to commit to a goal. And this was a fascinating one because it was a good win to give users that easier goal, to try to capture them before they said no, but it was almost just as big a win to add that opt out button.\n\n(00:22:58):\nSo, we tested separately, and I'm a huge fan of testing way too many arms for an experiment, just to be able to isolate your hypotheses, but we captured just what happens if we add an opt-out button, and adding an opt-out button... And you would think, as a PM, oh, now users might not engage with my feature, that's a bad thing, but it was a huge win to let them do that. And the learning here was that this intentionality of saying, no, I want it... Previously it was just a continue button, but now it's like, no, I want to hit 30 days, and having that be an intentional decision for them, yes or no, even though again, this had no impact, or no impact past this screen. Everything that I'm talking about now was just that screen that day, and then was all thrown out. So, that optionality was a huge insight, and so because of that, we built a goal setting feature where you could choose between different goals, giving users that optionality was likewise a huge win.\n\n(00:23:57):\nI'll say one final learning on this, again, you talk about friction, and good and bad friction, we thought once we built a goal picker screen, where you could pick between different streak lengths, we were like, oh, well, let's recommend that users do a harder goal, thinking that okay, well, a harder goal is going to be better retention, and we'll the preselect harder goal for them. And based on all the learnings that I just shared with you, you probably imagine lost pretty significantly, we realized that yes, we could speed users through the screen more by virtue of picking a goal for them, but that act of selecting, I think it's 30 days, I think it's 14 days, was where we were getting so much of the engagement from this feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:39):\nThere's so much human psychology that you all learn through all these experiments of just how to motivate people, what motivates, what demotivates, it feels like you guys should write a book on human psychology and motivation.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:24:51):\nI feel very much like a amateur armchair psychologist with everything that, at least as far as people who want to learn languages on their phone go, I really understand those folks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:03):\nRight. So, one theme I'm hearing here so far is you guys are basically just mining for gold, just looking for a vein in some mine, and once you hit it you're like, ooh, this worked, you just go crazy on just testing all kinds of things to see how far you can take that one little thread.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:25:22):\nYeah, and I think, I shared how this idea came partially from a monetization win that they had, I think there's a lot of, because Duolingo runs... I don't know what percentile we're in, but it's got to be a very high percentile of per capita experiments run for a company, based on company size. We're just constantly learning so many things and there's a really great cross-sharing of monetization say, hey, this thing worked for us, is that something you can use? So, I'd say it's rare that we go into something where it's just like, let's just try something. Typically, we have some insight because of all of these experiments that we've run, that hey, if we do this, I don't know, it's one here, or it's worked here, it's driven this user engagement, if we massage that and try in this scenario, or a different screen, we come in at least with a strong hypothesis of this will work.\n\n(00:26:17):\nA lot of times we do look, and we're like, a lot of the apps that we look at actually are games themselves, so it's like, all right, you're playing Royal Match, or there's the new Pokemon trading card game that I'm spending way too much time on, you look at these games and see what they're doing, and it's really good fodder for what we can do. But a lot of times you're at least going in with a strong hypothesis based on what you've seen work elsewhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:39):\nGot it. So, just to double down on that point, it's not just random experiments, it's here's a hypothesis we're fairly confident, or has a chance to be true, let's try it. It's not just let's just try everything?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:26:49):\nYeah. And I think that how strongly you feel about the hypothesis directly ties to how hard that experiment is. With copy, for instance, we've actually set up really good infrastructure for copy testing. I'm of the opinion that companies should run, as long as you have the user base to do it, copy test constantly. The amount of copy tests that we've had that have won, and I don't know, you just try things and you figure out what wins is definitely legion, and [inaudible 00:27:15] massive wins from little copy changes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:18):\nIs there an example of that, of just the impact?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:27:20):\nGoing back to that goal screen, we used to say Continue, our standard CTA is Continue, and we changed that to Commit To My Goal, and it was a massive win. And again, it was like, okay, users tapping on that, what are we asking them to do? Commit to the goal, what is that going to lead them to do? Commit, not churn. Just that little copy change, that one time, right there, led to huge wins. And copy changes are so cheap, it's just you translate, for us, we have a lot of users all over the world, and a lot of UI languages, but just come up with a bunch of ideas, translate some strings... This is one where the feedback that you'll typically get from Luis. So, all of our changes at Duolingo go through product review that are reviewed by Luis, so Luis reviews every single change that we propose, every experiment that we run.\n\n(00:28:12):\nTypically with copy, he's just like, I don't know, test it, there's nothing better than be told by Luis, I don't think this is going to win, but sure, if you want to. And a lot of times, to his credit, he's right, and a lot of times our intuition was right, but it's just so cheap to do it. I think when the lift is smaller, it's great to have a hypothesis, but you don't need to beat it up too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:36):\nSo, on this thread, I didn't realize Louis reviews everything you're planning to change, and this may be the answer to the question I was going to ask, which is, one of the criticisms of running a product and company this way, of just experimenting constantly with all these micro improvements and changes, is it can lead to something, like a monstrosity of a product and experience that isn't consistent and cohesive, and just that often happens. Is the solution to that having the founder basically review all the changes? Is there anything else y'all do to avoid it becoming Farmville or whatever, is a good example of that?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:29:06):\nYeah, our product review structure where we've got our head of product design, one of the lead, the product management leaders, and then Luis, NPR. And because they see everything, and they have a really high product bar, and so that helps. I think over time we just, as PMs, have to look at, okay, where is our feature headed? And so, we do this with the streak at least on a quarterly basis, to look at, okay, well, what have we learned, how has our streak developed, and how do we imagine this going in near future? It's easy to do, and in some sort of awful local maxima, if you're not constantly looking at your roadmap and you don't have a clear strategy. For me it's like, if you have a clear strategy where your feature is going, hopefully all of those A/B tests are not just done to get some cheap gain, they're done with a long-term goal in mind.\n\n(00:30:03):\nI do think though, and we do this every now and then with the streak, eventually you just hit a local maxima, and you say, you talked about launching neutral experiments, this is a great example, where it's like all right, cool, now we need to throw a bunch of this stuff out, based on all the learnings, can we reset this real estate, can we reset this UI, reset this feature, in such a way that is just as good as what we have now but is way more plain or simple, that we can, again, start to layer on? Those are really hard experiments to get to win obviously, because they are so optimized, but they're really important to do, otherwise, yeah, you just end up with a kitchen sink of a feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:39):\nOne other tidbit I just want to mention, an advantage you all have that other companies don't have is people want to learn a language, and so getting pushed to come back to an app for something that they want to do, it's not an advantage a lot of products have. So, anything you want to add there, of just like this is why Duolingo might be a little different from what you're working on.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:31:03):\nThat is definitely a benefit, if I had an app... And that this is actually why I think a lot of mobile games do streaks differently, because to say that you played a mobile game, and as somebody who plays a lot of mobile games, that you've done it for 3000 days in a row, I don't know, maybe that hits a little bit different than you've learned Spanish for 3000 days in a row. I think the comparison set is much larger though, than a lot of companies give themselves credit for, and I think that there's... There's a lot of ways that companies think about their... There are very few companies I imagine out there in the world saying, oh, we don't do some degree of good for our users... Even if it's like a game, it's like, I don't know, you're giving somebody a moment away from the craziness of their lives.\n\n(00:31:47):\nAnd so, I do think though that is contingent on companies who are going to figure out if a streak works for them, to figure out how can you frame the streak in such a way that a user does feel good about it. And it's easier for a Duolingo, but I think there's creative ways to phrase this for users. The other thing maybe just on that that I'll say is, the streak works really well for Duolingo because with language learning it's really hard to see day-to-day progress in becoming more fluent. And fluency is not even the right word, it's like becoming better at Spanish or whatever, it is a years long process for someone to get better at a language.\n\n(00:32:25):\nDuolingo makes it easier, but you still got to put in thousands of hours if you're going to reach C1 or C2 fluency, and that is really hard to track on a day-to-day, and so the streak works really well for us because we might not be able to tell you, hey, you now know 0.01% more Spanish, but we can show you, hey, you've gotten your streak a little bit higher. And so, I think this works particularly well when you're an app that is doing something that's going to be sensed or felt over a longer term to help contextualize that progress in a way that makes more sense, or at least feels more tangible to a user.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:02):\nGreat, that was a great context. Empowering to a lot of companies that aren't necessarily doing language learning. Okay. So, it took us on a long tangent away from lessons and experiments you ran along the journey of iterating on the streak. So, a few things you've shared so far is just, it started with this XP idea, and then went to a lesson, then you iterated on ways to make it simpler, maybe harder, you added streak goals, where you commit to I'm going to hit a certain goal of streak. What else? What else have you found that has worked, didn't work, lessons learned?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:33:32):\nAgain, sticking with this one to seven day streak, the idea of a streak, particularly probably to this audience, is obvious. Like, oh, it's a streak, it just counts how many days. We've realized over time that a lot of users do not understand how a streak works, and it can be as small as, well, I don't understand how streak freezes work, or I don't... Like my mom the other day was talking to you about it, she's like, \"Oh, I didn't use Duolingo and I come back and my streak's still there.\" So, there's certain elements of the feature that we can do better at explaining, but even what a streak is, it's tracking how many days that I've used the app, yeah, the more that we can make the feature easily comprehensible to users, the more retentive it is. And we've run a number of experiments to do this.\n\n(00:34:23):\nYou asked about early easy copy changes that we made. Actually, this is my first win experiment when I joined Duolingo was, when you start a streak, we have little copy at the bottom of the screen that just, I don't know, it's like flavor copy, we use it to celebrate you, or give you context, and I ran some tests that just tried to in eight words explained what a streak was, that was it. And it was a massive win because it really dumbed down here is exactly how the streak worked, and it really helped users just understand what they needed to do. And I think this is something that's like, you constantly got to remind yourself, particularly if you work in tech and you're building cool tech features, but your user base is not a bunch of tech workers, to think about, all right, who is my audience? And for us it's not just tech workers, it's not people in America, it's people all over the world of all ages of all cultures, and so making sure that your feature is even something as simple as the streak is understandable is critical.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:27):\nWhat was the actual copy, do you remember?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:35:29):\nIt was... I think it's still on the app, it's like, \"Start a day to extend your streak, but miss a day and it resets,\" something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:38):\nThat makes sense to me. Very clear.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:35:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):\nIn eight words, I love that. Okay. And then, when you say massive win by the way, just to give people a reference point, what does that look like? What is a massive win in this scale?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:35:50):\nWell, and it's funny, and this was four years ago, but I think it was in the order of magnitude of over 10,000 DAUs for us, and actually, maybe a small bit of context. So, Duolingo really cares about the metric CURR current user retention rate, and actually our first ever Duolingo post with Lenny was the newsletter that our former head of product wrote, Jorge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:11):\nStill the single most popular newsletter post of all time in my newsletter, across 300 plus-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:36:15):\nI would highly recommend that if you were interested in this, give it a read. To summarize, basically, what we found is that, if we wanted to drive DAUs, and Duolingo cares, our growth North Star is DAUs, the metric that is most effective, where a percentage change in that metric is most effective at driving DAUs is current user retention rate. And this is just users who are not new or resurrected, getting them to come back tomorrow. And so, most of the work that our teams do, our retention-based teams do is focused on CURR. And so, the retention team that I lead focused on CURR, it just so happens the streak is the best feature at driving CURR. And so, this experiment was the biggest CURR win that we had had, and it was like a top three CURR win, anyway for us. Just this little copy. And that's why I say, test copy 1000 different ways, sometimes it's not the big beautiful feature that's going to drive the huge gains, sometimes it's just something simple as a few words.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:15):\nI love this. Okay, so you said 10,000 DAUs, I think that references you guys measure incremental impact and absolute numbers of new daily users you're going to drive attributed to that experiment, is what it sounds like.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:37:28):\nYeah, and we do both. We'll also look at, a lot of times I'll look at, for retention, day one versus day seven versus day 14, a lot of what I'm looking for is for us to have a better day 14 impact than better day one impact because it means that users are retaining better over time. This is particularly for users that would see a feature multiple times. I just like absolute DAU numbers because as long as you're controlling for different biases, like a recency bias or a novelty bias, it's a really easy way to just have an absolute comparison. You start to look at percentage changes and then it's influenced by who your treatment, how many users saw the experiment, but at least an absolute number is easier, in my mind, to start comparing.. Again, there are pitfalls with it, but we find that that's a pretty useful way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:20):\nThat lesson comes up a lot on this podcast, and that approach to experiment.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:38:25):\n[inaudible 00:38:25].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:25):\nSo, yeah, you're in good company. Quick tangent, if there's not an answer to this, no problem, coming back to the idea of just experimenting like crazy and not creating a product that nobody wants to use anymore, is there an example of an experiment that was positive that you all decided, no, we don't actually think this is what we want in the product, they ended up not shipping?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:38:47):\nRetention doesn't only work on the streak, although you would think... Most of our work is the streak. We've touched a lot of different surfaces over the years and there was one experiment that we launched that, we talked about XP earlier, in the lesson, the only UI elements are a progress bar at the top, and then how many hearts you have. So, we keep it really simple, and this very much speaks to the design philosophy of Duolingo, which is simpler UI is better, and we decided, hey, let's add XP in there. And so let's show your XP ticking up as you're going through a lesson, that's going to make the user feel good, it's going to show you what you've earned, you're going to be less likely to quit, all of these good reasons to do it. And then you finish the lesson and then we'll show you've collected all this XP.\n\n(00:39:29):\nAnd it won, the hypothesis was a good one. But we realized, and I remember having this conversation with Luis, is like, cool, this is our most important screen in the app, it is our lesson, it is where users learn, and the focus here is on learning. And now you've added this other thing up there that could be distracting for users. And I think the question, we talked about roadmaps and strategy here, the question that he had for me, and I didn't have a good answer for at the time, was like, so what else are you going to do with this? What's your iteration ideas? Where's this going to go? Is this going to make the lesson experience more gamified? And what we realized is that, honestly, it was just an easy engagement win idea, but we had touched our most sacred space in the app to do that.\n\n(00:40:16):\nAnd so, that was a case where it's like, yeah, it was a nice win, but we'd added that UI element, and at least at the time it was less clear what we would do with it and we realized that long term it was just going to get in the way, and we'd rather, for simplicity's sake, pause that, shut it down, and keep the lesson to be a little bit of learning sanctuary it was. Now, it's funny, nowadays I think we actually have enough XP based mechanics and fun things that we can do, that I think actually a lot of the beliefs about the in-lesson experience have changed, such as something like that could work, but at the time didn't feel good to keep that around.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):\nThat is an awesome example. Hopefully we have time to talk about how the team operates, where my mind goes is like, oh, but you have all these PMs and teams that want to show impact, and the performance reviews, and all that stuff, and you're not shipping something, they're like, oh look, we did a win. So, I want to chat about that later, but let's keep going on things you've learned and things that didn't work along the journey.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:41:15):\nThe other thing that I'll call out with the streak, it's like we have the... The image of the streak is this flame. And we have the streak flame, and it's very much core to our iconography. It's important to acknowledge that that's a metaphor for a retention mechanic. The idea of keeping a flame lit. And again, I think we've established the flame is for a lot of users as sort of their understanding of a streak, which is great, but there's a lot of people in different cultural context and different stages of life, where the idea of keeping a flame lit to show your commitment to something makes less sense. We did some UXR in India many years ago, and this was something that just did not resonate at all there, which was a really interesting learning. And that's something it's like, again, depending upon what your user base is, the more global UXR you can do to understand how users are actually understanding and experience your feature, the better, because you just, again, encounter insights like this.\n\n(00:42:12):\nAnd so, even our screen design, we used to have a flame, it was mostly this flame that would light up every day. But again, it was like an indication of a metaphor for a mechanic, and when we redesigned it, we did this, Kurt, one of our animators, did this awesome odometer animation where it's like your number would tick every day... It looked good, but from a product perspective, what was cool is we actually focused the design on the screen to show your number going up, and then it would say seven day streak, eight day streak. And I think that as you're thinking about designing around a streak, don't get too caught up into what is this the beautiful story that you're trying to tell, at the expense of it being a really comprehensible feature. And so, as you're thinking about product design, making that product design a clear distillation of this is what we're actually tracking, form should follow a function here, was a learning for us. And you'll see that now in a lot of places where we're showing streak, we're really leading with the number, not necessarily the flame.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):\nThat's a theme that I'm hearing again and again is clarity, don't obsess with making it too clever, and don't ever think it, just clarity has a big impact.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:43:29):\nClarity also doesn't have to come at the expense of delight. And this is something where you hit a milestone and Duo gets, it becomes, we call him a Phoenix Duo, and he becomes awesome, and lights on fire, and I think there are things that you can do to still make the experience really exciting and delightful and celebratory, and I would not lose that, but just don't do it at the expense... And I think it's also about figuring out, you can get away with doing more of this for users who are deeper into their streak experience than users who are starting, where it's like your goal for the one-day streak user is just to make sure, do they understand how this feature works?\n\n(00:44:06):\nEven something... Again, just another random experiment. At the bottom of the streak screen we have a calendar, and over the years it just looks more and more calendar-like, and that is simply because we find that the more we make it look like a calendar, days on top, little circles, the check... The more we make it look like calendar, the more that people realize, hey, this is a daily mechanic. And so, think about the screen holistically, but every single thing that you're doing on the screen, how can you use it to communicate what is the point of this feature? How does it work?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. I use Coda every day to coordinate my podcasting and newsletter workflows.

Actually, I'm going to show you one of the most thoughtful gifts that anybody has ever given to me, this is our Duolingo Serenity, or Streak Serenity Prayer, my co-lead, Antonia-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):\nIt's like knitted, right?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:46:05):\n... [inaudible 00:46:05] this for me. It's amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:06):\nWow.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:46:06):\nAnd so it says, \"Luis, grant me the serenity to accept the flexibility I need, the courage to reach perfection when I can, and the wisdom to celebrate regardless.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):\nAw.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:46:15):\nAnd that actually is kind of our strategy with the streaks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):\nI love the show and tell by the way, that was great.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:46:20):\nYeah. Well, I guess for podcast listeners, we'll have to get an image somewhere. This idea of flexibility versus perfection, and then regardless, celebration, is core to how we think about the streak. Because I think for the streak for us, it's very much a bend not break. If you're going to miss a day, I'd rather you come back, having missed that day, to an intact streak, but if you don't have to miss a day, I'd much rather you don't, I'd much rather you come back and use the app every day. So, that thing on flexibility though, that's almost certainly been the biggest, from a mechanic perspective, the biggest DAU driver. One of the earliest experiments we ran was going from you used to only be able to have one streak freeze and then we let you have either two or three. So, we tested two different arms. It was, again, another huge DAU win.\n\n(00:47:12):\nThis actually is funny, it was something that... And this is, again, a callback to that growth model post from Jorge. It actually was really bad for CURR because we were basically saying, hey, you can take a day off, and that's okay, but it was really good for, this is going to be like Alphabet Soup, [inaudible 00:47:31], a weekly active user return rate. So, basically, users who had taken a day off, we were getting them to come back more at higher rates, and so it made up for our losses in CURR. But effectively, what this meant is that, why two streak freezes work better than one was, I don't know, sometimes people just need a little bit more flexibility than one day. But again, the really interesting insight of this experiment was that three streak freezes was actually no better than two streak freezes. And there were two competing things here, and I think this is important if you're going to build a streak to figure out what your flexibility mechanic is.\n\n(00:48:03):\nWe were getting more users to return after longer times away to an intact streak. But if you start taking three days off from any habit, it's just going to be less likely that you return even four days later. And so, we had these competing things where more users might be returning to a streak, but a lot of users were also just not coming back, we were training them to take more time off. So, that flexibility, what's the right amount of... We've again, this is another area we've run hundreds of experiments on, what is the right amount of flexibility? And we are constantly surprised here. I still don't have the answer for at every point in your streak journey how much flexibility you need. One thing that I can say with certainty though is, give more flexibility when a user is starting their streak. Again, one of our biggest streak freeze experiment wins... I feel like I'm constantly saying this, one of our biggest wins, but they all were really, really big.\n\n(00:48:59):\nOne of our biggest streak freeze wins was when you start a new streak, we give you two streak freezes. And again, it's so funny to think back, it's like how are we not doing this to begin with? But at the time, the streak freeze was an overly gamified mechanic, you had to buy them with gems, that's our in-app currency, because we wanted the whole idea of this to feel like it was really something you earned, that there was a little bit of pain to getting that streak freeze. And so, we tested though, what if we just give users when they start off their streak two streak freezes, and holy smokes to that win.\n\n(00:49:33):\nAnd it's sort of obvious now, in retrospect, but if you have a one or a two or a three-day streak, it's really easy just to let it die and restart, again, you need to get to seven days, what we've seen in the data, for it to really lock in. And so, giving users more flexibility so that it's harder to lose their streak initially, and then conversely, and this is what we keep learning, eventually, once people get on long streaks, you don't want to give them as much flexibility. Because there's a lot of times where, yeah, users don't... And I'm like this, I've got a 400-day streak. Note that that is a lot less time than I've been at Duolingo, I have lost and restarted streaks a lot of times at my time at Duolingo.\n\n(00:50:14):\nBut you start getting on long streaks, and you really care about this feature, you really care about your streak. And most people, as long as you're not backpacking through, I don't know, the back country of Utah, you'll be in a place where you can get service. And so, figuring out who is the user that actually could use Duolingo, and not conditioning them to start taking days off that they didn't otherwise need to do is important to figure out where that line is for your feature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:46):\nThis is fascinating. You can also buy a streak, right? With money. That's a feature, right?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:50:51):\nYeah. And it's funny, this is also something that we [inaudible 00:50:54]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:53):\nYou can buy a freeze, sorry, not a streak.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:50:56):\nYeah. So, you can buy a streak freeze, and the way it works is you can buy gems, and then you can use those gems to buy a streak... And this is something we wrestle with. We're actively working on an experiment, right now that's having a small hit to revenue, but it's a really nice win for retention, and I think it's actually worth thinking about from day one, as you're building a streak, do you see this more as a monetization feature, or do you see this more as a retention feature? What's the role of monetization in this? What's the role of retention? And I think for us it started out much more organically, and so we have a lot of monetization hooks, that again, is the retention PM, I would love to get rid of. But again, it's sort of part of how the streak works right now. And so, we always have this tension of, hey, if we start to make it harder to buy streak freezes, then fewer people buy them, buy gems to buy them, and so there's this more convoluted series of impacts that happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:49):\nYeah, no, I love that people wanting to buy streak freeze is like the ultimate sign of how much streaks matter.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:51:57):\nYeah, streak freeze is the other big one that we've recently demonetized, or introduced a free option for, is getting back a lost streak. So, used to lose a streak, we had a feature, in the day, back in the day, called Streak Repair, we'd give you your streak back, you had to pay gems. But what we found that worked way better was a feature called Earn Back, and this is basically where you would have to do a certain number of lessons, as long as you came back within a window soon after losing your streak, do a few lessons and we just give you your streak back. And that was such a retention winner. And again, what we thought about was it feels like you've earned it so much more when you've done... You deserve to have your streak back, we haven't cheapen the streak because you've done something.\n\n(00:52:44):\nAnd in this sense, this idea of cheapening the streak is something, like from a philosophical... Philosophy of the streak. From a philosophical level, we wrestle with all the time, of, cool, we're giving out more streak freezes, at what point do we cross the line and users start to realize their streak means nothing? Now, everything that we've seen, users are totally cool with using streak freezes and still thinking about their streak is this meaningful thing, but my co-lead, Antonia, who made that awesome cross-stitch for me, she is the keeper for us of the sanctity of the streak. And a lot of times as we... And I think this is really important to have, as you're thinking about building your streak. You can almost always get engagement wins, up to a certain point, by just cheapening the streak, making it easier to extend, letting users have more flexibility, but you kind of got to hold the line at some point.\n\n(00:53:30):\nAnd it's not clear where that line is. And once you... You talk about one-way doors or two-way doors, there's a point where you go too far and it's a one-way door, and all of a sudden those users, those 9 million users on one-year streaks don't care about their streak anymore. And that is, I don't know, again, retention PM perspective, that'd be an extinction level event for us. I don't want all of these users to stop caring about their streak. And so, to have somebody who is invested in the sanctity of this streak, and for us it's Antonia and Luis, he's very good about this, is really important, just so you make sure you don't go too far.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:06):\nThat's an awesome insight. So, to protect... And push notifications I think are another example of this in general for companies, how much is too much? Because everyone is just like, let's just send another push, it's fine, just one more. And so, your solution to that is a person is like the keeper, and almost the gatekeeper, plus the founder, of how far is too far.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:54:26):\nIt's good if you can have that. I think push notifications are also easier because there's a lot of things you can do around, all right, we'll send a budget cap for how many notifications we'll send, you can-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:36):\nIt's like [inaudible 00:54:38] policy.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:54:38):\nYeah, policies. But I think with a lot of things, at least for the streak, it's harder to create policies for in the same way, a lot of it has to be done based on feel, and so you just got to use your best judgment at times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):\nSweet. Okay. Any other, maybe one or two more lessons from this journey of what streaks has become today.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:54:56):\nYou mentioned notifications, and I've mentioned this a few times. One... It's funny, you tend to think of, exactly as you say, you can just always send another notification, it's going to be some win, and at some point it'll be a bad experience, but it's tough to see that. There's actually a notification that we... So, we send two notifications related to your core streak each day, the first is a practice reminder, we send it, this is actually an interesting insight, 23 and a half hours after you practice the day before. Whoa, that is a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:21):\n23 and a half. Okay,\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:55:23):\nSo, basically, if you practice at noon today, we'll send it to you at 11:30 AM tomorrow, and we have done-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):\nAnd it's, because it's like assuming they are free in that time the day before, maybe they'll be free at the same time?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:55:36):\nAnd we actually moved, we used to let users set this practice reminder time, and our thinking was, cool, you're going to say 7:00 PM, that's when I really want to extend my streak each day, and then you know what? I say this to somebody with two kids, life gets in the way, life always gets in the way, and when you think you're going to practice will change, your life will change, whatever. And what we realize is the best indicator of when you should practice was when did you practice the day before. We could almost certainly get more detailed, we have tried a bunch of ways to have much more complex logic, and what always wins is 23 and a half hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:07):\nThat's so interesting. Revealed behavior versus stated.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:56:10):\nYeah, exactly. So, again, we send this practice reminder 23 and a half hours later, the other thing that we'll do though is we'll send a, what we call a streak saver, and this is at 10:00 at night, if you have not extended your streak, we'll send you a message saying, hey, it's your last chance, this is it, if you don't extend your streak. And you would think that, that's kind of spammy, that's kind of annoying, to get a notification from an app at 10:00 PM, but what we found is because people care about their streak, their streak is this good thing that they attach positive emotions, that they don't really want to lose, that notification reminding them, hey, come back and... People see this by and large as a positive notification and not a negative notification.\n\n(00:56:53):\nObviously, it serves our purpose as well of getting users to come back and not lose their streaks, but again, I think if you can think about your notification strategy related to what is the feature that it's tied to, how do users perceive that? You can almost certainly, not get away with more, but you can be thoughtful about notification load, and when to send notifications, and again, for us, this late night message, that's also highly impactful, super good, is actually something that could be perceived as spammy, but a lot of our users really do... Somebody who, it's often late at night, and I work here, and I'm like, oh, forgot to do my... I was think about Duolingo all day, here it is, 11:15, and I still haven't done it, that message is really powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:36):\nYeah. It has saved me many times, I totally know that message, and I love that it's a late night message from an app, very rarely do you actually, are happy about that, and I love that this actually is a good example where-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:57:51):\nIt's really funny, all of the stories that you hear about people extending their streak, if you look around a Duolingo party, where it's like 11:30, 11:45, all the Duolingo employees, they're are doing their lesson at the last minute. You always see these pictures of people in the club doing, or at a concert doing Duolingo, and yeah, because it's like otherwise you're going to use a streak freezer, or God forbid you will lose your streak.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:14):\nThat's so funny. Okay, anything else? And if there's more than one more, definitely share, but any other really interesting lessons or wrong turns or insights?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (00:58:23):\nI talked about streak freezes, and we've done a lot with streak freeze, but I think if you're going to make flexibility a thing, it's probably also useful thinking about how do you celebrate perfection. And so, we have a feature that we have, it is the simplest thing in the world, it's called Perfect Streak. And it's just, if you don't use the streak freeze for a few days, we make your streak look gold, and we make your little progress bar on the calendar just look a little bit nicer. There's no reward for doing it, you don't get anything other than this nice little indication, and it is awesome. It is a simple feature, it is ultra not complex, and it is really powerful, not only for getting users to, as a bit of a reward, they'd be hey, get to seven days without using a streak freeze and your streak becomes perfect, but it's also a really nice indication of users who aren't using streak freezes.\n\n(00:59:14):\nHere is the thing that if you don't use a streak freeze, which, again candidly, I would love for you never to use a streak freeze, if you don't use a streak freeze, your streak will stay perfect. It's funny, we actually just, we're constantly responding to bug reports about the streak. It is... I swear to God, we have the best infrastructure around this feature because it is so important. We had an employee who lost her, I think a four-month perfect streak, and it was a big deal for her because she did her lesson, and she was crossing international dateline, there was a bunch of stuff going on that was like, it was just kind of weird in our backend. But people start to care about perfection as much as they do their streak, and for that person it was a big deal when they lost their perfect streak. And so, this is just an example of, look, if you're going to go after flexibility, which is good, finding a way to pull users back into perfection is a really important counterweight to have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:13):\nWhat I'm imagining is you guys need a Amazon style chatbot that just gives you the streak back, it's just like, okay, here you go.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:00:20):\nWe have very much... So, we have, if people lose their streak, there's ways to get in contact with us, but we've actually thought about that, where it's like, okay, we should just build a self-service feature, and if we think that your excuse is good enough, whatever, we'll just [inaudible 01:00:34].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):\nYeah, yeah. [inaudible 01:00:35].\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:00:36):\nBecause again, I'd much rather you be on a streak than have lost it, particularly [inaudible 01:00:41].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nRight. But it also can feel that easy. I love this, I also love this point about just the power of the animation and user experience having impact, that's really interesting. Is that something you find often, just celebrating and making it feel really amazing without copy or any feature is just like, holy, you're awesome?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:01:02):\nThis is another thing where it's like when users care about the feature, using not only animation, haptics, sound effects, using... And it's funny, we don't have sound effects on the streak, this is probably something we'll look at in the not too distant in future, but haptics are something we have done a lot of testing on-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:18):\nLike the phone vibrating in various ways.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:01:20):\nYeah, exactly, your phone, there being a really cool haptic pattern as you extend your streak, all of this stuff wins. And it's cool because I think it wins... There's a few reasons. One is it just makes you feel good, you get some cool moment in your streak, and we celebrate you, and we celebrate you in this visual way, and your phone's buzzing, it just feels awesome. The other thing it does is it causes you to pause on that screen, and I think there's this desire, as you think through a lot of, as PMs think through, oh, how can I get users through this funnel as painlessly as possible? I talked about [inaudible 01:01:52]. There's a lot of times where I don't, I want you to stop. I want you to stop and land on the screen.\n\n(01:01:56):\nYou got to be careful not to do this for too many screens, but the one big ones, sometimes I just want you to pause there and enjoy the moment. If I can get you to enjoy the moment more, you're going to care more about your streak, and you're going to be coming back tomorrow. And so, animations that are cool, and that cause you to really soak it in, haptics that feel good, all of that comes together to make you really focus on that moment, all of that just gets users more connected to their streak. So, animation in the right times works well and it's something we've had win quite a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):\nWho designs the haptic stuff? Is there a haptic designer?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:02:33):\nFor the longest time it would be a product designer, or actually, it initially started as the engineer would be like, all right, would cobble together haptics, based on what they felt good, then it became a product design role, where they would use their best judgment. We actually just recently required an animation studio, Hobbs in Detroit, and now they are the sort of keepers of, they do a lot of motion design work, haptics very close to that, and so they do a lot of that. I do remember trying to hire for a while a haptics contractor, like haptics design, and it was the saddest hiring I've ever done, because it was just, I don't know, it was such a specific... I don't know. I just went through a lot of people who, it's just a really tricky space of kind of sound effects, kind of motion design, sort of technical...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:22):\nYeah, such a unique role.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:03:25):\nVery unique specific skill set.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nRight. And there's very few apps that really need this this deeply, so you're almost creating this person.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:03:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:33):\nThat is fascinating. That's like a whole podcast on its own. By the way, I was going to say as you're talking about this, I love that it's a win to celebrate people that don't lose their streak, you introduce this way to make it flexible, and that's a big win, and then you go the opposite direction of, if you don't use this feature, you also feel even better.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:03:51):\nWell, and it's funny, you talked about the danger of feature bloat, or we sort of talked about the danger of feature bloat, this is actually something I'm constantly thinking about with this. We have the streak, but then we also have the perfect streak, and we count how many weeks you've had a perfect streak. Well, all of a sudden we have two streak numbers that are competing with each other. It's funny, we actually don't introduce the concept of a perfect streak until after you've hit seven days, and some of this is just because the cognitive load of additional streak features. A lot of our cooler streak features, you got to get on a long enough streak. And not to say we haven't tested it because we have, because we test everything, introducing these features earlier, but what we've found is that pretty universally they lose when we introduce too many things, too many concepts to users too early in the experience, it's just hard for them to manage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:39):\nOkay, sweet. I know that we can go down this track for hours and hours, there's endless learnings about all the things you all have done along the journey. I want to shift to talking about how your team operates. So, there's a lot of threads you touched on of just how a team can do this so well, shift 600 experiments, as you said, continue to find opportunity. What are some maybe lessons or advice you'd have for folks that are like, oh wow, I want to work more like this, from your team's experience, how does your team to operate that folks can learn from?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:05:13):\nYeah, maybe just a little bit of context. Duolingo cares a lot about... So, most of our teams are metric-based teams. So, we do the most work with streak, but the metric, what we really care about at the end of the day is CURR, and DAUs, because we see that DAUs hit CURR. And so, when you can be really laser focused on, my goal each quarter is to make this metric go up, I think it's much easier to make sure that you're working on the highest ROI thing. I think when you think more about like, oh, I want to make this feature better, I think it's easier to get lost in what better means, and how you think about better. And so, I do think that having a really strong degree of focus as a team on what is the metric that I'm caring about, and how is that directing my efforts is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:59):\nVersus feature-oriented. So, basically your teams are structured around a metric/a goal/outcome versus we own this feature, or this product.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:06:07):\nSo, retention owns streak, I guess, but that's only because we've seen streak drive CURR better than any feature. But we are not, we have this IAP hook with our streak freeze purchases, there are other teams that work on, that can and have worked on the streak, because it's not ours to say, no, no, no, we do all the iterations here, we just know that it drives our metric better. In the same way that leaderboards, we have a team that focuses on how much time you spent, we want users to spend more time on Duolingo so they're learning more. Leaderboards is the best vector for doing it, so that team does a lot of leaderboards work, but every now and then I have an idea that I think will be highly retentive, and I will go in, and I'll pitch to them, and then we'll do some change to the leaderboard to make it more retentive.\n\n(01:06:53):\nBut I do think having that clear metric of we're trying to drive CURR not we're trying to just make this feature better, helps at least make sure, give the team clear marching orders, and that focus I think is really good for prioritizing backlog.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:07):\nCool. This is a really important point, this is the same way Airbnb worked, when I worked there for a long time, is it's, here's a goal that we want your team to be responsible for, you can work on any product you need to hit this goal, as you said, often various products are most connected to what you're doing, but what you're describing is, even though a team's kind of... I imagine you own it from a [inaudible 01:07:29] perspective, and you're like are the shepherd of this part of the feature because it hits your goal, helps your goal most. But any other team can come in and be like, hey Jackson, we need to work on some streak stuff to help with learning, you're like, go for it. Just a tangent there. Do they work really closely with your team if they want to do some work in the code? How does that work logistically?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:07:49):\nYeah. If you are, again, this is where I say there's soft ownership, we're not against teams doing things to the streak, but if we're going to do something given we probably have multiple quarters worth of a roadmap around the streak... I say probably, we do. Multiple quarters of roadmap for what we can do to the streak, if other teams want to come and mess with it, okay, we got to just figure out how is that going to work with what our plans for the streak were, how do we make sure a lot of times when teams are coming in thinking, hey, let's do this to the streak, they're in context that we might have, and so there's as much of a much simpler version of what we're doing now, a bit of a knowledge sharing, of saying, all right, well, this is what we think about the streak, this is what we've seen work, hasn't worked, how does that influence some of the hypothesis that you have. And so, I think getting that really... Making sure the juice is worth the squeeze.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):\nGood old-fashioned product management work right there.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:08:34):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:35):\nCool. What else is interesting about how you all operate and how you all work to achieve this sort of success?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:08:41):\nAgain, my team lead runs, Antonia runs the most... A really process, if you're going to run this experiments, you have to be really process-oriented and really thoughtful about which experiments am I going to run when, how is that going to set up the next one, there's heavy Jira automation, I think sometimes the Atlassian suite makes my eyes bleed, but there's a lot of times where that degree of process helps the team unblock engineers and make them move really fast. And so, making sure that you have really good process around how are you going to run so many experiments, it's worth investing in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):\nCan you follow that thread actually? Just when you say that, what does that look like? What are some elements of that process to make this work efficiently?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:09:25):\nAll the way down to, really detailed roadmaps around, all right, we're running this experiment is based on the results of this experiment, or might hook into an element of this feature, how do we make sure that we're lining up implementation on this so that as soon as this thing runs and we're ready to go, we can start rolling out the next one. I hate features just sitting around and us not, again, continuing that thread. So, it's not just thinking about what's our engineering bandwidth, but also what's the design bandwidth to make sure that we have the next iteration of this feature ready to go. We're planning months out, as we think about these feature iterations, even small ones, feature iterations, because when you lose cycles, not pushing on a feature, it's just sort of lost opportunity. And so, everything from being thoughtful about engineering roadmaps to design roadmaps to product roadmaps, all of that needs to come together in a system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):\nSo, essentially, mapping dependencies across function, and you're saying in Jira you can do this.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:10:25):\nYou can do a lot of it in Jira, there is a non-zero amount of Google Docs that we have, that sometimes does things a little bit... I don't know, sometimes it just looks a little bit nicer, it's a little more flexible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):\nYeah. [inaudible 01:10:38].\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:10:37):\nBut Jira is our, it is where the motherload of process is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):\nGreat. Okay. What else?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:10:44):\nAnother thing that I'll just say is, we really resist the urge to do the big V1. And I think this is, I shared the streak goal example, where, a lot of times when we're exploring something we will say, okay, well, that's cool, how do we strip away a bunch of stuff and figure out what our core hypothesis is? And then, just ship that thing first as a V1. Because it's easy, and I've found this time and time again, it's easy to add things, features that make them win, I've worked in retention engagement long enough, I can add, I know enough things to pull, and bells to add, and whistles to make something win, but there's a lot of times where it's like cool, t [inaudible 01:11:27] because all the whistles you added, not because of what your core hypothesis was, and a lot of times if you can just really simplify what the feature is, it's also much easier to ship, it's easier to design.\n\n(01:11:37):\nYou're not designing for a whole system, you're designing for something much simpler. And so, getting everybody to think that way, allows us to end up shipping faster, shipping simpler, designing faster, getting faster approval, getting insight, and then doing what I talked about with streak goal, being able to run iteration after iteration after iteration, add these things iteratively. And then not only by doing this are you able to move faster, but you get confidence at each step of the way, that, hey, my series of hypotheses is actually born out. Or if it's not, cool, then we're going to drop that part of the feature, and then just ship what actually matters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):\nIf I can try to summarize the broad lesson so far that I'm hearing, and maybe you would've shared this, but I'm just thinking, if I were to try to design a company to operate, that we all operate, you essentially map all the levers that drive the business. So, you have this mapping of all the metrics that drive up to growth and daily active users. CURR ended up being the biggest specific metric to drive growth long term, so there's imagining a tree of all the opportunities you could work on, you found this is what is most connected to our growth. You basically just start mining, I don't know if mining is the right metaphor, but just looking for things that move that specific metric.\n\n(01:13:04):\nYou just look and poke and explore, and then once you find one, you just go real deep on trying a lot of different... You come up with a hypothesis, and a strategy of here's how we think we can do this, and how we can move this, and then you just try a bunch of stuff. There's also this element of the Arrested Development quote, \"There's always money in the banana stand,\" comes to mind, where it's just keep working on, see there's more, there's going to be more opportunity at this.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:13:29):\nWhen I joined Duolingo, the PM that I took over for, Anton, who used to lead the retention team, I remember saying, \"Dude, the streak, it just counts up, you guys have been testing on it for years, how much more work can we do on the streak?\" And he was like, Jackson, you child... He didn't say exactly this, but this is how I felt it. Like, Jackson, you child, we're not even 30% of the way optimized. And four years later, I say that with such conviction, we are so far away from... We've made a ton of strides, but we are still so far away, and every quarter where we ship a ton of wins and improvements to the streak, it just continues to prove to me that there is so much more to be done.\n\n(01:14:11):\nSo, I think your framing of it is... And I would say there's a lot of thought that goes into, again, I talk about the strength of the hypothesis that you have to have as you start to build out larger feature strategy, I do think it's really important to not just do a bunch of random stuff but do it with intent, with a goal in mind, otherwise, you do end up in these local maximas. But yeah, there's still a bunch of stuff that we haven't tried that I think we have high confidence in working out and so we'll keep doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:45):\nAre there any other, say, lasting lessons from this journey that if someone were to try to operate this way, build streaks into their product, anything you'd recommend?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:14:55):\nYeah, I really do think it starts with... Streaks are an engagement hack. You can make your app more retentive, I'm almost positive, almost every app out there can make it more retentive. It is loss aversion, that is, again, armchair psychologist Jackson, it's just a thing that works on humans. But if your app is not something that users want to use every day, or whatever cadence you want your app to be, to work on, it's going to be, you're only going to get so much from that streak, and honestly, it's probably going to distract you from what really should matter, which is making your app something that people want to use every day.\n\n(01:15:35):\nAnd so, if you start focusing on the streak but you haven't made that an enjoyable experience, you're just going to waste a lot of time, honestly. And so, I think making sure that you have your core loop of your app figured out, that it is giving value to users, it is something that they want to come back to every day, that really sets the stage for something to layer a streak on. So, resist the temptation, if you don't think you've reached that point, to go too hard down the path of streak.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:03):\nThat's a really good point. Just like a streak is not going to solve your problems if people don't actually care about the core value you're providing.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:16:09):\nNo, and honestly, it'll probably cause more problems if what you end up focusing on is how do I make the streak highly engaging, but your app is... You're wasting time that could otherwise be better spent on solving more critical problems. So, that's one learning, the other thing that I'll say is, we met with one of our board members, Bing, Bing Gordon, a few weeks, or a few months ago rather, and he had this comment where he was just like, \"The reason why users care about your streak so much is because you care about your streaks much.\" You being Duolingo. The reason why users care about our streak so much is because Duolingo cares about the streaks so much. And we're like, what do you mean? Well, he's like, well, after every session you see a big streak screen, and it's animated cooler than almost any other screen in the app, and then sometimes you see some other screens, and there's all these other... You don't let a user forget it, you talk about them in messages.\n\n(01:17:01):\nAnd so, I think it's worth thinking about, look, if you're going to build a streak, and then you're going to [inaudible 01:17:06] it off into the corner of your app, where users aren't going to see it, they're probably not going to care about it as much, which might be fine, because there might be other levers that you think are more important to pull on, but there's a reason why we focus as much on the streak as we do, and that's because we want it to be top of mind for users. And that's not by accident then that users start to care about it. And so, I think just as you're thinking about building the streak, making sure that you're giving it the visibility it deserves, if you want it to have the kind of impact that Duolingo has, it's sort of an important hierarchy principle to think about as you design things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:42):\nThat's such a good point. You look for cues to the app of tell me what I should pay attention to, what's important? If you're just like fire, explosions, you made a streak, oh, maybe I should pay attention to this feature. And then the push notifications obviously encourage you there too. Anything else along those lines?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:17:58):\nMaybe final thing is, look, we ran so many tests on our Duolingo streak to figure out what worked. We have a philosophy at Duolingo, of test it first. We are a lot of times willing to test things. I really think that if you're going to try to introduce a streak, or you want to improve on the streak you have, don't get too caught up in the philosophy of everything, make sure your hypotheses feel like they're good, but my recommendation is just try things. And this is, again, you said it earlier, it's like this is as much human psychology as anything, and as soon as that becomes the case, you kind of just got to understand what users respond to. And the easiest way to do that is to stop spending time batting around ideas in a conference room and just try some stuff. So, huge recommendation to if you're going to invest in a streak, try and figure out what works through testing with users rather than trying to get it perfect on the first try.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:57):\nSay someone's listening and they're like, should we do streak, is this worth doing? What's your take on just the chances that a streak feature would be helpful to another consumer?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:19:07):\nI am well known for saying in the company that I think every team, every app could benefit from a streak. Now, how you implement it is very different, and I think you got to, what is your user's use case? If they're going to come use, I don't know, tax software... Okay, you know what? Now that I say this, tax software would be a hard one, but maybe it's all about you need users to come back every day, during the tax season, or how many times... I don't know. Now, that I say this out loud-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:35):\nTimes you upload your [inaudible 01:19:37] forms.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:19:37):\nYeah, that is a hard use case. But the vast majority of companies I think have a good idea of like, all right, here is my ideal use case, I want users to come here three times a month, that would be ideal. Or four times a month. You can build a streak to work. Peloton has weekly streaks because the idea of doing a Peloton workout every single day was hard for this user during COVID. It was just like every now and then you get on the Peloton, that was great, but the idea of a weekly streak was something that I could keep up. And so, I think figure out what your usage pattern is, as a user, and then build your streak around it. But as long as you're not a really, again, the tax example is probably a good counterfactual, but as long as you have some degree of frequency in your use, I think almost anything can have a streak.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:29):\nSo, Duolingo, it's, again, a $14 billion company, this feature, possibly the most contributing factor, other than the core product, to that level of success in market cap, and it's hard to imagine another just feature of a product that has had this much impact on growth and revenue and building this sort of business. So, I love that we spent this much time on it, the motherload, the motherload of advice and insights. So, thank you again for putting-\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:20:59):\nOf course. Very fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:00):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:21:05):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:06):\nFirst question, what are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:21:10):\nAll right, I'll start with A Guide to Midwest Conversation. So, I'm based in Kansas City, I'm a proud Midwesterner, and us Midwesterners talk in a certain way. I think you hear about Minnesota nice, but we tend not to say what we mean, and it is a very funny primer into what Midwesterners actually mean when they say what they say. So, highly recommend reading that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:33):\nI like that you give that to people, just like, here's what I might be telling you, which you may not read.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:21:38):\nMy wife is German, and I gave it to her so she could better understand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:40):\nI see German being the opposite of that, okay.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:21:44):\nVery different. Another book, this is a good one, Fate is the Hunter. This is a really cool book, it's a memoir of one of the early commercial airline pilots, and it is wild to hear the stories about what flying was back in the day. I'm a former management consultant, I flew every week for almost six years, and I never once had to worry about, am I going to make it to the other end of this flight alive? That was not the case back then, and so some of the stories about what it used to be like to be a pilot on some of these planes, before modern aviation technology, is fascinating, and makes you really appreciate what we have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):\nIt feels good to read a book like that, being a software PM or engineer or whatever, how different that life is.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:22:28):\nHardware is hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:28):\nHardware. Oh man, it's not haptic design. Okay. Next, unless there's any other books you're going to share? No, okay, great. What's a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:22:40):\nSo, I have two kids, I watch a lot of Bluey, it's really good, I swear, it brings me no shortage of joy. But adult show or show not meant for four-year-olds that I have watched, I just finished the latest season of Emily in Paris, man, wonderful. I realize it's not the highest brow of television, but just beautiful people in beautiful cities, solving problems that are not earth-shattering, sometimes it is nice to just tune out. Also, I'm learning French on Duolingo, slight plug for the app, I can understand a lot of the French that is being spoken, and there is no better joy than having invested as much time as I have in French, and actually being able to use it. So, huge fan of Emily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:21):\nThat is so funny, what a fun Venn diagram of interests. My mother-in loves Emily in Paris, I saw someone tweeting about what Visa is she on? How is she still in Paris?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:23:33):\nYeah. You best just not ask questions, there's a lot of questions for this show that are better left unasked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:40):\n[inaudible 01:23:40] Okay. Do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really like? Other than Duolingo.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:23:44):\nLast week I went to Home Depot, and I bought a new ladder, and ladder innovations, you don't think of often, but you can make one of the legs go a little bit further than the other leg. And as somebody like myself who has a house that is built on a slight slope, every time I go up on my ladder, I take my life in my hands, but with this ladder, I'm always even. I cleaned my gutters twice last week just because of how awesome this ladder has... How much this ladder has changed my life. So, ladder innovation, I don't think it gets talked enough about and so I'm happy to give it the spotlight it deserves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:18):\nI appreciate you doing that, and it's the first ladder recommendation we've had on the podcast. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you really find useful in work or in life they share with folks?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:24:26):\nThis probably will not be much of a surprise based on how I've talked about our willingness to test things, but you miss 100% of the shots that you don't take. I'm a big fan of just trying things, even if your possibility of success is not 100, because you learn a lot along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:44):\nFinal question, do you have any fun traditions at Duolingo, amongst either the PM team or the company in general that might be delightful to share?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:24:53):\nWe have way too many traditions to count. I will share the weird tradition that we do at every retention standup, and this started during the pandemic, we obviously used to stand up in person, and then when we went remote, we did this thing where whoever's the last person to go would count down 3, 2, 1, and then we'd all try to clap at the same time, which was kind of fun and dorky, but we fell in love with it, and four years later we're still doing it. Recently we've added, we all say yee-haw in unison afterwards, I can't tell you why. But trying to synchronize a clap via Zoom, and then all shouting yee-haw... I did this in a phone booth the other day and after I came out someone told me, \"You know that those aren't as soundproof as you think,\" but when you get a good opportunity to give a yee-haw, you can't pass up on it, so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:47):\nI love these little things, they sound so minor, but they're such important elements of team culture and tradition, and so important for PMs to find ways to just have fun and do something ridiculous.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:25:58):\nI will say, it took a while to get people behind shouting yee-haw, but now that we have people doing it, you can't take it away [inaudible 01:26:08], we all love it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:09):\nOh man, I called our all hands for a while, y'all hands, feel free to steal that.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:26:14):\nYou get it, you get it Lenny. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:17):\nI get it. Jackson, this is incredible, I feel like people are going to listen to this with notebooks, and just like, okay, here's a bunch of ideas we should try with whatever we're working on, whether it's streaks or not. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Duolingo? I know you're hiring product managers, so share more there, and finally, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:26:37):\nYes, you can find me on LinkedIn, that is where most of my online social media is, so Jackson Shuttleworth, and then how people can be useful to me, yes, as you said, we are hiring. We're actually hiring for my team. Are you interested in thinking about streaks as much as we do? We might be the right home for you, so please, you can apply on our website. We're also hiring from a number of other product management roles, and they're all as thrilling as this work is.\n\n(01:27:05):\nAnd then, I'm always interested about how other companies have implemented streaks and what they've learned, and so what I'd say is if you're a company who's implemented a streak maybe in a different way than Duolingo has, or you found a whole ton of success and another vector, another element of the feature that we didn't talk about today, I would love to know more. I used to catalog basically every streak I found out there, and as it's become more of a popular feature, it's just been hard to keep up on. So, if you have interesting streak insights to send my way, I would love to hear them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):\nI love that, a collection of all the best ways of doing streaks. Jackson, just I want to say congrats to your team and you for having so much impact. This is like the dream of a lot of PMs and teams, is to see this much impact and continue to ship wins, and so congrats, nice work.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:27:57):\nThank you very much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:58):\nThanks for [inaudible 01:27:59]. And with that, Jackson, thanks so much for being here.\n\nJackson Shuttleworth (01:28:02):\nYeah, thank you Lenny, this was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:04):\nSame. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:28:07):\nThank you so much for listening, if you found this valuable, you can subscribe to the show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or your favorite podcast app. Also, please consider giving us a rating or leaving a review, as that really helps other listeners find the podcast.

It's really just about, look, at any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not. The notion with the highlight is imagine it's the end of the day if someone asks you, \"What was the highlight of your day,\" what would you say? That's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that, and you still feel really good about your days. You still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.\n\nLenny (00:00:37):\nToday, I've got two guests, Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. Jake and John are authors of two incredible books, Sprint and Make Time. With Sprint, they've helped more than 300 teams design new products and bring them to market, including teams at YouTube, Slack, Gusto and One Medical. Previously, John and Jake worked at Google Ventures, and before that, at Google, where John was a leader on Google Ads and YouTube. And Jake helped build Gmail and co-founded Google Meet. Today, they run a venture capital firm called Character, and they actually just opened up applications for their accelerator program called Character Labs, which you can learn more about at character.vc/labs.\n\n(00:01:16):\nIn our conversation, we focus on their more recent book, Make Time, which a guest of this podcast, Ben Williams, recommended in the lightning round, and I absolutely loved and wanted to make sure more people learned about it and the advice within it, especially product leaders and founders who are constantly looking for ways to be more productive. I want to get you right to the meat of the conversation. So, let me just say that we get into a ton of very practical pieces of advice for how you can be more productive in your day, and if you listen to this episode, I guarantee you'll find at least three things that you'll want to start doing differently starting tomorrow. With that, I bring you Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:57):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers. Sidebar is a private, highly- vetted leadership program, where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback.\n\n(00:02:38):\nGuided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused, tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today? Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Whimsical, the iterative product workspace. Whimsical helps product managers build clarity and shared understanding faster with tools designed for solving product challenges. With Whimsical, you can easily explore new concepts using drag and drop wireframe and diagram components, create rich product briefs that show and sell your thinking, and keep your team aligned with one source of truth for all of your build requirements.

We're so stoked to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:20):\nI was just re-listening to the audiobook of Make Time to prep for this conversation. And I feel like I kind of know you guys from listening to your voice for so long in the car, and it's a little surreal to be talking to you guys.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:04:31):\nThat was really fun to record. And while we were doing it, we kept saying to each other, it was like we were recording the world's longest podcast.\n\nJake Knapp (00:04:39):\nThat's what it felt like.\n\nLenny (00:04:41):\nActually, on that, how long does it take to record audiobook? I've always been curious. How much time does that-\n\nJake Knapp (00:04:45):\nWell, it takes twice as long as it should have because my stomach kept growling and the microphone would pick it up. And so, John would do a perfect take and we're both sitting in the little room together and the engineer was in the other room and he'd be like, \"You got to do it again. You got to do it again. The guy's stomach keeps growling.\"\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:05:07):\nI think it took two days, right?\n\nJake Knapp (00:05:09):\nYeah, I think it was two days. Yeah, and I think actually they thought it would take two days, so I don't think my stomach slowed us down too much.\n\nLenny (00:05:16):\nThat is not as long as I thought. I thought it was a month of recording and such a painful experience. Sounds like not so bad.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:05:21):\nNo, honestly, it was really fun. I mean it's weird, but it's just like, I don't know, you can get into this very intense zone where you're singularly focused, right? There's nothing else that you need to do or should do, so it's just like read, drink tea, read, break for lunch, read, drink tea. It's just like this really satisfying flow.\n\nLenny (00:05:45):\nThat sounds like a great few days.\n\nJake Knapp (00:05:47):\nYeah, I think it was really fun doing it together too. I think it would've been harder to do... I mean obviously people do it and I think they like doing it on their own, but we've been working together for so long, it's always more enjoyable when we get to do something together. So, that made it cool.\n\nLenny (00:06:02):\nAmazing. I want to do an audiobook now. That sounds like a lot of fun. So, to start diving into our conversation, so you guys wrote this very seminal book called Sprint, which we're going to talk about. But you also wrote this other book that I have right here called Make Time, that to me was even more powerful and I think it might be even more powerful in people's lives than Sprint. And I think it's one of the most interesting and most fun productivity books out there. My wife actually grabbed the book from my desk the past week as I've been prepping for this, and just started highlighting it. You could see all these highlights in here. She just goes-\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:06:36):\nAwesome.\n\nJake Knapp (00:06:37):\nOh, that's so cool.\n\nLenny (00:06:38):\n[inaudible 00:06:38] I want to be more productive. Also, a guest on the podcast introduced me to the book. At the end of the podcast, I'll ask you this too, but I ask people, what book do they recommend most to other people? And he mentioned this book, and so that's how I uncovered it. So, it all comes full circle.\n\nJake Knapp (00:06:49):\nThat's so cool.\n\nLenny (00:06:50):\nSo, I thought we'd start with Make Time and then get to Sprint in the second half of the conversation. First question is just what do most people get wrong when they're trying to become more productive?\n\nJake Knapp (00:07:01):\nTo set the answer up, I'll give you a super brief history of Make Time. And for over a decade, John and I have been, in quotes, designing time as part of our work with startups, helping them find or expand product market fit. So, we developed a design sprint at Google Ventures, which the Sprint book is about. And now, we run this venture fund of our own called Character. And we run these highly-structured sprints with companies. And when we're doing that, we get to control how everything happens. We get to change the defaults of the way the workday happens, of what happens sort of hour-to-hour, minute-to-minute, how people are using technology, how people are interacting with each other. All those things are sort of under our control because we're trying to achieve these big goals in a really short period of time. Everybody focused.\n\n(00:07:53):\nSo, as this stuff was going on, John and I started applying some of the lessons, the things that we found were working really well in those structured sprints. We started experimenting with applying those in our own day-to-day lives, and we found that some of those things were super effective and they were a bit counter to the way we'd sort of heard or learned about productivity. And there's all kinds of habit books and productivity hacks out there. And I think John and I have probably tried most of them, if not all of them. But it seems like 99% of the people who follow those things are still feeling overwhelmed, they're still stressed out all the time anyway.\n\n(00:08:33):\nSo, even though we are not productivity gurus, this hasn't been like this thing we were doing forever, it's not our full-time job, but we thought we want to share this framework. So, Make Time, the book and the blog that proceeded it was just kind this side project to share what we learned. And yeah, it seems like it is resonated with a bunch of people. There's this kind of steady stream of interest in looking at these things a different way.\n\nLenny (00:09:00):\nI love it. I love that it emerged out of the sprint concept. I know you talked about the book, but I forgot that and these are all very related. I also love that a lot of the best stuff comes from people actually doing the thing. This came from, \"I just have discovered all these little things and I'm just going to share it.\" Not just like, \"I need to write a productivity book.\"\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:09:16):\nYeah, I think, like Jake said, we both had always sort of been dissatisfied with the state of the productivity art, and we had big things we wanted to do. I mean, when you work in any kind of job, I mean we've both spent our early careers as designers and the job is really all about doing big projects. It's all about being able to focus, being able to spend time on the things that matter. And that's to say nothing of what we want outside of work, things that we want to learn how to do personally, people we want to spend time with. And it's interesting, we've found that when we talk to people about Make Time, they always know. They always know what they want to make time for. The problem is not like what should my goal be or how should I figure out what to do with my life? They usually know, but it's very hard to actually make time for those things.\n\n(00:10:16):\nAnd I think the problem is that most productivity advice focuses on getting better and faster about doing the things that are already in front of you. So, the messages that are in your inbox, the meetings that are on your calendar, a lot of focus on efficiency, like crank through that stuff. Our perspective is basically that those are the defaults. Just like our software that we use, apps that we use have defaults, those are the defaults of life, of the companies that we work in, the culture that we live in. And so, the solution is actually to change those defaults and to really flip this way of thinking on its head. So, it's not about how do I go faster? How do I get more efficient? It's about how do I put the thing that is the most important first in my day or in my life, and then build everything else around that and accept that you're going to need to do a bunch of those little things. You're going to need to answer those messages and go to those meetings, but really, start with the idea of what's most important to you? What do you actually want to make time for?\n\nLenny (00:11:25):\nAlong these same lines, we're going to talk about this kind of four-part strategy that you recommend, but a couple of things before we get into there. One is along the lines you just talked about is this insight that you had of just like willpower is never going to be enough to get you to make time for the things you want to do. And you had these two concepts of busy bandwagon and infinity pools, so maybe just talk about those two briefly.\n\nJake Knapp (00:11:47):\nThe idea of the busy bandwagon is just this expectation that everybody's busy. And in the United States, there's kind of this thing that I think if you travel abroad and talk to people for a while, then you come back, you'll notice, which is like if you ask someone, \"Hey, how's it going? What are you up to?\" And they'll be like, \"Oh man, I'm busy.\" It's kind of the default answer. \"I'm busy. Things are busy.\" And it means, usually, it could mean a variety of things, but usually it's good. Like, \"Oh, it's busy, so business is booming,\" or, \"It's busy, I'm overwhelmed,\" or whatever. But busy, it's kind of the expectations that everybody's busy. And we are, I mean we are busy, but we call it the busy bandwagon because it feels like you should be busy. And it's this inner feeling caused by what we see or perceive other people are doing that drives a lot of the stress. And I don't mean to sound like I'm above it all and have figured it all out. It still drives my stress, this inner feeling that other people haven't figured out, other people are expecting fast reactions from me, all this. That's the busy bandwagon, this sort of feeling that I should be busy, that everyone else is busy. And what that does inside of us is really the core of what we have to change and figure out, this getting out of a reaction mode. The other thing that happens to us are the infinity pools. And John, do you want to describe what infinity pools are in our context?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:13:14):\nYeah, we came up with this name because we were trying to think of endlessly replenishing fount of content. So, basically if you can pull to refresh or if it streams, it's an infinity pool. So, this is pure entertainment stuff. This is stuff that people say like, \"Oh, I spend so much time on Instagram,\" but it's also stuff that's important and necessary and productive. Email is a huge infinity pool and it's probably the single hardest thing for the two of us to control and avoid getting sucked into. And anybody listening to this is going to, I think, understand how powerful those pools are and how effectively designed and engineered those products are to be really compelling and to be friction-free and to just make it easy for us to dive back into that pool.\n\n(00:14:15):\nAnd so, when you put these two things together, the busy bandwagon and the infinity pool, you kind of have this, it's like a flywheel, but bad. You feel like you really need to be busy, you really need to be on top of everything. And then, you've got this whole collection of apps and services and products there that are ready to pounce on that, they're ready to take advantage of that set of defaults, that cultural and internal set of defaults that you have about what you should be doing. And for a lot of people, it just sort of spins out of control. So, our view is if you can name those two things, if you can understand those two things, then you can start to deliberately change some of the defaults around them, so that you can put your most important projects, people, work first, like we talked about.\n\nLenny (00:15:04):\nI'm guilty of both these things. I feel like the reason I do some of these chats, this one in particular is it's like one-on-one coaching almost. This is going to help me stick to some of the things you teach. And I've already actually implemented a number of the things you recommend, but this is reinforcing it. And then, obviously, also helping all the listeners get better at these things. Before we get into it, one last question is just like real talk, how how's your guys' productivity? You wrote this book, it sounds amazing. There's 87 I think pieces of advice. How is it going for you guys? As we go through, I want to hear what you're actually using, but just broadly, how's your productivity?\n\nJake Knapp (00:15:40):\nAt the top of the interview, Lenny, you asked, \"What do most people get wrong when they think about this productivity, time management, whatever?\" And I'll frame my answer in those terms. So, most people, I think they try to get better and faster at doing what's right in front of them. We don't change the defaults in our environment, so we can focus and spend time on these different more important things. And if you think of that sort of what do I want to do? What's my goal? What do I want to spend time on that John referred to as project A, generally the things we want to do, these project A things, they're big, they're not easy to start, they're slow to create, dopamine hits, they're non-urgent. Like boss is not asking for them if you have a boss. And generally, the tasks and activities that stand in our way that keep us from doing project A, they're small, they're medium size, it's obvious how to start them, they create dopamine right away, they're supposedly urgent, email meetings, TikTok, Instagram, news, what's on your OKRs, all these things.\n\n(00:16:47):\nAnd I know what's on your OKRs may not sound like it's a peer of those others, but in a way it really can be. So, these big things, they're at odds with these little things that get in the way that the busy bandwagon expects us to do, these things that have infinity pools built in. And so for me, right now, it's a constant battle between the Jake and the busy bandwagon and my inner feeling of how can I live up to people's expectations of me and respond in the way that I should and react in the way that I should? And then, how can I do the project A stuff, the big important stuff? A lot has changed in my life since we wrote the book.\n\n(00:17:28):\nThe summary is every few months I need a few new experiments. I have found in what has been some trying times that the tactics and the framework that we use... Because it's kind of simple and it sort of fits with these experiences that I've had for many years doing sprints, that it works. And that if I can go back to that, that if I can create space for it, if I can think about this as it's a series of experiments, if I can look at myself with curiosity and say, \"Why are things not working out?\" And then try to experiment my way out of it that I'm able to. But yeah, so at any given point in time, I probably give myself a B to B-, and sometimes it's a C and sometimes it's a D, and sometimes it's an A, and I'm really plugging away, but it's totally an ongoing challenge.\n\n(00:18:22):\nSo, I'm not going to sit here and say, yeah, just follow me with a drone for 48 hours and you'll think that's exactly how you should do things. But part of our philosophy, I think that part of the way I look at it is it can be a mess. And yet, if you can create the space for those project A moments, for your highlights, that can shape everything else, if you just have those moments. Things can sometimes be a mess outside of that and you still feel really good about your days, you still feel really good about the way you're spending your energy.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:18:56):\nAnd having a framework for it gives you a path back. If you're just stuck and you're looking... You're sort of grasping for hacks. You're sort of like, \"Oh, I read this blog post about this thing, I'll try it.\" That might have some short-term effect, but ultimately, you're probably not going to stick to it. You're probably going to fall back into that place of overwhelm and disappointment and burnout. But we find that if you have a system, that you can use the system and you can return to it and continue to build on and experiment, that you can make more sustainable progress on these things.\n\nLenny (00:19:33):\nI think a really important takeaway from these two stories you guys just shared is you don't have to do all of these things. You don't even have to do most of them. If you just do one or two, if you find one or two things that can make you a little bit more productive every day, that makes a huge dent. And so, I think it's okay to feel like, \"Oh, I tried this stuff. It didn't work.\" I think as long as you take a couple of things away today that might be useful to you, and then just try them again in the future. If they end up not working out. Like you delete an app and then you reinstall it, I think that's okay. So, I think that's an important takeaway from this is don't feel like you're failing if you're not doing all of the things that we're talking about today.\n\n(00:20:10):\nBut let's get into it. There's this kind of four-part framework for how to help yourself be more productive. Basically, if you could just give an overview and then we'll just talk about each of these steps one by one. So, the four parts are create a highlight, laser, energize, and reflect. So, I'll turn it over to you guys just broadly, and then let's go through each of these one by one.\n\nJake Knapp (00:20:30):\nIt all starts with this notion of a highlight. And highlight is, I hate to say this, it's the most powerful best part, I think of the whole process. And I hate to say that because John came up with it. It wasn't even me. But I have to admit, it's really good. And I think as folks have read the book and shared it, that's the thing we hear back from people. If you could just do one thing from this book and try this out, it's a big deal.\n\n(00:20:54):\nThe notion what the highlight is, start your day out and you imagine it's the end of the day, you're looking back on the day. If someone asked you, \"What was the highlight of your day,\" what would you say? What do you want to say at the end of today was the highlight of today? And you start there, just like, \"Okay, what would I like to say the highlight of the day was?\" And you might think about what's urgent. Sometimes the highlight is this thing that really has to happen today. Today is the day there's a big meeting, or there's this thing I absolutely have to get done for work for tomorrow. That could be your highlight and getting that done well, having good attention to that will be very satisfying.\n\n(00:21:37):\nBut a lot of times the highlight comes from joy or satisfaction, projects that wouldn't otherwise get attention. And it also doesn't have to just be something at work. It could be people in your life that you want to spend time with, a hobby that you want to spend time on. If you want to get better at Mario Kart, having a good session at Mario Kart, whatever might be the highlight of your day. The notion is just in the morning to think, \"What is it and what is that highlight going to be?\" And then, try to find a block that's 60 to 90 minutes. That's just usually the rough time we think it takes to really get in the zone on something, do a really excellent job, be totally focused on it. So, that highlight, that's the anchor of everything. That's the core, that's the foundation. And you start that way, you're now trying to shape your time around that highlight, and making sure that you have your peak energy, your peak attention when the time for that highlight comes around.\n\n(00:22:37):\nSo, laser is about the tactics you might need to actually focus on that thing. In highlight, we have a set of tactics for how to create and think about and frame that highlight. Laser, we have a set of tactics for how do you pay attention when that time comes? Then for energize, it's about having the right amount of energy to do the thing, to pay attention. My highlight for today is trying to be coherent in this podcast, so this morning I need to think about what's the best way for me to have peak energy when a podcast starts.\n\nLenny (00:23:08):\nThat's my highlight too, actually. I have [inaudible 00:23:10].\n\nJake Knapp (00:23:10):\nOh, good. Right on. Okay.\n\nLenny (00:23:11):\nRecord a great podcast episode.\n\nJake Knapp (00:23:14):\nExcellent, excellent. Okay. Yeah. And if you're not watching on video, Lenny had a sticky note and he wrote it down. So, that's actually literally the best way to do this is write it down on a sticky note, put it somewhere where you can see it. And so, you've got highlight, laser during the time of the highlight, energize, make sure you have the energy you need when the time comes. And these are just tactics around sleep and food and exercise, and just things that help with your mental energy, not crazy stuff. And then the final thing is reflect, and this is where we think about this as the scientific method. Did it work? Did what I tried today work out? And if not, just being curious about it, what didn't? And adjusting and trying to think, \"Okay, maybe there's another tactic I can try.\"\n\n(00:23:54):\nSo, the book is like... What are there like 87 tactics in the book? There's a lot of different approaches, but the expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that-\n\nJake Knapp (00:24:00):\n... expectation is not you're going to use all of them. And the expectation is not that all of them will work for each person. I use different tactics than John does, and some of his don't work for me, and vice versa. But that idea of centering on a thing, focusing on it, having tactics for that, having tactics for energy, and then having some tactics to reflect and reframe and be curious. That taken together, we find, just can reframe the way it feels. It's not really about productivity. It's not about time management. It's really just about, look, in any given day, we're lucky if we can have one great moment where we have our peak attention, and we use it well. And it's not going to happen every day, but if we have some intention around it, it can happen more often than not.\n\nLenny (00:24:47):\nI think that last point is so important and why the highlight works so well for me is usually there's... You don't get anything amazingly done in a day, often. And usually, you're just distracted by all these things, and you're doing all the easy stuff. You talked about this idea of Project A, like here's the thing I really want to get done, but the dopamine hit us so far in the future, and it's so hard. And so, the reason I think the highlight is so powerful is, you get one thing done you're proud of, that is a great day. And it may sound crazy that that's true, but it's so true.\n\nJake Knapp (00:25:14):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny (00:25:17):\nSo, I want to talk more in depth about each of these four things, and maybe spend the most time on the highlight and the laser because I think that's where most of the impact comes from.\n\n(00:25:25):\nSo, with the highlight, do you have any advice? You shared a couple examples of how to come up with like, \"Here's the thing to pick for the day.\" There's a few questions that you recommend, and I think you shared a couple of them. And then, are there any examples of highlights from your guys', I don't know, past couple of weeks that would be good for people to hear an example? And then, also, there's this calendar component, which maybe fits into the laser, but I guess that feels like a really important element of this. So, if you just talk about that?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:25:51):\nFor me, and again, this is where the framework is intentionally flexible, different people have different highlights. But for me, I am very project oriented. I'm very work oriented. And for me, most days, a really good day comes from having made progress on something that is really important to me. So, my highlights are usually focused work, creative work related. And this has become even more important since we started our own VC firm three years ago. And before that, I was sort of, I guess, more or less a writer, full-time writing, and speaking at events, and doing some consulting. And before that, I was a partner at Google Ventures, at GV, and before that I was a product designer. So, I've been through different modes and contexts in my career. But if you know any VCs, if you're listening to this and you know any VCs, they're probably the busiest, most frazzled people that you know who are constantly on email, constantly in Zoom calls and meetings, and on airplanes all the time.\n\n(00:27:08):\nAnd so, the natural environment of that work is the busy bandwagon, and it's to have a lot of infinity pools that you need to care about. And so, in that context, in order for us to make progress on projects, in order for us to move the ball on a launch related to this program, Character Labs, that we run with pre-seed founders that's coming up, or we're writing a new book, and that's a big project, or working with one of our portfolio companies and running a sprint with them, or writing a newsletter that goes out to our LPs, those things are all really important, and I feel like they give us a unique edge as a VC firm.\n\n(00:27:55):\nIf we accept the premise I said before, that most VCs are just sort of frantically running around, if we can take these bigger swings at things, then theoretically, they should really help us be successful. So, most of the time, it's all a very long way of saying that most of the time my highlights are like, \"What do I want to accomplish at work? What is the thing that I want to get done today?\"\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd so, what I do then is, I structure my calendar around making time for that. There's a tactic in the book called Design Your Day that is really about kind of drawing out your day, and using your calendar as a canvas where you can design how you want to spend your time rather than using your calendar as a thing that is done to you, a thing that tells you what you have to do. Reclaim control over that.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd so, most days, the first half of the day before lunch is my focus time, and I protect that very, very intensely, and then use that time to work on whatever my highlight is.\n\nLenny (00:29:06):\nWe had a previous guest on, Neer Eyal, also talking about productivity, and he had actually the same advice of just using your calendar as your to-do list, basically, because that's where time's going to go, what your calendar's telling you to do. So, I think there's a pattern here that I think people need to pay attention to.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:29:22):\nYeah, definitely. Yeah, and I mean, we take it even further, and we have sort of a calendar template that we use as a team. So, we have certain times of the week. And it's not exactly the same for all of us on the team, but there are certain times of the week where it's like, yeah, this is when we do these kinds of things. This is when we have these kinds of meetings.\n\n(00:29:43):\nAnd not to say that those are all standing meetings, although we have some of those as well, but these are kind of the content buckets in the template that we can fill with a specific type of activity, but then other parts of the template are sort of reserved for focus work, reserved for individual, solo time to work on things that we need to get done.\n\n(00:30:03):\nSo, yeah. I think the calendar is, at an individual level and especially at a team level, is this really powerful tool that most people just kind of... Not only do they not use it as a tool, they just sort of hate it. They're sort of like, \"Ugh, my calendar, it's a mess. If I could live without a calendar, that would be the dream.\" But I think if you can use some of these tactics or use other approaches to reclaim it, and use it proactively as a tool for yourself, it can really help you structure your time around the things that you care about.\n\nLenny (00:30:41):\nYeah. The way I've been starting to use my calendar is this way, exactly, is I try to prepare for work on next week's newsletter post for like an hour and a half, then prep for the podcast coming up in a few weeks. So, it's very specific and broken up.\n\n(00:30:55):\nAlong those lines, I often don't do these things as I planned. And one of your principles, something around Groundhog Day, it's okay to repeat it if you didn't do it. If you highlight you didn't do, just repeat it again and again until you do it. Right?\n\nJake Knapp (00:31:09):\nI think that what's so cool about this notion of Groundhog Day. And if you've seen the movie... Well, if you haven't seen the movie, see the movie. What a great movie.\n\nLenny (00:31:09):\nIt was a good movie.\n\nJake Knapp (00:31:15):\nIf you've seen the movie, you know it's like, not to give it away, but he gets better and better at doing the day, and that's kind of this core philosophy that we take on.\n\n(00:31:30):\nI think a lot of the time, when in the past I have thought about, \"How can I be effective with my time? How can I be productive?\" It's beating myself up. It's not a good feeling to be in that head space of like, \"I'm screwing up. What can I fix?\"\n\n(00:31:49):\nAnd this notion that it's like, you're going to have another chance, you're going to have another chance. \"It's okay, just try again, just be curious about what happened,\" is a big deal. And starting with the calendar, using the calendar as a framework for saying, \"Hey, here's what actually happened. Here's what I think is going to happen.\" That's what you're saying when you do this Design your Day tactic.\n\n(00:32:12):\nAnd I did this exercise earlier this week. I was switching to a new calendar thing, and trying some new features with... We invest in this company called Reclaim, and they do this stuff-\n\nLenny (00:32:26):\nI'm an investor in Reclaim also.\n\nJake Knapp (00:32:27):\nOh, well.\n\nLenny (00:32:28):\nHow about that? Not planned, this promotion.\n\nJake Knapp (00:32:33):\nYeah, little [inaudible 00:32:36] there.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:32:37):\nIt sounds like we knew that, but we actually didn't know that. I didn't know that you-\n\nJake Knapp (00:32:37):\nWe did not know that.\n\nLenny (00:32:41):\nHow about that?\n\nJake Knapp (00:32:41):\nThat was just discovered. So anyway, I was just looking at my calendar, and I was like, you know what? I'm going to do what John does. When I wake up, I'm going to schedule when I exercise, when I eat breakfast. I'm going to schedule when I take a shower, everything, and block it all out. When I walk and feed the dogs, everything's going to be on there, so that then I can have this idea, and when the day starts, I know there's slots for all those things. And then I've found this week that what I thought happened, how long I thought those things take, was not how long they take. And so, set that thing to repeat every day and look at it, and then I'm like, \"Oh, okay, interesting. That's not what happened.\"\n\n(00:33:20):\nOkay, so I can adjust it. I can adjust the template and be a bit more kind to myself about this part, be a bit more kind to myself about that part. Gosh, the morning time wasn't a good focus time for me. I'll see if I can... Is there a way I can make that block happen in the afternoon? It's just a helpful way to track stuff and see it.\n\n(00:33:41):\nEspecially, I think a lot of people are visual learners. We can benefit from seeing things. It's not everybody, but a lot of us are in that camp. And when you put it on the calendar, you can see it, and that helps a lot.\n\nLenny (00:33:54):\nAnd also keeps someone else from booking that time. Double win.\n\nJake Knapp (00:33:58):\nNot to be undervalued, keeps someone else from booking that time. Right. And they look, they see, oh, okay, Lenny's already got stuff going on. I figured out, okay, I better be cautious before I ask for something. And that default, to be helpful to other people, and say yes when they put something on a free spot on your calendar, defeats a lot of our inner purposes.\n\n(00:34:20):\nAnd one core idea I don't think we've mentioned yet is that we strongly believe in people's intuition about how they should spend their time if they have the chance. What really is important. And that is true. We're talking about running this VC fund, or writing books, which are obviously very like, well, we're in charge of those things.\n\n(00:34:39):\nBut this is also true, we've been employees in big organizations, I also believe it's true that if you have a boss, and a boss's boss's boss, that you have great insight about what, if you had a window of time, would be the highest leverage thing for you to do. And it might not show up on your OKRs, it might not be on your boss's radar, your boss's boss's boss's boss's radar. You have great intuition, and we want to create space for you to do that thing because you're going to feel better about it, you're going to be more satisfied, and also good things are going to happen.\n\nLenny (00:35:10):\nWe're spending a lot of time on this highlight, but I think it's because it's so powerful. It's such a simple idea, but so effective. So, just to kind of give people tactical advice for how to actually implement this, just a couple things that I'll summarize.\n\n(00:35:23):\nOne is, to pick the highlight, you had a couple of questions I have here, for how to help you pick one for the day. So, you either ask which highlight will bring you the most satisfaction? Or, when I reflect on today, what will bring me the most joy? Maybe that's the same question. But I-\n\nJake Knapp (00:35:39):\nSlightly different, slightly different.\n\nLenny (00:35:41):\nSlightly different. That's true. Okay, good.\n\nJake Knapp (00:35:43):\nSatisfaction could be like, \"I know this thing has to get done, and I got it done.\"\n\nLenny (00:35:47):\nGood point.\n\nJake Knapp (00:35:47):\nJoy could be like, \"Man, that was great.\" And they're in the same family, but they're cousins.\n\nLenny (00:35:55):\nGreat point, great point.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:35:56):\nYeah. And I mentioned, a lot of my highlights, personally, are very much in the urgency or satisfaction camp. They're these big chunky projects. I got it done. I finished that deck. I finished writing that thing.\n\n(00:36:11):\nBut I also try to stay attuned to when I need something else in my day, when I need... I need some joy. I need some fun, some play. I need to prioritize going for a run, or going for a walk, or cooking a big dinner. And so, I trust my gut on those things, and I say, \"Okay, what's most important to me today is not to be productive, but to do something else.\"\n\n(00:36:39):\nAnd sometimes that's the best highlight for me. For other people, maybe that's their highlight every single day. Maybe they work as a... I don't know, I've talked to a lot of people who work in healthcare settings about this. They're a nurse or a doctor, and when they're at work, they're at work. They're not bouncing around between meetings and emails and Zooms. They're on their feet. There's no time to do anything else. So, their highlight is probably something they need to do at the end of the day to unwind, or take care of themselves.\n\n(00:37:11):\nSo, you have these three different strategies that we talk about, urgency, satisfaction, and joy, as being three different places you can look for the right highlight for you each day. But ultimately, I think it comes down to just trusting your gut and sort of asking yourself, like you said, \"What do I want to look back on and have said, yeah, I'm glad I made time for that\"?\n\nLenny (00:37:33):\nAwesome. So, you touched on the third. So, it's basically, what would give you the most satisfaction? So, in the morning, you essentially ask, or the night before. I think one of you, I forget, because when I was listening to the audiobook, I don't know who's talking. But one of you is like, \"I like to do it the day before.\" Is that right?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:37:48):\nYeah, that's me.\n\nLenny (00:37:50):\nOkay. Okay.\n\nJake Knapp (00:37:51):\nThat's John talking.\n\nLenny (00:37:52):\nOkay. So, the questions you asked either the night before or in the morning are, \"What would give me the most satisfaction today, or the next day? What would give me the most joy? Or what's the most pressing thing that I need to get done?\"\n\n(00:38:03):\nSo, you do that, and then the advice is either write it on a Post-It... I actually bought these tiny little Post-Its by accident. I was trying to buy regular Post-Its, and they're actually really great for this specific use case, so it's perfect. Write your highlight, stick it on the monitor.\n\n(00:38:17):\nSo, that's one way of doing it. The other is stick it in your calendar, where you have focus time. In theory, it's like every day, here's my focus time, where you have the most energy. Is that the general advice?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:38:28):\nGenerally, although I think that that's probably more important for a certain kind of highlight. I have focused time most mornings. To be really specific and nerdy about it, Monday, Wednesday and Thursday mornings I have focus time. Tuesday and Friday mornings I have meetings. But on a Thursday night, my highlight might actually be to have friends over and cook dinner. And that's not the same as focus time, but it's this pressure release valve where I'm like, \"That's the thing that I want to make sure...\" I want to make sure I wrap up email at 5 so that have time to get everything ready, but it's not necessarily that peak energy moment in the way that we might think about being productive or getting things done or getting into that flow state.\n\nJake Knapp (00:39:22):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (00:39:22):\nSo, there's a lot of ways to do it. So, maybe you just take away, if you're listening to this, is just think about what could be your highlight for today or tomorrow?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:39:30):\nYeah. And I would say, go one step further and make sure to write it down. Don't just think about it, because there's something really special that happens when you write things down, even if it's on a sticky. Even if it's in your notebook, your journal, even if it's a note on your phone. Take that step as well.\n\nJake Knapp (00:39:50):\nEven if you don't see it again, just writing it down is a big deal.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:39:55):\nYeah, that's a really important point.\n\nJake Knapp (00:39:56):\nI can give you a concrete example of a highlight, and a failed highlight, from yesterday, actually. And so, most days these days, my highlight is around making progress on the book. John alluded to working on a book, and so obviously it's a huge project. I heard it said that if you are writing books, it's like having homework forever. You always feel like there's always more to do. And so, that's mostly been my highlight.\n\n(00:40:24):\nBut yesterday, I wanted to prepare for this podcast. I knew that was going to be satisfying, to feel like I was ready. We don't think about talking about Make Time all the time, like we said, it's sort of like a side project for us. So, I wanted to be ready and somewhat coherent. And I knew I'd be satisfied, but I also knew it was urgent. We're going to be doing the recording today. So, that was my highlight. Write that down. \"Get ready for podcast.\"\n\n(00:40:50):\nAnd I had two focus blocks, one in the morning, one in the afternoon. It should be easy. Focus block number one, kind of just didn't do a good job. I was distracted, I was in my email, I was doing everything that I would say you shouldn't do, I was doing. Feeling down on myself. I've become a loser. I didn't get anything done.\n\n(00:41:10):\nOkay, second focus block. Man, now the pressure's on. I got to do it. And so, I finally get into the zone. And my wife thinks I have a pretty serious case of undiagnosed ADHD, so a lot of it is just, if I really do have a deadline, then I really will click in. So, now I have a deadline. I'm doing it, and I'm making notes, and getting there, but I feel like there's still a ways to go.\n\n(00:41:32):\nAnd my 12-year-old son bursts into the room, and it was, \"Oh gosh, you're invading me right when I'm at peak focus.\" And he is like, \"Hey, I'm going to do one more trip outside to sled in the snow. Do you want to come?\" And I'm like, first reaction, \"No, absolutely not. I can get this thing done. It's my highlight. This is the one thing I need to do today. I can do it max level of quality if I can just stay in this precious zone of focus.\"\n\n(00:42:02):\nBut then I was like, \"Wait a second, what's really going to be the highlight of my day? What's really going to be the highlight, the thing that I might actually remember in the future?\" We rarely get snow here. I live on this island in Washington state. We maybe get significant snowfall once every two years. We've only lived here for a few years. He's 12. He loves snow more than anything in the world. He loves snow. But he grew up in California, so he hasn't had many days, and he's 12. He's on the cusp of being a teenager. There's not, maybe, any more days in his life that he's going to want me to get on the sled with him and wrap my arms around him and go down the hill.\n\n(00:42:38):\nI was like, \"I got to get out there.\" So, okay. Pause this, ran outside. We did it. And man, it was magical. And I didn't know we were going to get one more in, because the snow was supposed to be melting already. We went down the hill, we went down the hill, we went... It got dark, we had to stop. But it was so magic. And I remember the very last end of the sled run, and it's like the last one, and he's like, \"Man,\" he's like, \"That was a great last sled run. So glad we did it.\"\n\n(00:43:10):\nAnd I was like, \"Yeah, so glad we did it. It's great.\" Come back inside, 15 minutes. I try to hustle and get this done. So, I was like, maybe it was like 80% or 75% to where I wanted to be on this. I couldn't check off that highlight as being the most important thing. But because of the framing of, it might be wrong, what am I going to remember, all this stuff, it just felt natural to me to switch modes and say, \"Oh my god, that actually is a highlight. That's this thing that's going to be really, really precious. That's where the joy and the satisfaction are most for today.\"\n\n(00:43:47):\nAnd still, because I had written down the other thing, I still did it instead of churning on email the entire day. But I screwed up twice, but it still turned out pretty good. So, anyway, that's kind of what it can look like at its best. And a lot of times, it doesn't make that much sense, and a lot of times I miss the special moments, or I miss the key work moments, or the key time when I could have gotten the most done. But I just feel better about it, which is a lot of what this is about. I just feel better about it because I feel more intentional.\n\nLenny (00:44:17):\nWell, thank you for sharing the real talk. I think you made the right choice. I feel bad for having you have to decide between your kid and this podcast.\n\nJake Knapp (00:44:24):\nYou didn't have anything to do with it. No, no, no. I just wanted to... It's selfish for me to want to be prepared. I just want to look good. I just want to sound like I know what I'm talking about.\n\nLenny (00:44:32):\nWell, it's working out. It all worked out. That's a great story. It reminds me, in your book at some point, I forget who it was of you that had to... You're like, \"Here's my priorities in my life right now.\" And it was like family, writing, Make Time, something else, and then you're like, \"Okay, actually Make Time is more important right now than my family,\" because you just have to get this done, and I wonder if this is a counter.\n\nJake Knapp (00:44:51):\nWell, yeah. I mean, I think that part of what people have found useful about Make Time is that John and I come at this from different perspectives. And I have kids. I have a twelve-year-old and a twenty-year-old, sons, and dealing with being a dad is a big part of how I try to figure out how to make sense of what to do.\n\n(00:45:13):\nAnd John doesn't have kids, and so he has it easy. No, he doesn't, but that's just a different frame of mind. And I think sometimes I read something that people without kids wrote, and I think, \"Well yeah, sure. I am sure that's wonderful for you, but what about X-Y-Z?\"\n\n(00:45:34):\nAnd although, I'm sure a lot of people who have more kids, or when they have young kids, it would... But that's a real part of it. And whether it's your family, your significant other, anything that's going on in your life that's not part of your work, there are times when you, on a day, or in a moment, you have to shift those priorities. And it can help to just be this idea of stack-ranking things, and being clear about it, can help you just come to terms with it. \"I'm making that decision right now. It makes sense to make right now.\" Or at least, I can see that I did it, and if it seems like I screwed it up, I'd flip it back. I know where it happened.\n\n(00:46:14):\nA lot of this is just like if you were designing a product or writing code or whatever, you can see that's where the bug happened. I'll just try to fix that line.\n\nLenny (00:46:23):\nYeah. I love how real you're getting, and it also reminds me of... We just had a kid. He's seven months old, so I'm going through a lot.\n\nJake Knapp (00:46:30):\nOh, congratulations.\n\nLenny (00:46:31):\nThank you.\n\nJake Knapp (00:46:31):\nThat's busy times. Seven months old is busy times.\n\nLenny (00:46:34):\nYeah, that's great.\n\nJake Knapp (00:46:34):\nPeople always told me, told us, when we had kids when they were babies. They're always like, \"Oh, just you wait.\" I just feel like this is a thing that people want to tell other parents. \"Just you wait until this happens.\" And then one person said, \"You know what? Generally speaking, it gets easier and easier and easier. Every month, every week, generally speaking, it gets easier.\" And I think that is true, so just keep that in mind if you're ever feeling like it's overwhelming.\n\nLenny (00:46:59):\nNo, I think that is true. I've experienced that. It also gets more amazing. That's what I'm finding, too.\n\nJake Knapp (00:47:03):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Work OS. If you're building a SASS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features, like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where Work OS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app.\n\n(00:47:22):\nTheir APIs are easy to understand, so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. And hundreds of other companies are already powered by Work OS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.\n\n(00:47:35):\nWork OS also recently launched AuthKit, a complete authentication and user management service. It's essentially a modern alternative to OP Zero, but with better pricing and more flexible APIs. AuthKit's design is stunning out of the box, and you can also fully customize it to fit your app's brand.\n\n(00:47:52):\nIt's an effortless experience from your first user all the way to your largest enterprise customer. Best of all, AuthKit is free for any developer up to 1 million users. Check it out at work-\n\nLenny (00:48:00):\n... for any developer up to 1 million users. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:48:09):\nI want to talk about the next bucket that, you call it laser, you could also think of it as just how to focus better, and this is where most of the very tactical tips for how to avoid getting distracted are. So what I think might be helpful here is let's just do a rapid fire through as your favorite tactical tips to help people stay focused, and the ones that you actually do and find most helpful, I think it's like six years later now since you published the book, the better. So let's go through some stuff here.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:48:37):\nYeah, the basic principle with laser is that willpower is never going to win, and there's great research on this, but for now just trust me, you're not going to white-knuckle your way through not looking at Twitter when you're trying to work. So it's all about making it hard, creating barriers to getting distracted. So a few things for me, I'm not on Instagram and I'm not on Facebook. I was on both of those things and I left both of them, I disabled my accounts. I am on Twitter and LinkedIn, but I don't have either of those apps installed on my phone. I stay logged out of those sites on my computer, except for when I want to use them for some specific purpose.\n\n(00:49:22):\nLinkedIn I need to use all the time, because I'm a VC and I have to look people up and stuff, so I found this Chrome plugin, or Chrome extension, I guess is the right word, that disables the feed in LinkedIn. So when I go to LinkedIn.com, it's the search bar at the top but there's no feed, which is amazing because I can use LinkedIn as the phone book and then not get distracted. So those are some of the very, very concrete specific things that I do, all, again, with the goal of putting a speed bump between me and that thing so that if I go, and I don't do this much anymore but I used to, literally my hands on the keyboard would just be like, T-W-I, like Twitter.com, and then you see that log in screen instead of my juicy feed and I'm like, oh yeah, right, okay, I did that on purpose, great, I broke that feedback loop a little bit.\n\nLenny (00:50:18):\nI did a similar thing with Twitter/X, where I deleted the app and I just used the mobile website. I think this point of logging out is really powerful, I think people haven't heard that idea as much, because it's not like you can't log in really easily, you just click a couple things and you're back. But to your point, it reminds you, okay, I see, I really shouldn't have done this.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:50:37):\nWell, I also signed up for two-factor authentication for everything, not because I care about somebody hacking my account, but because it's another speed bump. Because that way, even if your browser remembers your password, or I use one password, so even if the browser extension is going to fill it in for me, there's still another step, so it's sort of reverse engineering my own distractibility.\n\nLenny (00:51:03):\nThat feature that everyone's always talking about that Apple built of the code being automatically there in the keyboard, that's counter to this friction that you've created.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:51:11):\nYeah, yeah, that's true.\n\nLenny (00:51:12):\nOkay, so it's interesting is I had this, and then I just like, goddammit I really just want to be on Twitter. And so I just re-installed it again recently, and I need to fight that again.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:51:22):\nWell, I go through cycles like that too, and I go through that a lot with email. Jake, you still don't have email on your phone, is that right?\n\nJake Knapp (00:51:33):\nNo, I would be on the floor checking email right now on this call if I did, on the floor.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:51:38):\nI used to do that, Jake inspired me a long time ago to remove email from my phone, and so for years and years that's been my default. But more recently I've had more reasons to install it, mostly related to travel, if I'm on the go and I just want to stay on top of things. And something that Jake and I have talked about a lot is you go through these different cycles of, hey, I need this thing, or I want this thing, and then part of the reflect step, part of paying attention and reflecting on how it's going is to recognize, oh wow, I've actually been spending a lot of time on email on my phone, or a lot of time on Twitter, maybe I'll just uninstall it for a while. Maybe I'll just reset and do that for a while. And then there'll be some other thing that happens that causes you to reinstall it, and that's totally fine, because you're being deliberate about it and you're paying attention, rather than saying it has to always be this way forever and it's set in stone.\n\nLenny (00:52:35):\nThat's a great tip of just coming back to it, not feeling like you're defeated, it's like, all right, let's try this again.\n\nJake Knapp (00:52:40):\nYeah, I think a big part of it is if you can experience the feeling of not having it on your phone. Like I'm old enough to have lived in a world building products where there were no smartphones, and we got a lot done back then, things happened. I mean, for God's sake, they designed the first iPhone without being able to use iPhones while they did it, you can do a lot. So this idea that we have to have it or everything's going to fall apart, that's just not true for 99.99999% of everyone.\n\n(00:53:16):\nIt's interesting to see what it feels like if you delete all of the infinity pools off of your phone, and this is something I did out of rage at myself in 2012. It was another situation where I was with my kids, who were much younger at the time, and I was spending time with them, we're playing wooden trains, and all of a sudden my son's like, \"Dad, dad, dad, dad, dad,\" and I'm like, \"God, what?\" And I didn't even realize it but I was on my phone, and I don't even remember what I was doing, email or something, but I think I told him, he's like, \"What's on your phone?\" Because to him, he was like, we're doing something really fun, so if you're on your phone it must be something really cool, maybe it would be a cool thing to share, because this is great, so it must be another great thing. He wasn't trying to shame me or anything.\n\n(00:54:06):\nAnd I was all defensive, I'm like, \"Well, I need to do this for work,\" which was, I think, my internal monologue of why I was doing this thing that actually was just a really low-friction dopamine hit. And then I thought, God, this is not what I wanted, this is not why I worked so hard today so I would get done with my work so I could be home in time to do this before my kids go to bed. And I was like, screw this, so I just started deleting things on my phone, and I deleted email and I deleted Facebook and I deleted this, everything that had an infinity pool, everything that had an infinite amount of content. News is like this, anything streaming.\n\n(00:54:44):\nWhen we wrote this book, it came out in 2018, I think we said we thought it was going to get worse, and it has. But at that point in time there was really Netflix, and now there's all these streaming services. At that point in time there was Instagram and Facebook, but now there's TikTok, the best part of every video available instantly right here. This stuff, it only gets harder to resist. When you clear all that stuff off of your phone, it's painful, the idea of deleting all this stuff, and each time the phone's going to ask you, \"This is going to delete all the data and settings, are you sure you want to do that?\" It doesn't want you to. And when you do that though, what does that feel like? And it's usually a feeling of discomfort, but also relief that I don't have to check this, this thing, I don't have to check it, I don't have to.\n\n(00:55:34):\nAnd if you've ever felt like your phone was in the Lord of the Rings, how Bilbo, I guess, yeah, Lord of the Rings, they want to put their hand in their pocket and touch the ring, or put the ring on without even knowing it, Frodo's like, \"I didn't even realize I did it.\" That's what this thing is like. And when you take those off, just that feeling of relief is, to me, so powerful, that having done this for a decade now, and yeah, there's exceptions, like I'm traveling, God, I have to check my email for X reason, and I install it and I check it. And then it automatically, because I'm aware of it, I'll just feel this static.\n\n(00:56:11):\nThere's this notion of attention residue, and I think the researcher who coined this term is Sophie Leroy from the University of Washington. Anyway, you can look that up, I think I learned about that from Cal Newport. But this idea says, it makes a lot of sense, that you pay attention to some things and they just stick in your head and they create this static, those apps just create this static. The idea of email being on my phone and accessible at any time creates a discomfort, a disquiet that now that I've seen it and felt what it's like to not have it, I could not imagine experiencing it.\n\n(00:56:44):\nYou do give some things up. You're not going to be as responsive. John and I don't have as many Twitter followers as we'd have if we used Twitter. There are these things that you look at other people, and I just saw a post on LinkedIn because I haven't used plug-in yet, but I looked on this post and it was a colleague that I used to have and she was saying, \"Yeah, I posted a few tweets last year and a couple of them went viral and I gained 30,000 followers.\" And I was like, man, all I have is 30,000 followers, and that was from years and years ago, I thought I was a pretty big deal, oh jeez, maybe I should... And I was like, oh God, don't do it, because I know when I'm doing it, then I'll be thinking about it all the time and the attention residue will spoil my life.\n\n(00:57:28):\nSo yeah, anyway, sorry, that's just a rant, but you should try it. The distraction-free phone thing is just worth trying, if you can take off everything, if not just try taking off the thing that's your kryptonite. What's the thing that is the hardest for you to resist, sucks your attention the most, makes you feel not good? Take it off for, try it for a day, or try it for two hours, just to feel that feeling. And then once you've felt the feeling you'll always know, I could release that, and I think that's powerful.\n\nLenny (00:57:57):\nAnd I think when you delete it, it's important to know nothing's being deleted when you're deleting the app, you can reinstall it, you log in, it's all the same.\n\nJake Knapp (00:58:04):\nIt's all the same, that's an important point. They make it sound like, oh my God, this is a big deal. It's not.\n\nLenny (00:58:09):\nYeah, just have to remember your password or Google auth, or whatever you're using. This metaphor of The Lord of the Rings and the ring is so good for how it feels to just say, I'm just going to check Twitter, what's the problem, I'm just going to check it again, I'll just check it, check it. That's so good. And then in Lord of the Rings, the way they resist the ring is they hide it, they put it somewhere else, they give it to Frodo to take it, right? That's the same solution, it's just like, I can't get access to it, it's over there.\n\nJake Knapp (00:58:36):\nRight, right. Yeah, you got to be like Gandalf. Even if that ring would do great things for you, you got to give it to Frodo for a while, maybe show up at the end with an eagle.\n\nLenny (00:58:45):\nJust too eerie, yeah, yeah, the eagle.\n\nJake Knapp (00:58:46):\nScoop them up.\n\nLenny (00:58:47):\nYeah, oh man. So the key tips here are find the apps that are sucking your attention, could be Twitter, could be LinkedIn, could be your email, and delete them and/or log out of them. What else?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (00:59:00):\nThere's a few tactics that Jake and I both use that are related to TV, watching TV, and a really simple one, which is also kind of a luxury one, but I think there are ways to do it that are pretty universal, is just not having a TV in your main living space. Again, not having the default be like, I'm home, the TV is on, what are we watching? And so for me and my wife, that's always been the TV is just in a different room. And Jake, do you use a projector where if you want to watch something you have to get it out, set it up, and make a decision to watch something?\n\nJake Knapp (00:59:40):\nYeah, so it's a bit of a project. And it doesn't take that long, but you definitely are not just click, and you don't see it when it's not set up. So we have a projection screen that's all folded up in the corner, and the projector's in a cabinet, so you got to get it out and get a chair and put it on there. If you're motivated enough you can do it, but it takes a few minutes.\n\nLenny (01:00:06):\nYou need an old-timey camera that you have to wind.\n\nJake Knapp (01:00:06):\nYeah, right.\n\nLenny (01:00:07):\nSomeone has to sit there.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:00:11):\nHere's another one that-\n\nJake Knapp (01:00:13):\n[inaudible 01:00:13] in the back.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:00:15):\nYeah, right. Another one that's really helpful for me that actually is sort of a bridge is the laser section and the energized section, because it relates to sleep, is I don't keep my phone in the bedroom. The phone doesn't come in the bedroom. And not only that, the place where it charges, the MagSafe little charging place for it, is downstairs. It's on a different floor, it's in the kitchen. So when I put that there at the end of the night and I go upstairs, I might still be awake for an hour, I might read, I might get ready for bed, all those things, but the phone is a way to make sure that the last thing I do each day is not on my phone. That's super helpful to me, and I think there's a bunch of ways, whether it's in a drawer or in a cabinet, there's a bunch of ways you can implement that tactic that I think could make a big difference.\n\nLenny (01:01:07):\nMy wife and I have been talking about that actually, but the issue is to watch our kid with the Nanit app we need our phone. I know that you can get other devices that aren't on the phone, but we just like the Nanit, and so we've stuck with that.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:01:20):\nYeah, one tactic that's related to that that a lot of people have told us they've had success with, and not specifically with the Nanit app, but some people have said, \"Oh, I can't uninstall those apps because,\" Twitter, LinkedIn, whatever, \"because I do social media for my work. Literally my job is I do marketing at the company, I have to be on social media.\" So what some people will do is they'll have a separate device. So it's almost like the old days of your personal phone and your work phone, they'll just have a work device, like a work iPad, that those apps are only there, and when they're working they're on it, when they're not working they put it away. So you could have another device that's the Nanit device and that's all it does and it's in a nice little stand by the bed, that can create some separation as well.\n\nLenny (01:02:09):\nThat's a great idea. I think there's a company, I think it was Arianna Huffington made a thing where it's a little bed for your phone, where you put it somewhere in the living room and you put it to bed and you charge it there and it's outside your room.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:02:21):\nYeah. There's a company, I can't think of the name right now, but I can look it up and send it to you, there's a company that makes a cool box that not only you put your phone in, it charges, but it has some sort of way of, it interacts with the phone, it puts it into Do Not Disturb, or there's some cool integration that it does. So yeah, those things are a little bit gimmicky, but if it helps you create that default, I think it's worth it.\n\nLenny (01:02:48):\nHere's the trick my wife wanted to share with you guys as she was reading the book, she's like, \"Tell them about this thing that we've been doing,\" which is with TikTok. She doesn't install the app, and she basically relies on me to send her TikTok videos I like to her account, which she then checks on my phone.\n\nJake Knapp (01:03:04):\nYou're Frodo.\n\nLenny (01:03:05):\nYeah, yeah, I'm holding the TikTok, my precious. And so the trick there, there's two wins, one is she only sees the best stuff. She respects my taste of videos to watch. And then two is I'm always like, \"Give me my phone back,\" and so there's limited time where she can watch them, and that keeps her from getting addicted to TikTok.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:03:27):\nYeah. My wife and I have a similar dynamic, but in reverse and with news. I spend very little time reading the news, and I don't have any news apps on my phone, but my wife's pretty into the news. She has a healthcare background and she studied journalism in school, so she loves particularly those two topics in the intersection of those two. And so she gives me a news digest. When we're chatting at the end of the day, or when we're doing something together, she'll just, it's not structured, it's not some official thing, but she just shares what she was reading about that day. It's nice, it gives us something to talk about, I think it suits both of our styles and our preferences. It's good for her, it's good for me, so it's fun to think about how you can implement some of these ideas in a relationship as well.\n\nLenny (01:04:23):\nHow do I subscribe to this feed of your wife sharing the news every day? It sounds like a great podcast we all need.\n\nJake Knapp (01:04:29):\nReally, really good stuff, or really important stuff, will find us. I think there is, part of the busy bandwagon, or part of the infinity pools thing, is this feeling inside that I'm responsible for staying up to date with the most important news in the world, or the most important news in my inbox, or my company or my team, work, and I'm responsible also for getting the very best of entertainment that's out at this moment that's the most topical and the funniest, or the most interesting, whatever, at this moment.\n\n(01:05:04):\nAnd it's okay to let go of that and, the good stuff, it'll come to you. People will share it with you or you'll hear about it. If it's a really big news story, you'll hear about it eventually. If it's going to affect you, actually, you'll hear about it. And with most news, and most entertainment, we don't play a role, it's hard to admit, but we don't actually play a role in what happens, and so the idea that we're responsible for being on it all the time, that's a job that we can quit, or at least take a sabbatical from.\n\nLenny (01:05:38):\nSo Tim Ferriss talked about this in The 4-Hour Workweek, is way back in the day is just like, I wait for people to tell me what I need to know, exactly what John just shared before this, and I find this with, so first of all you find that when you delete Twitter, LinkedIn, you go week without it, and nothing is any different. You still know everything you need to know, your job, everything's going great. You missed a bunch of stuff that had no impact on your life. And so I think doing that exercise helps you realize that and I don't need to be on Twitter all the time.\n\n(01:06:08):\nAnd not to get political, but with news about Trump, there's always these headlines, \"Trump, look what he did in this lawsuit today, it's over.\" I just feel like there's so many posts about all these things Trump is doing every day, and none of them, nothing happens. It's just the same thing, just keeps going. If something actually happened there I would hear it from a lot of people, the New York Times would send me a big push. So it's like, I don't need to know all these things he's doing every day.\n\nJake Knapp (01:06:36):\nWell, it doesn't matter what your political affiliation is, that is true. Trump is always going to be in the news, and it's always going to, that's the constant, that's the third constant, death, taxes, and Trump will be in the news.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:06:51):\nA related tactic that I've been doing for a long time is my main source of news is the Economist magazine, which is far too highbrow for what I need, but the main feature of it is that it's weekly, because at the end of the week, the zillion stories about Trump, or whatever, if there was something of consequence, it gets distilled into this really good summary. Really, really good. The Economist has some of the best journalists in the world, they're just absolutely fantastic, and so not only does it have this really nice cadence of once a week, if something matters it's going to get rolled up there, it's going to get summarized. And so that's one of my most durable habits related to these tactics, is reading the news once a week, reading the Economist. It fits my brain, it fits my life rhythm really well.\n\nLenny (01:07:54):\nYeah, it's the opposite of Twitter, basically.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:07:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:58):\nSo yeah, let's hear a couple more tactics and then let's touch on the other two parts of this framework.\n\nJake Knapp (01:08:03):\nWell, first a pairing, and then one more. The pairing is reset expectations and slow your inbox. So these are two tactics related mostly to the email and messaging. So resetting expectations is just about having maybe a conversation with people you work with, but it can be as simple as a signature in your email. And so one great example of this is a signature that says, I'm checking email two times a day as an experiment to improve my focus, or I'm checking email once or twice a day, you decide how spicy you want to get with this option, because I'm working on an important project. And just a simple line that people will see passively as you send emails that will reset their expectations of how quickly you'll respond. And if you like you can say, I'm checking email once a day because I'm working on a big project, you can text me if it's urgent. Feel free to text me, you can invite people to do so.\n\n(01:09:11):\nBut that very act of just putting it in there, you can also do it as an out of office autoresponder, so just like, hey, instead of I'm actually out of the office like, hey, I'm going to be slow to respond to email because I'm working on an important project. That because is really important, and we talk in the book about this, a funny study about the power of because and this case where people would make up bogus excuses, but they'd say, \"Because to cut a line,\" it's an old study, they're making photocopies, but they would cut the line and say, \"I need to cut the line because I need to make copies.\" And just saying because dramatically boosted the percentage of the time that a person would let them cut the line. We're suckers for explanations, all of us. So if you say because people will feel better, and you can feel better about saying it.\n\n(01:09:58):\nBut this idea that you're just going to put up a placard, basically, that says, hey, I'm slow to respond because I'm working on a project, and maybe give people an escalation path, or don't, that's a huge deal. And it seems like it would be a huge deal because it changes others expectations, and that is true. But the real power of it is in changing our own expectations about what we are going to do and what we are expected to do. Most of the stress comes internally, from our feeling that if we don't get back to people right away, we're not enough, we're not measuring up, we feel some kind of shame or guilt about not doing it and not being fast and not being responsive. And so doing this statement is just about renegotiating with ourselves.\n\n(01:10:46):\nThe other one is to slow down your inbox. This is a simple one, if you start to do that, if you start to just check your email once or twice a day, or even less frequently, or even if you check it a little bit more frequently but you aren't responding to emails, you don't hold yourself accountable to this idea of an empty inbox, then the whole loop slows down. If you respond to emails really fast, you respond to messages really fast, people respond back to you and then there's more to respond to. And if you slow down that little hamster wheel, it slows down. And so that's powerful too. So those two around email I think can be really helpful, they help me with this, my default feeling about email and messaging and everything is I should be as responsive as possible, and I have to constantly renegotiate that with myself, and those are ways I do it.\n\n(01:11:36):\nThis other one that's pretty extreme, that I only just tried for the first time, it's in the book but I hadn't actually tried it, but this was a reader of our blog told us about this. Her name is Krissa, I think she allowed us to use her first name but not her last name. So Krissa, if you're listening, shout out to you, this turned out to be a great tactic, but it's to cancel the internet. And she had canceled the internet at home, which is wild. But what I did was I have an office, a very small office in this small town here where I live, and-\n\nJake Knapp (01:12:00):\nSmall office in this small town here where I live and I canceled the internet there so that I could, when I went there, all I can do are tasks that you can't do with the internet, which is a lot. I mean, you can use a lot of apps in offline mode and it's a great place for me to write. It's a great place for me to do focus work, design something, presentation, but any kind of focused thinking, reading, writing can happen there and now the whole feeling of stepping into that room where I cannot access the internet is insane.\n\n(01:12:32):\nTo create this kind of a thing at home, you can do things like put a timer on your internet. You can actually buy one of those vacation timers, plug it into the wall, plug your router into that, and it will actually switch your internet off at a certain hour or hours. There's also software that'll let you do this selectively, but the big notion of just having there be a time when you are off and it's a fairly significant pain to get back on again, it's more than just clicking wifi on, wifi off. I find for me that's not enough of a speed bump. It's pretty powerful.\n\nLenny (01:13:07):\nJust the way you're describing the feeling of walking into an office that has no internet, I totally feel that. Just imagine, just like, \"I have no internet here. I could do so many things. I could read.\"\n\nJake Knapp (01:13:19):\nIt might be a coffee shop where you don't find out what the wifi password is and there's just this amazing, amazing feeling. Maybe it's just you go to a park where there's no wifi, just whatever it might be, finding a place where you can't, you just can't get that stuff. Leave your phone at home if you can't bear to delete all the apps. It's so great. It's so great. And then you're not fighting the battle.\n\n(01:13:46):\nA lot of this stuff, there's a visualization I think of where I've got the highlight in front of me. It's right there. This thing I can see that I want to do, but it's like five feet away or 10 feet away, and right next to me just kind of vibrating are all of the... You can imagine all the app logos, they're just kind of vibrating right around my head.\n\n(01:14:07):\nThey're right there and touching any one of them, it's like they're little pieces of candy. It's all going to feel good. There's this really good meal, five to 10 feet away is this great sandwich, but these little pieces of candy are right in my face and it's going to be hard to resist just popping a little Sour Patch Kid or Laffy Taffy in my mouth, but if I could push them away, if I can just push them far enough away so that there is far away or farther away than the sandwich, I'm going to eat the sandwich. And Mike, if that's what you do basically with these barriers to these distractions, then you can get into laser mode and it's easy. You want to. Once there's space, you'll want to do the thing that's most important. It's just it's hard because the candy is right in our face.\n\nLenny (01:14:50):\nSuch a good metaphor. You also have this metaphor of Odysseus sailing past the sirens. If folks know that story where there was a siren, I don't know, cliff thing where he's just sailing.\n\nJake Knapp (01:15:01):\nI know well, in eighth grade I played Odysseus in school play, so I can tell you all about it.\n\nLenny (01:15:06):\nMan, what a character to play. Yeah. And in that story, he wanted to experience these sirens who nobody could resist, but he forced his sailors to tie him to the ship and not allow him to do anything, even though he's like, \"Let me go. I need to go there.\" Because everyone crashed into the sirens. Anyway, I'm doing a bad job explaining this story, but I think it just comes back to the same point again and again that you can't rely on your willpower to not go towards these vibrating candies all around you that you need to set up these systems.\n\nJake Knapp (01:15:41):\nI think there's this notion that we will use willpower maybe comes from the fact that some people can, maybe some people are just using willpower or they're on Twitter, they're on Instagram, they're on TikTok, they're on Facebook, they're doing all these things, and they're also functioning just fine, or at least what we see from the outside is just fine. But maybe internally too, it's fine.\n\n(01:16:07):\nIt just seems that everybody I actually talk to and certainly my personal experiences, all that stuff makes me feel bad and actually undercuts my ability to do the things that are meaningful. The meaningful contributions I can make through my work or through my life, whatever. They're all undermined and undercut by the bad feelings and the distraction that come from all of social media, all of the news and almost all of my email. And so if that's true for anybody, if it's even remotely true for us, we have to just radically rethink what we're doing.\n\n(01:16:42):\nThis thing, I think we basically are steered toward becoming reaction machines and this notion of, \"I'm going to have an empty inbox. I'm going to do every task. I'm going to be a fast responder, I'm going to be in every meeting. I'm going to do that because I want to help other people, and that's the way it works.\" I think this desire to be helpful is a big driver of it. I think we want to alleviate our stress and other people's stress, and that seems like the right way to do it. It's candy. Some of the stuff is candy and easy.\n\n(01:17:12):\nWe also see this modeled by people in power, so like CEOs and bosses, it works for them because they're applying their influence through being constantly reactive and being in meetings all the time. That's just how they do what they do. That's how they apply their influence. But even for them, I think it has limits as a way to apply influence. At the bare minimum for the rest of us. And for those of us who again, I think is the vast, vast majority for whom all of these things create problems and we're not able to easily willpower and self-esteem manage all this stuff, if we're a reaction machine, we're not doing meaningful work, no Project A's and we're not really alive as humans. We're just chat bots. So it's worth experimenting if you don't want to live your life out as a chatbot.\n\nLenny (01:18:00):\nI think the point you made there around the feeling is just a really important point that even if you feel really productive enough and you're getting things done, is if you're feeling bad, it's still an important thing to focus on. This idea of, are you spending time on things you want to spend time on? You also reminded me of this app I'll mention briefly that I think you guys will love, I don't know if you've heard of this. It's called mailmanhq.com. It shuts off your Gmail for periods of time. So you could say, \"Only allow my email through at these times of day.\" And so instead of email whatever, it's just like you can batch your release of email.\n\nJake Knapp (01:18:35):\nThat's beautiful. Mailman HQ?\n\nLenny (01:18:37):\nMailman hq.com.\n\nJake Knapp (01:18:39):\nOkay, I'm writing that down right now.\n\nLenny (01:18:40):\nYeah, I go on and off it because sometimes I just want on an email, but it makes a big difference. It's wild how just not even knowing your email makes a big difference.\n\nJake Knapp (01:18:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:18:50):\nOkay. Let's touch on the last two parts of this framework, energize and reflect, and then let's spend a little time on Sprint for people to get a sense of what this method is all about. For folks that haven't read the book.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:19:03):\nSo to replay the system overall highlight is about the thing you want to make time for today. The most important thing today, laser is about creating barriers to distraction so that you have much your energy or as much of your attention as possible to focus on your highlight on that one thing. Energize is sort of like a booster to laser.\n\n(01:19:29):\nIt's sort of like the big idea is that our brains and bodies are connected and our ability to pay attention and to focus and to do those things that we care about only works when we are well and we have slept, we have eaten well, we have exercised, we have talked to other people the right amount, not too much, not too little and so we put this as part of the make time framework because we don't think you should go crazy, try a million biohacker type of things, but we do think it's worth applying this same philosophy of pay attention to what's working, what's not, have a system, try some new things, pay attention to those things, run these experiments. We think it's worth doing that for your health, for your energy as well, because it really does make a difference.\n\nLenny (01:20:27):\nMaybe share one or two tips there real quick for people to energize to create a little more energy during their day?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:20:33):\nIn the year since we wrote the book and as my life has just continued to change and I've gotten a little bit older, I've realized that sleep is probably the single most important thing. I mentioned earlier, not having my phone in the bedroom, no TV in the bedroom, hopefully that goes without saying, but just being able to really construct an environment that allows me to sleep. I started wearing an eye mask recently.\n\nLenny (01:21:01):\nI do that.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:21:02):\nYeah, really helps me fall asleep and stay asleep and then the other thing is exercise is a big source of energy for me, but I realized that I was making excuses about why I didn't need to or shouldn't exercise in any given day. So even though this is not what we recommended in the book specifically, I ended up signing on with a personal trainer so that I have accountability, I have a schedule, I have somebody who's thinking about what I need that's not just me and those two things have kind of been the pillars of how I build energy over the last few years.\n\nLenny (01:21:47):\nI use this app called Future, I'm a investor, quick disclaimer, but it's basically a personal trainer through an app that's like a real person that helps you design a workout for you, and then they give you the workout on the app and you just follow the instructions and that's the thing that got you working out three times a week.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:22:03):\nNice. Yeah.\n\nJake Knapp (01:22:04):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (01:22:04):\nKilling it. Okay. And then within reflect, maybe just briefly talk about the importance there and then one thing people could do to reflect on how things are going.\n\nJake Knapp (01:22:14):\nReflect is just simply the act of looking back on the day and treating the day. It wasn't marble gravestone of your successes or failures, it's just a experiment that you ran. What happened in the experiment? Taking note of it in that lens, what did it look like? There's a template in our book that has some questions you can answer, but really it's pretty simple.\n\n(01:22:44):\nIf you write down your highlight in the morning or the night before, if you're draw it and you stick it somewhere visible, then at the end of the day you just look at it and just like, \"Okay, did that happen or did that not happen?\" If you stick it somewhere visible, you won't even have to do anything. You'll just come across it and you'll know if did that happen or not? So that's the simplest part of it is writing it down, sticking it will create a reflection loop for you.\n\n(01:23:14):\nAnother thing that I think is quite powerful at the end of the day is to write down, keep a notebook by the side of the bed and write down one or two or three things that you are grateful for during the day, just like a simple gratitude journal. And you'll start, this keeps you in this frame of mind of what was cool today, what happened that was satisfying or joyful, what brought me joy and then if you start the day thinking about what you'd like to happen and then you look back and say, \"What was great?\" Your brain is just starting to look for those good things. Look for those big highlights, and that's a great way to live your life day to day saying, \"This is what I hope will happen. This is what did happen. Now I'm more tuned into what it might happen tomorrow. Oh, now I'm more tuned into what happened today.\" And again, and it's just a really nice loop. So was there a connection between what you hoped would happen? Did you manage to do your highlight? If so, what helped you do it? What worked or didn't work? What made it hard? It might be an energy thing that suggests a tweak to when you drink coffee or if you take a walk or whatever. It might've been a focus thing. So maybe I'll try another barrier for this thing because that undercut me. Whatever it is, it's just basically, in summary, curiosity about your day instead of self-judgment about your day.\n\nLenny (01:24:30):\nI think we've covered Make Time and tons of depth if people want to practice these things, highly recommend getting the book. It's called Make Time and it's really quick to read and it's basically just a long list of things you can do and we talked about a lot of them. There's a lot more. And I think part of the premise of the book is try stuff, see what works, see what doesn't. Keep reflecting, iterating, some of these things, even if you find two things that change how productive you're, that's a huge win.\n\nJake Knapp (01:24:55):\nI highly recommend people get the book. That's great. And it's our best attempt to put together a how-to guide for doing this stuff. For what it's worth, we're not really motivated to try to create a self-improvement empire. This is not our full-time job. We just hope it works for you and is useful. So if you don't want to buy the book, we get it. Go to maketime.blog and just check out some of the experiments and things that are available there or just try one or two of the things that we talked about today. Try the highlight. If you're going to do one thing, just try right now writing down what you want your highlight to be, either for today or if it's late in the day for tomorrow on a sticky note and put it somewhere that you'll see it tomorrow.\n\n(01:25:41):\nJust that is a great step in the right direction. Try having a conversation with your colleagues or putting a signature or an autoresponder in your mail that says you're going to slow down or talking to them about slowing down at character. At our VC fund, we had a conversation and decided we're going to try to have our main communication happen in Notion so that if we're talking about something, it's in a form, it becomes a document, and the expectation of how you react and respond there is going to be different than in a tool that's designed to get you responding as fast as possible, like an email inbox or Slack.\n\n(01:26:16):\nSo just have a conversation about that. Take a couple apps off your phone. You don't have to buy the book or become totally bought into the system to do those things, but that's what we really want. We just want you to have more time for what matters for you.\n\nLenny (01:26:30):\nAmazing. So I've used up basically all our time talking about Make Time. I think we should have a follow-up episode just to talk about Sprint. What I think we do is let's cut off the lightning round and whatever stuff you guys would've shared there, we'll include in the show notes. I'll send you those questions asynchronously, but let's just talk about Sprint for a few minutes just to give people a sense of what is this framework, it's extremely popular, lets a lot of really successful products, and then we'll wrap up and point people in the direction that you recommend.\n\nJake Knapp (01:26:59):\nCool.\n\nLenny (01:27:00):\nWhat is this framework of Sprint? When do people use this idea, this framework, this approach? And what are some examples of what has come out of somebody applying Sprints?\n\nJake Knapp (01:27:10):\nThe big idea with a design Sprint is to go from a zero to a prototype and a test of that prototype in just five days. And it's a recipe, it's a scripted set of activities that we developed over a number of many years. First, started with some projects I was doing at Google and I run some experiments with the way I was working. I was a product designer on Gmail in the 2000's, and I also co-founded Google Meet. And in the sort of week where we really catalyzed what had been a project that was going nowhere, this 20% project of people who were familiar with Google, like a side project was going nowhere for a year and a half. It was really on the rocks. And in one focused week working together, we decided me and these two other folks we're going to clear everything off.\n\n(01:27:59):\nI visited them in the Stockholm office where they were. We created a working prototype. Instead of trying to come up with the perfect plan, the perfect PRD, the perfect pitch to executives we're like, \"Let's just build a prototype and put it in front of our colleagues and get them using it.\" And we did that and that was the thing that stuck. And so from there on, I was like, \"I need to recreate these kinds of moments for teams because that's powerful.\" So we ran hundreds of these at Google Ventures with startups, tweaked and refined the process, wrote this book called Sprint.\n\n(01:28:28):\nWe run a venture fund today, John and I and our colleague Eli, called Character. We help teams find and expand product market fit with Sprint. It's a tool for doing that and it uses a lot of these principles we talked about with Make Time to change the defaults, but not just the defaults of the way an individual works, but the ways teams work, the way people make decisions, the way we evaluate what's a good idea, a good strategy and worth pursuing based not on just a hunch or a guest, but based on something we can actually see with customer reactions. So all of that kind of in a nutshell is what Sprint does.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:29:07):\nThis idea of getting unstuck and turning maybe some abstract ideas or some concepts that you've been discussing, turning that into a concrete prototype, something that you can look at and you can click around and you can actually try. It works in a lot of different contexts, and we've heard amazing stories from people who read the book and have run Sprints at companies that have a hundred thousand people and governments and all sorts of different organizations, but the stories that are in Sprint are about working with startups.\n\n(01:29:45):\nWe think this is especially valuable for startups because typically you've raised a certain amount of money which buys you a certain amount of runway. You have a certain amount of time to prove that you have product market fit to prove that the thing that you're making is the right thing for some customers. And so the faster you can do that, the more quickly you can find out if you're on the right track, the more quickly you can learn and you can course correct and ultimately you can get to a better place faster than if you spent months working on that prototype or that first version of the product before releasing it.\n\nLenny (01:30:22):\nI think what's awesome about it is as a product manager, the idea of containing a new idea experiment to five days versus this ongoing teams distracted on this idea just like, \"Cool, we're going to spend a week, see where this goes. They're not going to spend months exploring. We're not going to talk about it. And just in theory, let's just try it.\" I think it's really powerful. And so for folks that may want to explore this until we do a follow-up episode, is it just by the book, is there anything else you could point them to think about this idea and implementing it?\n\nJake Knapp (01:30:49):\nYeah. Well, if you are thinking about, or in the very early stages of starting a company, a great thing to do is to get in touch with us at character.vc. And actually we're just opening up applications to our labs program. So character.VC/labs. Our labs program is an intensive program for startups, and we will run a sequence of Sprints including some new formats that are not in the book, but are excellent.\n\n(01:31:20):\nThis will be our third time running through this. We found that it's especially valuable for AI startups. So it just turns out that a lot of the complex issues you have to figure out with turning something that may not initially be trustworthy may require a big behavior shift to customers who aren't used to working in this way and sometimes artificial intelligence can produce things that feel kind of alien to people.\n\n(01:31:45):\nAnd so making this stuff actually useful, more than just a chatbot with little stars that's in the corner that says, \"Hey, would you like to ask the AI a question about this?\" But something that's really meaningful, doing this kind of repeated and we'd run a sequence of Sprints doing it again and again, you work with directly with John and I, we find a really powerful way to get started.\n\n(01:32:04):\nAnyway, that's a big advertisement for Character Labs. But yeah, in general, check out the book. Also, would say if you're not quite ready to dip your toe in the whole book, you can go to the sprintbook.com. And we have a ton of resources on there, including a new thing, which is a Miro board, a Miro template that I created that has step-by-step instructions for every single step as well as 30+ videos of me explaining each step and actually I think I'm wearing the same sweatshirt in those, so if you're watching this on YouTube, you can see more of me in this sweatshirt in that template. And that's free, that's free and there's a bunch of resources on the website that are free as well. So anybody, everybody should be able to access this stuff.\n\nLenny (01:32:51):\nStuff. Amazing. And again, for folks that may want to check out the Labs cohort, is there anything other than AI-oriented that would be ideal? Just how early stage, any other markets that are ideal for the Sprint process and the way you're approaching it?\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:33:05):\nYeah, it's a four-week Sprint program for pre-seed software startups. So we only invest in software startups at Character, and this program is really ideal for companies who they know what they're doing. They're not just like, \"Oh, I want to start a company.\" They have an idea of an opportunity that exists, a market that they're focused on, but they definitely haven't reached product market fit.\n\n(01:33:31):\nThey may not even have a product to test that hypothesis with. So it's very early stage, and we are pretty flexible on the sector, the industry that you're in. But what we find is that the more there's kind of a big behavioral risk, the better this stuff works. So if you're just trying to make a slightly better version of something that already exists, and maybe it's going to be a little cheaper or a little faster, a little easier to use, you probably don't need this stuff. You can probably just do it and probably going to work.\n\n(01:34:06):\nBut if you are like one of our portfolio companies, they make AI that controls the industrial facilities. They came from Google DeepMind and they did this for Google data centers before, something like that where you have to convince plant operators who are wearing hard hats and dealing with huge equipment, you have to convince them to trust AI. That's a big behavior shift. That's a big behavioral risk. Or in healthcare, in education, places where it feels like the technology can really make a big difference for people, but it can be hard to get over that hurdle of trust and understanding. Those are the types of opportunities that we think we can really help with.\n\nLenny (01:34:50):\nPlaying on hard mode, these sounds extremely difficult. I love it.\n\nJohn Zeratsky (01:34:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:34:54):\nSo if you're thinking about starting a company or if you're in the process of starting a company, check out character.vc/ labs.

Episode 119: Building better roadmaps | Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)

  "title": "Building better roadmaps | Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)",
  "transcript": "# Building better roadmaps | Janna Bastow (Mind the Product, ProdPad)\n\n## Transcript\n\nJanna Bastow (00:00):\nThe whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level.\n\nJanna Bastow (00:22):\nSo at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you'd take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody and say, \"Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?\" And they'd tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you'd throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you'd make a new one. So the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process.\n\nJanna Bastow (00:47):\nThe value isn't in your roadmap, the value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, \"I think we have this problem, then this problem. What do you think?\" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody who will listen and just check that you're on the right path.\n\nLenny (01:11):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing your own products. I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is Janna Bastow. Janna co-founded Mind the Product, which I believe is the largest community of product people anywhere. She's also the inventor of the roadmapping framework, Now, Next, Later, and the founder of ProdPad, which makes it easy for you to do your roadmapping in this new simpler way. In our chat, we talk about public speaking, community building, roadmapping, vision, and going from product manager to founder. With that, I bring you Janna Bastow.\n\nLenny (01:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Formsort the leading low-code form builder for product teams. If you work at a startup, you've probably experienced the pain of building forms. Product managers come up with an idea for a new onboarding flow, and then engineers have to build it and then maintain these flows forever. Even tiny changes to the flow can take weeks to get implemented, slowing down your team's experimentation cycle. Formsort removes the engineering bottleneck and gives product managers and marketers full control over the form building lifecycle. With Formsort, anyone can build highly customizable forms, implement complex logic, and send data to destinations like Postgres, BigQuery, and Segment.\n\nLenny (02:38):\nCompanies like GoodRx, Candid, and Balance Homes build their most important forms on Formsort, think patient intake data, surveys, and fintech onboarding. They've seen conversion rates increase by over 30%, and have saved thousands of engineering hours. I always tell startups that improving onboarding is one of the most powerful ways to optimize activation and increase retention. Formsort makes this process as easy as possible and it's why I'm a proud investor.

Coda's an all in one doc that combines the best of documents, spreadsheets, and apps in one place. I actually use Coda every single day. It's my home base for organizing my newsletter writing. It's where I plan my content calendar, capture my research, and write the first drafts of each and every post. It's also where I curate my private knowledge repository for paid newsletter subscribers. And it's also how I manage the workflow for this very podcast.\n\nLenny (03:42):\nOver the years I've seen Coda evolve from being a tool that makes teams more productive to one that also helps bring the best practices across the tech industry to life. With an incredibly rich collection of templates and guides in the Coda doc gallery, including resources from many guests on this podcast, including Shreyas, Gokul, and Shishir, the CEO of Coda.Some of the best teams out there like Pinterest, Spotify, Square and Uber, use Coda to run effectively and have published their templates for anyone to use.

Just to start off and set a little context for folks, could you give listeners a 55 second background on what you've been up to in your career?\n\nJanna Bastow (04:57):\nYeah, absolutely. So I'm a product manager by background. I started my career falling into product management like a lot of people do, accidentally. I worked my way up to be head of product at a startup in London. And then saw the need for product management tools, because there wasn't really anything like that out there. So started building ProdPad. One of my co-founders, who I also happened to start Mind the Product with, and Mind the Product turned into the world's largest community of product managers. So I ended up founding two things at the same time, and that's what kept me busy for the last decade or so.\n\nLenny (05:28):\nAnd currently you have a company, maybe just mentioned that, before we move on, because I think it'll be important.\n\nJanna Bastow (05:33):\nYep, absolutely. So that tool that I was talking about turned into ProdPad, which is software for product people. So it's a tool that allows you to build roadmaps and do your OKRs and capture ideas from your team and feedback from your customer and just organize all your product managements stuff in one space.\n\nLenny (05:47):\nAwesome. So you mentioned Mind the Product and ProductTank, which is kind of this associated component. I'm not exactly sure the difference, but I know they're related. One's a community component, right? Is that right?\n\nJanna Bastow (05:57):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (05:57):\nYeah. So I think you mentioned it's probably the biggest product community in the world, both online and offline. And as someone that's building their own community around the newsletter and the podcast that I have, I'm always curious just to learn what folks have learned about building communities, especially for product people. So question on my mind is, what do you think has been most important in getting Mind the Product community right early on, and then also just maintaining the quality of the community?\n\nJanna Bastow (06:23):\nHonestly, it wasn't so much that we set out to build a community, it was that we got together with some product people with the idea that we didn't know what we were doing. And so we figured if we got together with some other product people and started chatting it through, we'd all learn together. And so it was just the sense of sharing and collaborating and learning from each other and just keeping it as grassroots as possible as it grew. And consistency as well, just always being there, every month, holding a ProductTank, every year of holding an event. But just being there, whenever there was a chance to be there.\n\nLenny (06:56):\nSo I'm hearing is just putting in the time, doing it consistently. I imagine a big part of it was having the right sort of people involved early on that are maybe the right exemplars of the type of community you want to build. Is that roughly right?\n\nJanna Bastow (07:09):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean surround yourself with the people who are going to help you continue that community and are going to help you with that consistency, and going to help you surround you with more and more of the right people. One of the things we learned really early on was that we only had so wide of a network. And so being able to get other people to help us curate and bring in other smart people to help find other speakers outside of our network, and help find people to write on the blog when we'd run out things to rant about. Similar to what you do, Lenny, you've got people from all over your community helping to contribute to the wider picture.\n\nLenny (07:42):\nAwesome. What's the scale of the community at this point?\n\nJanna Bastow (07:45):\nThat's a good question. I don't have the exact number. What you might not know or what you might know is that Mind the Product was actually sold earlier this year, so I don't have-\n\nLenny (07:51):\nMm-hmm. I did know that.\n\nJanna Bastow (07:52):\n... a handle on the exact numbers now. And it did go influx when COVID hit. I know at one point in time the ProductTank was like 200 going on almost 300 cities around the world. I don't know what that number is today. I know that it sort of went up and then down and then back up again. Some of those are digital still, some of those are back in-person. I know that there's thousands and thousands of product people around the world who are taking part in the community in one way, shape, or form or the other. And, of course, some people take part in the big conferences as well.\n\nLenny (08:22):\nI imagine there were some mistakes that you made along the way building this community.\n\nJanna Bastow (08:26):\nOh God.\n\nLenny (08:26):\nIs there anything that stands out as, \"Oh, man, we shouldn't have done that\"? For folks that are thinking about building communities these days,\n\nJanna Bastow (08:32):\nWhen running a conference, it's one of the most expensive and unleanest things you can possibly do. It's really difficult as a product person to pull that off, because it pulls at your heart. You want to do something that's lean iterative, but you can't. If something screws up with the lunch order, for example, you can't fix it. You have to wait until the next year and you just have to pull out whatever you can to make it good enough for that particular year. There was a year once when we ordered food and it didn't turn out to be enough, because the caters under delivered, and we ended up having to get all our volunteers to go to the local sandwich shops and buy all the food up and bring it in.It was stuff like that that was difficult at the time, but we made do with what we could and we ended up sending cash cards to our attendee saying, \"Here, let's make it up to you.\" Stuff like that, that just becomes logistically really, really difficult when you're just thinking, \"Oh, we just pay a supplier and they make it happen.\" It's not that simple.\n\nLenny (09:29):\nGot it. Okay. But that's a plus one for me to never run a conference, something I never want to do. And this is a reminder of all the pain that goes into them.\n\nJanna Bastow (09:38):\nConferences are ridiculously hard. I mean the thing that I've learned is when something goes wrong in a conference, it doesn't happen in the hundreds of dollars of cost, it happens in the thousands of dollars of cost. A speaker who decides they can't make it for one reason or the other, totally legitimate reason, sure, but you've already paid for their business class flights, and so you've got to find another speaker last minute and get them over. That's thousands of pounds in the hole. It could be things like the printing went wrong and you found out the day before, that's more dollars gone. There's lots of things that could go wrong. Our venue once went bust, the after party venue once went bust three weeks before the conference. That was year one.\n\nLenny (10:19):\nSuper.\n\nJanna Bastow (10:19):\nAll of these things, yeah, that's what we said, \"Super, what are we supposed to do?\" We ended up having to just make do and found somewhere else and roll with it. So lots of things that go wrong at that sort of level. But the thing is that we built up a lot of goodwill with the community and were able to get help from people around us, get suggestions from people around us. And when things ended up, actually it turns out we ended up with a smaller venue than we expected, or this was slightly different or whatever else, we had people forgive us. It worked out okay, in our favor.\n\nLenny (10:49):\nJust while on this topic, I'm most curious, are conferences like a good business? Do they make a ton of money in some occasions? Is it always just super thin margin? How does that even business work?\n\nJanna Bastow (10:59):\nIt's not for the faint hearted. It's hugely risky. In hindsight, I'm highly surprised we actually made it through some of those first ones. If you can do it, there are some amazing ways that you can monetize them. But it only starts making a difference at larger figures, and it takes a lot of efforts to actually get to that point. Somebody once asked me like, \"Oh, we're struggling to sell tickets. How do you sell all those tickets?\" We'll start a community several years before and invite people and run a thing, some sort of community meetup every month time, time again beforehand, and that's your marketing.\n\nJanna Bastow (11:33):\nJust if you undersell tickets to a conference, for example, it can absolutely break it. And you see sometimes conferences, they run one and they don't have enough people turning up and it's gone. That can just break it. It's ridiculous. Something like COVID comes by and it can break it. It's a ridiculously hard business. It's really hard to ensure against. It's really hard to think of all the things that could go wrong and protect against. So while there are some upsides, it's not for the faint hearted.\n\nLenny (12:01):\nOkay, cool. That's another plus one. I have a friend who runs events here in San Francisco and I'm always just like, \"How can someone be excited about running events over and over? It's so stressful and full of risk and there's always things going wrong. You can't ever have fun at these things.\" So it's always a different personality.\n\nJanna Bastow (12:16):\nYeah, event organizer or event manager or something like that was once listed as one of the most stressful jobs out there. And you can see why. It's because it all just lands on you all at once. And once the event is over, there's the sense of [foreign language 00:12:29], as in it's over and now what? The next day you're just like, \"Yay.\" You can look at the tweet stream of everything that happened. You can look back at the photos and then you're like, \"What do we do next?\"\n\nLenny (12:38):\nStart prepping for ext year.\n\nJanna Bastow (12:39):\nYou start prepping for next year, off we go again. And it's really hard work. But there again, product management was also listed as one of the toughest jobs, one of the hardest jobs out there. I'm not sure if that still stands, but I know product management as it stood 10 years ago, five, 10 years ago, certainly did have a different vibe to it, and it was a really tough job.\n\nLenny (12:58):\nContinues to be a very tough job. On the topic of conferences and speaking, I've watched a bunch of your talks online before we started chatting today. And a couple things I noticed. One is you're just an awesome speaker, and you're also storyteller. And something that comes up a lot on this podcast is just how important communication skills are to product leaders and product managers and storytelling. And you've also seen a bunch of people do awesome talks at these conferences. So I'm just curious, whatever you have in mind, what has helped you become a better speaker and storyteller? And then also what have you seen is important to folks that are really good at storytelling and presenting at a conference, let's say?\n\nJanna Bastow (13:37):\nRight. Yeah, such a good question. I mean, I have learned by watching a lot of other people. One of the things that I have been super lucky in my career is that by being part of Mind the Product I've gotten to watch every last Mind the Product speaker, top end speakers. I've been able to see every ProductTank London speaker, and a lot of the other ProductTank speakers around the world. Been able to see what people react to, what works, what doesn't work. So I've been able to develop a taste for a good talk and a good presentation and that sort of thing.\n\nJanna Bastow (14:06):\nBut also one of the things that Mind the Product has been able to provide to speakers is a speaker coach. So when I was invited to speak on the Mind the Product stage in 2017, one of the things that they provided to me was an actual speaker coach, somebody to take my talk and improve on it. And it was really nerve-wracking taking my half-written talk, which I started months and months before, it started off with just Post-It Notes scattered along the wall, which I tried to turn into something. And I think it was probably six hours worth of content. And I brought this to this speaker coach, and I had a vague script idea of what I wanted to say.\n\nJanna Bastow (14:43):\nAnd she said to me, one of the first things, she said, \"Well, I've taken your script and I've turned it around. I've rewritten the jokes to land a little bit better.\" I was like, \"That's great. I had jokes.\" And she helped turn the stories around, so that they carried through. She helped with posture. She helped with delivery. She helped with even just phrasing of words. Just making sure that everything landed in particular ways. And one of the things she did was make me listen to it and play it back, which I had not done before. And I still hate doing to this day, but am now more used to it than before.And I don't think anybody likes listening to the sound of their own voice. I don't think anybody likes doing that. But it does help with it. If you've got a large presentation, a big presentation, you've got to get up to that level. If you're nervous about doing it in front of a 1,000 people, then getting to that level that you're actually willing to, able to hear yourself do it, and you're able to do the talk flawlessly in the shower, and as you're walking to work, and as you're doing your groceries and all that sort of stuff, then it makes a big difference.\n\nLenny (15:47):\nSo one tactic that I love that you shared is record yourself, watch yourself ,keep refining, but watching your actual performance. Looking back at the lessons your coach taught you for new presentations that you do, is there anything else that sticks with you? Or just let's make sure to get X, Y, Z nailed because that'll help make this talk better.\n\nJanna Bastow (16:06):\nOne of the things that I've stopped doing is I used to sit down with a PowerPoint and start writing my deck in PowerPoint or Slides, now. What I now do is I start with my story points. I start with my narratives. I try to figure out what I'm actually trying to say, and then I fit it into the deck. Because what I was doing before, I would get stuck in this mode of the presentation mode, and trying to make the presentation, the slides fit my narrative as opposed to the opposite way around. Having a great narrative, and the slides should follow more naturally.\n\nLenny (16:43):\nWhat about just the presenting, the physical anxiety of presenting?, Is there anything you've done there to get better with that and feel-\n\nJanna Bastow (16:51):\nOh, yes.\n\nLenny (16:51):\n... more comfortable?\n\nJanna Bastow (16:51):\nSo one of the things that actually really does work is the power pose, standing with your hands on your hips and it really does, I'm not sure if it's adrenaline or endorphins or something, it releases some sort of chemicals that really does just help boost your confidence and make you feel better as you're getting ready to stand on stage. And it something that's me and other Mind the Product speakers, and I've done behind all the big stages that I've done in recent years. Stand there with your hands on your hips and just feel better about it as opposed to sitting there balling up in that tense pile of stress.\n\nJanna Bastow (17:25):\nOne of the other things that I always do, if I get a chance to, is get out onto the stage sooner rather later. So when they do the tech check, just walk out onto the stage and just wonder back and forth and look out to the audience and greet it. There's no one there. It's the day before, it's completely empty. But look up at the audience and just enjoy that sweep of the audience, and just get used to it. And imagine it full of people. Don't imagine them naked, that doesn't matter. But just imagine them there, so that when you actually do see them the next day, it's not so stressful.\n\nJanna Bastow (17:56):\nOne of the other things I try to do is find the people in the audience who are your fans. And you'll find them in the course of your talk. There's always going to be some people in the audience who just look bored and they're on your phone, just ignore them. They're always going to be there. Find the people who are nodding along and smiling and going, \"Yeah, yeah, that's me. That's me.\" And just speak to them. And if you find one up there and one over there and one down there, no one's going to notice that you're doing your talk just to them. And just keep delivering your talk around the room to these few key people. They're having a great time, you're having a great time, and you're doing a great talk as a result.\n\nLenny (18:30):\nThat's such good advice. The power pose piece, you said that it's hands on hips. I think there's also when we raise your hands up and you're like Superman or something. I think there's-\n\nJanna Bastow (18:38):\nThat could work, yeah.\n\nLenny (18:38):\nYeah. I think people have different ones. Also, I've seen that, there's like all the science that showed that was effective and then I think it was one of those experiments that wasn't replicatable. People are kind of worried that there's not real science backing that up. But I've done that myself and it actually works. And so it doesn't matter ,if it works for you, just do it.\n\nJanna Bastow (18:57):\nYeah. If it's a placebo, hey, don't tell me that, it works. Honestly, I feel better at the end of it, and get on stage and do a better job.\n\nLenny (19:05):\nSomeone made this point, placebo is this magical thing that we have in our brains that gets things to change by not having anything go. You just change things. It's amazing. It's magical.\n\nJanna Bastow (19:15):\nYeah. Placebos are as effective as the actual drug, whatever. I'm happy with a placebo. Just don't break the placebo effect for me. That would be fine, right?\n\nLenny (19:23):\nYeah. That's right. One last question on the speaking stuff. How bad were you initially? Just because folks probably see you, see some of your talks and they're like, \"Oh, my god, I'm never going to be this good. I'm screwed.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (19:34):\nYeah, I used to be shaky, little fawn, shaky voice, terrified at the front. Okay. So it was one of the first ever ProductCamp events that we were running. And the first one I think I did okay at, but it was a smaller group, it who's only like 50 or so people. And the second one it had ballooned to 200 people. This is more product people than I'd ever known. And they were all super professional, and they're all looking at me. And I stood at the front of this group and I was supposed to just, I don't know, tell them what they were supposed to be doing that day. And I had it all half written down, and I started talking and then I sort just tripped up over what I was saying and forgot everything and blanked. And I just looked up and I went, \"I'm really sorry everybody. I'm just going to start again.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (20:19):\nAnd I started again. I said, \"Hi everybody, I'm Janna and welcome to ProductCamp.\" And I just started again and they were just totally fine with it. Honestly, it was fine. And this is the thing that I've learned since then is people in the audience are rooting for you. They were totally cool with this. They didn't think anything of it and they just rolled with it, as did I. And so whenever I see somebody who's struggling on stage, just give them a nod, a smile, clap them along, give them reassuring looks, and hopefully they'll just pull through.\n\nJanna Bastow (20:48):\nAnd if you ever feel like you're shaking, you're corpsing on stage, you're falling apart, honestly, just take a deep breath and just pick up where you last remembered you were and just keep going. Honestly, no one is rooting for you to fall over and have a bad time. Everyone's rooting for you to finish your point and get on with it.\n\nLenny (21:05):\nThat's such a great story and it's a good example of people have this fear of the worst case scenario. Everything's going to fall apart. They're going to be seen as idiots, they don't know what they're doing. It's all going to be revealed on stage, because you screw up in how you're talking. And the worst case scenario never happens, in my experience. And two,, if it does, just do exactly what you said, just try to start again. It's easy to say, hard to do. This isn't a conscious thing that people can get over. It's like your body's just doing crazy shit and you're so nervous sometimes and can't just rationalize it to like, \"Nah, it'll be fine.\" But, yeah, it's fine. To your point, people want you to be awesome and succeed. They're not there to like, \"Ha, ha, you stopped. You screwed up.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (21:47):\nAnd it's humanizing when you screw up, right? People don't like people who are perfectly perfect and don't mess up, and it makes them feel like they can't go up and go do their talk. I mean I think that right there showed everybody else that they could go up on the little ProductCamp stages that day and go do their own talks. And they certainly wouldn't be any worse than that. As long as I just remembered their name, they'd be fine. Crack on, they got it.\n\nLenny (22:12):\nSpeaking of screwing up, you have some very spicy takes on roadmap and roadmaps.\n\nJanna Bastow (22:16):\nOoh, yes, I do.\n\nLenny (22:20):\nAnd then generally the mistakes people make in organizing the roadmap. So I definitely want to spend some time here. So first of all, you have some strong feelings against Gantt based road mapping. Can you talk about that?\n\nJanna Bastow (22:31):\nYeah, sure. I used to do timeline roadmapping. The first version of ProdPad was actually a timeline roadmap. So to take you back, when I was a junior product manager, mid-level product manager, I used to do my roadmap like everyone else was doing the road, as in I looked up what a roadmap was, and it looked like a colorful Gantt chart. I knew what a Gantt chart was. And so I started putting one together, which is where I'd take the features that I was working on and line them up against their due dates. And I would get a little pat on the head from my boss, and they'd say, \"Good job, now go deliver it,\" basically.\n\nJanna Bastow (23:05):\nAnd I would do my best with delivery, and I'd never quite be able to deliver everything. Something would always get in the way. But I sort of assumed that was my fault. I just wasn't great at delivery, and I just had to get a little bit better at adding enough buffer and setting expectations and doing a roadmap slightly better. But I figured that this is how everyone was doing the roadmaps, and it was just me who wasn't finishing the stuff on the roadmap quite right.\n\nJanna Bastow (23:29):\nAnd when it came to creating the first tools for roadmap, I'd envision something that would actually help me manage this format of a roadmap more easily. Which I ended up creating the very early version of ProdPad, which was a digitized version of this, where you could drag and drop ideas onto the roadmap and stretch and squeeze them, and pan the roadmap back and forth. And I shared this with some early product people that I knew, some early users, and they gave me some feedback and some of them absolutely loved it.\n\nJanna Bastow (23:56):\nThey're like, \"Yeah, this is great. Now I can stop using PowerPoints or whatever tool I'm using or drawing it up in whatever I can now start using this digitized tool.\" But one of the things that we started hearing from early customers is about a month later they said, \"Great, but I want to take this, and move all these things here over by a month in the field.\" We're like, \"Oh, that's interesting. We've heard that from a bunch of other people too. Now why is that?\" Because had we just asked our customers, had we just built what our customers wanted, we would've just ended up with a multi-select drag and drop. But this was all built in jQuery and it was a little bit difficult to build that.\n\nJanna Bastow (24:35):\nSo we sort of asked the five whys, we dug in to why people wanted this thing, and we found out that no one was actually delivering the roadmap in the timeframe that they were saying they were. So we're like, \"Wait, if it's not just us who's not living the roadmap and none of these better than us roadmap product managers are building the roadmap on time, what's the point of a roadmap? Why are we giving them a roadmap?\" So that's when we sat down, it was myself and Simon, my co-founder at ProdPad, and we sat down and we came up with a three column roadmap, current, near term, future, which became now, next, later.\n\nJanna Bastow (25:08):\nAnd it took away the simple concept of a timeline at the top. Now, the problem with the timeline is that as soon as you have a timeline, it turns it into a math chart sort of thing, where you've got time on the X axis and things to do on the Y axis and you basically end up with everything underneath is assigned a due date or a iteration. And it seems that everything that you do has a due date, an iteration just by the format of the roadmap, which is painful. It's just wrong, because we don't have that. The further out you plan, the more you're making it up. We know this.\n\nJanna Bastow (25:45):\nAnd so we wanted more flexibility and we knew that other product managers wanted that flexibility, because we kept asking what they were up to. So we decided to break it down into these three buckets, and provided that as an option and people loved it. It became this first bump in our usage of ProdPad, because people went, \"Oh, wait, I can just say what's happening now, what's happening next, and what's happening later? And if I want to, I can add a date to the specific thing, but I don't have to. And I can be less and less granular about that as I go forwards. Yeah.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (26:18):\nSo it's taking from the concept of the cone of uncertainty, taking from the idea that things get less certain as they get further away, which is kind of how reality works. So the whole beef with the timeline roadmap is just taking apart the concept of the timeline. It doesn't mean we live in la la land. It doesn't mean that we don't believe in having dates on the roadmap, if there is a date that we have to work towards. It just means not penalizing ourselves by having a date on everything on the roadmap.\n\nLenny (26:49):\nGot it. Okay. I didn't know that you could put dates on some of the things that's interesting, because I was trying to understand exactly how this approach works. We should also mentioned, you came up with this whole idea of now, next, later, which a lot of people use now. Is that right?\n\nJanna Bastow (27:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (27:02):\nAwesome. Okay. So as someone that's been using Gantt timelines his whole career, I'm really curious to dig into these ideas and challenge the default assumption.\n\nLenny (27:12):\nI'm excited to chat with my friend John Cutler from podcast sponsor Amplitude. Hey, John.\n\nJohn Cutler (27:17):\nHey, Lenny. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny (27:18):\nJohn, give us a behind the scenes at Amplitude. When most people think of Amplitude, they think of product analytics, but now you're getting into experimentation, and even just launched a CDP. What's the thought process there?\n\nJohn Cutler (27:30):\nWell, we've always thought of Amplitude as being about supporting the full product loop, think collect data, inform bets, ship experiments, and learn. That's the heart of growth to us. So the big aha was seeing how many customers were using Amplitude to analyze experiments, use segments for outreach, and send data to other destinations. Experiment in CDP came out of listening to and observing our customers.\n\nLenny (27:51):\nAnd supporting growth and learning has always been Amplitude's core focus, right?\n\nJohn Cutler (27:55):\nYeah. So Amplitude tries to meet customers where they are. We just launched starter templates, and have a great scholarship program for startups. There's never been a more important time for growing.\n\nLenny (28:04):\nAbsolutely agree. Thanks for joining us, John. And head to amplitude.com to get started.\n\nLenny (28:09):\nThere's two questions that this brings up, and you may have answered them in part. One is just without dates on things, how do you make sure marketing and sales and your CEO has things that they need for promising or at least giving a sense of when a product will come out? And the other is just aligning internally with engineers, design being done on a certain date, engineers being done on a certain date, PMs being done a certain day, [inaudible 00:28:32]. How do you deal with those in this format?\n\nJanna Bastow (28:36):\nThere's a couple ways that you can turn that around. So one is you should still be having regular communication, so they can still see what's coming up in the now call them. So they have a sense of what the order of things are and that things that are in the now column are probably weeks away, not months and months away. You should probably have launch readiness meetings so people understand this is the stuff that's going through testing, and that's likely to be coming out now.\n\nJanna Bastow (28:59):\nBut one of the other things that you can be doing for your marketing and sales teams is separating your hard launch from your soft launch. So what you should be doing is basically saying your developers are able to launch something on a particular date and it's the date that's convenient for them, right? Let's say they think that they can get something out for end of September. Now, that might be pushed to made October because things go wrong.\n\nJanna Bastow (29:23):\nNow at that point, whether it's end of September or mid-October, it doesn't really matter to the marketers because they're busy talking about the stuff that was launched in August. They've got lots of stuff to work on. They're selling and marketing the stuff that's already live and out there. When this new thing comes out, that's a soft launch. As soon as that soft launch is out, great, let's kick off this launch meeting with launch steps. Now you've got something else to go do. And it's so much better for marketing anyways because they're not setting up their launch steps based on something that they don't have eyes on. There's nothing worse than the marketers trying to market something based on pictures from the designers that have vastly changed by the time they go out or that they don't know whether it's going to come out on the right day or not.\n\nJanna Bastow (30:07):\nSo they've actually got a functional working version that they can share with some customers. They can start getting videos of it working. They can get testimonials from early beta users. And then they can spend, whether it's two days or six days or six weeks or six months planning the biggest, bangest launch they want. They can then spend the next however long they want to launch their hard launch, and then that goes out. And in that period that they're doing that hard launch development is cracking on with their next thing.\n\nJanna Bastow (30:41):\nAnd by the time that they're done that marketing is then, \"Okay, great, what have you built? We're ready to work on the next thing.\" So you're just separating soft launch from hard launch, so that you don't have this stress of trying to line up to completely different types of projects, your marketing projects and your development projects, which is where a lot of those things fall apart.\n\nLenny (31:00):\nGot it. So kind of the basic premise is roadmaps or timelines sound great and awesome. Everyone would love to know when things are going to be done and if it worked it'd be great. Oftentimes, they're all made up, they don't work, you don't hit deadlines, they're always missed. So instead of promising dates for everything you're doing, you're better off generally just giving a sense of, \"Here's what we're going to work on now. Here's what's coming up next.\" And then for the things that really need a date, we're going to put dates on those things and give it our best shot. Is that [inaudible 00:31:29]-\n\nJanna Bastow (31:29):\nYeah. That's absolutely right. If something does have to have a date, we don't live in la la land, if something has a regulatory date, when GDPR came down, everyone had a due date on the roadmap, because if you didn't hit that date then you were going to be in trouble. Sometimes you might have dates that are tied to things like the Christmas rush, or if you're in education it might be like has to be out by the school year.\n\nJanna Bastow (31:50):\nAt which point, in order to reach something by that date you have to put in more project planning work, as in you have to plan out ahead of time, you have to put in more buffer time to do that. And generally you have to plan to get that thing done well before, so that you can have a soft launch before and make sure it works and do some iteration and fix it before the actual full-on launch happens. Because if you leave it too late, it's going to go wrong and you're going to miss the deadline.\n\nJanna Bastow (32:16):\nIf you did that for all of your launches, you're just going to end up either cutting quality, because everything's just going to be big crap cause it's going to be pushing it out the door last minute. Or you're just going to end up spending so much time trying to plan things to the nth degree that you're just going to move super slow. This is why you end up with teams who are really big but can't deliver worth anything. Where compared to these tiny teams, who are just out delivering them and just spinning things out the door, they're the ones who aren't spending all their time going, \"Are we certain this is going to deliver? And how many hours is this going to take you? And let me go talk to this person, find out how many days it's going to take him,\" and back and forth and back and forth. They're just building, and it goes faster.\n\nLenny (32:57):\nI'd love to pull on that thread. I was thinking about the fact that you're building software for product teams and so you have a really unique perspective on product teams and you've seen a lot of product teams a lot more than a lot of other folks. And so I was curious what percentage of teams that you see are what you'd call like top notch, highly functional product teams?\n\nJanna Bastow (33:18):\nThat's a good question. I don't think I've got an answer there because it's going to be biased, because we naturally attract companies who self-select our way of working. We put on our site, no timelines come for the now, next, later. So it's going to be a much higher percentage. People don't sign up for demos with us if they know that they want a timeline nowadays, because we make it really clear. So I would say like 70% of them are like we want now, next, later. And I know that's not real. I know that's not the real state of people, of product teams out there.\n\nLenny (33:48):\nCool. So yeah, that makes sense.\n\nJanna Bastow (33:49):\nI do have a sense that it's increasing. So what I have found is years ago when we first started this thing off, no one was talking this way. It was a whole new concept and people are like, \"No, this is crazy doc, you can't do it this way.\" Then over the years it has just become the natural way that people are working on it. People are going, \"Of course this is the way that it works. Why would it work any other way?\" It's becoming the expected way. Definitely changed the discourse and changed the expectations of the audience, I guess.\n\nLenny (34:13):\nPutting the now next later piece to the site for one moment. I'm curious what else have you seen separates the best product teams from mediocre product teams? In terms of how they execute, the people they hire, processes, is there anything else that you've noticed of just like this team, when I think of teams that are functioning super well? Other than implementing this process you're recommending, is there anything else that often comes up?\n\nJanna Bastow (34:37):\nYeah, a couple things. A focus on discovery. So this ability to spend time in discovery and asking questions of customers and constantly being able to iterate based on that. And psychological safety, so teams who are able to question each other, speak up when they see that things are wrong, question what's going on at the senior level, question what's going on at different team levels, and generally just have the good sense of what's going on across their business because they're allowed to ask those questions, less silos.\n\nLenny (35:05):\nThanks. What's a lasting change that a team has made that made them significantly better at building product? Is it these two things, doing more discovery and maybe more safety? I imagine part of your answer will be implementing this way of working of now, next, later. Is there anything else that comes to mind? \"Wow, wow, this one team did this one thing and it made things so much better for them.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (35:24):\nLike retrospectives. Retrospectives make such a big difference because they are indicative of psychological safety, which underpins so much, right? Once you start building in this psychological safety, the ability to ask questions and to start saying, \"What are we doing that's working? What are we doing that's not working? Okay, determine that something doesn't work. Are we allowed to go change it? Okay, we are allowed to go change it.\" Okay, this is a team who's now changing their situation. They're talking to each other, they're learning from each other, and they're making a concerted effort to do so. And so these are the teams who are constantly learning, iterating, and moving forwards.\n\nJanna Bastow (36:03):\nAnd they naturally move towards things like now, next, later. They naturally move towards things like doing discovery, because these are just, I don't know, they're kind of common sense. They're not setting in stone expectations of what's going to be done and when. Because that was really only done because some head honcho wanted to see that information. That wasn't psychological safety. That was somebody pinning them down by the neck saying, \"Tell me what's going to be done and when.\" Psychological safety is just saying, \"Hey, tell me as much information as you know and then do discovery to learn as much as you can, so that we can move forward with this.\" It's all about just talking to your teammates and getting the most information as you can from the resources you have, making the most of the collective intelligence that you have within your company.\n\nLenny (36:46):\nComing back to the now, next, later approach, you're often doing something really hard at companies, which is changing their way of working and changing their product culture. And I'm curious what you've learned about what it takes to change product development culture and product culture and the way of working at larger companies.\n\nJanna Bastow (37:04):\nLarger companies are tough. They're tougher. I think of culture as calcification. So calcification being the limestone that is built up as watered run over and that sort of thing. And in order to fix it, you can kind of chip it off over time. You can't just fix it all in one go. And so in order to fix it, you've got to chip away at it. You've got to find a small pocket somewhere. You've got to make use of the tools that you've got. So sometimes it might be finding a small subset of the company and saying, 'Hey, here's the startup lab within the business. Let's let them run off and go do something.\" Because changing the mindset of the whole company is just too difficult. It's set in stone, and it's stuck where it is and can't change them all at once. But we can change this one little space right here, because we've got a shit hot leader who knows what they're doing and we can take this pocket of people and go do something here.\n\nJanna Bastow (38:00):\nAnd then they're going to teach the rest of the company. They're going to teach this section and then this section and then this section. You don't have to go and change the whole company all at once, but it does take buy-in from above. And sometimes that can be really difficult to take, because the incentives from above are often misaligned with the incentives that it takes to get a company moving this direction.\n\nJanna Bastow (38:21):\nUltimately, a lot of these larger companies, they're incentivized to keep the company as stable as possible, to keep the company just growing quarter on quarter. Which is great for the stock market, they love that stability, they love that quarter on quarter growth. But if the company is actually under threat from startups, if you're a big bank, you're in health tech, something like that, you almost certainly have startups nipping at your heels. And the reality is that you probably have enough cash to make it for the next 20 years or so, but over time it's going to get bitten away at.\n\nJanna Bastow (38:58):\nAnd you've got smaller startups who are going to take the juicier, more interesting parts of your business and leave you with the tougher parts of your business. Take HSBC versus all the companies who are coming out with got a Starling account here and I've got a mortgage with somebody else and you've got your savings account somewhere else. You've got all these smaller startups nipping at their heels. These companies are going to nip away at these larger businesses and if these larger companies don't actually do something with it, they're actually going to end up losing this ability to innovate themselves. And so these companies are essentially stuck in this pattern where they want to continue growing and yet they're not going to, they're going to end up not being willing to take the dip to move upwards.\n\nLenny (39:42):\nWhat's the biggest company that you've implemented this new way of building? And is that how you approached it, you found a team within the larger company to roll out this new-\n\nJanna Bastow (39:53):\nYes.\n\nLenny (39:53):\n... yeah, this framework?\n\nJanna Bastow (39:54):\nYeah. So that's how it generally works with the way that we work with our enterprise rollouts is like we worked with large enterprises of governments as well. It generally starts with an advocate, somebody who gets the way that we're working, a division, a department, and then it starts from there. Sometimes what we'll find is that we'll get one or two, sometimes three or four many groups starting and then they'll start banding together and saying, \"Hey, no, we're starting a thing here.\" Once that starts happening, it's easier to start that conversation saying, \"Okay, yeah, we've got a whole thing going here. Let's talk to the person who is the VP of strategy, or who owns the tech area,\" and then we can have a bigger conversation.\n\nLenny (40:33):\nWhat's the impact that you saw at that company having taken on this new way of building product?\n\nJanna Bastow (40:39):\nSo we're in the middle of a key tool in the middle of transformations right now, which is fascinating to see. These are multi-year pieces of work where you're seeing it being used for ongoing products that are being used and delivered as we speak, as well as part of a mindset shift within the business. Because one of the things about ProdPad is that it's not just a tool to help you deliver your products, it's actually a tool that helps you become a better product manager. It sets in stone better product management practices. Once you start using it, it makes it difficult to go back to bad product management practices.\n\nJanna Bastow (41:15):\nWhen you create a roadmap in ProdPad, it makes difficult to add features and dates to the roadmap. It makes it difficult to make a timeline based roadmap. It makes it difficult to add ideas to the backlog that are not thought through, because it asks questions, thoughtful questions, like what problem does this solve? And why would you want to solve it? And what are the outcomes? And what did you get?So it makes it difficult to fall into a build trap with just saying, \"Here's stuff to build,\" and we built it, and move on to the next thing, like a lot of dev tools are designed to do. Because it has spaces in there to say, \"Did you measure success? And was it successful or not successful? This roadmap thing is completed, what was the outcome of it?\" So by creating all these spaces, it creates all these reminders for the team to go back and think about this stuff before they do work and after they do work. So it actually actively helps them become better product teams and more cognizant of this sort of work.\n\nLenny (42:05):\nIf someone wanted to experiment with now, next, later, what would be a good place to go and just start to play around with it?\n\nJanna Bastow (42:12):\nI mean, you can start a free trial in ProdPad, you can start playing around with it. We even have a sandbox mode. You just go to sandbox.prodpad.com where it's got example versions of roadmaps, best practice roadmaps that you can just start playing with. You don't even need a login or a credit card. It's got OKRs and roadmaps and ideas and experiments, feedback. You see how it all sort of fits together. But honestly, a now, next, later roadmap can be done with Post-It Notes on the wall. It's just about saying, \"What problems do you have? Let's lay them out in order and just check them with other people.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (42:45):\nSo the whole point about a roadmap is that it's not designed to be your plan. I think about it as being a prototype for your strategy. What I mean by that is we talk about prototyping all the time in the lean world and a prototype is essentially a way of checking your assumptions. Generally, we think about it in terms of a design or like a model, but think about it at the strategy level. So at the feature level, you'd prototype by doing a design, a mockup, and you take that mockup and you'd share it with somebody, and say, \"Here's a mockup of the feature that I'm trying to build. What do you think?\" And they tell you what's right or wrong, and you'd add some new copy or a button to make it more clear, and you throw out the original prototype, because it wasn't very good and you make a new one.\n\nJanna Bastow (43:27):\nSo the value isn't the prototype, the value is in the prototyping process. The value isn't in your roadmap, The value is in the roadmapping process. What you're actually doing is laying out your assumptions of the problems that you're solving. So you're saying, \"I think we have this problem then this problem. What do you think?\" The whole point is that you just share your early assumptions with other people on the team, with customers, even, like anybody, who will listen. And just check that you're on the right path. And if they say, \"Oh, actually I thought that it was going to go this way, this way, then this way, or that way, then the other way, and what about this problem?\" You've actually learned something. You can adjust your prototype for your strategy, you can adjust your roadmap there and your roadmap all of a sudden becomes stronger, becomes better there.\n\nLenny (44:11):\nFor folks that are listening and they're just like, \"Nah, this is never going to work where I work. It's just too out there, too radical. No deadlines, that's crazy.\" I know you're not saying no deadlines, but less deadlines. What are the most powerful three bullet points you could share with listeners that are just like, :Here's why you should have confidence this might actually work at your company.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (44:32):\nOther teams are already working this way. Product people are the only ones who seem to be pinned down to be required to give concrete dates as to when things are going to be delivered in this way. Your sales team isn't asked to give exact delivery dates on their work. They work in a very experimentation led way as well. You are VP sales or VP revenue or whoever doesn't go to a board meeting and say, \"We're going to close the Acme deal at the end of October for a million pounds.\" They don't know that. What they do know is that they have a process by which they're going to fill a pipeline, and almost certainly they're going to be able to close a million pounds or a million dollars worth of sales, but they can't tell you who it's going to come from or how that's going to work.\n\nJanna Bastow (45:19):\nWhat they're going to say is, \"Give me a quarter million dollars worth of investment into my team, which I'm going to spend that on my account executives, my sales team. They're going to pick up the phone and do a bunch of calls.\" Think of these calls as experiments. These calls, some of them are going to work, some of them are going to fail. They don't know which ones are going to work and which ones are going to fail. What they do know is that by using a script and by picking up the phone and calling people, some are going to work. And by the end of the quarter someone's going to buy. And they know this because last quarter someone bought and the quarter before that someone bought, they just don't know who's going to buy. If they did know who's going to buy, then they would just call those people and not everybody else.\n\nJanna Bastow (45:59):\nSame thing. You're not asking for any more leeway than your sales team. You're saying that you want a quarter million dollars worth of investment, and you're going to spend it on your team who's going to run experiments, right? It's going to be trying this change on the interface or that tweak to the pricing or that change to the positioning or whatever you're going to do. Some of these experiments are going to fail and some are going to succeed. You don't know which ones. But that's okay, you know that by the end of the quarter, enough are going to succeed that you're probably going to move the right numbers in the right direction.\n\nJanna Bastow (46:30):\nSo you're not asking for any more leeway than your salesperson. What you should be able to do is point at how many experiments you ran the previous quarter, and what numbers moved in the right direction. You should be accountable for your experiments and how you're spending the money and what you're doing. But you shouldn't be accountable for saying what is going to work before you know what's going to work yet. And that's the problem with this timeline delivery, Magic 8 Ball that we're asked to give.\n\nLenny (46:58):\nI like that. Two last questions before we get to a very exciting lightning round, which I didn't tell you about. We'll see how that goes. So one is you have an interesting framework for coming up with a product vision, and I don't know if you have this in your head loaded up, but I'm curious how you think about coming up with a product vision. You have this really handy little framework, and vision is always this thing that people are like, \"Man, how do I come up with a vision? How do I phrase a vision? How do I even visualize my team's mission?\" Can you share that with us, if you have that in your head?\n\nJanna Bastow (47:30):\nThe product vision template, you might actually recognize it from the Geoffrey Moore's Crossing the Chasm book. It's the elevator pitch template. But I like it because it answers the same sort of questions that you need to answer for a product vision template. So it asks things like, for your target customer, who the statement of need or the opportunity. The product name is a product category. What's the reason to buy? And then say, unlike this alternative our product, and then say what this statement of differentiation is. So it's actually a template that we have available on our site, and you can actually fill out as part of our product canvas in ProdPad. So happy to share that link with you, so you can link it up and send it to your audience here, Lenny.\n\nLenny (48:17):\nCool. Yeah, we'll put that in the show notes. I think that's the same framework as the positioning exercise. I might be wrong, but if so, that's cool. So basically you could use your positioning work to help figure out your vision. And just like a vision, it's basically a vision statement, it's not necessarily the vision for your product, it's just kind of how you think about where it's going to go.\n\nJanna Bastow (48:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (48:36):\nOkay, cool. The last question, you were a PM now you're founder, so you moved from PM to founder, and a lot of PMs, imagine being founders someday. I'm curious if you have any advice for folks that are currently PMs that may want to be founders in the future. What do you think they should be working on, focusing on, skills, vision rebuilding, things they should be doing to help them in that future career?\n\nJanna Bastow (48:58):\nBeing a PM actually provides you with a lot of the skills and background to be a founder, to be a CEO. It gives you a lot of chance to work with a lot of the different teams and see a lot of the underpinnings of how business works. I was really lucky in previous roles where I got to work very closely with leadership in a few different roles before I took the step up to take on my own thing. So I felt as if I'd seen it in a few different ways, done well and done badly, and so I got a chance to sort of say, \"Ah, I think I could do this. Yeah, go on.\"\n\nJanna Bastow (49:32):\nOne of the things that struck me is it's not as hard as it looks, and it's also harder than it looks. There's things that you get started and you go, oh, no one's going to stop you from doing this. You've got lots of leeway. You can just do it, and you've got lots of freedom to run your business how you want to do it. There's lots of resource out there. As long as you surround yourself with people, you're always going to be able to find people to advise you and to help you along the way. And there's always going to be bumps. You don't know what they're going to be yet. There's always going to be things that are going to come by and side swipe you, but that's always the case that you had when you are product manager as well.\n\nJanna Bastow (50:11):\nAnd just be ready for those and be ready to take it on the chin and deal with them as they come. Best thing you can do is surround yourself with people so that you've got somebody to go to for each thing. Going, \"Oh, when I run into a problem that has to do with this, I can talk to this person. When I run into a problem that has to do with this, I talked to one of these people.\" And figure it out as you go. Take each thing a day at time. Certainly, don't stop yourself from starting a business or starting your own thing, just because you don't think that you know how to do it yet. You will figure it out as you go ahead. People less capable than you have figured it out.\n\nLenny (50:46):\nAwesome. Okay. We've reached our lightning round. The way it's going to work, I'm going to ask you five questions real quick. Whatever comes to mind, share an answer.\n\nJanna Bastow (50:55):\nCool.\n\nLenny (50:56):\nIf nothing comes to mind, that's also cool. Sound good?\n\nJanna Bastow (50:58):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (50:59):\nWhat are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people, whether they're product leaders or just generally?\n\nJanna Bastow (51:06):\nArt of Profitability, I thought was a really good one.\n\nLenny (51:09):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you've watched?\n\nJanna Bastow (51:13):\nOh, Sandman.\n\nLenny (51:14):\nOoh, and that's-\n\nJanna Bastow (51:16):\nSandman is-\n\nLenny (51:16):\n... like a British show, right?\n\nJanna Bastow (51:17):\nOh, it is British. Yes, by Neil Gaiman. Yeah, very good. Definitely, not for children. Thought it might be, definitely not.\n\nLenny (51:25):\nNoted. What's another favorite podcast of yours other than the one you're currently on?\n\nJanna Bastow (51:31):\nOoh, Startups For the Rest Of Us.\n\nLenny (51:33):\nWow, I haven't heard of that one. Tell us more.\n\nJanna Bastow (51:36):\nBasically, it's Rob Walling's podcast and it's for startups that are either bootstrapped or alt funded. Basically, the startups that aren't the one percent top end funded, unicorns, but the startups for the rest of us.\n\nLenny (51:52):\nAwesome. What's a favorite interview question of yours that you like to ask?\n\nJanna Bastow (51:57):\nI like asking people what problems that they're looking to solve. Why are they coming to this table?\n\nLenny (52:03):\nVery PMy question.\n\nJanna Bastow (52:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny (52:05):\nWho else in the industry do you most respect as a thought leader? Who comes to mind?\n\nJanna Bastow (52:10):\nI've got to give a shout out to Christina Wodtke. I had a great conversation with her yesterday, and I've had a chance to chat with her a number of times over the years, but she's just got this illustrious career. She's been part of so many amazing teams, built some amazing things, written some amazing books, and is also just an all round amazing product person and amazing person all in one.\n\nLenny (52:32):\nJanna, this has been amazing. I think we covered a lot of different topics, more than we often cover in a podcast like this. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they'd like to reach out and learn more?

Like with any of these major tech revolutions, headlines tell one story and then on the ground, laying broadband means you need to dig up every single road in America to lay it. Someone's got to dig up the road or someone's got to run the undersea cable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nIs there anything you think people don't truly grasp or understand about where AI models are going to be in the next two, three years?\n\nJason Droege (00:00:31):\nThe general trend right now is going from models knowing things to models doing things. The next question becomes, what can it do for me? How does the agent make decisions for you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nLet's talk about Scale and this whole world of AI that you're in, you essentially pioneered data labeling, trading data, creating evals for labs.\n\nJason Droege (00:00:46):\n18 months ago, you would get a short story and it would say, \"Is this short story better than this short story?\" And now you're at a point where one task is building an entire website by one of the world's best web developers, or it is explaining some very nuanced topic on cancer to a model. These tasks now take hours of time and they require PhDs and professionals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):\nI've talked to a bunch of people that have worked with you over the years, and I heard a lot about just how high of a bar you set for new businesses.\n\nJason Droege (00:01:13):\nFrom an entrepreneurship standpoint, it truly is about what insight do I have? Why am I so lucky to have this insight? Why in a world of a million entrepreneurs who are thinking, who are smart, who are trying everything, why am I in the position where I likely have an insight that others do not?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:31):\nToday, my guest is Jason Droege. Jason is the new CEO of Scale AI. This is the first interview that he's done since taking over for Alex Wang after the Meta deal. Alex now leads the super intelligence team at Meta. Prior to Scale, Jason co-founded a company with Travis Kalanick. Before, he started Uber, worked at a couple startups. Most famously, Jason launched and led Uber Eats, which went from an idea that he and his team had to what is now a multi-billion dollar run rate business and one that basically saved Uber during the pandemic when nobody was taking rides. This interview is following a theme that I've been following through a bunch of interviews, which is the evolution of how AI models actually gets smarter. Along with scaling, compute and improving the actual model code, much of the improvements we're seeing in ChatGPT and Claude and every frontier AI model is these labs hiring experts to filling gaps in their knowledge and correcting their understanding of how things work, and basically showing them what good looks like in every domain that consumers are using models.\n\n(00:02:35):\nScale was the pioneer in this space. They created the category, and in our conversation we talk about what is happening at Scale and just how this deal with Meta worked, what experts like doctors and software engineers are specifically doing to help models get smarter, how the whole market of data labeling and evals and data training has changed from when Scale entered the market to today, and also just how long will we need humans to keep helping AI get smarter. We also get into where Jason sees models going in the next few years because they have such a unique glimpse into the future. We also talk about a ton of really unique and really important product lessons from the course of Jason's career, including a bunch of advice on how to start a new business, both startups and within existing companies, and also a bunch of advice on hiring and leadership and so much more.\n\n(00:03:21):\nA huge thank you to Allen Penn and Stephen Chau for suggesting topics for this conversation.

They're messy, they're slow to build, they're a huge drain on your roadmap, and they're definitely not why you got into product in the first place. Lucky for you, Merge is obsessed with integrations. With a single API, B2B SaaS companies embed merge into their product and ship 220 plus customer facing integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Companies like Mistral AI, Ramp and Dorada use Merge to connect their customers as accounting, HR, ticketing, CRM, and file storage systems to power everything from automatic onboarding to AI-ready data pipelines. Even better, Merge now supports the secure deployment of connectors to AI agents with a new product so that you can safely power AI workflows with real customer data. If your product needs customer data from dozens of systems, Merge is the fastest, safest way to get it. Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and they'll send you a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:04:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Figma, makers of Figma Make. When I was a PM at Airbnb, I still remember when Figma came out and how much it improved how we operated as a team. Suddenly, I could involve my whole team in the design process, give feedback on design concepts really quickly, and it just made the whole product development process so much more fun. But Figma never felt like it was for me. It was great for giving feedback and designs, but as a builder, I wanted to make stuff.\n\n(00:05:25):\nThat's why Figma built Figma Make. With just a few prompts, you can make any idea or design into a fully functional prototype or app that anyone can iterate on and validate with customers. Figma Make is a different kind of vibe coding tool. Because it's all in Figma, you can use your team's existing design building blocks, making it easy to create outputs that look good and feel real and are connected to how your team builds. Stop spending so much time telling people about your product vision and instead show it to them. Make code-backed prototypes and apps fast with Figma Make. Check it out at figma.com/lenny. Jason, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJason Droege (00:06:08):\nYeah, thanks for having me. Excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:10):\nAs I was researching your background and prepping for this podcast, I learned a really interesting fun fact about you that I don't think a lot of people know. So Travis Kalanick, he had a startup before Uber. It was called Scour. It was a peer-to-peer file sharing app, and then I think got shut down. You were his co-founder. This was the early part of your career. I'm guessing there are hours of stories we could talk about during this experience. So let me just ask you this one question. What's just a lesson that has stuck with you from that experience that you've taken with you to future places you've worked and built product at?\n\nJason Droege (00:06:44):\nI mean, there's so many lessons. I like to pick one. I think that the main lesson is that in business and in startups, everything's negotiable. I think that's the main thing. Because we were 19 at the time, 19, 20 at the time, we built this search engine in a dorm room and we were running it out of the dorm room and our first URL was scour.cs.ucla.edu. These things were not necessarily in fractions at the time, but we were just being practical. It was basically a project that we had started, and so we built the search engine and people started using it and we thought we would get in trouble, but it turned out the computer science department was excited about it even though we had basically parked a domain on their servers and we were using our own computers in the dorms to serve up this website and product.\n\n(00:07:46):\nAnd then, when we got into financing, the financing process was fascinating, and this is where the everything is negotiable lesson came from, which is, it was Ron Burkle and Mike Ovitz, who are the initial investors in the business. We were in LA, so we were at UCLA, so we were not quite wired into the entire Sand Hill Road scene. And as we were doing the deal, the terms kept changing on us. We thought you went and raised money and it was like, \"Oh, we'll get a few million dollars at a $5 million valuation.\" This is back when that was actually a series A valuation. And then over the course of the deal, it was like, \"We're doing the deal. We're not doing the deal. Oh, you should give us 50% of the company. Oh, you should give us 75% of the company. Oh, if you want to sign the document today, this person's going to show up for breakfast and if you don't sign today and give us 80% of the company, the person's not going to show up.\"\n\n(00:08:38):\nIt was just completely wild, the things that we saw from day one of what can happen in business, and we thought there was a way to do things, and at a very young age we realized there is no way to do things. There is just the way that you can negotiate your way through the world, which I actually think influenced Travis heavily and then me later heavily at Uber in terms of if you can imagine it and it makes sense and you can align incentives, then it can happen. But there is no way. And to learn that at 19 or 20 years old I think was highly imprinting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:12):\nThat is an amazing lesson. What happened to Scour? It got shut down, I think. What happened there?\n\nJason Droege (00:09:16):\nWell, yeah, so basically what Scour was was it was a multimedia search engine and then peer-to-peer file sharing network. But what it was used for was finding free content. And at the time, the laws were on this were pretty ambiguous because we weren't, mix tapes were legal, but this was like a hyperversion of that. But we were eventually sued for a quarter of a trillion dollars. So I guess if you're going to experience something that's potentially as life devastating as that, doing it when you're, I think we were 21 or 22 at the time is the time to do it, but it was just this very cold splash of water about how the real world really works, because the MBAA and the RAA were the ones who sued us, the entertainment industry sued us or the associations that represent the entertainment industry, and then they settled it for $1 million.\n\n(00:10:08):\nSo we're like, \"Wait, you wanted a quarter of a trillion dollars and then you settle for $1 million.\" And of course they were just trying to drive us in a bankruptcy, drive us out of the market, and these are established companies. So we're like, \"If these guys don't have a playbook to follow, they just make up numbers, then wow, how should we navigate the rest of our lives?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:28):\nLet's talk about Scale and this whole world of AI that you're in. This is the first interview that you're doing since taking over CEO at Scale. I'm honored to have you here to talk through this stuff. This is also the first interview you're doing since the whole Meta deal, which is very complicated, confused a lot of people. So I'm just curious to hear the current state of Scale, what people should know. For example, what's your relationship with Meta? What's your relationship with Alex? What is the current state of Scale?\n\nJason Droege (00:10:55):\nYeah, so Scale is a fully independent company. The transaction was Meta invested a little bit over $14 billion to get 49% of the company, non-voting stock, didn't take a new board seat. Alex fills the board seat. So the board is the same, the governance is largely the same. There's no preferential access to anything that Meta has. There's no preferential relationship. I mean, we've had a longstanding relationship with Meta on the data side of the business for a long time and even on some business development related things to maybe working on things in government together, et cetera. And so, those might get bigger just as we're closer now, but there's nothing that prevents us from doing things with other parties and they have no access to anything that they wouldn't have had otherwise. All the privacy still in place, all the data security still in place that was there before.\n\n(00:11:47):\nAnd in fact, only about 15 people went over in the transaction. So Scale has about 1,100 employees or so now, and we have two major businesses. Each of those businesses, each of them has hundreds of millions of revenue. So we have two unicorns inside the company today that sustains. The business has grown every month since the deal happened, which I've read, the reporting is not consistently reported. We haven't talked about it, so this is part of getting the word out and we're excited to continue to build, deliver data, and do what we did before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:20):\nSo the company today, independent, its own company. Alex, just to be clear, he works at Meta now. He's no longer at Scale.\n\nJason Droege (00:12:26):\nYeah, that's right. Excuse me, I should have talked about that more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:30):\nI think that's really interesting. So basically, it was an investment. Some people left to join Meta, the company continues, you're running the ship. Let's talk about this whole space that you guys essentially pioneered, I don't know best way to call it, data labeling, training data, creating evals for labs. You guys were at this before anyone even knew this was a thing. I know even Scale pivoted into this market from other things. I think there was a bunch of stuff they tried with self-driving cars and all these things, and then it's like, \"Oh shit, AI labs need this data.\"\n\n(00:12:57):\nOne of the main stories I've been hearing is, and I've had a bunch of CEOs from this space on the podcast, is that there's been this big shift from the way, from what Scale had pioneered and had been doing for a long time, which is generalists, low-cost labor training. From that to now, labs mostly need experts, lawyers, doctors, engineers doing training, writing evals, things like that. I'm curious just what you're seeing, how that's impacting you guys, where you think things are heading, what people should know about this whole market of data training data.\n\nJason Droege (00:13:27):\nYeah, totally. I think the current positioning out there from competitors is just bogus. So I'll start with that and then maybe talk a little bit about, I'll explain what I mean by that in a second. But I think it's important to just give 30 seconds on what the history of Scale is and what's the thread going back to 2016. So Alex had this insight in very early days that the important thing to models was data. And I think he was 19 or 20 years old at the time as well. And so, he's like, \"Okay, well what business would I create around this?\" And the business that he created around it was, okay, let's do labeling for autonomous vehicles, because if you label the data that they have, the cars do better. And then, that wave turned into the computer vision wave, which we have a relationship with the Department of Defense where we do labeling for them, and that was in 2020.\n\n(00:14:21):\nAnd then, you move forward and the models have gotten better over this period of time. And so, as models get better, they need different types of data. So we've constantly been adapting to the type of data that models need to be successful. And so, then the gen AI wave hit, and this went through the moon or to the moon. And so, as part of that, that industry is changing constantly too. So it is correct that when the models came out two or three years ago, I mean we remember using them, they would hallucinate all the time, they would get basic answers wrong, they didn't know which poem was better, this poem or that poem. And that was the state of labeling a couple years ago. And things have changed quickly and we've changed with it. And now the state for everyone, and we've been at the forefront of all of this, is expert data labeling, more sophisticated tasks.\n\n(00:15:15):\nSo to give you a sense of what the task was 18 months ago, I've been here about 13 months. So I was interviewing and I remember seeing it. You would get a short story and it would say, \"Is this short story better than this short story?\" And then you would edit it and be like, \"Yeah, it would be better if it was this,\" and you would give some preference ranking to it. It was pretty basic 18 months ago, and you had the rise of some experts, but the models were so far behind that they needed just even the basic stuff they needed. And now, you're at a point where a task is, one task is building an entire website by one of the world's best web developers, or it is explaining some very nuanced topic on cancer to a model. And these tasks now take hours of time and they require PhDs and professionals.\n\n(00:16:01):\nSo to give you a stat to back this up, 80% of the people that we have on our expert network have a bachelor's degree or greater, which is very contrary to some of the positioning that's out there and some of the understanding of this industry. About 15% have a PhD that's greater, and we have PhDs on the network earning significant amounts of money doing labeling, contributing their expertise to these models. So we've been doing expert data labeling ever since the models need it. I mean, this game is keeping in touch with the researchers, knowing what they need, coming up with ideas internally. In some ways, we drove this because we were seeing that the models were not sufficient in more expert ways. And so, we would go to the model builders and say, \"Hey, we noticed that this is a problem. If you would like to fix it, this cadre of experts can do that for you.\" So the counter positioning is out there, but I think that's just what competitors say sometimes. It has nothing to do with reality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:02):\nOkay. That was extremely interesting. So what I'm hearing is yes, there has been a big shift to labs need more expert folks involved in training, labeling, writing evals. You guys are very aware of that and have evolved with that. One of the, I don't know, allegations I guess in the market is that it's hard to find these experts. So all these companies have their proprietary network of experts and how they find them. Is there anything you could share about just how you guys go about that because that feels like the hardest part is finding these experts and keeping them from other companies?\n\nJason Droege (00:17:33):\nThey are hard to find. You have to have many, many tactics. So we get, as you would expect, there's not one way you do it. The largest way is that they refer each other because when you are enjoying what you're doing and you are using your expertise to contribute to AI, which is pretty cool. If you're a PhD on this pretty specific topic and you're using a model and you're frustrated that, oh, it doesn't interact with me in the way that I want, this is a paid way to have an outlet for that and to make hundreds or thousands of dollars doing that. And so, a lot of times they refer each other.\n\n(00:18:13):\nWe also have campus programs where we will literally go onto the campus and talk to the professors, talk to the students, ask about who would like to do this type of work. And then, of course, there's the more traditional scaled ways of LinkedIn and places like that. But the best ones come from these grassroots and referral networks. And the only way you get that is providing a great experience to these people, because these people, they're doing it partly for money, but they're also doing it because they think that their contribution to the AI models is important and interesting, and in many times it solves a problem for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:48):\nSo something that I've been seeing on Twitter just this week as I was preparing for this is there's the information headline. This came out and this mirrored something that Brendan from Workhorse said that over time the entire economy is going to move towards just reinforcement learning and everyone's just training AI is basically the jobs that will be left. Thoughts on that? Is that where you think things are going? Is there another perspective?\n\nJason Droege (00:19:12):\nReinforcement learning is very important, and I think this is a broader comment about the move to environments. There's these things called RL environments that effectively are sandboxes for AI agents to play in to accomplish a goal so that they can learn how to accomplish that goal. We've been doing this for over a year. So for example, you have a Salesforce instance. How does an AI agent navigate that instance? That instance has data that it needs to recognize, it has configurations. Salesforce is a highly configurable product. It has configurations, it needs to understand how to navigate. You're asking the agent to do a business process that needs very high reliability, and then the agent needs to know, \"Hey, if I can't accomplish what I'm going to accomplish, or I think if there's a low accuracy of what I'm about to accomplish, how do I pop it up to a human being for feedback so I can get guidance?\"\n\n(00:20:08):\nAll of those things need to be trained and there's no alchemy to it. You just have to put the AI agent in an environment that represents what a human being would be doing. And you can imagine the number of environments in the world and the number of goals within each environment is enormous. So the question is, and the research that we have done over the past year to try to be a good partner to our model builders, our model builder customers, is how generalizable is each individual task or each individual environment. So if you imagine the world of environments of software systems, configurations, data types, sizes, user counts, complexities, it's like the permutations are endless. So what you need is you need a strategy that allows a lab to collect data that is generalizable enough across a broad spectrum of use cases so that they don't have to collect 45 trillion combinations of what should the agent do in this particular situation.\n\n(00:21:20):\nSo sometimes the work and the data is highly generalizable, and by generalizable I mean you have it accomplished in a simple way. The task might be find the meeting on my calendar for my interview with Lenny, and the agent goes and it looks through all my calendar and then it pops it out, very simple example. That needs to be generalizable to any calendar search potentially or potentially any calendar action. And the more generalizable it is, the more valuable the data is. So our job is to provide the most valuable data to model builders that accomplishes the goal of making agents as useful as possible for their end users.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:03):\nI love that you've been sharing these examples of what this stuff is specifically that these people are doing, the data you're providing to labs. So just to mirror back a few of the examples you've shared, one is an engineer building a website, sharing the code essentially with the model. And here's how I would do it. And in that example, is it just like here's the code or is it a recording of them building it? What is the data?\n\nJason Droege (00:22:30):\nIt could be both. So in some cases, it's just the website and here's an example, and then they design it. In some cases, it needs to be annotated in such a way that's like, I made this decision for this reason or this decision for that reason, or here's how I would think about it. So it depends on what the model builders are trying to accomplish. And so, it can get quite nuanced in terms of what they're trying to train on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:54):\nGot it.\n\nJason Droege (00:22:54):\nSo it's not like here's a website and then it's created doing websites. It's like, here's a website, here's why I made this decision, here's why I didn't make this decision, or here's a broken website and here's why it's broken if they're trying to accomplish, I don't know, a debugging tool for a website builder or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):\nAnd another example you shared is a short story where it's like, here's one short story, here's another I imagine generated by a model. And then it's like, which is better, and then how would you make it better? The other example you just shared is a Salesforce agent where it's like, Hey, book a meeting with a prospect and then teach it how that happens. I love just how concrete these are because it's like, okay, I get it. This is the stuff that these companies do. Is there another maybe one or two examples just to give people a sense of what this data looks like?\n\nJason Droege (00:23:33):\nAbsolutely. I can actually give you an example from, so we have two sides of our business. One, we supply data to model builders. We sell the data, and then the other is we actually do solutions. We sell applications and services to healthcare systems, insurance systems, et cetera. I actually think it would paint a more colorful picture if I gave you an example of one of those because it involves data, but it involves the use of data, the manipulation of data for a very, very specific goal. And so, one example there is we work with a healthcare system and health systems have lots of problems. This particular healthcare system has experts that see very rare cases on a regular basis. So you go there only if no one else can figure out your problem, and there's a huge backlog. So there's a productivity element to this implementation tier.\n\n(00:24:27):\nSo there's a huge backlog. They want to be able to see more patients, they want to be able to provide better care, and they want to prevent the number of revisits because they want to give the accurate diagnosis day one and what the treatment should be. Well, to do this today without the help of AI, the doctor really needs to read 200 to 300 pages of documentation and it's rolled into one document, but in different formats. And so, if you're a doctor, how are you going to read 200 or 300 pages of everything? So what they do is they do the best they can. They scan it, they ask a nurse to look at it, they ask maybe a more junior doctor to take a look at this case. They want to treat the patient well, obviously this is why they became a doctor. And then, they go into the room and they talk to the person and then they make a diagnosis.\n\n(00:25:14):\nWell, we basically built a tool that will read that document for them and point out the top 5 to 10 things that they should take into consideration, either allergies that might not be obvious is one example where we actually, we picked up on an allergy that a patient had that would not have been obvious from reading the document and that allergy actually would've had a conflict with the medication that they were going to be prescribed. And so, the AI tool basically pulled out this correlation that would've even been hard for a human being to do. To make this tool better and better, you get to a certain limit with the models off the shelf, and actually the people inside of this healthcare system have to do their own labeling.\n\n(00:25:54):\nSo we talk about labeling for model builders, but we are starting to see the labeling move into enterprises and into governments because you can only get so far with off the shelf plus rag plus some fine-tuning based on recorded data. One thing people often miss about these systems is we assume because you hear these numbers of like, \"Oh, this bank in just 200 petabytes of data a year or whatever fantastical number.\" What we miss is is that the right data? Which of that data is useful to the models? And most of it is not useful. Some of it is, but a lot of what we do when we're talking about knowledge work, when we're talking about making judgment is human judgment based on synthesizing how would this doctor in this case or how would this banker in this case make this decision and how would they make decision in the context of their overall enterprise? And that might be different bank to bank, healthcare system to healthcare system, because of the culture, the objectives, the incentives, et cetera. And so, we're getting to the point now where we see that digitizing judgment, human judgment, true subject matter, deep expertise is becoming a bottleneck that we're unblocking for our customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):\nThat's really interesting. It's like the spectrum went from just low skill generous labor to experts to now the specific expert at this one company who needs to do this work, this labeling.\n\nJason Droege (00:27:16):\nAbsolutely. I mean understanding what, there's this broad narrative. We have two narratives. We have the AGI, everything is just going to become AGI, and then there's the skeptics, which is like, \"Hey, this is all bunk, this is a bubble, et cetera.\" And of course, my view is most things are kind of like there's truth in between and some of the extreme parts of the extreme probably correct, but the reality is is that it's very hard to get machine critical use cases in agentic systems where agents are talking to agents to a level of accuracy that is necessary to accomplish a goal. And one of the main issues is that a one document, think about the problem of even understanding a document, a document that reads the exact same words in company A will have a different meaning and importance in company B. So how do you have a system that knows that? So this is all got to be built. So if you're going to make good decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:18):\nThis is a good segue to this question that is always on people's minds when they look at companies like yours and the other folks in the space is just how long do we need people to be doing this? At what point will AI be smart enough to do it themselves? I know your incentives are to say we'll never run out of people because it's aligned with your growth, but just how should we think about just why do we need people, I don't know, in 10 years? How long do we need these experts telling AI things it doesn't know?\n\nJason Droege (00:28:42):\nFirst off, the history of data labeling is a history of new beginnings. Autonomous vehicles do not need as much data labeling as they did in the past. I mean, Scale is a company that believes that data will always be important at the point at which you don't need external data, human data in models. I think we've gotten to a level of advancement in the world that is almost like unfathomable because you're effectively saying that no new human skill and no new human knowledge is important enough to put into these models. That feels like pretty far out there. And so, for a business like ours, we're constantly looking at how do you build operations that can constantly find the new needs and then work with the contributor network we call the experts contributors to unearth that data, to unearth that information. And sometimes it's new people, sometimes within our existing base we find that existing people have expertise that we didn't know about that maybe wasn't useful to a model a year ago, but now is useful.\n\n(00:29:47):\nSo this is a constant progression of getting more and more data into these models. Yes, we are financially incentivized to believe that humans will always be in the loop, but that's not just a business belief, it is a personal belief. These systems need to work for us, and if these systems work for us, then we will need to be on the loop or in the loop on any of the decisions that these systems make. As to the broader point around labor, which I think comes up around white collar apocalypse and these things that come up, I'm definitely on the more maybe practical side of this, possibly just because of my nature, possibly because I see what's going on on the ground actually in these customers where supposedly this transformation is going to happen in the next one to two years. And I just think that it might happen. The space is moving super fast, but I don't think it's going to happen.\n\n(00:30:39):\nIt is definitely not going to happen in the next year. The idea that it happens in the next two years I think is very far-fetched, but nothing's impossible here. And long-term, I think that if you go back through, I don't know, pessimist archive or whatever, these accounts that post, the radio was invented and then all of this will be eliminated. There will be change, but the change, I think humans are very good at adapting. So I think what we're underestimating in all of the doom and gloom is we believe in human adaptability. We as a company are highly adaptable and I think the history of technology has shown that people are adaptable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):\nI really like that takeaway. I'm an optimist as well, so I'm always looking for reasons to be optimistic. I want to follow that thread before I get there, something very tactical I want to ask about is evals seems to be coming up a lot, especially with companies in your space. I'm still learning a lot about just what this all is, especially in your market. How much of what you or experts are providing are evals versus other types of data?\n\nJason Droege (00:31:40):\nA lot of it's evals, and within enterprise customers and government customers, it's mostly evals because somebody's got to establish the benchmark for what good looks like. That's the simple way to think about evals. What does good look like and do you have a comprehensive set of evals so that the system knows what good looks like? It's as simple as that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:00):\nSo in the case maybe of the healthcare example you shared, essentially this doctor would be sitting there looking at all these reports, creating evals that are like, this is what this should be discovering in this report, in this record. Is that a way to think about it?\n\nJason Droege (00:32:15):\nYeah, that's a very big part of it, which is what does good look like?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):\nAwesome, okay.\n\nJason Droege (00:32:20):\nI have to reduce things down to simple terms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:24):\nIt's interesting you say good versus correct. Is that a specific term you like to use good versus just this is the correct answer.\n\nJason Droege (00:32:31):\nI didn't intentionally use that word, but these are probabilistic systems and so depending upon... Yeah, so I can get into some nuance here about the right types of problems that AI is good at solving. So if you have a human process that is 10 or 20% accurate or 10 or 20% liked, AI is awesome. Because if you get to 50, 60, 70, 80% accurate, you're in the money, you're in the green, everybody's happy. Now, the system then has to know, hey, for the remainder, how do I make sure that humans are involved for the remainder of the decision making? But from a net value add standpoint, the humans are pumped in that scenario.\n\n(00:33:13):\nIf you have a human process, a workflow that is 98% accurate, and you expect an AI system to get you the remaining 2%, not totally there yet. And so, when I say what does good look like? A lot of the processes and a lot of the things that people are asking these systems to do and systems for us to build are making judgments on their behalf. And so, just like we would ask a human being, \"Hey, what do you think we should do in this scenario?\" What you're looking for is you're looking for the best recommendation or course of action given the current information.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):\nTo you, this is so obvious and to people in your market that I think a lot of people think about AI being trained on just here's a bunch of data, check it out, learn everything you can from all of human history and all of written record. But what's wild is basically people are sitting around teaching AI things it doesn't know, filling gaps. That's how AI is getting smarter now. There's no more real data for it to feed on. It's just like, here's what I don't know, or here's what an expert found you're wrong. I'm going to teach you this. And the fact that it scales and that's keeping models improving is so mind-boggling.\n\nJason Droege (00:34:21):\nYes. No, yeah, I agree. I mean, like with any of these major tech revolutions, the headlines tell one story and then on the ground, laying broadband means you need to dig up every single road in America to lay it. There is the, yeah, it's as simple as that. Someone's got to dig up the road or someone's got to run the undersea cable. There's always some operational chiseling that's going on in all of these industries. I mean, if you think about how magical these models are, they're remarkable that if you've been in technology long enough, it blows my mind even today that they get the punctuation right consistently. I mean, that sounds like almost daft to say at this point in the market, but if you were to go back three years and think about that from a technological standpoint, a lot of things that we think are trivial now are very sophisticated, and it's a combination of, I mean, the real answer is it's a combination of computational power, model improvement, and data, and all three are getting better at once.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:25):\nLet's follow that thread. You've been at Scale for a long time, CEO for, you said, 13 months. I feel like you see a lot more about where things are heading because you work with labs on things they haven't even announced yet. You see more than most people, and I know there's only so much you can share about what companies are doing, but just is there anything you think people don't truly grasp or understand about where AI models are going to be in the next two, three years?\n\nJason Droege (00:35:47):\nLook, there's so much talk. I think it depends on how much X or news you consume. So I think it's like what sort of our perspective. The general trend right now is going from models knowing things to models doing things. And we're pushing the boundaries of knowledge, like the benchmarks that we put out and that others put out are showing that the knowledge that these models have is getting, it's quite robust. And then, the next question becomes, well, what can it do for me? And as soon as you get into that world, that's where the environments we were talking about start to come into play. How do you navigate a Salesforce instance? How do you navigate a healthcare system? How do you navigate even a weather app on your phone, and how does the agent make decisions for you?\n\n(00:36:36):\nWe're just getting into the beginning of that. It'll be very interesting to see how quickly that happens. And I think that's where a lot of the speculation has a wide variance because we're at the beginning of it. People take different trajectories on how that's going to improve. And so, if you take a trajectory of the most aggressive trajectory, which is like, oh, it's actually going to be quite easy to train on these things, and then it's just a change management exercise in the economy, which by the way, change management exercises are not to be underestimated.\n\n(00:37:06):\nThere's still people in the world without an email address. And so, the adoption curve then becomes a human and policy issue, not a technological issue. We're not there from the technology standpoint, but I do think in the next two to three years, if I take the bait and have to make a guess is the technology will get to a point where it will push the change management and policy makers to say like, \"Oh, what do we do with this because it's getting pretty close?\" That's probably two or three years away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):\nThere's been a lot of talk these days about AI not delivering on the promise that we hear, especially at enterprises. There's this MIT study that just showed that there's all these pilots that people are excited about and then they don't work and companies aren't adopting these tools. There's data showing engineers are not actually as productive with tools. It actually slows them down sometimes. You work with a ton of companies implementing all kinds of AI. What are you seeing on the ground? What kind of gains are you seeing? Do you feel like it's overhyped, underhyped?\n\nJason Droege (00:38:03):\nThere's a lot of hype out there, and our job is to actually build products that work, that deliver value for our customers and figure out where the rubber hits the road. And to get a sophisticated, my healthcare example is one, we do other sophisticated workflows, claims management for insurance companies. This is a financial decision that's happening, but it's an automatable process. But basically what happens is the POCs get to 60 or 70% of the way there, and the human mind goes, oh, the rest is no big deal. But it's like uptime in data centers where every nine is an order of magnitude investment in terms of reliability, backups, et cetera. One nine is basically a web server in a dorm room like we had at UCLA, and then five nines is this crazy high bar, but it just seems like a very small movement.\n\n(00:38:55):\nSo you have a similar dynamic going on here where you have a bunch of people, one of the reasons why the POCs have failed, one, there's a denominator effect because it's so easy to do, \"Hey, I spun up a project, I spun up a project, I spun up a project.\" So it's really easy for people to try. So I don't necessarily know that the 95% number, I think is a bit of clickbait in a way. It tells the right story, but it is a little bit hyperbolic because if you take the efforts that happen in the company where they actually get a quality partner like we are, or if you do it yourself, if you have engineers who've worked with models before and they put in the time, and I'm talking about months, not like minutes like you see in these videos to actually get legal approval, policy approval, regulatory approval, change managements like an accuracy that everybody's comfortable with. If you actually do that, these things take 6 to 12 months to get them truly robust enough where an important process can be automated.\n\n(00:40:00):\nSo I think that's where the hype is right that when you do it, the impact is like, whoa, I never would've figured that out myself, and I'm one of the most educated doctors in the world as an example. But the time to get there is just longer than what people are selling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:17):\nIt's such a good point that it's not only is it easy to try these things, it's just like everyone's doing it so everyone's feeling FOMO like, \"I got to try these things. I got to try all these prototyping tools, Cursor, all these things.\" Just goes, \"Everyone's doing it,\" and then you just rush into it and it doesn't actually work out.\n\nJason Droege (00:40:31):\nEasy to learn, hard to master.

This could be an endless discussion about AI, but you've got a lot more lessons to teach us. You've helped build Uber Eats, you've had a couple startups in the past. We talked about Scour for a bit. I've talked to a bunch of people that have worked with you over the years, and I got a lot of really interesting insights into the stuff that you're extremely good at. So I'm just going to go through a bunch of these. One is your obsession with being close to customers, talking to customers, and I love this topic because it's something everybody thinks they're great at, and they feel like they completely understand how this is important, why this is important. They all feel like I'm doing this, don't worry about... Everyone else is not doing this, but I am. Talk about just what you think maybe people miss about how this looks when you're doing it well, and just why this is so important.\n\nJason Droege (00:42:33):\nI mean, I probably fall in the category of what you just described, which is maybe part of the hubris you need to start anything new. But I mean, I don't think it's a clean process. I think my process is I'm constantly questioning every single thing that I'm hearing at the beginning of anything. I don't take what a customer says literally. And there's been a lot talked about on this topic from a product management standpoint in terms of like, oh, don't do what they say, do what they mean, and look at the real problems and underlying things. I think the way that I look at it that might be additive to the discussion is I look at the underlying incentives of the customer. And the underlying incentives of customers are not always financial. Sometimes it's ego, sometimes it's career growth.\n\n(00:43:24):\nIf you're selling enterprise software to someone, there's an executive sponsor as an example, that person needs to trust that you're going to do a good job for them. How do you get them to jump with you on this big project? Well, that's part of the journey of not just the product, but what do they need to hear from us? What do we need to supply them? What do we need to do to actually unlock the opportunity to implement the product? So I think there's an incentives alignment baseline. I'm a big believer that it's cliche, but show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome. I think that's absolutely true. And even when customers will tell you things, I'll give you an example. I've been out of the game for a while so I can be open about it, Uber Eats.\n\n(00:44:06):\nSo when we launched Uber Eats, I looked at the business in terms of being close to the customer. We actually couldn't get a restaurant tour. I knew nothing about this industry. So at Uber, my job was to figure out what other businesses we should get into. And so, we looked at a billion businesses and Uber Eats, food delivery was the one that we thought was most interesting, which turned out to be right so good for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:26):\nVery right.\n\nJason Droege (00:44:28):\nAnd we couldn't get a restaurant tour to help us understand their unit economics. And they'd say like, \"Oh, it'd be this percentage or that percentage, or Why do you want to know?\" And then we'd go to a different restaurant tour and they would explain it, but they were a little suspicious of why are these Uber guys talking to me about how much my ham costs? And so, what we did is we ordered just a bunch of food from these places, and then we got a restaurant supplier to give us a base catalog, and we just matched up how much does the ham weigh? How much does the cheese weigh? How much does the bread weigh? How many pieces of lettuce were on there? And we tried to actually just compose our own independent view of what's the ingredients cost versus what's the labor cost? And then, we triangulated what was our ground truth, and then what are we being told by restaurant tours, and then what is the site guys telling us about restaurant economics?\n\n(00:45:16):\nAnd if those things all overlapped, and we're like, okay, we have an insight about what to do here and how does this relate to Uber Eats? Well, what we found as part of this is that roughly a restaurant pays 20 to 30% of every meal to ingredients, and they pay roughly 20 or 30% to labor, and they pay roughly 10% to real estate and a bunch of other, anyway, so goes down the chain. But the important parts is what's the value of incrementality?\n\n(00:45:41):\nAnd so, we came in and we said, \"We're going to charge you 30% of the bill.\" And they were like, \"Oh my God, is this group on all over again? This is way too high. Oh my gosh.\" And we explained the economics to them and they were like, \"Okay, we'll give it a try, but this is way too high.\" And they were right, the real number, the real clearing prices aren't 25%, but we weren't that far off. And so, when you go to find product market fit or be close to the customers, it's a combination of what's the most valuable thing. Well, in a restaurant tours case, give me incremental demand. Because if you were to take a restaurant location and triple demand based on the same labor but you're just scaling ingredients, you've got a 70, 80% incremental gross margin product.\n\n(00:46:27):\nRestaurant tours would hate when we would say this because it doesn't work out exactly like that in reality. But because we had that insight, we had confidence that we could go to market with, we need to charge you this so that the delivery fee can be that. And then, if the delivery fee is that and we charge you this, then we think the consumers will adopt, and that's what you need to get your incremental demand, and then we could pay the driver this. And so, you fit this whole puzzle together without totally satisfying, in the case of a marketplace, you're not totally satisfying any individuals 100% of their needs. What you're satisfying is is you're getting a clearing rate for them to participate in the market in the case of a marketplace. So that's one example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:07):\nYeah. I love this example as you almost you figure out how to help them with something they don't even fully themselves know yet. So as you think through their goals for them as if you were them, break down the economics and then here's the solution versus, hey, what can we do for you guys?\n\nJason Droege (00:47:25):\nYeah. I mean, if you walked into a restaurant, they would tell you a bunch of things. They would say, \"Oh, labor schedule is an issue.\" They would say, \"My rent is an issue.\" They would say, \"All these, my ingredients prices are an issue, that's 20 or 30%.\" If you could shave off 3% of that, that would be huge. You might then take that and go, \"I'm going to go build a business. It's going to save you 10% of your ingredients costs.\"\n\n(00:47:45):\nWell, but that doesn't actually get into their head on what's truly important day-to-day. That might be important for them on an annual basis, but on a daily basis, what are they doing? They're looking at their numbers, they're looking do people show up. Did I make money yesterday? Am I going to make money tomorrow? So the urgency, I think the biggest thing people miss when they're building new products is the urgency of the buyer part of it. You can build something that provides a lot of value, but if it's not the top thing that the customer is thinking about in their busy days, then you're just going to have a long road to a small town.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:19):\nThis touches on just the theme I heard a lot about, this idea of independent thinking and how much you value that, and this feels like a really good example of that. Is there anything else along those lines of just why this way of thinking is so critical?\n\nJason Droege (00:48:30):\nI think as a founder's job, and I mean I stretched that term because at Uber we had all of the benefits of Uber so I wasn't really a founder. I just started the business there. But there are some elements of founding there is you're looking for alpha in the market. When we started our first company in '97, it wasn't that cool. It might've been cool in Silicon Valley, but it was definitely not cool in LA. Now, it's super cool to start a business. So as a result, everyone's trying everything. So how do you get alpha on that market. If your research is highly influenced by what the world is saying around you, you're not going to have an independent insight. You have to go off and do your own thing.\n\n(00:49:14):\nAnd this is why from an entrepreneurship standpoint, I have very strong feelings about what the approach to founding a company should be and is probably very particular to me. But it truly is about what insight do I have, because why am I so lucky to have this insight? Why in a world of a million entrepreneurs who are thinking, who are smart, who are trying everything, why am I in the position where I likely have an insight that others do not? And then, why am I the one to do it?\n\n(00:49:46):\nAnd the answer might be I'm in this narrow, far-flung place. The other answer might be, I am inherently a contrarian personality type, so I'm just constantly looking for the thing that's true that people don't believe is true, which sometimes worked. But then, the second part of that's super important, which is why do I want to work on this problem for 5 to 10 years? And people get this wrong all the time. They go and talk to a customer and they go, \"They have a problem. I'm going to go solve it.\" And it's just not a great way to start a business. You really have to have this burning desire to constantly be questioning yourself.\n\n(00:50:20):\nThe other thing about independent thinking is is that you can't fall in love with your ideas. And I do not proclaim to be the world's greatest thinker for what it's worth, this is what you've been told, but is just part of that is basically throwing away who you are, who you've been, all your ideas for the mission that you're on, which is trying to accomplish something for our customer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:43):\nThis is great. I'm glad you went here. This touches on the other theme I heard often about you is just how high of a bar you set for new businesses. And I think this advice is useful both for founders, as you said, and also people starting companies within companies, new business lines. So you've talked about this a bit already, but is there anything more there, just how high that bar needs to be for it to likely work out when you're starting something new?\n\nJason Droege (00:51:07):\nLook, if you want to give yourself the best chance, and this isn't always how it works, but if you're in my position 25 plus years in their career, if you want to give yourself the best chance, I think there's two ways that companies end up working out. And the first way, which is probably the most important, quite frankly, is that the founder is just a force of nature over a long duration of time. Because you're going to have to pivot, you have to have that energy to pivot. You have to go years and years and years with it being hard, and that's probably the most important thing.\n\n(00:51:36):\nBut the second most important thing is that you can easily educate yourself on what are good business models, what are bad business models, what are good markets, what are bad markets? And even if you're this force of nature, having the knowledge, if you're going to go into a bad market with all your energy, you should at least know, maybe ignorance is bliss because you just throw yourself into it and it just works out with time. But that's not how I would operate, which is marketplaces are good businesses. SaaS, at least historically, we'll see how this changes, but SaaS, historically, great businesses, recurring revenue businesses, sticky businesses, network effect businesses.\n\n(00:52:12):\nAnd if you look at what the top VCs invest in, yes, there is a lot of portfolio building, but there are similarities in terms of the types of business models that they believe could be worth tens of billions of dollars. And they have network effects, they have lock-in. They are more valuable at scale, a big scale than low scale. So if you just take a filter on a new business, this is what I did at Uber, which is like if you just have a filtering mechanism on a new business, it doesn't take that long to eliminate the bad ideas. And then, of what's left, you can pick, oh, I'm very passionate about this, even though it might have more problems than this other thing that on paper looks better. And then, you have to have passionate about it. But I think people just miss a basic understanding of what businesses even have a chance of being worth $100 billion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:04):\nSo you launched Uber Eats, you figured out this is the place to go and bet. As an outsider, feels obvious, of course this is going to be a massive success. Of course, food delivery, such a good idea. I know you looked at a ton of ideas in that process. Can you just talk about what you explored and why you ended up picking Uber Eats?\n\nJason Droege (00:53:23):\nI am definitely not the smartest person in the room when it comes to figuring these things out. And so, I keep a very, very wide aperture on ideas for as long as I can until I'm like, okay, everything is coalescing. And I think there's a bunch of reasons why you have to keep an open aperture on considering ideas that might seem bad at the start, but you just keep digging and see if you're right that they're bad or you're wrong. So just as a general philosophical principle, I'll start there. We looked at, we did some crazy stuff. I went walking around San Francisco one day and I looked down Market Street and there was a CVS, a 7-Eleven, a CVS, a Walgreens, a 7-Eleven, and I'm like, \"How many SKUs could possibly be inside one of these things that people want and couldn't you just put that into a van and you hit the button on the van and the van comes around and you get whatever convenience items you have, and they're convenience items, so why would that be a problem?\"\n\n(00:54:14):\nAnd we launched that in DC. We put 10 of these trucks on the road, we put 250 SKUs in them. And I mean, crickets is an understatement of how bad it was. I mean, we couldn't get an order to save our lives. And what we realized was that we hadn't really done the research on what convenience stores really were. It was if you didn't have cigarettes, you didn't have beer, you didn't have Slurpees, you didn't have these things, for example, you didn't bring people in to sell all the other things. So we didn't know anything about retail. We were clueless. So that's one idea. We looked at grocery, but honestly the unit economics just terrified me of all the pick packing and everything like that. I think Instacart did a remarkably good job at getting the unit economics to a good spot and probably the hardest operational problem you could tackle.\n\n(00:54:56):\nWe did generalized delivery, point to point delivery, what's now, I forget what Uber's product is called, but Uber Direct I think it's called, where you have something that needs to go point to point in a city. That was a flop from the beginning because the truth is is how consumers don't really have this need, business sort of have this need, and in 2014 when we were doing this, no one had this need. But we tried 15 versions of all these things before we eventually just said, \"Okay, the food delivery thing is just popping off on all signals and we can make the unit economics work. People seem to want it. It's a super cool problem because we can enable independent restaurants with all these tools and allow them to compete with the big guys. We can take the real estate out of the equation. So you can have a real estate location that's non-prime, but if you have prime food, then you get to compete.\" So we're like, \"Oh, this is a very interesting problem and we can really help local economies.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):\nAnd this ended up being, if I remember correctly, this basically saved Uber during COVID. Lyft didn't have something like this. And how big is this business at this point? Anything you share about just how important this turned out to be for Uber?\n\nJason Droege (00:56:02):\nYeah, of course. Well, we launched it in December of 2015 in Toronto and within two hours we had done $20,000 for the sales. It was crazy how quickly we saw that it was the right idea and the unit economics were good. And then, four and a half years later, I was at Uber for about six years, but it took us about a year and a half to figure this out. Four and a half years later, it was about $20 billion. So it was 0 to 20 billion in four and a half years, which is pretty good. Uber was very good at scaling things, but competitive market. Others did well. We beat a lot of people. Some people beat us. And then, now I think it's pushing 80 billion, and that's been for another four and a half years since I left. I think COVID turned it from 20, I left right before COVID, total coincidence, 20 to 50 in a year. So I mean, ride-sharing went this and food delivery just went to Pluto.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:52):\nWhat luck. Well done.\n\nJason Droege (00:56:55):\nLuck is part of the game. That's the other thing that's important to realize. Luck is part of the game, so do not begrudge people for luck. This industry is hard. All these things we're doing are really, really hard. Luck is just part of the game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:08):\nMaybe speaking that maybe not. One of your colleagues, Stephen Chau, who I am an investor in his new company, he worked with you at Uber Eats for a long time. He told me to ask you about the McDonald's story. I imagine that was just a big milestone, a big moment enough for you guys. So why'd you decide put McDonald's in Uber Eats and there's apparently a story of how you won that deal.\n\nJason Droege (00:57:27):\nSo it was interesting, and this just goes to maybe where sometimes ignorance leads you to accidentally the right answer. So we had launched Uber Eats and Uber had a global footprint and we were the only food delivery network with a global footprint excluding China. Everything at Uber needed to be launched globally. That was a very big part of the culture, et cetera, which is a lot of work and you can spread yourself too thin and cause other problems. But in this way it was good. My vision was, okay, let's help the little guy compete with all these chains. They have these systematized food systems and food is what makes a city amazing. And no one talks about the chain restaurant that they visited in Paris. They talk about the local place that they found and let's be part of that. That's who we want to be.\n\n(00:58:17):\nAnd so, McDonald's actually approached us and they said, \"Hey, we'd love to do food delivery with you.\" And I said, \"No.\" And they're like, \"Hold on a second. We have 80 million consumers a day. You don't want to do this together?\" I'm like, \"It's not really our vibe right now.\" And so, I pushed them off for four or five months until my team is like, \"You're insane. These people are going to put marketing behind it. They really want to do this. They want to lean in.\" So we actually had, because of that, I think it's hard to correlate these things, we ended up with this exclusive relationship with them, got an insane number of customers of... Chains at this point actually weren't really on food delivery networks because everybody was so worried about the unit economics, because they're so sensitive to the basket size.\n\n(00:59:00):\nAnd my approach was like, eh, figure it out, which is a very Uber culture thing. Okay, the basket's $17, it's our job to make that work, reduce the radius on the delivery, figure out the economics, maybe mark up some of the food someplace. There's always a way to figure it out. So we did it and then three months later the business just started hockey sticking again at a different level. And my team is just like, \"Dude, you were so stubborn on this point,\" but I think it actually ended up being in net benefit because we got a great deal with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:34):\nSo the fact that you pushed him out helped you get a better deal is what I'm hearing. That's amazing.\n\nJason Droege (00:59:37):\nYeah, I think that's the story he would be referencing. And then, the onboarding of it was crazy because we basically went global with them in six months, and at this point the business was less than two years old. So activating this, I don't even know, an 80-year-old company that expects processes to be in place and we have two of our office managers in New York managing it. It's just mayhem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:59):\nI'm still sad In-N-Out is still not on any of these apps.\n\nJason Droege (01:00:04):\nYeah, me too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:05):\nI remember someone was hacking it. There's all these ways people found a way around and they're like, \"No, no. Okay, you're Postmates. We know we're not going to give you any food.\"\n\nJason Droege (01:00:12):\nYes, love In-N-Out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:13):\nYou've touched on this idea of gross margins and margins, how obsessed you are with this. I wanted to spend a little time on here. I've heard just you're obsessed with understanding gross margins before going in on anything. Most founders have no idea what they're doing here. What have you learned about just what people should be paying attention to, what they might be forgetting when they think about just the feasibility of a business?\n\nJason Droege (01:00:33):\nYeah, look, it's one filter like many filters. There are certainly businesses that have low gross margins that are great businesses. Costco, Walmart, et cetera. Amazon talks about this all the time of there's companies that increase prices and there's companies at lower prices. But I would say that by and large, high gross margins combined with healthy churn curves are a very healthy sign for the business. I mean, think about it. If I were to sell you something and I can't mark it up a lot, how much value am I adding beyond what's in my hand? And if I'm not adding that much value, then what am I in the business of doing? And I'm in business of adding value. And it's not quite that simple. This is just a litmus test of when someone comes to me and they go, especially in a new business, and we deal with this. I dealt with this at Uber, I've dealt with it everywhere.\n\n(01:01:26):\nSomeone comes up with an idea and they go, \"We can get into this business and I think we can charge this and it'll get us to a 40% gross margin.\" And then, my next question is start at a 60% gross margin. Why does that not work? And they go, \"Oh, well, the customer...\" And immediately, you short circuit to what the real problem is. Oh, the customer has an alternative. Oh, okay, well who's the alternative? Oh, it's some offshoring company. Well, what's their gross margin? Oh, we don't know. You go find out. It's like 20% and they've been around for a long time and they have scaled operations. And you're like, okay, so your gross margin is going to go from 40 to 20 quicker than you think, and you're going to be in a world of hurt unless you do something to differentiate.\n\n(01:02:06):\nSo I take gross margin is just a very coarse instrument, not a perfect instrument to think about, am I adding enough value? Am I differentiated? It's not perfect, but it's a very quick short circuit filter to even to see if someone's pitching you an idea, have they thought through this dynamic? Because if the response is gross margin is super low right now, but here's the dynamic I'm going after. And then you're like, \"Oh, okay.\" And sometimes it's like, we'll just make it up with volume and then the gross margin will go negative for a while and you're like, \"Wait, this doesn't work.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):\nSo what I love about this is just a lens into is my idea good enough if studying, can I keep a high gross margin? Is there a reason why people in this space haven't been able to have a higher margin?\n\nJason Droege (01:02:48):\nYeah, exactly. And like I said, it's meant to disqualify just you're doing these large for larger companies and everybody has ideas. And so, it's a way to cut through. Do you understand the machine that is going to need to be in place in two or three years? You might have a 70% gross margin now because the next question is why can't someone else do this? And if you have an answer of like, \"Well, they can now, but they can't in two years, if we run really fast.\" Okay, we might have something. If they can now and they will be able to in two years, you're going to have margin compression.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):\nAlong these lines I was just listening to, I think it was the a16z podcast. Alex Rampell I think was sharing this story about Costco, how as you said, their strategy is actually to keep margins very, very low because all their revenue comes from their membership. So they have something like 50 million members paying 100 bucks a month and that's their entire business. And so, they don't plan and they don't want to make money off the products.\n\nJason Droege (01:03:55):\nYeah, that's right. I mean, they're playing a slightly different game, not an expert on Costco, have spent some time with the company, but they use price as a way to get to scale. And so, they're basically saying if we discount, same with Walmart, we will get so much volume that we will just take the air out of the room for all of our competition. And so, then the question of, okay, so if you have a low gross margin today, in two or three years, once you land one of these centers in a market, why won't your margins to get eroded? The answer is because we will have already absorbed all of the demand. You try to go to 8% versus 10% gross margin, which I roughly think is what their gross margin is. That's going to be a really hard business. If you already have a habit with a customer, they have already built their weekly trips around you, you already have relationships with suppliers, you already have general managers that know how to stock inventory, that's not a straightforward exercise. So they're first to scale and then good luck competing with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):\nOkay. Just a couple more questions. One is there's this term that I've heard that you often say and believe in is this idea of not losing is a precursor to winning.\n\nJason Droege (01:05:00):\nYes, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:01):\nTalk about that.\n\nJason Droege (01:05:03):\nTech is a culture where portfolios are built by investors, and a lot of the narrative is controlled by investors frankly. Founders obviously participate, but this idea that you should just go for it is consensus. Just go for it. Who cares? Well, I don't know, if it's my life and I only have one moment to take a shot, I might want to just not just go for it. I might want to think for a little bit, and I think the best entrepreneurs, I have no data to back this up, but just these are my friend, this is my friend group. I think the best entrepreneurs and the best business owners look at the risk profile of the decisions that they're making and they try to make asymmetrically positive decisions all along the way.\n\n(01:05:51):\nAnd so, oftentimes I feel like we forget about the risk of a decision, and there's more to unpack there because I actually think taking highly risky decisions and then having it work out is a weird cultural thing too, because then how do you train people to do that? Because it's a very hard thing to take high risk decisions and be right enough because it creates a lot of volatility. But it goes back to my comment about the most important thing in founders, which is just this ability to persevere through. Survival is just part of the game, and most people just give up before they get their timing right, before they get the right insight with the customer before they get the right product in the market. And life can change quickly in tech. You can go from being a dog to being a hero in a very short period of time, but you're on this very, very long journey, but you have to survive for that condition to be met.\n\n(01:06:38):\nAnd so, then the question is is when you're in a hype cycle, I would argue that we are right now, everyone wants to go for it and then go for it more and then go for it more and go for it more and you don't realize, guys, all of our customers are going to be around in five years. They just want us to solve their problems. We have to be around to solve their problem for them. And so, survival is a precursor to that. So let's not put ourselves in position that could potentially compromise the enterprise along the way. It doesn't mean don't take risks, but think about how you calculate it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):\nI love how clear it is that this lesson and many of the lessons along these lines have come from just failure and things not working out and things breaking, which is the best outcome.\n\nJason Droege (01:07:19):\nIf you ever get on the other side of a high reward, high risk decision, it is so painful because you are just cooked. You are done, and often there's no way out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:32):\nIs there a story along those lines that comes to mind or an example of that?\n\nJason Droege (01:07:35):\nWell, this is where it is together on why I try to be so I think you can spend a little bit of time thinking upfront to save yourself a lot of pain downstream. I had this business not worth detailing it, but after the bubble burst in 2001, I'm like, \"I'm going to self-fund a business. I'm going to build a profitable business. I want to prove that I can do this.\" And we had started Scour, which had all the things we talked about. And so, what I did is I'm like, I was a golfer and frankly, there was nothing to do in tech.\n\n(01:08:03):\nSo I started selling golf clubs on the internet and I was making real money and I might've learned more from this business than any other because I started on eBay and I was 22, and I didn't really understand that my margins would come down because anyone can do this, but I was one of the first ones to do it, so I was making a ton of money and then I built this business and then I just failed to recognize I had a lot of hubris. I was like, \"Oh, if I could just buy all the used golf clubs in America, I can be the market maker for prices,\" and don't people do that?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:34):\nI love this ambition. That's great.\n\nJason Droege (01:08:36):\nAnd it's just like it's madness to actually think about the practicality of that. And so, I just didn't spend the time thinking and then I ended up in this business. The business was profitable, it got to a couple million of revenue, whatever, paid me a dividend for a while, but it was painful the entire way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nI love the spectrum of experiences you've had. You've sold golf clubs, you're helping achieve AGI, you could say. There's also a whole part of your career. We haven't talked about where you built tasers and body cams and drones and all these things. Also, peer-to-peer file sharing before anyone else. Final topic I just want to spend a little time on based on this experience is hiring and building teams, something that I know you have a really strong take on. That I've been hearing a lot on this podcast recently is this idea of it's more important to build the right team than find the most optimal top talent. Talk about that, why that's so interesting and important.\n\nJason Droege (01:09:31):\nAs of late, I've developed a more nuanced view of this, which is for certain roles, you absolutely need the right experience in this current market. You see this with researchers, because the market's moving so fast, you don't have time to train up some people, so you actually have to go find people either who have the right relationships with customers that you want to get or you have to, who might not check other boxes but are awesome at that, might not check the classic boxes that I think you're referencing of they're a problem solver, they can grow with the company, they have a high trajectory, et cetera. I would say that's 5% of the roles in the company, but very important whenever speed to market is important.\n\n(01:10:09):\nAnd then, for interviewing, I just interview for three things and I have to interview across all kinds of expertises, which is hard. I can't be an expert in everything. And so, I reduce it down to just three things, which is like, are you a curious problem solver and can you articulate that verbally? Can you work across people? Are you humble enough to work across and are you a good leader? And if you just do those three things, I think you have a pretty high chance of success, at least in an organization that I'm running, because the world's changing. So you do need people that are adaptable. So all the experience is not necessarily one-to-one relevant.\n\n(01:10:53):\nAnd then, the working across to your team point, this actually came up at Uber Eats. So when I was building the Uber Eats management team, I'm not sure if this was mentioned to you from that group, but whenever I would hire people, I was trying to compose almost like an organism of strengths and then minimize the conflicts. That management team for the most part outside of some of the operations side, but for the most part, that management team was the same management team from day one when we had nothing to $20 billion. And I just believed that the team, knowing each other's strengths and weaknesses and being able to compensate for each other was more important than the classic advice you get around, \"Well, that person hasn't seen this much scale.\" And you're like, \"Well, yeah, but can they learn it?\" I learned it. So you do have to kind of believe in people a little bit, which is my job, not necessarily their job. And so, I mean, these are people systems. They're not straightforward rules-based things you can apply.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:49):\nAnd I especially love this advice because there's all this talk about what skills will matter in this world of AI doing all our jobs, and it feels like these three buckets are maybe the same thing, just are they good at solving problems? Are they good leaders? Can they collaborate well with other people?\n\nJason Droege (01:12:02):\nYeah, I don't think that the core rise of humanity, it will change, and I think that these things are pretty core to how humans have been successful for a long time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:11):\nSpeaking of that, I'm going to take us to a recurring segment of this podcast that I call AI Corner, where I ask folks this question, what's some way that you've found a use for AI in your day-to-day life in your work that makes you more effective, get more done, get better stuff done?\n\nJason Droege (01:12:28):\nHonestly, when I came into Scale, so my history was in consumer and I've done some application level stuff with government, and this space is moving so quickly. AI is my, I use it as a tutor. As these new concepts come up, I have a lot of people in the company who can educate me on the nuances of the technicals of all of, excuse me, the technical nature of the data and the products, but they only have so much time. And honestly, there's new concepts coming up all the time and I need to stay on top of it.\n\n(01:13:01):\nSo it might sound crazy, but a large percentage of my job is not dealing with the engineering issues related to AI. I'm managing an organization, but I love understanding it. It's one of the most enjoyable, rewarding parts of my job is to learn from all these AI researchers, but they don't always have the time to do it, so I use it as a tutor. I turn on voice mode and talk to it on my way into work. So I think that's probably the most impactful thing that I use it for that's also relevant to this topic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:32):\nI do exactly the same thing, especially when I'm prepping for this podcast. What exactly is this? I think about when you say this, I did an interview with the founders of Perplexity a few years ago asking about how they work at Perplexity, and the founders said that before, they were ruled, before they ask a question of anyone on the team, they have to ask AI first. And I was just like, \"That's crazy.\" Now, it's so obvious. But back then, I was like, \"That's an insane way of working. I've never heard of this before.\" Just a sign of how ahead of the curve they were.\n\nJason Droege (01:14:04):\nYeah, I think number two would be I'll take internal documents and I'll ask, what's the most important thing in this document? And I'm shocked, and then I'll read it and just double check, but I'm shocked at how good it is at just pulling out. There's so much in organizations that is like, I don't know what you want me to say and I don't know what I need to know, but we each have our own agendas, and so this matching of, and so then there's this huge broadcast problem where it's like, of all of the information you might want to receive, what's actually important to you? And so, I use it a lot for that too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:39):\nAmazing. That's a really good tip. I use it for legal documents, just like what do they know about what they're trying to do here for me or against me? Jason, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with, maybe double down on a point before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nJason Droege (01:14:54):\nYeah, absolutely. I mean, I think the really important, the reason why I'm doing this, the reason why want to spend time here outside of wanting to be on the show for a while and being a long-term listener is, our long-time listener, excuse me, is there's a lot of amazing work going on at Scale. The teams are working super hard, we're delivering a ton of value for our customers. The public narrative has not represented the work that the people here are doing and the work that our customers are doing with what we're doing for them. And I just think that deserves the respect and reward that all those people are putting in, and we'd like people to know that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:34):\nI appreciate you saying all that. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We've got five questions for you. You ready?\n\nJason Droege (01:15:38):\nYeah, let's go for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):\nWhat are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nJason Droege (01:15:44):\nSome of this is going to sound interesting. The Selfish Gene is one of my favorite books.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:48):\nLove that book. I don't know if anyone's ever mentioned, it was one of the most influential books for me too. So sorry, keep going.\n\nJason Droege (01:15:54):\nYes. I think Selfish Gene. Road Less Traveled, I've read more than once. I mean, it's just one of the classic human psychology book. And then, I think in business, I think Good to Great. It's not the read that you're going to be most excited to enjoy on a vacation, but it's pretty much right, and I think we should take advice from people who have analyzed these business problems before because not a lot's changed, but we keep acting like everything's changed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:24):\nWhat's crazy about that book, you look at all the companies they talk about, I haven't read in a while, but just the whole book is about companies that last, I believe, or maybe that's the other book, I don't know. But anyway, all the companies that they talk about, I don't know if they're still around. It's so hard for a business to last a long, long time.\n\nJason Droege (01:16:38):\nI would also recommend Thinking Slow and Fast, that's the... Yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:38):\nThinking, Fast and Slow.\n\nJason Droege (01:16:43):\nThinking, Fast and Slow. Excuse me, sorry. It's been like a decade since I read it, but just in terms of point there being human biases are very important to understand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:51):\nWhat's really crazy to me about that book and Kahneman in general, someone asked them just, how's your life been impacted by learning all these biases humans have? He's like, \"Not much. I have the same biases. Knowing them doesn't really help me avoid them.\"\n\nJason Droege (01:17:05):\nSee, I find myself checking myself. Whenever I get super convicted on something now I will be like, okay, what is the list of things that I'm inclined to do to try to catch myself? Because I think we're most inclined to have these bad decisions impulsively, which is what I think the book is largely about. I mean, it's a long book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:28):\nSo long. Oh, my God. It feels like that's where AI can help us in the future. Just like, \"Hey, Jason, are you sure this isn't framing a fact or whatever?\"\n\nJason Droege (01:17:38):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:38):\nOkay. Next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nJason Droege (01:17:43):\nMost of the movies I watch are with my kids, so I wish I had something deep and profound.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):\nNo, kids content also is a very acceptable-\n\nJason Droege (01:17:52):\nThe Formula 1 movie I thought was really good. I mean, it's a classic action movie. I don't think it informs anything in AI or business, but it's good to check out from the craziness of tech once in a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:04):\nIs there a product you recently discovered that you really love? Could be an app, could be clothing, could be a kitchen gadget, anything along those lines?\n\nJason Droege (01:18:13):\nVO3. Not totally new, but when I was in high school, I wanted to be a screenwriter. I actually grew up in the Bay Area and everybody was an engineer, but I wanted be a screenwriter. And so, I went back and I got the first page of one of my old scripts, which not good scripts, but I got the first page. I took a picture of the script and I fed it to VO3, and I said, \"Make this scene,\" and it got it right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:38):\nWow.\n\nJason Droege (01:18:39):\nI was shocked. I was just absolutely shocked that you could just take a picture of a script. And so, now I'm thinking about that for how do I use these tools for family videos? Some of the grad tools now with making live images more active, I think are really interesting. I think they need one more step of iteration, but I think those are going to be really emotionally life-changing for people because just a little bit of movement in an image from a grandparent or a relative or whatever you haven't seen in a while, it really does make a big emotional impact on you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:20):\nI love that when you play with these tools, you probably can think about, oh, here's the people that help train this thing. Here's the people that helped on the problem that it had.\n\nJason Droege (01:19:26):\nI was actually talking to someone who was working on VO3, and I told him the script thing and he goes, \"Oh, actually scripts. Yeah, no, the way the data is formatted in a script, that would actually be very good.\" Because they start with set looks dark interior, this character says it in this raspy voice, and so it gives you all the instructions in the script.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:45):\nOh, man, just unlocked a whole new business unit right there. Two more questions. One is do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, find useful in work or in life?\n\nJason Droege (01:19:57):\nYeah. The end is never the end. That's my favorite internal saying, and it goes to the comments before about survival being a precursor, surviving being a precursor to thriving. You got to survive before you thrive, which is your brain tells you, and along these entrepreneurial journeys, I think this is most applicable. I mean, this is the hardest journey anyone can go on. If you go on this journey for five years, you are mentally harder than 99.9% of the population. People don't understand the Chinese water torture of having self-doubt and having things go wrong, et cetera.\n\n(01:20:31):\nAnd so, more tactically, you get this when you're working out like in a day like, \"Oh, I'm too tired. I need to stop.\" But the truth is is you can keep going and the world's going to keep spinning. So I find in the moments where it's just the hardest or you have this hard decision that seems impassable and your body, you're having this visceral reaction to this is impassable, just to remind yourself that I'm going to wake up tomorrow. This isn't the end. There's another end somewhere. I just find that to unlock me to be like, okay, there might not be a perfect solution, there might be an imperfect solution, but it's a solution so let's just keep going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:06):\nFinal question. You helped create Uber Eats. I imagine you're still a power user of Uber Eats. You have a favorite restaurant on Uber Eats that maybe people should know about, maybe that you order most from?\n\nJason Droege (01:21:16):\nI order a shocking amount of McDonald's actually. Despite my original story, it's the family treat in the house. I would say that that's probably the top thing that we order.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:31):\nOh, man, I'm worried for your health, but I love, I haven't had McDonald's so long. This is like, maybe I should give it another-\n\nJason Droege (01:21:37):\nI mean, more practically we will order mixed greens or tender greens or something like that on a day-to-day basis, but I think that the more notable, surprising thing is is that despite my initial aversion to working with a global chain, it's a good treat once in a while. You just shouldn't have it all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:57):\nJason, this was incredible. I really appreciate you making time for this. I'm really honored to be the first chat you've had since taking over at Scale. Where can folks find you online if they want to maybe reach out, learn more about what you're, I don't know, maybe join Scale. Where do you want to point people to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJason Droege (01:22:14):\nYeah, absolutely. I'm @jdroege, J-D-R-O-E-G-E on X. That's probably the easiest way to follow me, keep up with things and you can shoot me a DM if you like. And so, I think that's how you would keep in touch and, sorry, what was your other question? Sorry.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:31):\nIf you're hiring, I don't know, where should people go check it out if you are, and then also just-\n\nJason Droege (01:22:34):\nAbsolutely. Just go to scale.com, go to our careers page, and we have 250 open roles. To the point about we're in business and we're growing, we're hiring a ton of people. Our data business is growing, our applications and services business is growing like crazy, and so we're going to need a lot of people to help us on that journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:54):\nYou guys just signed some insanely large contracts with the government I was reading.\n\nJason Droege (01:22:58):\nTwo $100 million contracts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:01):\n$100 million contracts.\n\nJason Droege (01:23:02):\n100, yeah. We didn't sign just one. We signed two in one month, so yes, no, our federal business is doing well. Our enterprise business is doing well. Our international government's business is doing well. There's a lot of demand out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:16):\nSome salespeople are getting some great commissions. Good job. Jason, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJason Droege (01:23:21):\nYeah, thank you. Honor to be a guest here. Super excited to be with you, especially so early in the journey, or at least my journey here leading Scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:32):\nAppreciate it. Thanks for coming. Thanks for joining us.
