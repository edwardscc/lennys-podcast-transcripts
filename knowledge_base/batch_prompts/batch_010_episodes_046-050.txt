Stay away from why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nI think it might be helpful to talk about this concept that you call the three realities.\n\nCarole Robin (00:00:28):\nWe don't understand that we are only privy to two out of the three, so I know what's going on for me and I know what I did. I have no idea what happened on your end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:37):\nThat's a really profound point that anger is a secondary emotion. Really what's going on is you're afraid or you're hurt.\n\nCarole Robin (00:00:43):\nWhat a disservice to not help people understand that anger is a distancing emotion and there are other emotions that are connecting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday my guest is Carole Robin. For over 20 years, Carole taught the legendary course at Stanford's Graduate School of Business, nicknamed Touchy Feely technically called Interpersonal Dynamics, which helps people learn how to build strong relationships and become much more effective leaders. She then went on to start a non-profit called Leaders in Tech, which brings these same lessons to leaders of high-tech growth companies, and she also wrote an incredibly impactful book called Connect, which distills all the key insights and lessons from her decades running this course. I've had so many friends go through the Stanford course or the Leaders in Tech program, and every single one of them was transformed in terms of how they relate to other people, how they communicate, and how they lead. In my conversation with Carole, we talk about why we're often trapped in mental models that we formed when we were younger and how they now limit us and limit our potential and our ways of seeing world.\n\n(00:01:49):\nWhy disclosing 15% more than you naturally feel comfortable will make you a more effective leader? Why there are actually three realities around us at all times and how that insight changes the way you relate to people. We also get into how to give feedback to anyone about anything, why vulnerability is so essential to great leadership, how to build exceptional relationships, and why they're so important and so much more. This is a very special and very unique episode and I am so excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Carole Robin.

It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. This episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams.\n\n(00:02:43):\nCompanies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I left most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. EPO does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytics cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing.\n\n(00:03:40):\nCheck out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny. Let me tell you about CommandBar. If you're like me and most users I've built product for you probably find those little in-product pop-ups, really annoying, want to take a tour? Check out this new feature, and these Pop-ups are becoming less and less effective since most users don't read what they say. They just want to close them as soon as possible, but every product builder knows that users need help to learn the ins and outs of your product. We use so many products every day and we can't possibly know the ins and outs of everyone. CommandBar is an AI-powered toolkit for product growth, marketing and customer teams to help users get the most out of your product without annoying them.\n\n(00:04:25):\nThey use AI to get closer to user intent, so they have search and chat products that let users describe what they're trying to do in their own words and then see personalized results like customer walkthroughs or actions, and they do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful. This works for web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp and LaunchDarkly. Over 15 million end-users have interacted with CommandBar. To try out CommandBar you can sign up at commandbar.com/lenny and you can unlock an extra 1,000 AI responses per month for any plan. That's commandbar.com/lenny. Carole, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nCarole Robin (00:05:19):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny. I'm delighted to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:22):\nI've heard from so many people over the years how much you and your course have impacted their life, both friends of mine, and also people when I shared on Twitter that you were coming on the podcast, so many people left comments just like, \"Oh my God, that course and Carole's changed my life in so many ways.\" So I am really excited to have you here. I'm really honored to have you here.\n\nCarole Robin (00:05:23):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:43):\nI wanted to start with when we were preparing for this podcast, you shared this quote with me. You told me that \"I was put on this planet to help people learn that it's possible to learn how to build and develop robust, meaningful relationships.\" What are robust, meaningful relationships and why are they important to you? Why are they important to people?\n\nCarole Robin (00:06:05):\nI think that most people experience a richer, fuller, more meaningful life when they have at least some high quality relationships or maybe put the other way. If you have none, it's unlikely you're going to experience quite as rich and full a life. So I often talk about relationships exist on a continuum. At one end of the continuum is contact and no connection, or we could also say dysfunction. And by the way, contact no connection. Those are thousands of Facebook friends. Those are not relationships and those are not friends in my vocabulary. At the other end of the continuum is what my co-author David Bradford and I came to call exceptional, and exceptional relationships have a particular set of characteristics that I can get into if you want to. But before I even do that, we're not suggesting, and I'm not suggesting that everybody needs to turn every one of their relationships into something exceptional.\n\n(00:07:05):\nThat would be, first of all, impractical, second of all, unnecessary. But it turns out that the skills you need to move along that continuum actually take you from contact and no connection and dysfunction to at least functional and robust. And then once you've acquired those skills, then you can decide whether or not you want to take a few of those relationships a lot farther, take them all the way to exceptional, but at least you've gained what you need to know in order to get to functional and robust. And I believe if we had a critical mass of human beings on this planet who had those skills and knew how to get to at least robust and functional, we wouldn't just have more functional teams and organizations, we'd have stronger communities, we'd have more functional schools. We might, in my wildest dreams, even have a more functional government. And so that's my life's mission.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:03):\nHopefully this episode is going to actually do exactly that, help people build from-\n\nCarole Robin (00:08:07):\nFrom your mouth to God's ears.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:10):\nTo give people a little more motivation to really dig in and pay deep attention to this. What are some of the benefits you've seen from people moving further along the spectrum, building more robust relationships and more exceptional relationships?\n\nCarole Robin (00:08:23):\nObviously, I taught a course for many, many years at Stanford Business School, and it was the Stanford Business School, by the way. It wasn't hidden away somewhere in the psychology department. And that's because the premise of the course is that people do business with people not ideas, not products, not machines, not tactics, strategies, not even money, they do business with people. So you better get the people part right if you really want to succeed. And that interpersonal competence is a determinant of both personal and professional success. So, to your question, I've lost track of how many hundreds of emails and calls and visits I've had from former students who come to tell me I just became a CEO. I'm pretty sure I owe it all to you. I just raised my third round. I'm pretty sure I owe it all to you.\n\n(00:09:20):\nI just figured out how my co-founder and I are going to navigate this very difficult situation we're in. Thank you for everything you taught me, and those are exceedingly satisfying. And I'll tell you, even more rewarding for me are the, \"I'm pretty sure your class just saved my marriage.\" I just reconciled my relationship with my brother who I hadn't talked to for two years because he voted for X and I voted for Y. We don't need to get into who X and Y are. And now I get thank you for finally writing a book because my VP of product didn't go to Stanford and doesn't understand what I'm talking about. So at least I bought them a book and now I've got more and more folks sending people to Leaders in Tech, which we can talk about later, which is the nonprofit I started after I left Stanford, so that more and more people can learn this from more than just a book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:19):\nAmazing. And I think what I love, you also shared this point that many people told you that that one class at Stanford Business School at GSB was made them feel like their entire college tuition was worth it from that one class, which is so surprising because it's called Touchy Feely, it has nothing to do specifically with business.\n\nCarole Robin (00:10:38):\nExcept of course it has everything to do with business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:41):\nSo to follow that thread, can you just talk about what this class is trying to do, what the goal of this class is and what actually goes on in this class? And again, people call this class Touchy Feely. I think it's technically called Interpersonal Dynamics.\n\nCarole Robin (00:10:57):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:58):\nOkay.\n\nCarole Robin (00:10:58):\nThat's correct. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:00):\nYeah. What is this class all about? Help people understand what goes on here.\n\nCarole Robin (00:11:03):\nWell, first of all, it's a quarter long class at a really fundamental level we've already really talked about what goes on there. People learn how to be more interpersonally competent or how to connect with other people in more functional ways. And what I mean by connect is learn how I need to show up in order for you to trust me, in order for you to feel closer to me, in order for you to want to spend more time with me in a leadership. By the way, this is part of the leadership curriculum I taught, in a leadership sense that makes you more likely to want to follow me because in the end, that's the question leaders should ask themselves, \"Why should somebody follow me?\" And you know what? You could study other leaders. Why did somebody follow Steve Jobs? Why did somebody follow Ursula at Xerox? Why did some people follow Sheryl Sandberg or why should somebody follow me? Because I'm not any of those people. So the question I ask my students to sit in and now my Leaders in Tech participants to sit in is why should somebody follow you?\n\n(00:12:18):\nNow, there are lots of reasons why people might follow you. You've got a great vision that's very inspiring. You have a product that they want to bring into the world. They think they may make a lot of money if they hitch their wagon to you. Those are all good reasons. But if you want to build a sustainable long-term legacy, then you probably want to think about showing up in a way that other people come to see you as a referent figure, somebody in their life that they say, \"When I grow up, I want to be more like that.\" And that is a form of power. There's a lot of research that supports this, referent power. You're a referent figure, and then people are much likely to be open to your influence, and open to working harder, and open to doing some of the things that you believe are going to make you great as a whole organization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:27):\nThe class is quite unusual in that there's not just a bunch of lectures and talks, there's a lot of experiential pieces where you have to do quite uncomfortable things in order to learn how to do this well. Can you share an example or two of some of the things you put people through, whatever you're able to share?\n\nCarole Robin (00:13:45):\nSure. I mean, I think that we don't learn to be... And I don't learn how to connect with you by reading about it in a book, which by the way is why it took us four years to write our book because at the end of every chapter there's a, here are things you can go do with what you just learned in the reading. And likewise in the class, the lectures are scaffolding on which you can hang your experience. But most of the learning happens in these small groups called T groups. The T stands for training, not therapy. And sometimes people think they sound like therapy, and they sometimes even experience them as feeling a little bit like therapy, but that's not what they are. We call them training groups. And what happens in that group is that there's 12 participants and two facilitators, and they are, for example, given a task, I might pair two students up and say, okay, you've got 10 minutes.\n\n(00:14:51):\nAllow the other person to get to know you. And that's the only instruction I give. Okay, so now you and I look at each other and we're like, \"I don't know what the heck that's supposed to mean.\" And then maybe I share something about myself or maybe I ask you a question or who knows what I do with that, and then who knows what you do with that? So after 10 minutes, then I stop them and I say, okay, so take a moment and recognize that you just had a bunch of choices that you actually probably never even think about. You had a choice whether you began by sharing something or you waited for the other person to be in. You had a choice whether you began with a question, which was a nice, safe place to be, or whether you began with a disclosure.\n\n(00:15:40):\nThen you had choices with regard to how you responded to what your partner did. And the whole course is about having interactions and then having the guidance and the space and the time and the focus to unpack what just happened. So now do you want to have a more conversation with this person or less? Are you intrigued or are you like, \"Can I just get paired up with somebody else?\" But now we get to talk about it. And then I put them into a second conversation and I say, okay, now having learned that, by the way, one of the ways we build relationships is through disclosure, through allowing ourselves to become more known. So that's a little mini lecture. And then I say, okay, now go back into your pair and see whether or not you want to make some new choices.\n\n(00:16:33):\nAnd then of course, that's all I always say, confidentiality is a very important aspect of all this work. So in the pair conversations, in the group conversations, I call them the Vegas Rule. What happens if Vegas stays in Vegas. And so I don't ask for any specifics, but I'll ask them for, was there a qualitative difference between the first and second conversation? And they inevitably say, \"Oh my God. The first conversation is the conversation I have in the bar all the time with somebody.\" And the second conversation was a little more uncomfortable, but I sure feel a lot more known, and I think I know my partner a little bit more and now they've had a little taste of what it's going to be like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:18):\nAmazing example. So what I want to do with the rest of our chat is basically go through many of the lessons and insights and lectures that you give in this course. Obviously, they're not going to be able to practice the way they would practice in a class. But before we get in there, let's actually talk about, so there's this course at Stanford, and you also now have a program called Leaders in Tech where anyone can participate. They don't have to be going to Stanford Business School. Talk about what this is and how people can participate if they want to go deeper on the stuff we're going to talk about.\n\nCarole Robin (00:17:47):\nSo Leaders in Tech is a nonprofit that two of my co-founders and I started, I guess in January of 2018. We started it with a program called The Fellows Program, which is a 10-month program that starts with a four-day retreat that's like Touchy Feely on steroids because Touchy Feely is a quarter long class, and then it continues on a monthly basis for a day or half a day a month to get the rest of what we might call Carole Robin curriculum because I also taught a course called High Performance Leadership. I also called Taught Leadership Coaching and Mentoring. So there were other things besides Touchy Feely. Then what happened was that our fellows who went through our first couple of cohorts said, because the Fellows Program is open to founders, either current or previous founders or co-founders of a company that has not gone public.\n\n(00:18:51):\nAnd what we're trying to do is we're trying to influence the cultures of the future of Facebook's and Google's of the world, not the current ones. And so that program has a more limited number of people that can apply to it. However, one of the things that happened was we got a lot of people who said, but I'm not a founder and I still want that. And we also had fellows who went through the program that said, what about my people, my chief people officer, my VP of engineering? So then we'd started just a four-day version of the Touchy Feely, which anybody could apply to. I mean, actually not anybody. You do have to be a manager of some kind, and you do have to be in tech for now.\n\n(00:19:37):\nSo that's where people get the real on the ground experience. They all get a copy of the book, and of course, if you don't want to go through the program or it's not the right time or you want to start somewhere else, you can start with the book. But if you just buy the book and you read it and you put it back on your shelf, you're not going to learn anything. Don't waste your money. If you're going to buy the book, buy at least one other copy and give it to somebody with whom you actually want to develop a stronger relationship and read it together and do the activities at the end of every book, and then you start to get a taste of what it's like to go through the course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):\nSo just to close the loop there, how do people learn more and apply and join this program?\n\nCarole Robin (00:20:21):\nWww.leadersintech.org.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:25):\nAwesome. And around the time this episode comes out, there's a deadline roughly around that time?\n\nCarole Robin (00:20:31):\nThere is. Around when this episode comes out. So we do these four-day retreats all year, so there's no deadline to apply for that, but if you're interested in the ten-month program that starts with the four-day retreat and then has all that additional stuff, then deadline for that is May one. Actually, it might even how many days? It might be April. I don't remember how many days there are in April, but it's either the last day of April or May one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:00):\nApril 30th.\n\nCarole Robin (00:21:01):\nYeah, there you go. So it's probably April 30th. So check it out. You have to be nominated in order to apply. Don't let that stop you. If you look at it all and you decide you want to apply, just apply and say, Carole, I listened to Carole Robin on this podcast, you told me to apply.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:23):\nOkay, great.\n\nCarole Robin (00:21:25):\nDon't waste time trying to find somebody to nominate you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:27):\nHow amazing. Okay. Or you're going to be flooded with applications.\n\nCarole Robin (00:21:31):\nAgain, from your mouth to God's ears.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:35):\nOkay, so let's get into a lot of the stuff that you teach. So you mentioned progressive disclosure, so that might be a good place to start. What's the lesson there? What is it that people get wrong? Why is that important?\n\nCarole Robin (00:21:46):\nSo first of all, when we disclose, we make ourselves more vulnerable, and vulnerability and disclosure tend to be reciprocal. If I hold my cards really close, you're going to hold your cards even closer. So one of the things to learn to do is to experiment. And what works with one person isn't going to work without somebody else necessarily because every relationship is its own fabulously interesting and always unfolding dynamic is to experiment with allowing myself to be a little bit more known, and then seeing what happens and whether or not you reciprocate. Now, a really important concept we teach that you and I have talked about before is called the 15% rule. And what that is that we all have a comfort zone. Imagine a circle in the middle called the comfort zone, this picture's in the book, and that we don't think twice about what we say, and then there is a danger zone, which is a circle way on the outside.\n\n(00:22:57):\nSo these are concentric circles if you're not watching the video, and I never in a million years say that or tell you that, but there's this really important circle in the middle, which is called the learning zone. In academia, they have to have fancy words for very easy concepts, it's called the zone of proximal development. But basically it means that's where you learn. And you have to step outside your comfort zone in order to learn anything, and especially in order to create a deeper connection with somebody. However, my students used to say, \"But Carole, the minute I step outside my comfort zone, how do I know I'm not in my danger zone?\" I hear this learning zone, but how do I know I didn't go too far? So we came up with the 15% rule. So step a little bit outside your comfort zone. If you step a little bit outside your comfort zone, you're very unlikely to freak yourself or the other person out.\n\n(00:23:53):\nBut you'll know, you'll feel it a little bit, you'll be like, okay, I feel just a little uncomfortable saying this, but I think I'm going to try. And then depending on how you respond, then we settle into a new comfort zone, a slightly larger circle, which is our comfort zone with each other. Then we can go 15% beyond that, and that's how we learn and grow and deepen our relationship. The same thing by the way applies to feedback when we get into that later. So we have to step outside our comfort zone in order to deepen and strengthen relationships.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:27):\nWhat are some examples of stepping outside your comfort zone, disclosing what is it that you find people maybe aren't disclosing enough of or areas they should disclose? Is it challenges they're having in their life?\n\nCarole Robin (00:24:38):\nWell, of course, context matters. It depends on who I'm talking to. And by the way, disclosure, I want to underscore a concept that we also very much teach, which is appropriate disclosure. If I'm the VP of marketing and I get up in front of the troops and I say, \"Well, third month in a row we've lost share and I have no idea what's happening or why or what to do about it, and I'm feeling pretty crappy about myself, I'm not even sure I should be your VP of marketing.\" That might be vulnerable and disclosure, but it is not appropriate Vulnerability and that it's not what we're talking about. The flip side of that is that I get up in front of the troops and I pretend nothing is happening. That doesn't build my credibility either. So I can get up and say, okay, probably no secret to most of you, that's the third month in a row, we've lost share.\n\n(00:25:39):\nAnd man, I wish I could stand up here and tell you I know exactly what's happening and I know exactly what we should do about it, but I don't, and I have never needed you all more. Now, who would you rather follow? So I think in business, and for a very long time, leaders were socialized to, first of all, leave all feelings in the parking lot. I've got an anecdote I often tell about my very first job, which I'm happy to tell you if you want. And there's no place for vulnerability or for sharing feelings. Are you kidding, feelings in the workplace? Now, I ask you, how do you inspire anybody with no feelings? How do you motivate anybody with no feelings? How do you become seen as a real person with no feelings? Why should somebody who is a robot who is robotic follow you? And the answer to that sometimes in the valley especially is because they're going to follow you for a while because you've got a really great idea. And the minute they've got another choice, man, they are out of there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:50):\nAnd so a lot of this connects to this broad piece of advice you always give people is just and focus on vulnerability. You spend a lot of time teaching people just the power vulnerability, which is not intuitive. A lot of people try to move away from showing vulnerability. There's this quote I saw somewhere that \"A willingness to be vulnerable makes you not less influential as a leader.\" Can you just talk about why that is?\n\nCarole Robin (00:27:15):\nYeah, you asked me whether or not I held any contrarian views and I said, yeah, that's one of them. I actually think that a leader who is willing to be appropriately vulnerable is a stronger leader. And so I'll give you this short example of what happened to me because it encompasses a lot of what we've been talking about. So in 1975, I went to work for the largest industrial automation company in the world as the first woman in a non-clerical job. I was a sales engineer, and yes, I am old, but the dinosaurs were not roaming the earth. And the first thing I learned was you leave feelings in the parking lot, whatever you do, you never talk about your feelings or express feelings in the workplace. It's unprofessional. I was like, okay. I got pretty good at it. In fact, I got very good at it.\n\n(00:28:13):\nIronic, given that I eventually became known as the queen of putty-feely at Stanford. But at the time, I got very good at it. I'm not a career academic. I've had six different careers. And 10 years later I'm at an off-site and I've been promoted many times, I'm now running a $50 million region. I've got a half a dozen guys that work for me. And yes, ladies, if you're listening, I did finally fix that, but at that point, I still hadn't quite fixed it. And we're sitting there and I had an idea, it doesn't matter what it was, but I got a little excited about it and I got crickets and I got a little more excited and I got crickets. I was like, \"Come on you guys, this could be really cool. Why can't you see how cool this could be?\" And one of my guys leans in, looks at me and says, \"Carole, is that like water in the corner of your eye? Oh my God, are you going to cry?\" And then he says, \"Are you human after all?\"\n\n(00:29:09):\nAre you human after all? And then I burst out crying and I tore up our agenda and I said, \"You don't think I'm human?\" I don't think there is anything more important for us to spend our off-site talking about than that. And we spent the next two days talking about who we were, why we were there, what we wanted, what was important to us, how we could help each other. To this day, I believe that was the day I became a leader. To this day I know for a fact any of them would follow me anywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:40):\nTo help people build this muscle and start to practice this to try 15% disclosure, try to be a little more vulnerable. Is there any other examples or just tidbits you can share of like, here's something you should start doing more and more?\n\nCarole Robin (00:29:54):\nLet's start with you can start admitting mistakes, especially when everybody knows you made one, you actually lose a lot more credibility by ignoring it. And you can start again 15% by experimenting with sharing what's going on for you, particularly with regard to feelings a little bit more often. So there's a recent course is called Touchy-Feely emphasis on the feely and not the touchy. And that's because so much of our ability to develop this competence comes down to the appropriate use of feelings. That's why a vocabulary of feelings, how sad is it? We had to develop a vocabulary feelings because that's how hard it is for people to even access what they're feeling. So there's a vocabulary feelings in the syllabus, in the course, in the appendix of the book. Every member, every person who ever goes through a leaders in tech program gets it. And it starts with allowing yourself to be known, not just in terms of facts and... Feelings give meaning to facts.\n\n(00:31:12):\nLet me give you another example. If I tell you I went ziplining, well, that's interesting. Maybe you learned something about me. Maybe you start to make up all sorts of interesting stories about me. But if I tell you I went ziplining and I was terrified, but I went because I felt coerced by my family and I didn't want to be left alone back and then miss out. Well, you learned a lot more about me, didn't you? One of my most satisfying moments at the very first Leaders in Tech retreat we ever did was of a former student of mine who had taken Touchy Feely 15 years before, and who said, based on everything I learned 15 years ago from Carole, I couldn't imagine what I would learn if I came back. So I'm back. And he said, but Carole or no Carole, I will not sit around for four days talking about how we're all crushing it. I will leave.\n\n(00:32:15):\nI was like, \"Oh,\" I was so proud. And now there are times when a leader does have to stand up and say, yeah, we're crushing it. So another really, really important thing that people don't understand is that all of this is very nuanced and very context dependent, and most people unanswered Tell me what to do when X happens. Well, did X happen with this person or this person? What relationship do you have with them in the first place? Are there 20 people in the room of 250? Is this being recorded? There's just so many different things. Who's going to have access to it? There's so many things that you have to consider, and especially today, I know I'm old and this will sound predictable, but I am not a social media fan. I think it has done more to destroy strong relationships and to destroy people's ability to even learn or think about what it takes to have a great relationship.\n\n(00:33:26):\nAnyway, we could do a whole podcast on that. I have a former Leaders in Tech fellow who sent me this fantastic, here's another great example, sent me an email and maybe he called me, I don't remember. It doesn't matter. He said, \"So I had my all-hands meetings are every Monday morning, on Friday, I found out we had missed a major deadline on a product release, and I spent the entire weekend just furious, pissed off, wanting to fire a lot of them,\" and he said, \"And then on Sunday afternoon, I remembered part of what you taught us was that anger is often a secondary emotion and often under anger is either fear or hurt. And then I realized, oh yeah, I'm actually feeling pretty scared here, that nobody is as worried about this as I am.\"\n\n(00:34:24):\nAnd so he said, \"So on Monday morning, instead of getting up and blasting them all as I was prepared to do, I got up and I said, so, gang, I am deeply worried and afraid that I'm the only person here who is as concerned about this missed deadline as I am and what it's going to mean to our customers.\" And he said, \"I have never had my troops rally to fix something faster.\" So appropriate use of feelings is something most people don't know how to do. They don't even know how to access the feeling. I told this particular anecdote about anger being a secondary emotion at a very big workshop a number of months ago, and a woman walked up to me and said, \"Wow, thank you so much. I've never understood that my husband Carries so much fear and so much hurt because he only ever leads with anger. It never even occurred to me something else might be going on.\" And anger is a distancing emotion, whereas hurt, fear, sadness, loneliness, happiness, joy are all connecting emotions. So those are kinds of things people learn when they come through our programs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:47):\nOh, man, you're blowing my mind already. I can see why marriages are saved by a lot of these things you teach. That's a really profound point you're just making there that anger is a secondary emotion. Really what's going on is you're afraid or you're hurt. Is there anything more you can add there because this feels very important?\n\nCarole Robin (00:36:06):\nThat is normally what's going on, except we've all been socialized not to be vulnerable, especially in business and naming any of those other things makes us feel vulnerable. So somehow being angry doesn't make us feel vulnerable. That's the okay emotion, as long as you express it in an appropriate way, but it's a distancing emotion. What a disservice to everybody in business. What a disservice to professional learning, to not help people understand that anger is a distancing emotion and that there are other emotions that are appropriate and that are connecting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:46):\nThis connects so beautifully to your first point we talked about of being vulnerable and disclosing more and how I completely see how if you were just to share, I'm afraid of this, how that brings people closer to you and feels like they will trust you more versus you not sharing that.\n\nCarole Robin (00:37:03):\nRight. It connects to something else. You and I talked about one of the biggest gifts I think people get out of taking Touchy Feely or going through the Leaders in Tech program or even reading the book is that they learn that they hold some mental models, some beliefs and assumptions. If I do this, that will happen, or if I don't do this, this will happen. And those are beliefs and assumptions that we develop very early in our careers like I did. Whatever you do, you leave your feelings in the parking lot. And it served me really well initially. If I'd burst out crying two months into the job, I'd have never ended up running a $50 million region and then it over served me, and then it cost me because I never had a reason to update it.\n\n(00:37:56):\nBecause I never realized I was paying a cost for continuing to hold that belief that drove my behaviors. And mental models, then we developed them very early and they're grooved and we need new experiences in order to even believe that they're maybe subject to testing. Gee, I will forever be grateful to this fellow who said, \"Oh my God, are you human after all?\" I was like, how did this ever happen that I became seen as not human? Again, we go back to some of the stuff we talked about earlier, which is that leaders, if a leader doesn't show up with a willingness to update their mental models and their beliefs, they're certainly not going to inspire anybody else to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:59):\nI'm glad you got here because this is exactly where I was going to go next, is this mental model challenge we run into where we develop these mental models early on and then they end up hurting us later in life. Are there common mental models people have that hurt them as they grow? Or is it very particular independent on people's experience?\n\nCarole Robin (00:39:17):\nI mean, there are some that are pretty tried and true. I mean, the first one is, if I tell you more about me, you'll take advantage of me. Or if I am vulnerable with you or disclosing, you'll think I'm weak. And inevitably, somebody has had a time in their life where that has been true, and maybe it was true a lot, but then they decide that's the only outcome that's ever possible as opposed to part of growing up and becoming more mature is differentiating and being more discretionary in who we open up to and how we open up to them. It's like I have a colleague who often says, we have to think about these things as dials, not switches. It's not an all or I don't tell you everything or nothing. I don't share every single feeling I've got or none. It's a dial and you move it at 15% rate.\n\n(00:40:22):\nAnother mental model people hold, and this becomes a huge learning for people who go through our programs, is people think if I give you feedback, it's going to ruin the relationship. It's going to weaken the relationship. Whoa, that's really common. Even though everybody's always wanting, I want more feedback, I want to know how it can be better, but everybody believes that giving feedback is going to create a problem. And that's because most people have in fact been on the receiving end of feedback poorly given or they've given feedback in a not very good way. They've stepped in piles of doodoo, yes. And it does not mean feedback ruins relationships. It means feedback the way you've always seen it done or done. It ruins relationships pretty important. And then one of the things that we arm people with, I think one of the most powerful pieces of learning that people get is learning how to give feedback in a way that is going to build relationships as opposed to, and it's going to build a relationship.\n\n(00:41:29):\nIf you see that my reason for wanting to give it to you is that I'm invested in you and in us it's similarly, we hold mental models about expressing what we call pinches, which are just those little things that people do. Then we're just like, eh, I'm not going to make a big deal out of it. I'm not going to say anything, but mental model is, eh, it's a small thing. The problem is, if I'm doing something that's mildly irritating and you don't tell me, then what am I going to do?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):\nYou're doing it.\n\nCarole Robin (00:42:01):\nAnd then are you going to get less irritated or more irritated?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:02):\nMore irritated.\n\nCarole Robin (00:42:04):\nYeah. Now, if I get less irritated or it doesn't change, then you're right. I shouldn't say anything. But if I have the wherewithal to notice, this is why we talk about two antenna, which I'll come back to notice that I'm getting more and more activated, more and more irritated, then it's really important for me to say something. And by the way, address it while it's still small and then it won't get big. That's why we call it talk about a pinch before it becomes a crunch, and then it becomes a much bigger deal. But most of the time we say it's not worth it. So I always tell students, okay, substitute the pronoun, substitute the word it for I, you, we. I'm not worth it, you're not worth it. We're not worth it. And then ask yourself again whether it's worth raising.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by the a16z Podcast. Every week on this podcast, you get to hear from product leaders and growth experts from some of the world's most impactful companies, whether it's Airbnb, Slack, Figma, or Stripe. But what will the next wave of companies look like? One firm might have a clue, and recent Horowitz invested in all four of the companies I just mentioned and their flagship podcast, the a16z Podcast features conversations with the very founders and technologists shaping our future. Recent episodes feature folks like Marc Andreessen, longtime builders like Adam D'Angelo from Quora and Mark Pincus from Zynga, even some voices from the government like the CIA's first-ever chief technology officer, Nand Mulchandani. From drones to DNA to deep learning, you can eavesdrop on the future with the a16z Podcast. I want to talk about how to give feedback well, but I think it might be helpful to talk about this concept that you call the three realities and the net, because I think that sets up a lot of this.\n\nCarole Robin (00:44:00):\nYeah. And in fact, it is fundamental to giving feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):\nWell, awesome.\n\nCarole Robin (00:44:04):\nSo they're very related. You were right on the money. And you know what, let me just take a moment and talk. I mentioned the two antennae, and this is in the book, but we're all equipped with two antennae. One is tracking what's going on for me, my internal antenna. The other one is trying to pick up signals on what might be going on for you. And first of all, recognizing those two antennae exist. Second of all, learning how to hone our ability to pick up subtler and subtler signals make us more interpersonally competent. That's also why I'm a big believer in meditation and awareness. So, anyway, if we now fast-forward to your question about how to give feedback well, which has to do with understanding the three realities. It starts with in any exchange between two people, there are three realities. There is my intent, how I see the world, my background, my history, there is what I do or say or don't do, verbal or nonverbal.\n\n(00:45:09):\nSo my reality is reality number one, my behavior, verbal or nonverbal is reality number two. And whatever happens on your end is reality. Number three, the impact of what I've said or done, how you see things, your background. So there's these three distinct realities. And the trouble we get into when we don't recognize that those three realities exist is we don't understand that we are only privy to two out of the three. So I know what's going on for me, and I know what I did. I have no idea what happened on your end. You know what I did and how it impacted you. So your two are... The only one we share is the one in the middle in common, the behaviors right now, we draw a metaphorical net between reality number one and reality number two to help people understand. And anybody who's ever taken Touchy Feely in no matter which context knows the saying, \"Stay on your side of the net.\"\n\n(00:46:28):\nMeaning stick with the two realities you know because we get in trouble the minute we start thinking we know the other person's reality. Right? So I've told this anecdote many times, it might even be in the book, but I come home... I'm sorry, my husband comes home after a very long day in the valley. He was an executive. I've got two little kids, infant and a 2-year-old. I've been waiting for him to come home. I come running into the front room. In those days, by the way, we still had newspapers. He's reading the newspaper and I say, \"Oh my God. Oh my God, you're home. I can't wait until I tell you what happened tonight. I can't believe what happened. Why are we living in Palo Alto, Jesus Christ? I don't want to raise kids in Palo Alto. It's a terrible town. I wish that new nursery school, it hasn't even opened. It's already closed. Oh my God.\"\n\n(00:47:18):\nAnd then he says, \"mm-hmm, great. \"So then I say, you're not listening. And by the way, people have been taught iMessages, I feel that you're not listening is exactly the same thing, it doesn't have a single feeling word in it. I don't know whether he was listening or not. I'm over the net. I'm in his court unless I'm in his head. I don't know whether he was listening or not. But then he says, yeah, I was listening. You're all worked up. You went to that new nursery school. Actually it's more like this. Yeah, you're all worked up and you went to that new nursery school hasn't even opened. You're all worked up. Now I get a little bit more activated and I say, \"How can you not care?\" First of all, he didn't say, I don't care, did he? I don't know whether he cares or not. And by the way, \"How can you be so insensitive?\"\n\n(00:48:13):\nAnd I feel that you don't care and I feel you're being insensitive are not feelings. They're attributions and imputed motives, and that's where we make our biggest mistakes when it comes to feedback. And what that does is it makes the other person defensive. So calling my husband insensitive is the most insensitive thing in the world because he's one of the most sensitive people on the planet. So it wasn't until I learned to stay on my side of the net and say, so when I speak and I'm all worked up about something and the only thing I get back from you are either a grunt or an affectless repetition of what I just said, that's reality number two, anybody watching the video would say, that's what happened, I don't feel heard. He can't say, yeah, you do. And when I don't feel heard, I feel hurt and I feel distanced.\n\n(00:49:11):\nAnd the reason I'm telling you that is because I can't be here for you in the way I want to be when I feel that way. So the formula is when you do insert behavior, I feel pull out the vocabulary of feelings and I'm telling you this because, or I'm hoping the outcome of you knowing this is. And so then what happened is he said, \"Well, if you want my undivided attention, then you've got to give me some time to unwind when I get home.\" What a reasonable request. I said, \"Well, how much time do you need?\" He said, \"I don't know, half an hour.\" \"I was like, half an hour?\" I've been counting the minutes. How about five minutes? We settled on 15. And by the way, that is the purpose of feedback. When it's constructive feedback, move into a problem-solving conversation, don't change the other person. Move into behaviors that will work better for both of you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:14):\nAmazing. And this structure, so the structure you just shared, and this is similar to nonviolent communication structure?\n\nCarole Robin (00:50:14):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:21):\nOkay, cool.\n\nCarole Robin (00:50:21):\nIt is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:22):\nSo there's books people can read on this-\n\nCarole Robin (00:50:23):\nRight. Ours came before, but that's okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):\nOh, wow. Okay. Good to know.\n\nCarole Robin (00:50:30):\nI will say anything that spreads the word and anything that helps people learn how to engage with each other in ways that build relationship, I'm all for.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):\nI love that attitude. Okay, so the structure again is just when you do some behavior, I feel an emotion. By the way, is there a flyer or handout? I think the book has these of just emotions. Okay, cool. And feelings.\n\nCarole Robin (00:50:58):\nThe vocabulary of feelings is an appendix in the book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nOkay, great.\n\nCarole Robin (00:51:02):\nAs is the formula.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:04):\nAmazing. Okay, great. So by the book, if you want to get really good at this stuff, is there anything online we can point people to, or?\n\nCarole Robin (00:51:10):\nWe got a picture of the... I'll send you a couple of slides.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:14):\nPerfect.\n\nCarole Robin (00:51:16):\nAnd then you can just say, here are the slides.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:17):\nAmazing. So we'll link to that in the show notes. And as you talk through all of these lessons and pieces of advice, it makes so much sense why this is something you need to do. Because I imagine what's happening in the class here is you do this with someone and then you hear the reality and it often surprises you. Right?\n\nCarole Robin (00:51:36):\nExactly. Because often we say it takes two to know one, I don't know what impact I'm having on you until you tell me. And I have to be willing to be a little vulnerable to ask. And if we go back to that first activity that you asked me to describe way at the beginning, then we put them back in pairs and we say, okay, now that you've learned a little bit about feedback, tell your partner what they did that made it easier for you to disclose more and be more willing to be more vulnerable and/or what they did that made it a little harder. And right there in the moment, you learned something about yourself that you might never have known. Somebody says, you looked away as I was talking, you might not have even known you did that. You looked at your watch. And I love this.\n\n(00:52:34):\nOne of my greatest moments when I was teaching was that I asked a question. I was teaching in a big lecture hall at the law school, and they didn't have any clocks on the wall. And I asked a question and a student began answering, and I just glanced at my watch just because I was trying to figure out where I was in terms of when I had to wrap up. And he walked up to me after class and he said, \"Professor, I felt disrespected when you looked at your watch while I was answering,\" I hugged him. Well, first I asked him if it was okay, \"Is it okay if I hug you?\" And then I hugged him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:12):\nAnd I love how so much of this is like, we never get this feedback in real life. No one ever tells us this thing you did is distracting them, annoying them, making them feel like they're not being heard.\n\nCarole Robin (00:53:22):\nAnd then guess what? Then he leaves and then somebody says, how was that? He says, oh, she's really disrespectful. And then pretty soon nobody's ever even been there. But my reputation is that I don't respect students. That's how stuff gets out of control.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:36):\nYeah. And you wish people would tell you, right? Everybody wants this, but it's so hard and uncomfortable to tell anyone negative feedback.\n\nCarole Robin (00:53:45):\nWhich by the way, I never used the word negative when it comes to feedback.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:48):\nOkay. Okay.\n\nCarole Robin (00:53:50):\nSo feedback is either constructive or complimentary. Constructive feedback is there's something you're doing that is problematic, and the purpose of it is let's move to a problem solving conversation like with Andy and me. The purpose of complimentary feedback is, wow, that's the third time you've handed in that report early and completely, and you even went above and beyond and did this and this. I can't tell you how much I appreciate that, how lucky I feel that you work for me. And if I'm telling you this, because if there's ever something that you want that we're not giving you, I want to make sure you know that I want to talk about it. By the way, same formula. Now compare that to nice job, thanks, right? All feedback is data. So all feedback is positive. More data is always better than less data.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:46):\nI agree. That's a great lesson there. To maybe make this even more practical for listeners that are maybe working on a product and say they have to give feedback in a product design or to a colleague who did something wrong. Is there an example that you could share of just in the workplace.\n\nCarole Robin (00:55:03):\nI'm glad you asked that, because first of all, we're not talking about performance feedback and we're not necessarily talking about feedback on a task. What we're talking about is interpersonal feedback. And the reason it's so important is that if you don't take care of that, then that other feedback becomes unresolved. When you leave the interpersonal stuff unresolved, then the other feedback doesn't go well because the real problem is that I'm still pissed off that you never answered my phone call. So now I'm going to make it all about how this feature really is never going to work. Here's an example. Somebody walks into... A manager or a team leader or whatever, walks into a room meeting, starts a meeting by say, so I want to make sure we hear from everybody. I want to make sure that we have a very full conversation.\n\n(00:55:58):\nI want to talk about X. And now let's say that I start to say something and before I have finished, he says, yeah, and the other thing we should talk about is blah, blah. And then a little later a similar thing happens. I start to suggest that there's another way to look at this and he turns back to somebody else, what somebody else had said and never says anything in response to what I just said. And I'm being very specific here, very behaviorally specific. And then after a while, what happens to me is I feel less and less inclined to offer up anything. Now, maybe he doesn't care, but if he cares because he started by think he wanted to hear from everybody, then I'm not being very caring if I don't tell him what the impact was of his behavior. So I don't call him out in the middle of the meeting because I don't want to embarrass him, but I might go to his office later and say, \"So, John, do you have a few minutes?\" I have an observation.\n\n(00:57:07):\nI've got something that I experienced that you might want to know. \"Sure, Carole.\" So when I started to say x, you did y. When I started to say z, you did it. I said, and when that you started the meeting by saying you want to hear from everybody. When that happened, I felt less and less... I felt shut down, and I felt less and less inclined to offer up my opinion. Maybe that's okay, but I wondered whether you knew that that was the impact. And I'm telling you, because as far as I am concerned, in that meeting, you did not accomplish your stated desire. Your desired outcome was to hear from everybody. And after a while, I just gave up trying to give you my...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:52):\nWell, it's like you need to solve these pinches as you described early, because all of this comes back to these are relationships, they matter because that's the way we get everything done. And if you just ignore these things, your relationship's going to be hurt. You're not going to be able to accomplish the things you want to accomplish. It's almost like something you need to do even though it feels hard.\n\nCarole Robin (00:58:14):\nAbsolutely. And that's why I say that feedback builds relationships because by the way, if I'm doing something that I'm, I wish I hadn't done, it's not that I'm going to be like, \"Oh yeah, I'm so glad I did that.\" But if I recognize that it would've been easier for you not to say anything because it would've been more comfortable, but because you cared about me, you actually said something to me, that talk about something that builds relationship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):\nComing back to the antenna as you described feels like one of the most important skills you teach people is to build this antenna both of yourself, which is you could to think is easier, but maybe often not, but also understanding how the other person feels. And you have this concept of the art of inquiry and how powerful that is. Can you just talk about what that is?\n\nCarole Robin (00:59:06):\nOh, yeah. I'm glad you brought that up, because inquiry is a fundamental component of strong interpersonal relationships for a couple of reasons. And first of all, let's stop and note, inquiry comes the root of the word inquiry is quest. Quest means to be in search of and not knowing what you're going to find, not the way most people think about questions and inquiries. Most of the time people ask a question to confirm a hypothesis. \"Don't you think you're just trying to discredit John by doing that?\" That's not inquiry. \"Don't you think you'd just be better off letting that go?\" That's not inquiry. And by the way, another thing to note in artful inquiry, first of all, you have to suspend judgment. You cannot be curious if you've already decided you know what's going on someone else. You can always go back to being judgmental, but you got to suspend it long enough to see if there's something for you to learn.\n\n(01:00:12):\nAnd then the way you ask the question matters, questions that can be answered with yes or no are typically limiting questions and aren't going to be very productive. Questions that start with why, why did you do that? Are going to make me defensive? Or worse, why are you crying? Well, is that going to make me want to tell you more about why I am upset or why are you upset? Right away I'm going to go into, \"Oh no, I'm not upset. It's not a big deal.\" Or I'm going to go into a place that's not necessarily very productive because this reminds me of how my mother always scolded me. Neither one is going to be very productive. So questions that start with what? What's this about? What's going on? Where is this manifesting? When did you see this happen last? How might we go about unpacking what's going on? Where is this happening most? When, where, how, stay away from why. And it's a whole art.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):\nSomething else you teach people and you're big on is that people can actually change themselves. I think a lot of people might feel like, I'm just not good at this. I'm not good at giving feedback. I'm not good at maybe asking questions. I'm just like, I don't know. Talk about what you found about the change people see and why it's actually possible and how.\n\nCarole Robin (01:01:35):\nWell, for starters, to any of your listeners, one of my very favorite authors is Carol Dweck who wrote a book called Mindset and you put a word yet at the end of any of those, I don't know how yet, I'm not like that yet, changes the meaning of the whole thing. And by the way, talk about updating a mental model, instant update of a mental model. And the other thing that I'll say is we are all capable of changing our behavior. We cannot change our personality. We are born wired with personalities. I am very outgoing and extroverted as might come as a shock to all of you. And you know what? When I overdo it, I suck all the oxygen out of the room and one of the behaviors I had to learn, and it takes discipline to engage in was zipping it a little more so that others could speak up more.\n\n(01:02:40):\nAnd my incentive was that I actually really wanted to learn more about what was going on for them and I wasn't going to learn anything unless I shut up long enough for them to tell me. So behavior is something we all have control over. Now when I give somebody feedback and they tell me, well, I can't do that. If I've asked them to change a behavior, then I'll say, I'm sorry, I don't think I can accept I can't. I will accept I don't want to or I don't have it, but I don't have to accept I can't. So I'd just like you to own the fact that it's a choice that you're making.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:25):\nKind of along those lines, something, I don't know if this is from your book, but I saw somewhere you said that it's possible to say almost anything to almost anyone if you have the necessary skills. How do people build these skills? I know we talked about a lot of this through the structure focusing on your side of the net, but just how do you avoid people getting defensive?\n\nCarole Robin (01:03:43):\nFirst of all, let's make sure that we point out that what we're doing here is we're shifting probabilities of success, we're not guaranteeing anything. And let's say that you do your best and you stay on your side of the net and you give somebody feedback and they go bonkers and they call you all kinds of names and they write... Now there's an opportunity to learn something else that everybody learns in these programs, which is called repair. How do you repair when something goes sideways? Because no matter how good you are, no matter how skilled you get, no matter what your intent was, sometimes it won't work. And then you've got to know how to repair. And that's why, remember I told you that our facilitators have a unique set of skills? And that's because they have to allow messes to happen otherwise nobody's going to learn how to repair. And repair often goes back to some of what we've already talked about. Let's start with I come in the kitchen, my husband's struggling. I say to him, \"Can I help you with that?\" He says, \"Don't tell me what to do.\"\n\n(01:05:04):\nI'm sure none of your listeners can relate to this story. And I say, instead of, \"I wasn't trying to tell you what to do, I was just trying to be helpful. What a kind of way to respond to my offering help is that?\" I say, \"What did you hear me say?\" One of the most powerful things you can do when somebody responds in a way that feels very unexpected and out of whack with what you just said is go back to, \"What did you hear me say?\" Because nine times out of 10 what they heard is not what you said. He said, \"I heard you say I didn't know what I was doing.\" Now, by the way, it didn't matter. That's not what I said. And I didn't say, that's not what I said. I said, \"Wow, really glad I asked, because now that I understand that that's what you heard, I understand why you reacted the way you did.\" And I said, \"Let me try it again.\"\n\n(01:06:04):\nOne of the ways that I show somebody that I love them is I offer to help and what would you like me to do if in a situation like this when I see you struggling? He says, \"Wait for me to ask.\" And that was 25 years ago, and that has served us very well because we've been married 37 years, 39 years. And if we go back to feedback, you give somebody feedback, they get super defensive. By the way, net jumping invites net jumping, so they're likely to net jump too. And by the way, the minute you label somebody or you're over the net. In fact you sent me something that was really interesting that I wanted to find here because you said \"Nobody is born with genes for being rude or self-involved.\" Well, guess what?\n\n(01:06:56):\nRude and self-involved are labels that is not behaviorally specific. So calling somebody rude or self-involved is just going to make them defensive. But saying, I was interrupted three times, and I'm telling you this because you said you wanted to hear my opinion and I just thought you should know that I was put off by being interrupted, much less likely to incite defensiveness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):\nAbsolutely. Just hearing what actually happened, staying on your side of the net.\n\nCarole Robin (01:07:38):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):\nSo again, this always comes back to I could see this being so effective doing this in a class versus just listening to us and like, okay, I'm going to start staying in my side of the net and I'm going to prepare relationships. Are there any other examples of exercises you do in the class that might be helpful to people just to hear how you learn some of these things?\n\nCarole Robin (01:07:57):\nEvery chapter in the book has a section at the end called Deepen Your Learning and those deep in your learning sections, every single one of them has a suggested activity, something you can go do, and some of those come from some of the things we do in the classroom. So that's one place to start in terms of trying to find very tactical and practical ways of applying some of this. The other thing that we often do, I often do in leaders in Tech, I used to do this less at Stanford because they did a lot of this in their T groups and they were actually in real time with each other putting everything they were learning to use. But sometimes with my execs in Leaders in Tech, I will, for example, put them in a trio and I will say to you, so Lenny, I want you to think of somebody who you would like to give feedback to and I want you to tell me what's the behavior they're engaging in?\n\n(01:09:04):\nHow does it make you feel? What would be behind you wanting to tell them? What would be your desired outcome to the conversation? Then I become you, you become your difficult person because you know them and I don't, and we role play because you've now told me what you need, what you want, what's going on for you, and then you have to play your difficult person as well as you can. The third person's usually the observer who pinch hits and says, \"Carole, I think that was over the net.\" \"Carole, I don't think that was a behavior.\" And by the way, we say, I feel insert feeling, nine times out of 10 people say, I feel that, or I feel like, I feel that you don't care is not a feeling.\n\n(01:09:56):\nI feel like it doesn't matter, is not a feeling. I feel that you're not committed is not a feeling. In fact, they're all over the net. You're almost guaranteed to be over the net when you start I feel and put in like or that, guaranteed. Very easy hack. I feel pull up vocabulary feeling, you can't say grammatically correctly. I feel that sad or I feel that angry, or I feel that irritated or I feel like disappointed, doesn't work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:28):\nThis is amazing marriage advice going to, I need to remember these things.\n\nCarole Robin (01:10:34):\nYeah. Many married couples have bought the book together and read it together actually, which is cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):\nThere's a few other things I want to touch on that I love. One is a tip that you share. You call it advise hinders relationships.\n\nCarole Robin (01:10:49):\nOh, I'm really glad you asked me about that because two things, a couple of things. First of all, leaders often believe this is another mental model that they have to have all the answers, and that is actually a pretty, it's not a very productive mental model or belief because first of all, puts a huge amount of pressure on the leader. Now suddenly I always have to know and what happens when I don't know. Second of all, I believe a leader's job is to ensure the best answer is found. It doesn't matter whether it comes from me or anywhere else in the organization. It also allows for the possibility that somebody else may have a better answer than me. And a really, really good solution has been squelched and never surfaced because people are afraid to say, well, I see it a little differently. What if we did this?\n\n(01:11:50):\nWe had a or disaster as a result of that. The other thing about advice is that it creates even bigger power differentials between people. So if you're the leader or you're in the higher power position to start with, then giving me advice is only going to make me feel even lower power as opposed to, well, let's think about this together. Let's be thought partners. Often when we give advice, it's a good thing to stop yourself and ask yourself, \"Who am I doing this for? Am I doing this for me so that I can puff myself up with everything I know or am I doing it for you because this is really going to help you and make you better?\"\n\n(01:12:34):\nNine times out of 10, being a thought partner as you explore the various options and coming to your own solution is both going to help you develop more, and then you're not going to have to come ask me again if the only time you ever learn is when you come ask me and you don't go through any of the work or figuring out how I got to that answer, well, then I've just made more work for myself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:03):\nThere's this great Harvard Business Review post I just read about monkeys on your back. Have you heard of this?\n\nCarole Robin (01:13:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:09):\nYeah. Where basically as a manager, people are always trying to put monkeys on your back to have you solve their problem, and your job as a manager is to keep the monkeys on their own backs and help them.\n\nCarole Robin (01:13:19):\nYes, and I'm glad you brought that up because people then have become so used to the quick shortcut is you'll just give me the answer. First of all, you have enabled powerlessness. You certainly haven't helped them learn and grow. If you at all think your job as a manager is to at least sometimes do that, and sometimes people will say, \"Can't you just give me the answer?\" And then I always just say, I could and here's why I'm not going to because I don't think that'll serve you because that's not my job. My job isn't just to give you the answers. My job is to turn you into somebody who eventually will just know what the right answer is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:03):\nBut just give me the answer. Does this apply to friendships also? I know often people come to you as a friend, I need some advice on this. Does this apply as well? Often try not to give advice, or is it a different dynamic there?\n\nCarole Robin (01:14:20):\nWell, some of the same power differential can happen. I think chapter four in the book is about two guys who were good friends and one of them is always trying to give advice to the other one. First of all, it can be annoying if you didn't ask for it. So I certainly wouldn't give advice unless somebody asked for it, and I might not immediately jump to the advice, I might want to explore. What have you already thought about? How have you already approached it? Where are you stuck? I might ask more questions before I immediately go into advice because by the way, nine times out of 10, you end up giving advice on something that's not really what the person was worried about or wondering about. So first go to inquiry. You can always come back to advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:21):\nI find that every time I try to resist or I make myself resist giving advice and instead ask more questions, every single time, I realized, okay, I had no idea what they were actually looking for or what was going on, but it's hard to do. I'm just like, here, I just want to tell you, here's the thing.\n\nCarole Robin (01:15:39):\nTotally. Because you know what? It's another mental model. I serve you best by just giving you advice when you ask for it, that's the loving, caring thing to do. Well, it's a mental model. Try testing it and seeing whether or not it really turns out to still be valid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:58):\nAnd so maybe the more correct mental model is how would you describe it that it's often better to help the person figure it out, or is it that you just often don't actually understand what's going on?\n\nCarole Robin (01:16:09):\nThe best thing to do first go to inquiry. Because by the way, I also, as you might imagine, I tend to err very much on the side of transparency, and so I'll say, man, I got all kinds of things going on in my head about what I think would be great for you to do, and I'm going to resist that because I, first of all may or may not hit the mark, so I'd really like to understand more. And second of all, I wonder if in the end be even more fruitful if we explore different things together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:46):\nJust a few more questions. One is, so we have this segment on the podcast that I call Failure Corner, where people share failure in their career and what they learn from it, and you have a really constructive way of thinking about failure with this great acronym. Can you talk about that?\n\nCarole Robin (01:17:02):\nThe acronym is A-F-O-G, another F-ing... I don't know your audience well enough. Don't want to offend anybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:11):\nGo for it. If you feel like-\n\nCarole Robin (01:17:12):\nAnother Fucking Opportunity for Growth. Every student who ever took a class from me, every client who I have ever coached, every participant who's ever gone through Leaders in Tech knows that acronym because my question, when something has gone wrong or a person has experienced a failure, my first question is always, so what did you learn? Because there's always a lesson, and then usually what follows is, yeah, you just had an AFOG. And as a person who's had a lot of AFOGs throughout my life, it puts it in perspective. I like the perspective that it offers, so it's not the end of the world. Sometimes AFOGs are more painful than others. Some AFOGs take longer to recover from than others. Most of the time they're recoverable, particularly if I've invested the energy in really unpacking what there was for me to be to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:27):\nYeah. So the advice here is when something goes wrong, when you fail, think of it as another fucking opportunity for growth, AFOG.\n\nCarole Robin (01:18:27):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:27):\nOkay.\n\nCarole Robin (01:18:35):\nThat's exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:37):\nTo even go full circle to where we started building exceptional relationships, building robust relationships. In the book, you have this checklist of just how to build an exceptional relationship. I know you don't have all this in your head, whatever.\n\nCarole Robin (01:18:49):\nActually I probably do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:50):\nYou probably do. What's on this list of just things you can do to build exceptional relationships?\n\nCarole Robin (01:18:57):\nWell, you can go back to the fact that there are six characteristics of exceptional relationships, and actually those are the characteristics that are present as a relationship is moving down this continuum that we've talked about. And the more each of these exists, the farther down the continuum you are. So the first one is I'm better known by you, and of course there's skills involved in how do I allow myself to be known. The second one is, I know you better and there's skills involved in getting to know you better. We've talked about many of them. The third one is we trust that our disclosures won't be used against us. The fourth one is we can be honest with each other. That's where all the feedback comes in. The fifth one is we know how to resolve conflict productively, and the sixth one is we are committed to each other's learning and growth. And when all six of those are present to varying degrees, you've moved farther down the continuum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:00):\nYou wrote somewhere that you know your relationship has become exceptional when you and the other person don't have to hide important parts of yourself and can deal with major issues even if it feels scary.\n\nCarole Robin (01:20:10):\nYep. I did write that somewhere and I stand by that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:15):\nIf you zoom out from all of your work and teachings, are there any overarching themes that continue to come up that you think are important for people to take away from this conversation?\n\nCarole Robin (01:20:28):\nWell, for starters, we're all works in progress, which means every relationship in your life is a work in progress. Because if I'm a work in progress and you're a work in progress, then by default so is our relationship. And so remembering that what worked with you two years ago may or may not work for you now because we're different people. So I think that's a biggie. I think stopping and becoming aware of what are the mental models that are driving these choices that I'm making, every behavior has in front of it a choice. If we stop long enough to become aware of it and in front of every choice, there's some belief. So I try to march myself back from the result to the behavior, to the choice, to the mental model that drove it or the skill or lack of skill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:36):\nSomething that we didn't talk about at the beginning of this because it might distract people, but you've been dealing with Long COVID for almost two years at this point. Where are you at with it? How are things going and is there anything you've learned from this unexpected part of your life?\n\nCarole Robin (01:21:54):\nIt's given me an opportunity to live a lot of what I teach. So I always taught in my leadership classes that the worst thing a leader can do is make an organization too dependent on them. If you care about building a sustainable long-term organization and a legacy, then it behooves you not to make the organization very dependent on you. So over the last 20 months, I have slowly and surely given more and more of my responsibilities to more and more members of the team to the point where hot off the press, I'm about to become only an advisor and step out of really all of my operational duties probably by the end of this year. Now, there was a point at which I was like, and oh my God, what happens if I get better suddenly? Because people do get better, and one of my very wise children said, \"Mom, I'm pretty sure that if you suddenly get a lot better, they'll be happy to give you lots of stuff to do.\" So, anyway, that's one of probably the biggest lessons, and also it goes with a lesson around acceptance and accept.\n\n(01:23:25):\nI wrote a LinkedIn, I think a LinkedIn, not a blog paper, one of those LinkedIn things. If you go to my website, you can look at things I've written, I think it was called Long COVID and Acceptance or something like that. But it's about how acceptance is not resignation, and it's about having an opportunity to rethink a lot of things and reframe beliefs. And I think the last thing I'll say about it is that it has made me a much more empathetic person, and I think one of the really interesting and important things to learn and have always continued to learn in doing the interpersonal dynamics work we do is you never know what's going on for someone else.\n\n(01:24:26):\nAnd one of the worst things we can do is assume we know what's going on for someone else, and it's really easy to get really... I think I said this before we even got online, which is in the absence of data, people make shit up. So if you don't want people to make shit up about you, you're better off disclosing more because then you'll have more control over your self-definition, not less. People like to make sense of things. They will connect dots however way they want to unless you help them connect them the way you want them to. Another case for self-disclosure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:04):\nWell, Carole, I'm incredibly thankful that you made time for this. I know it's not the easiest thing to do these things.\n\nCarole Robin (01:25:10):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:11):\nTo remind people where to find Leaders in Tech and how to apply, tell them the website and who it's for specifically, so the right people go there. And then finally, just how can listeners be useful to you as a final question?\n\nCarole Robin (01:25:23):\nI'm on LinkedIn. You won't be able to just connect with me. I've got one of those things where you can't just connect. You need my email address so you can put my email address in the notes. Anybody's more than welcome... But if you connect with me, please don't try to sell me anything. The only reason it's set up that way is that too many people were trying to sell me too many things and I got exasperated. That's the only reason they wanted to connect. So I'm just going to trust that you'll reach out to me because you want to connect with me because you're interested in my work and that you'll also know and be sensitive to the fact that I have Long COVID. So my capacity to respond to messages and emails is definitely impacted. I used to be one of those you could count on me to always respond. By the way, another learning. It turns out everybody didn't write me off just because I couldn't respond to them right away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:14):\nThat is a really great learning. Okay. And then the website for people that may want to apply and the applications are still open basically by the time this is leadersintech.org?\n\nCarole Robin (01:26:23):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:24):\nAmazing. Carole, you are wonderful. Thank you so much for making time for this. Thank you for being here.\n\nCarole Robin (01:26:32):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:33):\nBye everyone.

What do these companies have in common? Casey Winters, Casey has worked with and advised more consumer companies on their product and growth strategy than anyone in the world. He's also very generous with his time and often sets time aside to help founders and product leaders. I always learned so much talking to Casey, and I'm excited for you to hear this episode. In our chat we covered Casey's advice on making trade offs as a product leader, justifying non-sexy product investments, the spectrum of product people and how to level up your skills, new growth trends and tactics that he's seeing, when to focus on growth, and a bunch of advice on growth strategy, and so many other things. As a bonus, we're going to be doing a live AMA with Casey in my newsletter Slack community on August 5th at 10:00 AM Pacific time, so if you'd like to ask Casey any questions, make sure to get there. Until then enjoy this episode with Casey Winters. Hey Casey Winters, what do you love about Coda?\n\nCasey Winters (01:19):\nCoda's a company that's actually near and dear to my heart because I got to work on their launch when I was at Greylock. But in terms of what I love about it, I love loops and Coda has some of the coolest and most useful content loops I've seen. How the loop works is someone can create a Coda and share it publicly for the world. This can be how you create LKRs, run annual planning, build your roadmap, whatever. Every one of those codas can then be easily copied and adapted to your organization without knowing who originally even wrote it, so they're embedding the sharing of best practices of scaling companies into their core product and growth loops, which is something I'm personally passionate about.\n\nLenny (01:56):\nI actually use Coda myself every day, it's kind of the center of my writing and podcasting operation. I use it for first drafts, to organize my content calendar, to plan each podcast episode, and so many more things. Coda's giving listeners of this podcast $1,000 in free credit off their first statement, just go to coda.io/lenny. That's coda.io/lenny.\n\n(02:22):\nThis episode is brought to you by Mixpanel, offering powerful self-serve product analytics.

I feel like every time that we chat, I leave with at least one new perspective that kind of blew my mind on product, or growth, or even just the world. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation mostly to selfishly extract as much knowledge out of your head as I can in the hour that we have together. And so with that welcome.\n\nCasey Winters (03:50):\nVery kind, happy to be here.\n\nLenny (03:52):\nYou've worked at so many iconic companies and worked with so many iconic companies. It almost boggles the mind just looking at your LinkedIn, trying to scroll through LinkedIn and you have to click on, see additional experiences. And there's just so many places you've worked, so many companies you've worked with. Could you just give listeners maybe a 10,000 foot view of your career arc through product and growth?\n\nCasey Winters (04:15):\nWell, I started my career as an analyst at apartments.com on the marketing side, so it was my job to measure every channel for effectiveness in driving leads. These are things like SEO, AdWords, affiliate marketing email, so once I got good at measuring that I naturally started working on optimizing those channels directly. And then I started going to do user research and understand how the product could be better so that we could convert leads better. And it was at that point that I got the feedback from the company that I was this weird marketing and product hybrid, and they didn't really know what to do with that, because those were two totally separate departments. It wasn't until I got to GrubHub and I was the 15th employee and they were like, dude, we don't care.\n\n(05:01):\nAs long as you grow how many people order food, I don't care if you work on marketing, I don't care if you change the product, do whatever we'll have results. And we now call these roles growth, but that term didn't exist at the time, so I basically worked on growing the demand side of that business from Series A to IPO. We ended up creating a product management function out of my team there, but for the first four years we didn't have product titles either. That was kind of a newer idea, also. It wasn't until I went to Pinterest that I was actually formally labeled a product person.\n\n(05:37):\nI ended up leading the growth product team there. We basically had to rebuild the growth model of the business to reignite growth, so I was there from 40 million MAU to 150 million MAU. And it was around that time that I started doing some more advising with Airbnb on the demand side, with Pocket. And then I went to a VC named Greylock Partners and worked with their companies on growth and scaling. And then I just independently started working as a full-time advisor with companies like Eventbrite, Tinder, Thumbtack, Canva. And after doing that for a couple years, Eventbrite opened this chief product officer role and they asked me to take it, so now I've been doing that for three years now.\n\nLenny (06:18):\nThat's an excellent segue to our next little segment that I want to get into, which is partly your CPO role and the work that you do there. And also touching a bit on a bit of the writing that you've done. You're currently a chief product officer at Eventbrite, which is a company that I love, I have so many friends there and they're all amazing, such a big fan of the company. And I know a lot of listeners are maybe thinking about becoming CPO someday as a goal.\n\nCasey Winters (06:18):\nYep.\n\nLenny (06:43):\nAnd so I thought it'd be cool to chat through some of the challenges that you're having and some of the things you've learned in the role.\n\nCasey Winters (06:49):\nSure.\n\nLenny (06:50):\nCool.\n\nCasey Winters (06:50):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (06:51):\nI'll be more specific, so one of the things that you mentioned that you're working on is thinking about trade offs and being very explicit about trade offs you're making, communicating why you made certain trade offs and then just generally communicating that upward to executives and then across the company, so I'm curious just to hear what you've learned around how to communicate trade offs and internal communication?\n\nCasey Winters (07:11):\nYeah, one of the things I found, especially during the pandemic at Eventbrite, where we weren't obviously hiring a lot of people and we had lots of various issues come up, is that a lot of managers and leaders would just try to deal with issues on their own and not raise them or escalate them with me in particular. And some of these were really tough situations, so then later on, I'd ask why something went wrong or why we didn't achieve a goal. And I get some feedback from my team of like, Hey, you don't understand the situation. This is really impossible. There's all these things going wrong. And then I respond. Yeah, of course I don't understand this situation because you haven't told me about it. How am I supposed to evaluate things fairly if you don't let me know what's really going on, so these people on my team thought that being a leader was handling it the best they could given the circumstances when in many cases the right way is to escalate the issue so that perhaps I could help them change the circumstances, so the circumstances aren't as dire.\n\n(08:14):\nAnd if I can't change the circumstances, I'm at least aware of the circumstances and the explicit trade off we've made to deal with that situation. And then I can help communicate that better to others across the company, and I can help evaluate the results with the proper context and do it more fairly. I find that in general people just way under communicate upward inside of companies. And then they'll complain that executives are out of touch when they aren't telling executives what the executives need to know. Then when people inside a company do try to communicate upward a lot of times they're so in the weeds that as an executive, I just don't understand what they're saying. And then when I ask questions it's like as an exec, I'm asking a question in another language. It's like I don't know if you've ever seen Ocean's Twelve, but as a joke, they invite Matt Damon to this business meeting and they just talk in code as a prank on him.\n\n(09:14):\nAnd that's what a lot of people on my team feel sometimes when they're talking to the executives of like, I don't even understand what these questions mean. It's like you're speaking another language. One of the ways I try to frame it to my team is if you're not an executive, whatever you're working on, you're basically writing and telling a story. And when you talk to an exec about that story, you have to start with chapter one, which is what part of the company strategy are you working on? What metrics are you trying to improve? What assumptions are you making that are guiding what you're building? And I find that many times when non-executives are presenting to execs, they'll start on like chapter six, so even if that part of the story is right, it's like a good story. You haven't earned the right to tell that part of the story yet because you skipped the first five chapters. And I've definitely seen people with the opposite problem as well, which I call starting at the beginning of the time where you come into a meeting with the CEO or with the CFO or something.\n\n(10:20):\nAnd you basically spend the first 20 minutes, re-explaining the company strategy or who our customer is or something that everyone already knows. And then by the time you get to explaining new information, you've used up your allotted time, so I try to coach my team to be in the middle. Like don't start on chapter six of the story, but also don't start with a textbook on the English language either. You want to find the last point in your story, that would be completely obvious to the person you're telling the story to, and then go from there to things that would be less obvious, but that they can follow along with. And it's a lot of work to really dial that in across different types of people you're trying to communicate that story to because of course, upward communication isn't all that you're doing, right? You're trying to communicate that down to your team, to individual engineers and designers, and they're going to need to hear some very different things then say the CPO of the company, or the CEO of the company, so it's a challenge I see quite frequently.\n\nLenny (11:19):\nCan you talk a bit about how you actually coach PMs on this? Is this like in one-on-ones you revisit a presentation they gave that could have been better? Is it after a presentation, you pull them aside and talk through what they could have done better. How do you approach that?\n\nCasey Winters (11:33):\nWell, I think the best way to coach is actually to do it before the meeting, so I think there's a tendency in product management and product design to want to do meetings where there's kind of this big reveal and an aha to the audience. And it's kind of the opposite of how you want to handle most of these situations. You want to de-risk that meeting not make it a big success or fail moment, so there's a few things that I do. One is if there is a big presentation coming up or something like that, I try to run through it with the team, pretending to be the other members of the audience that are going to be there, so I'll say, okay, well, what the CFO's going to ask about here is X. And you want to answer that question before it gets asked. What Julia, our CEO is going to ask about is why, so you want to weave that into the early story and not wait for her to ask.\n\n(12:28):\nYou kind of role play the entire thing based on the different people that they're going to be communicating with. Something I commonly say is that executive communication is actually executives communication. You're communicating with individual executives that all have different styles and different concerns about the business or about the particular problem you're working on. And you want to anticipate that, and if you don't have enough experience say presenting to the CFO or the CEO, I as the chief product officer do, so I can impersonate them and help you understand what they're going to care most about. The other thing that I push a lot of my team to do is have pre-meetings with some of those key individuals, so that they're going to be less surprised in the meeting about what you're talking about, that you've gotten any major concerns brought to your attention before the big meeting.\n\n(13:18):\nAnd that helps de-risk how poorly a meeting like that can go, so definitely at the individual presentation level, doing that pre-meeting. What I'm working on a lot now is trying to have more of a scaled approach to training this type of upward communication. And what types of frameworks, what types of structure tend to work for Eventbrite and making sure that everyone on my team is just really well versed in that and comfortable in it because of course, confidence projection is a key part of these types of meetings as well.\n\nLenny (13:54):\nThis is such important advice that I think a lot of PMs don't recognize how important it is to prepare for important meetings like this. Just to give folks context, maybe that aren't doing this sort of thing when they're working at a larger company, how much time do you spend or an ICPM should spend on preparing for these things just to set a little bit of a reference point?\n\nCasey Winters (14:13):\nWell, it's an interesting question because I think different people have different styles on how they want to handle this. I'd say the way my brain works in these situations which I think is a little bit atypical, is I'm actually a little bit better if I am free forming a lot of elements and just speaking from confidence in areas I know versus specifically trying to lay out every exact bullet point I want to hit. I'm going to show up as more comfortable, I'm going to show up as more dynamic, and I'm going to be able to engage in a more thoughtful conversation, so for me, my approach to these sorts of things is I write a lot. I write a lot of notes. I write a lot of documents. And then in general, for any of these types of communications, I am just pulling from things I know deeply because I've written them down, I've thought a lot about them.\n\n(15:10):\nFor a lot of other people they really just need to spend a lot of time on prep to make sure they nail the communication they want to nail. And I found it requires a different amount of investment for different people on my team, so the point is not as much how much time you spend, it's how well do you really know the material, and how well do you really know what your audience is going to care about with that material so that you are prepared for every question you might get. I'll give an example from my Pinterest days, the primary way with which you interfaced on any key strategic topic was product review, right? You'd go in and you talk to Ben, our CEO and Jack our head of product. And Ben and Jack had very different styles of communication. Jack in particular would very early on ask a few different data questions to get context on the problem. And if you, as a product leader or an individual PM or an individual designer didn't know the answers to any of those, it cast doubt on the entire rest of that meeting.\n\n(16:17):\nBecause, the team wouldn't be confident that you had all the right context to understand the problem, so a lot of what I would coach my team on is, okay, I'm pretty confident Jack's going to ask this question, then this question, then this question. Based on the material I'm seeing from you, how well are you prepared to answer those questions? Different execs might be somewhat different in that regard, but if you haven't thought through all the questions that might be asked from the document that you're sharing or the presentation you're about to present, you're not prepared enough, right. You need to know the entire universe of how that meeting can go. And that may take you dozens of hours, it might take you three hours, but the most important thing is that you've asked what possible questions can be asked and am I prepared to answer all of those? Do I have all the data in front of me to answer all of those? But because if I don't the chances of the meeting you're having a negative outcome just increased dramatically.\n\nLenny (17:17):\nI imagine some people are listening to this and they're like, holy shit, I need to spend this much time on preparing for meetings like this, but in my experience, that's exactly what you do need to do to be successful. And so this is real good, real talk about how long it takes to prepare for important meetings like the ones you're talking about.\n\nCasey Winters (17:33):\nAbsolutely. I mean, for better or worse, the way that a lot of key decisions are made inside companies are through these types of forums and meetings. And it's an extremely high leverage piece of time for a product manager or a product designer in terms of how much impact they can have. And if you are under preparing for those sorts of things, the chances of you being able to have the type of impact you want, to have the type of career growth you want just go down dramatically. And I'm sure, you and I have definitely made mistakes in our career in important meetings in the past, but I think one of the things that I really try to do is learn from each one of those and make sure those types of issues wouldn't happen again. And now I feel like I have a pulse on, I know if I haven't done the work going into a meeting, that's going to make it have a more negative result.\n\n(18:26):\nAnd now I'm pretty accurate. And look sometimes you just didn't have enough time and it is what it is. But now I know, okay, I know I'm not quite prepared for this and it can go poorly as a result. And I know also when I've done the right prep and I'm ready for anything, whether it's a board meeting, or a meeting with the executive team, or a meeting with an external partner, right? And I think that's what you're trying to build as any sort of product leader, or PM, or product designer, or researcher, is that intuition of like I'm ready for this, I know everything that's going to come at me, I'm prepared for any eventual outcome. And if you're not, then probably the answer is spend more time to get ready.\n\nLenny (19:09):\nSpeaking of spending more time, another topic that you shared with me that you're thinking a lot about as a CPO is keeping the Eventbrite product simple while adding more and more functionality to make it more usable by more people and more use cases. And so I'd love to hear how you're approaching that because I know that's something every single product faces eventually assuming they keep growing, and survive, and keep adding more power.\n\nCasey Winters (19:34):\nYeah, Scott Belsky who's the chief product officer of Adobe. He has this concept of the product life cycle you're probably familiar with, but I'll explain it to your listeners, which is users flock to a simple product. The product takes users for granted and adds more features for power users and then users flock to the next simple product as a result. And I've done a lot of research and work on this problem. And I found that there are a few different design hacks, essentially that companies use to try to avoid this cycle. One is okay if you build out more complex functionality, un-bundle it over time, like Facebook Messenger, Uber Eats have done, right? At Pinterest, we did a heavy investment in progressive disclosure, which is let's hide a lot of the more complex functionality until we make sure our users learn the really critical functionality. And then we can open up more of the full suite of the product.\n\n(20:34):\nThen there's just proactive training. You can get on a video call with your customers or a phone call, much more common in enterprise, obviously, or you might have a custom UI that goes away over time. That's giving you the training wheels. You can also segment experiences based on different user types, so certain users might get a very simple user experience and then some users might get the more complex one, and there's different packages and interfaces that cleanly separate the two, maybe that more complex experience also bundles in training. What I found is that just none of these really worked that well for the Eventbrite scenario, because we have different types of event creators across every possible level of complexity and sophistication. We have people that are putting on their first event and they expect five people to show up. We have people putting on a hundred events per year that really know what they're doing.\n\n(21:32):\nAnd then users also shift from one of those categories to another over time. They can get more sophisticated as they build up their business, so segmentation doesn't really work that well. Progressive disclosure doesn't work that well either because in many of these cases, we never want certain types of users to find the more advanced stuff, it's just going to confuse them. We strive for this concept of what we call perceived simplicity, which is there are advanced features in the product and they are easily discoverable when you look for them, but they're effectively hidden if you're not looking for them. And of course the majority of users aren't going to ever look for them, so the advanced more complex areas of the product don't make the product harder to use for the majority who will never need that level of complexity. And there are areas where we do this well and areas where we're still working on getting better, but that's really our aspiration.\n\n(22:26):\nThe company that I feel like has always done the best job of this is WhatsApp, where at its core, it's a chat app and it's really good at being a chat app. But I remember when I went to Brazil, all of a sudden I started receiving voice messages and it was really easy to figure out how to use them and how to do them myself. When I needed to learn how to do video calls or phone calls, it would take less than a second to figure out how to use the more advanced stuff, but it's effectively kind of hidden if you're not looking for it. That's what we aspire to at Eventbrite. And in some cases we're doing well. And in some cases, we definitely have some work to do.\n\nLenny (22:59):\nIs there an example of a win in that direction in the Eventbrite product that you're proud of using this model or even something that's like, oh man, this is really broken?\n\nCasey Winters (23:08):\nYeah, we've definitely had some wins here on the marketing side of our products, so one of the bigger investments we've made recently is our creators do a lot of their own marketing to try to get people to come to their events and transact on Eventbrite in the process. But our event creators, they're not professional marketers, they try to figure these tools out, so we built a product that allows them to automate their Facebook advertising to get better results, supercharged by our data. And the product's working really well, but we found is that there are certain segments that, I want to geek out on this a little bit, right.\n\n(23:47):\nThey want to figure out all the different target segments and optimize their creative, and then there are many creators who just want it done for them. We've been able to build some interfaces where the default is super simple, we'll handle the targeting for you, we'll handle the creative and then, Hey, here's an on-ramp if you want to get a little bit more sophisticated and do more of this yourself, so that's an area where I wouldn't say we've perfected it, but we've now really understood those different types of users and a have easy pass for both of them to be successful, so I'm really happy with that.\n\nLenny (24:22):\nAwesome. Another topic that you wrote about that kind of touches on the stuff we were just talking about is justify non-sexy product improvements, things like stability, performance, developer velocity, things that as a PM leader, you're just like, no, no, no, let's just... The default is let's do that later, we got to hit our fricking metrics, we've got to drive growth. And you had some really interesting insights on how you think about justifying these sorts of things. And so I'd love to hear that from you?\n\nCasey Winters (24:49):\nThe idea is that some of the most impactful projects that product teams can work on at scale, not early stage startups per se, but at scale are the hardest to measure. And because of that, they just get chronically underfunded. It's that old adage, what gets measured gets managed, right? For things like user experience, or performance, or developer velocity, or just a product area that's deemed un-sexy, like growth used to be back in the day, I walk through some examples of a few tactics that work to get around this problem, building custom metrics to show the value, being able to run small tests that prove the worthwhile-ness of the investment, creating some team principles that make sure you don't ever kind of forget about these important elements that can hurt you in the long run. And also just how to use experiments to build buy-in at the broader level.\n\n(25:41):\nAnd one of the main takeaways besides some of those tactics in being successful here is that you have to get a team to buy-in to this. You can't really do a lot of this work alone, right? If you're a PM, you want to be approaching this from a well, my engineering manager and my design leader also bought in that we need to work on performance or we've all aligned that the user experience is not going in quite the direction we want, and we want to head some problems off that may not improve metrics today, but could certainly decline metrics tomorrow. And if you can get a small team, what two, three people aligned on the importance of something that's deemed un-sexy. It's a lot easier to start to build this game plan around metrics or running small tests or structuring OKRs to not only prioritize this work, but to show some really massive impact. Which could then get the rest of the company much more excited to make investments themselves.\n\nLenny (26:48):\nWhat I'm hearing is step one is just get your kind of peer leaders aligned behind something that may not obviously be something your leaders want you to do, is that right?\n\nCasey Winters (26:59):\nAbsolutely, yep.\n\nLenny (27:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Whimsical. When I asked product managers and designers on Twitter, what software do they use most? Whimsical is always one of the most mentioned products, and the users are fanatical. Whimsical is built for collaborative thinking, combining visual, text, and data canvases into one fluid medium. Distributed teams use Whimsical for workshops, white boarding, wire frames, user flows, and even feature specs. And that includes thousands of built in icons and a rich library of templates. See why product teams at leading companies call Whimsical a game changer, visit whimsical.com/lenny to have my own templates added to your account when you sign up, that's whimsical.com/lenny.\n\n(27:47):\nIs there anything else that you think is really valuable, powerful, effective in just getting folks to getting your leaders to basically go along with some that maybe isn't going to move metrics or is that the core of it?\n\nCasey Winters (27:57):\nWell, yeah. I mean, definitely it's hard when you can't create a metric that they can understand. I think the other area to think about is when you're an early stage company, everything you're doing is trying to drive upside, like trying to drive growth in some way, it could be short term or long term, but you're trying to drive real growth for the business. But then when you've actually built a real business, a lot of times people are still in that same mode, which is everything is trying to add more growth on top of what we've already got. But when you're at scale, you can actually lose what you've built, so trying to help whether it's executives or just your manager, understand that this thing we've got, whether it's a high conversion rate or good engagement on this feature, it could go away if we don't do these other things.\n\n(28:48):\nAnd here's what it would look like if that goes away, that can be incredibly powerful. I think we were fortunate at Pinterest in this regard, in that we were a fast growing startup that stopped growing due to some changes in the market related to Facebook. And then actually once we had switched to growing primarily through SEO, there was an algorithm change that severely impacted our growth at one point in time, so that helped the company build more intuition of like we're not guaranteed the gains from all the things we've built in the past. We need to do things to protect them and protecting what we've got actually is increasingly important once you build scale, because now you've built something really valuable already. And yes, we want to make it more valuable of course, but it's hard to make it more valuable if you're eroding some of the gains you've already built, so that's another element that I think can be pretty impactful.\n\nLenny (29:41):\nIn your post on this topic you have an awesome chart of product market fit over time, illustrating the point you just made that it doesn't last and you have to keep iterating to keep your product market fit like you're by default falling behind if you're not continuing to push there, right?\n\nCasey Winters (29:54):\nYeah. I think the concept is user expectations just continue to go up every day in terms of their expectations on user experience, on the value that they expect your product to provide, but also the competitive landscape in the market continues to get better. Yeah, if you're not continually pushing to make your product better, your user experience better, your latency better, then you're eventually not necessarily tomorrow, but maybe in a year, maybe in five years, you might find yourself fall out of product market fit entirely. And that's a really dangerous place to be, because then it's going to take a long time to figure that out and make adjustments. And then you probably have more technical debt to clean up, to be able to get back to where you need to be, where the market has reached in terms of expectations, so just doing work to make sure you never get in that situation is extremely valuable, in my opinion. It's something that I think a lot of teams forget about.\n\nLenny (30:54):\nI think you're going to create nightmares for a lot of founders listening to this right now.\n\nCasey Winters (30:59):\nThat's not the intention, but-\n\nLenny (31:02):\nNo, it's a kick in the butt. Another post that I definitely wanted to chat about. Maybe your SPST post, maybe I'm curious if there are others is around operations team, product ops and generally ops people.\n\nCasey Winters (31:12):\nYep.\n\nLenny (31:13):\nAnd this point that you made that ops is often a sign of inefficiency on a product team because in theory, a lot of the roles should be done by software, eventually. I'd love to unpack this and hear your take on this?\n\nCasey Winters (31:26):\nI think I originally got the idea for the post in that I had written another essay on MarTech. And how MarTech to be really successful, it's really got a target engineers more so than marketers. And that a lot of MarTech businesses just aren't very good businesses. And I think I got an invite to speak at a MarTech conference to a bunch of marketers about this post. And it's like, well, that sounds like a terrible idea. I'm basically telling a bunch of marketers that what they're investing in isn't that important, and that they're not the most important target customer. And I remember reading something about the conference that was like a conference for the growth of the marketing operations professional. And then I was like, oh no, that's not what I want in the industry at all. Like having marketing ops means you suck at marketing.\n\n(32:18):\nAnd obviously that's a bit of hyperbole. I'm not against the concept of a marketing ops role or a product ops role, we have a product ops team at Eventbrite, but as someone who ran a double digit million marketing budget at GrubHub without marketing ops, because we invested in automation and we invested in process, it scares me when the first tactic people go to is to add people to help scale. There's nothing wrong with people obviously, there's nothing wrong with operations people. The thing I have a problem with is normalizing ops as a distinct stable function where operations rules are amazing and how we utilize them at Eventbrite is their explicit job is to go find inefficiencies and build process or software to root out that inefficiency, so then they can go find other places to be more valuable. When you say, oh, their job is to do this manual process long term.\n\n(33:16):\nThat's where I get super concerned because you're not rooting out efficiency in how you build your company. And that's where I feel like a lot of this can go if you're not careful, Intercom has a really good blog post on this from a while back around their business operations team. And they basically up front in that post say the goal of business operations is to not exist, and I definitely very much agree with that. I think in general functional ops roles, whether it's product ops or marketing ops or whatever, they're a hack to deal with some sort of functional issue on your team. And it's totally okay to have functional issues. Startups are going to have functional issues all over the place, but if the way they deal with that functional issue is by building larger and larger operations teams and roles. That's basically exacerbating an inefficiency issue, a functional issue, it's not fixing it. It's a form of empire building and in general empire building is something I don't have a lot of tolerance for.\n\n(34:16):\nYou're making more of a function unable to operate without human intervention by saying the goal is to scale up marketing ops or product ops. Whereas what the goal should be is let's use our brains to run experiments, to make us more functional with less people. We're more efficient, we could add more value to the customer, and to the business. And if that means I don't actually need to have this product operations job in a year. That's awesome. And guess what, if you've shown you've done a really great job at rooting out inefficiencies. Every part of the company's going to want you to do some other job if that job is no longer valuable, because you've done such good job eliminating the need for it. There isn't this real concern that I'm going to lose my job by being too effective at it. It's like, no, you're going to show that you're just awesome at many types of jobs that product leaders or marketing leaders care about, so that's my perspective.\n\nLenny (35:09):\nI love that. And this happened a lot at Airbnb, a lot of amazing office people ended up moving into other roles once the role was not necessary or they just wanted to do something else. And clearly people wanted them on their team because they were killing it.\n\nCasey Winters (35:20):\nIndeed.\n\nLenny (35:21):\nOne last question about the CPO role, and then I want to shift a bit to just product management and growth. What is the job of a CPO for folks that are just like, what the heck, what is this thing? What do you do all day?\n\nCasey Winters (35:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (35:32):\nAnd then what does it take to get there? Just like what should people work on most if they're trying to get to CPO someday?\n\nCasey Winters (35:39):\nFirst off, when you think about what's the job, the way I think about it is I'm responsible for leading and facilitating the development of products and features that deliver value for Eventbrite's customers that will translate into value for the business. And each of those words were chosen pretty carefully. Now in terms of the scope of the function, a CPO role can lead a few different sub-functions. In my case, I lead product management, product design, research, and growth marketing, but different roles have kind of some or not as many of those, it can be pretty custom depending on the size of the company and what the leader's skill sets are. To talk a little bit more depth about the role. I think it's my job to make sure Eventbrite chooses the best possible product strategy based on the information we have, that we can adjust that strategy as we learn and continue to build that feedback loop.\n\n(36:35):\nIt's also my job to define and consistently improve the process through which we set our product strategy, how we prioritize projects, how we execute on them to make sure we're delivering that value to our customers, we're delivering those tangible business results. And to do that in a way where the rest of the company understands it and is able to participate in it as well, so this is things like identifying bottlenecks that prevent us from delivering value, or quality, or doing that at the detriment of speed, working with people across the company to remove those bottlenecks, making sure people outside of development are aware of what we're building, participating in the development and feedback of what we're building, as well as in helping deliver that for like a GTM perspective. And last but not least, and we've talked a little bit about this earlier, training the team on what it means to be an effective product manager, product designer, user research, et cetera, at Eventbrite.\n\n(37:36):\nAnd then of course hiring people who can augment our existing team on everything I just mentioned, so I'm accountable for what we build driving value for the business. And there's of course going to be many times where what we build doesn't end up driving value. It's hard to predict sometimes, but it's my job to improve that conversion rate and the magnitude of impact over time. It might not be that everything we build delivers value, but I want most of it to, and I want the impact of that value to be higher and higher over time. You also asked about what it takes to get to the CPO role. And I think my journey's been more irregular than most of the people you probably talk to. Product management when I started my career, it was all a waterfall. It was built around massive releases, it was a totally different job from what we do now. Marketing was a lot more agile in the lowercase sense of agile and it mapped to my mind better as someone who's really influenced by the book, The Goal.\n\n(38:40):\nI think the tangible pieces of advice to get to this level that may be helpful is I always focused on where I thought there was leverage. I wanted to learn everything I could and focus on the things that had a big impact regardless of the org structure or the career path that meant, I wanted to really have a deep understanding of the entire business so I knew just what was worth focusing on to help the business. I think one of the things that's different about being a chief product officer versus other product roles is how much of a company leadership role it is versus a functional leadership role. You're expected in this role to optimize for the entire company, even at the expense of what's good for your team, so you really have to learn how to optimize for company first. That's like a key thing to learn that I think new executives can struggle with. And what advantage I think I had is I've basically been working with executives since my first job at apartments.com, so I learned to speak their language and understood what they cared about pretty early in my career.\n\n(39:47):\nAnd this is a really important element, assume that questions from them are them trying to learn versus them assuming you don't know something and testing you about it. I find that a lot of people get intimidated by executive questions when the executive is just trying to understand things. And then that changes the interaction you can have. The other element that served me well was just refusing to specialize. I thought if I could learn all the skills that would allow me to combine them to work on the most important things versus only work on the thing I knew how to work on. And that definitely led to slower visible progress in terms of career growth or titles, but it was a much faster path to the true executive role because I could speak better with CEOs about more topics than most of my peers. Obviously this is all my individual experience there are many paths to get to this type of level, but those are some things that have worked for me.\n\nLenny (40:45):\nThat was such an incredible definition and so much good advice there. And this is a good segue to another area that you have a really interesting insight on around the spectrum of product people. When I think of you, I think of two by twos and this is I think just a spectrum, which is unusual for Casey framework.\n\nCasey Winters (41:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (41:01):\nI'd love to hear your take on how you think about the spectrum and around up-scaling PMs to move along that spectrum?\n\nCasey Winters (41:06):\nThe idea is, and this is something I was inspired from talking with Omar who runs product at Cambly. He used to run core product at Pinterest. It's this idea of any product team is like a gang of misfits, they all come from different backgrounds. Most people didn't start as a product manager, their first job, they might have been in sales, or in marketing, or analytics, or engineering, right. Everyone's bringing these different skill sets to the table. But the main spectrum that I've observed in product teams of any decent size is that you have two extreme types of product managers per se, and on perhaps the left side of the spectrum you have the crazy innovator types, they have so many different ideas, they pay attention to every single change in the industry, they all know all about the latest Apple API or Snapchat's latest product feature.\n\n(42:06):\nThose people are going to have ideas all the time. Actually, probably most of those ideas are going to be bad, but one out of ten's going to be just a game changer and they're generally not super great at turning that idea into action. And then on the extreme right side of the spectrum will be your typical executional focused PM, and they can do a really good job of taking a strong strategy and turning it into action that creates value for the customer, but they generally don't know what's going on in the industry. They can't think of a totally new product idea themselves. They're going to need support from above to be able to push them in the right direction and then they got it from there. When you think about recruiting, what we all want as CPOs in terms of people we bring into our team is we want people in the middle. We want people who are strategic, they understand what's going on in the industry, they can generate some good ideas, but they can also turn it into something real that delivers value for the customer and the company.\n\n(43:08):\nAnd there just aren't a ton of those people in the world. Not as many as we would like to recruit, so as a product leader, if I'm airing on the side of which side of the spectrum I want people from, I generally will take people who are good at execution over people who are good at generating ideas, because of course there's always too many good ideas that a company need to focus and execute well on the best ones. Whereas if I were a VC, I would probably bias to the people on the left because I don't need every company to work. If I invest in 10 different entrepreneurs who have crazy ideas and one of them works and becomes the next Airbnb, turns out I've done incredibly well as a venture capitalist. The challenge you practically deal with as a product leader is you end up recruiting, and managing, and growing a lot of executional people who can get stuff done, but if they want to get to the director level or if they want to get to my level, they need to get more strategic.\n\n(44:06):\nAnd we don't have good ways to turn great executors into great strategists as in general, like a product function, so I've started investing in a lot of different things here. Obviously I've built some programs for Reforge around product strategy. A lot of my team goes to those to try to learn. I've also been doing a lot of mentorship with the team to try to teach them what it looks like to do that well. I've had people come in to speak with the team like you and many other great product folks to show my team what great looks like and how people like you developed your skills. And I'm trying lots of different things to try to move more of the team to the middle, where they can be that optimal strategist that still retains that ability to deliver great value on top of the strategy versus just have ideas that can't be executed on. And it's definitely a work in progress, it's a lot of different tactics to try to build that skill set inside the team and scale it. And definitely something I feel like I'm still working on.\n\nLenny (45:11):\nWhat I'm hearing is a lot of kind of the biggest upside for PMs to develop is basically to become more strategic and all the things you've shared are just ways or a lot of ways to just become better at strategies. It's interesting that that's like what you found to be the most essential piece for PMs to often level up at.\n\nCasey Winters (45:30):\nLike you said, it depends on the level, right. Early on in your career as a PM, you're going to get the most value by showing that you can ship real things to customers and that the customers like them, like that's by far the most important thing. But if you want to start managing groups of PMs, if you want to start a running a business unit, or a pillar, or a theme. I as a chief product officer, I'm going to expect you to be able to write that strategy doc without me. And you know what I found, whether it's through the advising roles or through coming into Eventbrite is just a lot of people couldn't do that step.\n\n(46:04):\nAnd that means when you try to become a product leader at the company and the CEO expects that from you and you can't do it, you're going to set yourself up to really cap hard on how fast your career can grow. And you'll get stuck, whether it's at the senior product manager level or at the group PM level, because you can't show that you can drive decision making on your own and that you can push forward new ideas that are going to help the company, so that's definitely where I've seen the biggest bottleneck in terms of skill sets. Obviously there's lots of important skill sets you want to build as a PM, but that one to get to the top is the great filter.\n\nLenny (46:40):\nThat's awesome advice for folks listening that are trying to figure out what should I work on? It's kind of simple a lot of times just get better at strategy and it feels like it elevates you in so many other ways.\n\nCasey Winters (46:49):\nYeah, and of course we could talk for hours about what it means to get better at strategy and some of the tactics there.\n\nLenny (46:54):\nIt could be a follow up.\n\nCasey Winters (46:56):\nBecause I know some PMs who struggle with that.\n\nLenny (46:56):\nFollow up.\n\nCasey Winters (46:57):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (46:58):\nOkay.\n\nCasey Winters (46:59):\nPodcast number two.\n\nLenny (46:59):\nPodcast number two, let's book it. Okay, so I can't let you go without talking about growth. Everyone's always trying to figure out how do we grow our company?\n\nCasey Winters (46:59):\nRight.\n\nLenny (47:07):\nWhat can we do to accelerate growth? I know you're modest, but I think you're one of the smartest people in the world on this stuff. And so I just want to touch on a couple things in the time that we have here. One is with paid growth becoming increasingly more expensive and difficult, especially with Apple's recent changes.\n\nCasey Winters (47:24):\nYep.\n\nLenny (47:24):\nSEO forever becoming more crowded, sales being always expensive. It's just tough out there for a lot of startups to grow. Are you seeing any interesting or new growth channels or tactics that folks can explore or consider that maybe work for companies that you're looking at?\n\nCasey Winters (47:43):\nIt's not that there are new channels per se, unless you include tokens from like Web3, which I do not. It's more that there are ways to get leverage on your channels through better flows or lifetime value that companies are figuring out. For example, at Eventbrite, we unified what we're separate direct response and lead generation flows in our performance marketing to acquire creators. And now it just takes less effort, we're getting better CPAs and sales now has the opportunity to pick up any product qualified lead from a direct response customer who may need a little bit more help, and they have the data to now determine if there's high enough value to justify it.\n\n(48:27):\nThis concept is being dubbed, product led sales. And it's this idea that you can unify self-service loops in a B2B business, which are typically driven by product and your sales loops into one more complex giant loop that operates more efficiently and breaks down the silos. And I think you're going to see an explosion in B2B companies that learn how to unlock that and get sales, and product, and marketing to be working as one larger cross-functional team and building an engine that optimizes all of their skill sets, so that's something I'm pretty excited about, but we're definitely in the early days there.\n\nLenny (49:02):\nThat's awesome. I was going to ask you if there's any trends you're seeing around growth and clearly that's one. Are there any other trends, just things happening in the growth world?\n\nCasey Winters (49:12):\nYeah, sure. I think there was this conventional wisdom to just focus on building until you found product market fit and then you can worry about growth. And of course there's some truth in that statement, but now as I'm talking with more and more founders and I'm sure you're seeing this yourself, is we're seeing founders who are thinking about building growth loops into their product before they find product market fit. And it's not so that they can prematurely scale before they have product market fit. It's so that when they find product market fit, they have that built in distribution advantage to grow once they're ready. And founders are starting to intuit what I've written about a bit as well as you, which is that scalable acquisition or what we call an acquisition loop is a requirement for product market fit.\n\n(49:59):\nLike if you got a product that retains well and you can't find more users for it, I don't think that's product market fit, so it's really exciting to see that evolution and to see founders think about like it's not about getting a bunch of users before you have a product that works. It's about thinking strategically about how this product's going to grow itself when it's ready to do so. I'm really excited to see the next generation of founders build that muscle early on and also leverage it when they're ready instead of just like, oh, I'm going to throw a bunch of paid ads at it and it's going to work, so that's something I'm really excited about.\n\nLenny (50:31):\nOn that topic, when should companies focus on growth? And as a second question, when do you think they should hire a head of growth or someone full-time focused on growth?\n\nCasey Winters (50:40):\nLike I mentioned, well, you don't want to focus on growth before product worked fit. You want to be thinking about how your product can grow scalable pretty early on, so early growth definitely needs to be done by the founders. I tend to separate growth into two phases. I call the first phase kindle strategies, these are those non-scalable hacks to get your early users. And I think those are generally done by founders, maybe some early team members. Fire strategies are the ones that drive scale, that's what you were mentioning, content loops, sales loops, viral loops, paid acquisition. And to me, the goal of your kindle strategies, these like non scalable hacks they only exist to unlock the fire strategies, to unlock the things that could take you to millions of users.\n\n(51:24):\nAnd it's once you unlock a fire strategy, that's when I think you think about hiring someone full time on growth to fully harness that new growth loop you've built. That could be a salesperson, if it's sales. It could be growth PM, if it's viral or you just see content. Or it could be a performance marketer if it's ads, but it's once it's like, okay, we've sequenced to a growth strategy that actually scales. Let's go find someone who's awesome at that who can make it 10X better. That's how I think about it.\n\nLenny (51:51):\nMaybe a last question, is there is kind of an underappreciated or under invested in growth strategy, growth tactic, things that you're just like, oh wow, this seems to be working better than people may think.\n\nCasey Winters (52:03):\nYeah. Well, I still think data network effects are underrated. I think a lot of people confuse the idea of data network effects with data as a product you can charge people for, especially like businesses. And I get it a lot of businesses like you can't charge them for data because they don't know how to use data super well, especially SMBs. But what data network effects are, is leveraging product usage data to make the product value stronger and stronger over time. That could be personalized results in the case of Pinterest or in the case of Eventbrite, better targeting data for advertising to find people who are more likely to be interested in your event. And I think especially with Facebook and Apple's platform changes your product being able to generate its own data, versus just relying on the big platforms to do all the work for you. That's a real edge that companies are starting to wake up to. And it's obviously something that's worked well for me in the past at Pinterest and certainly now at Eventbrite.\n\nLenny (53:02):\nThere's a couple questions that I had at the top that I skipped that I thought I'd come back to. I know that you're a big video game guy and I love that at the bottom of your post, you always share the music that you're listening to, so I was just going to ask what's the game you're playing these days. Anything you recommend and then what are you listening to?\n\nCasey Winters (53:18):\nYeah, I'm currently playing Cyberpunk 2077 on the PS5, which is fun. But I recently finished Horizon Forbidden West and that was excellent, really great science fiction game. On the music side, one of my favorite bands is this band called Broadcast and they never really played live a whole lot and their singer died a few years ago, but they recently came out with a recording of a bunch of their live sessions that they recorded on the BBC. And it's like getting this time capsule from the past of some of their early live sessions. That's been really great, so I've been enjoining that record quite a lot lately.\n\nLenny (54:02):\nAwesome. Casey's picks get them here, get them here now. Casey, I feel like I was successful in extracting many nuggets in our hour together, I really appreciate your time. Where can folks find you online and how can people that are listening be helpful to you?\n\nCasey Winters (54:17):\nBlog@caseyaccidental.com, I'm semi-active on Twitter @onecaseman, and always I focus on paying it forward, like help the next generation of companies, of PMs, of marketers, get better at their craft and build better businesses. And if you're searching for a cool event, check out the Eventbrite App of course, we always would appreciate that.\n\nLenny (54:43):\nLove it. Amazing Casey, what a great way to end it. Thank you again for being here.\n\nCasey Winters (54:48):\nThanks so much.\n\nLenny (54:50):\nThat was awesome, thank you for listening.

There was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. It was almost as if there was a strategy gene you needed to be born with to be good at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nSay someone's sitting down, okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product. Where do you begin? What does this process look like?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:23):\nIn terms of what product strategy is? There is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems, they're called present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. The reason I think this process works is there is a ton of alignment built in. It goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nLet's talk about big S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:53):\nThere's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is-\n\nElon Musk (00:00:56):\n\"Life's got to be about more than just solving problems.\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:00:58):\nI think this is true of every sort of company. There needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nToday my guest is Chandra Janakiraman. Chandra is chief product officer and executive vice president at VRChat. He was a product leader at Meta, chief product officer at Headspace, a GM at Zynga, and a senior PM at Amazon. And the way this podcast episode happened was an avid podcast listener, Karthik Suresh, told me about Chandra at a community meetup. And when I connected with Chandra, it was clear that I needed to get him on the podcast.\n\n(00:01:40):\nChandra is a student of strategy and has spent his career developing what he calls an operator's guide to strategy, which essentially pulls together the best ideas from Good Strategy, Bad Strategy, Playing to Win, Michael Porter and others to create a very clear, reliable and easy-to-follow five-step process to develop a great strategy and a set of next steps for your product and company. After hearing Chandra walk through this in our conversation, I'm basically going to now point everyone who wants to get better at strategy to this episode and Chandra's method. Strategy is at the heart of every great product and team and business, and it's also the source of so much pain if you do it badly. This episode is meant to help you avoid that. A big thank you to Karthik for making this connection. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Chandra Janakiraman.\n\n(00:02:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A-B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams, companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features and Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does.\n\n(00:03:09):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform where I could set up experiments, easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more With advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles. Eppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A-B testing flywheel.

I was at a meetup of my readership, of my community and someone came up to me and they're like, \"Lenny, you need to get this guy Chandra on your podcast. He's the most amazing playbook for developing a strategy.\" He's gone through it with you at a company he worked at with you once, and he's just like, \"People need to learn this because it's so good.\" And to me, if someone can get better at strategy, it feels like it just makes so much of the way the company operates and the way that people work better. So we chatted, we met, I was like, \"I completely agree. We definitely need to get you on this podcast to share your approach to the strategy.\" So we made this happen, and so we're here. So again, thank you for doing this and sharing.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:05:37):\nThank you. Thank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:39):\nFirst of all, I wanted to ask just you're very passionate about strategy and developing a way to consistently create great strategies. What got you so interested in this stuff in the first place? What kind of sparked your interest in this area?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:05:53):\nYeah, yeah, it's a very interesting story. It goes back all the way 10 years ago, but I remember it vividly like it happened yesterday. And I was a relatively new VP of product at Headspace, and we had this amazing company vision and mission that the founders had laid out, and I had come in and established goals for the team in terms of our key metrics, and we had a very buttoned up roadmap in my mind that fed into that company mission and vision. And I was feeling pretty good about how things were shaping up.\n\n(00:06:37):\nAnd on a particular Monday, the founder, CEO pulled me aside, and in his usual disarming style, he sort of made a short but profound statement. He said that, \"Hey, CJ, I'm hearing that a lot of people don't really understand why we are working on what we are working on,\" and that was it. That was really the extent of what he shared. And it was a little bit of a bubble bursting moment for me because we obviously had spent a lot of time building the plan and I was feeling relatively good about the plan.\n\n(00:07:21):\nAnd so I spoke to a few people. I sort of wanted to understand it a little bit deeper, like, \"Hey, what's happening?\" And he was right. He was right. A lot of people didn't really understand why we were working on the things we were working on, and it led to some soul-searching. And basically I was lucky because there was actually a board member of Headspace who had a product background, kind of knew what good looked like, and I came to the conclusion, \"Hey, we needed a strategy for Headspace.\"\n\n(00:07:56):\nSo with extensive work with her, with the board person, we built the first written product strategy for Headspace. And that, and the subsequent actions on the product led to a complete re-imagination of the product. And basically we were able to create a new product, we call it the Next Generation Headspace, which on one hand it could support a comprehensive library of content, not just meditation, but non-meditation content as well. It had the sort of home experience where everything was incredibly personalized for the individuals, and there were several motivational elements built into the whole product experience. And it was very transformational for the company and the product because it changed the product from being a meditation app to a broader health and wellness service and really put the company on a different trajectory. It led to my promotion to the first CPO at Headspace.\n\n(00:09:07):\nAnd most interestingly, I had a chance to, while going through it almost in a sort of out of body way, observed the process of like, okay, how did we put this thing together? And what actually went into it? What really started as almost a personal crisis moment of finding this need to create a strategy for a product and a company led to a bigger sort of quest for me, which is I started noticing that there was a certain mystique and aura about product strategy, and there was this perception that some people were intrinsically really good at strategy and others were not. And it was almost as if there was a strategy gene that you needed to be born with to be good at it. And that bothered me a lot, and I sort of wanted to ask myself, is it possible to break that divide between the haves and the have-nots and make this capability widely accessible through a procedural approach. And I have news for you. The answer is yes, anybody can build product strategy through a clear understanding of what it is and through a friendly and repeatable playbook.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:29):\nAmazing. That's exactly what I want to do here. The point you made about the why, I think everyone listening to this that's been in product for long enough has heard that of just, \"Your team doesn't understand why we're doing this.\" I've heard that a number of times, as much as you think you're killing it, there's always that, you forget sometimes to do that or you aren't doing it great. And I love that basically the solution to that is the strategy solves that problem of helping people connect the dots and understand why this is the roadmap, why this is the strategy. Okay, so before we get into it, just one more context question, what's just the best way to think about what you're about to share and also who's it for? Who needs to hear this briefly?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:11:11):\nSo the way to think about this, the substance is that this is not a new framework or theory that I'm going to be talking about. There are plenty of excellent materials on strategy from ancient texts like The Art of War from Sun Tzu, all of Michael Porter's work, Good Strategy Bad Strategy by Richard Rumelt, who's been on your podcast, Playing to Win Lafley and Roger Martin. So there's a ton of extensively researched and well-founded materials out there. So the way I would think about this is, it's more of an operator's interpretation of all the stuff that's out there and are able to package it into something that's friendly and repeatable, particularly for product people who think they are weak at strategy or perhaps have received such feedback.\n\n(00:12:05):\nAnd just in terms of the battle-tested nature of it, I personally use this playbook about five to six times tweaking and optimizing it each time based on what I thought worked, what people thought worked and didn't work, including several times at Meta and usually leading to strong results, both for me achieving senior leadership alignment as well as driving business results for the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:36):\nOkay, I'm getting more and more excited. Let's get into it, let's get into this playbook. People hear this word strategy a lot. They're told be more strategic, build a better strategy. What's the simplest way to understand what is a strategy?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:12:49):\nYeah, let's start with some basic definitions, which is as you asked, what is product strategy? And if you think back to the Headspace example, this sort of comes to life as well. So product strategy, strategy sits between the mission and vision and the plan. It could be at the company level or at the team level, but it's usually sitting between the mission and vision and the plan. And the plan, you can call the plan the roadmap, which is basically an ordered list of things that you want to get done and the mission and vision is basically sort of the purpose of existence, what does it look like when you achieve your purpose of existence? So it sits between the two and it forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact.\n\n(00:13:40):\nAnd I want to borrow an analogy from the world of physics. There is this concept called resonance, and the concept of resonance is really interesting, and it's actually very close to the concept of strategy. So the concept of resonance works as follows, when you apply a certain frequency to an object and you get pretty close to its natural frequency, you see a disproportionate increase in the amplitude of how that object vibrates. And so it's very interesting, if you apply any other frequency, there's very little effect on the object, but if you get close to its natural frequency, there's this exponential increase in the vibration of the product. So this concept of resonance is interesting.\n\n(00:14:27):\nSo the way to think about it in the context of strategy is, it is selecting that frequency to achieve resonance between the product and the market. And so when you get close to that frequency, you should see tremendous impact in terms of the product landing well in the market. And so that's how I would think about it. It sits between mission, vision and the plan. It forces choice to deploy scarce resources to generate maximum impact, so using resonance as a sort of an example, and it ideally includes three components. The first is a handful of areas to focus on and I call these strategic pillars and then a whole bunch of areas that are explicitly not the focus. And the third component is why. So why are the focus areas, A, B and C? Why are these whole bunch of areas not the focus? And that's the three components. That's really it in terms of product strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:32):\nI love it. And I love the things we aren't doing as a core part of this, that comes up a lot on this podcast of being clear is what we're not going to do. We know these could be things we could do, but we're deciding we're not doing these things.\n\n(00:15:42):\nOkay, so let's just talk through how you go about developing a strategy using this method. Say someone's sitting down, \"Okay, I'm going to start developing a strategy for our product.\" Where do you begin? What does this process look like? Let's start talking through it.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:15:59):\nSo I sort of want to first explain this concept called smallest strategy, and I'll sort of talk about what that is and how it's different from another kind. But the basic sort of strategic process I would say takes about eight to 12 weeks long. It's something that I think people often underestimate how long it takes and eventually end up taking a lot more time. But when they start off, they think, \"Oh, I could probably stand this up in a couple of weeks,\" but usually through iteration it actually ends up taking 8 to 12 weeks anyway. So it's good to start with setting clear expectations that it takes about eight to 12 weeks. And the way to justify the ROI on that is typically a strategy like this can be leveraged for about a couple of years. So relative to that sort of payback period, I think the investment is relatively small. So it's pretty healthy from that sense to manage expectations and say that that's how long it's going to take.\n\n(00:17:00):\nSo within that period, there are five phases. There's the preparation phase, there's a strategy sprint, the design sprint, the document writing and the rollout. And those are the five phases, which I'll explain how one would go through. And basically each of them has a certain sort of time recommendation. For example, the preparation phase I would say is probably about four weeks. The strategy sprint is up to about one week. The design sprint is another one week, document writing maybe one to two weeks, and the rollout is maybe two to three weeks. So that's how you get to that range of eight to 12 weeks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:40):\nEssentially it's like a quarter of work to get to a final great strategy. And of these five phases, the biggest bucket is preparation, which to me sounds like it's not like a full-time team thing. It's starting to gather data and user research-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:17:56):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:57):\nAs you talk through this, I'm curious just how much of the team is involved in each of these steps. But I think it's an important point, if you want a really good winning strategy, you need to give a time. You can't just say, \"In a month or a week, we need to develop a strategy, go figure it out, write this document.\" Great. Cool. So let's talk about step one preparation.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:14):\nThat's correct, Lenny. And I think you, if I forget, remind me that sometimes there is pressure. There's just business pressure, like the CEO might still want a strategy in two weeks, how do you respond to that? And I think we can find some clever shortcuts there, but I think to the extent possible, the leader should push for [inaudible 00:18:39] to make something really great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:40):\nAnd I think part of it is that as a leader, you can start on this before... you know this is coming, so you should get started before it's even asked for.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:48):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:49):\nYeah, awesome. Okay, let's get into it.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:18:51):\nSo I think you sort of touched on this in terms of the preparation phase being the longest phase, but also not being sort of like a full-time thing. So that's absolutely right. So the preparation phase is really... The way to start this, which is a little different from other approaches I've seen from people is to actually form a strategy working group. This is an important concept. So the strategy working group is sort of a small team. It typically consists of engineering, product design and data at a minimum. And in certain cases, there's a luxury to have other functions like product marketing, user research, that's also part of the strategy working group. But the minimum quorum, I would recommend is engineering, product design and data because design in some ways represents both sort of product design and user research. So you do get the voice of the user from that perspective. And typically the PM is driving the strategy working group and the process, but that working group is actually the team that's going to collaboratively create the strategy doc.\n\n(00:19:59):\nAnd so in the preparation phase, there's usually a kickoff meeting where the PM pulls the team together, talks about the purpose of the process, lays out the different phases, and gives everybody a feel for what's going to happen in the next 8 to 12 weeks. And basically then creates a list of very discrete action items and deliverables for each of the stakeholders in the working group. So specifically, there's an action item around aggregating all the behavioral insights that the team might have around the product. And usually this is a combination of previous analysis that the team has run on the data side and potentially also feature launches and how they have done. So all kind of analytical analysis.\n\n(00:20:50):\nThe ask is really to create a meta analysis of all of the analysis. So the data person on the strategy working group has to scan the historical archives at the company and sort of synthesize and condense that into a very sort of digestible macro themes and learnings about users. So that's sort of one preparation phase item.\n\n(00:21:16):\nThe second is UXR insight. So again, there's probably a lot of soft hard signals about users, not just based on research that's run by user researchers, but also potentially from the customer service team, social channels, and basically a meta analysis of all of that into one very actionable and synthesized deck on all the insights on users. That's usually led by the design person and with support from their research team. And that's sort of the second action item.\n\n(00:21:53):\nThe third action item is leadership interviews. So I sort of have this fun story of the fruit with leadership strategy reviews, which I want to share. So imagine, this is sort of how sometimes strategy reviews go, which is you bring a fruit to the reviewer and say, \"Hey, here's a mango, what do you think?\" And the reviewer says, \"I actually don't like mangoes.\" And you're like, \"Oh,\" you're sort of sad. You take it back, you bring an apple and you show, \"Hey, what do you think of an apple?\" And then the leader says, \"I actually stopped eating apples last year.\" And so you're disappointed again. You go back, you bring a banana. \"I hated bananas since I was a kid.\" And so it's a bit of a silly caricature of reviews, but there's a bit of grain of truth there, which is, imagine how frustrating that is for both the reviewer and the person who's reviewing.\n\n(00:22:54):\nAnd so it could be made so much better if you just engage with your leaders before you actually build a strategy. It's amazing how few people actually do that. And so the fruit story tells you, hey, imagine if you just asked the reviewer, \"Do you even like fruits?\" How much better the experience would've been for both parties. And so leadership interviews are a very important part of a strategy formulation process. So you can divide and conquer, there's several leaders, like you assign different leaders to different people on the strategy working group and each of them sort talks to that leader. And there are a few questions that I would recommend asking, and it's basically, what does success feel like for the leader? What does failure look like? What is the measure of success? What are principles to keep in mind while going through this process?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:51):\nAnd these are centered around the product that you're working on?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:23:55):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:55):\nFor Headspace, it'd be like, what do you think success looks like for Headspace or the specific feature of Headspace? [inaudible 00:24:03].\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:24:02):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):\nOkay, cool.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:24:04):\nThat's right, yeah. And also I think ask them for their favorite or better ideas. It's actually what I've found through this process is a lot of leaders have these better ideas, they just feel shy to share it because they don't want their teams to think of them as micromanage-y. They want their teams to figure out the answer themselves, but then when you ask them, they actually have a pet idea always.\n\n(00:24:29):\nAnd so asking them just takes the mystery out of it. And it also gives them a creative avenue. So some people feel nervous about engaging senior leaders in these conversations in the sense that, hey, is it a waste of their time? What I've found is the exact opposite, senior leaders are, they welcome this because one, it's actually a more fun conversation for them than the other meetings that they have in their day because they're getting a little bit of their creative juices going, and they actually feel happy that somebody actually asked them what they're feeling and thinking about. And so it's actually very, very positive energy when you ask leaders just what they want. And it's also not a sign of weakness. It's actually a sign of strength and humility to ask your leaders what you want. And so keeping that fruit story in mind, I want to just say that this is a very, very positive thing, a very powerful thing.\n\n(00:25:26):\nThe next area is competitive analysis. So if there is a product marketing person, they can do it for you. If there isn't, the PM should do it themselves. And basically the idea is you try to understand who are the comparables or the competitors in the space, and you sort of build a little bit of a head-to-head and sort a stack chart of where's everybody going and what are of the angles of investment for different people based on the explicit signals, which is what are they releasing?\n\n(00:25:59):\nYou don't really know what their strategies are, but you can kind of tell when you look at the features they're putting out that, oh, they seem to be focusing on this particular area. And so that's sort of competitive analysis. And bigger companies, there's also another important input, which is adjacent roadmaps. Are the teams adjacent to you and what are they investing in? Because oftentimes that can have a rub-off effect on your team, and if you're not aligning with other key teams, it's going to be important. So adjacent roadmaps and a summary of that.\n\n(00:26:33):\nAnd last but not least, is what I call user observation. So I like the strategy working group to actually either interview a user or watch a video and report key learnings. And the idea is not to action those insights, it's really to build empathy. When you get somebody in the room with a user, it just changes their mind, it softens them a little bit. It gets them out of their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be and...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:27:00):\n... their own preconceived notions of what to build, what the strategy should be, and it humanizes the whole process. That I think is the purpose, but you still give them the homework of writing down what they learned because it's a little bit of a forcing function.\n\n(00:27:16):\nThe output of all of this is what I call the comprehensive preparation readout. It is a single master deck where you sort of have the behavioral insights meta analysis, you have the UXR insights meta analysis, you have a download of the leadership interviews, you have the competitive stack charts, you have the adjacent roadmaps, and you have a section on user observations. It's a lot of work, but to your point, it can be done in parallel with your day jobs. You can multitask, and that's why you take about four weeks to do that. That sort of concludes the preparation phase. You get the deck, and that rolls into the strategy sprint, which is the next phase. I want to pause and see if you have any questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):\nYeah, I have a million questions, but I'm going to keep myself contained. Just to quickly summarize. Basically you kick off, we're going to start developing strategy for this product, and you were going to touch on this, but it may help just to talk about this right now. I know you have big S Strategy, small S strategy. This process, what's an example of the level of product scale that this process is for? Because I know you have another approach for a larger scale of a product, basically for a company. What's the best way to think about small S strategy, which is what we're going through?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:28:37):\nYeah, I think it's a good question, Lenny. I would say that the process works well at sort of a growth stage company or in a vertical within sort of a larger company. I think it scales pretty well. The main difference between this small S and big S is the time horizon aspect and the aspirational component, which we'll get to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:02):\nOkay, so this is a process you can use for entire company strategy of not a large company, not a massively, and then also just a product within a company?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:29:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:11):\nOkay, perfect. Okay. Hey, we're kicking off strategy for this thing. Let's say VR Chat 2.0. You have this kickoff meeting with your working group. You assign action items and there's six things you ask everyone to do. Gather all the behavioral insights, all the user research insights that you've had, leadership interviews, interview people, ask what they want and see what they're hoping for, what success looks like, competitive analysis, adjacent roadmaps across other teams and user observations, just like watch users, see what's happening. You assign each of these tasks to different people in this working group. You set a deadline. We have to present this in say, four weeks. People go work on it. You meet ongoing as it's coming together, and then the output is a deck that you share. Do you share this deck with just that working group, or who do you share this deck with and read it out to?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:02):\nYeah. The deck is an output of the first phase, and then it flows into the second phase, which is a strategy sprint. You don't share the deck with anybody yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:10):\nGot it. This is our secret.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:11):\nIn the strategy sprint, it's like a key thing. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:13):\nAwesome. Okay. I love how very concrete and actionable this is with time boxes and action items and the exact output you're looking for. I love this. Okay, cool. Basically what you're trying to do here is gather all of the input that will inform the strategy.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:27):\nThat's correct.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:28):\nIt's giving yourself time to do this, because if you think about it, the output is determined by the quality of your input. I love, it feels like a core component of this method is spend time creating, gathering all the input, all the best input, actually spend time there. Don't just make it a half-assed last minute thing. Okay. Amazing. Okay, let's talk about step two, which is the strategy sprint.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:30:52):\nYeah, so the strategy sprint is the heart of the process. This is sort of where you make the decision. If you recall, the definition of strategy is it forces choice to deploy resources into a few areas for maximum impact. The core of strategy is really picking those areas and the areas you're not going invest in. That happens in the strategy sprint, so really it's the heart of the process.\n\n(00:31:22):\nTypically, it's like a three to five day process. The first day is the share out date. Everybody has done some great work. They go in, they share what they've collected, what they've sort of learned. It brings everybody in the working group to the same state of understanding, the same state of consciousness on the state of the union. That's a great process where what I encourage people to do is write down things that you are, as you're listening, write down things that you find are problems for our users, things that are coming in the way of our growth and things that are sort of suboptimal for the business.\n\n(00:32:05):\nPeople take a lot of notes during that time and the people who are presenting are sharing everything they've learned. That's really day one. It's just absorbing a ton of information and writing down a ton of notes so people can kind of understand where all the problems are. It's a very problems focused process, and that's an important point. I'll get back to it when we talk about big S, which is different. Once people have that common awareness, shared knowledge of all the problems, day two is literally the most important day in the entire 8 to 12 weeks because that's where you actually make the choice. The way to flow through it, it's actually really important to flow through it correctly. The first step is really generating a whole bunch of problems, because people have been taking notes the previous day.\n\n(00:32:59):\nYou start the day with, \"Hey, let's collect everybody's thoughts on what the problems are that are holding us back.\" It's a free flowing session. Everybody throws out their observations on what's holding us back, and you just capture all of that in a Google Sheets, for example. Over even an hour, you start to see these patterns emerging of like, there's these clusters of problems that are really holding us back. The next step is you do a joint clustering of related problems and you create these potentially, typically in my experience, I've seen about 10 to 15 clusters form of very related problems. The beauty of it is each of those bigger cluster, you actually know what the sub problems are within that cluster because you sort of generated it very organically.\n\n(00:33:55):\nThen you have, let's say 10 to 15 clusters. What you then do is you, because remember, because it started as a problem generation exercise, each of the clusters also has a name that is a problem, and so the next step is to flip it into an opportunity framing. Let me give you a couple of examples.\n\n(00:34:16):\nLet's say there's a bunch of problems around people don't really know where to find different things in our product, and they don't really know where to go, where to find a certain feature or a certain experience. There's let's say a lot of problems in that area, so difficulty finding things becomes the cluster, the problem cluster and discovery becomes the opportunity sort of framing of it. It's sort of the more positive framing of it.\n\n(00:34:46):\nAnother example could be that people get a lot of content that they don't like. They see a lot of stuff that they don't like, and so they disengage with the product. The opportunity framing of that would be relevance. It's basically stuff that really matters to me. Maybe if it's a social product, then maybe people are finding it difficult to find friends and they are lonely because of that. The opportunity framing would be social connection.\n\n(00:35:20):\nFlipping all of those problem clusters into positive framing and opportunity framing is the next step. Then you're in a great spot because now all you have to do is you have to down select from those 10 to 15 opportunity areas into ideally three, maybe five, but I would recommend three because it creates more clarity and focus. The way to do that is really sort of ranking them on, I would say four or five key dimensions or criteria, and the first is expected impact.\n\n(00:35:56):\nLet's say you actually tackle that area. What is the expected impact to whatever matters to you as a company, as a business, as a product? The second dimension is certainty of impact. Certainty of impact is basically how concrete is the evidence that this is a problem? Sometimes you have really hard data, sometimes you have more anecdotal evidence, and so the confidence really depends on how big the problem's sizing and frequency is. Expected impact, certainty of impact. The third one is also very important, which is clarity of levers.\n\n(00:36:34):\nDo you actually have an idea of how you would solve it? If you don't, it's going to be really difficult to move the needle on it because you should kind of know that, okay, I can imagine these solutions could actually move the needle. I can actually launch this sort of nudge system that can help people find things. I can recommend people. I can recommend friends so that people can form friends quicker on the platform. You should have a sense of how you would solve that particular space. Is there clarity on levers? That's the third dimension.\n\n(00:37:08):\nThe fourth dimension is super important, which is are the levers unique and differentiated to that particular team or company? Which is that if another team or company could build it better than this particular team or company, then it's probably not that differentiated. It's probably going to be pretty generic once you launch it. It's a combination of sort of like, is there a lot of impact here? How confident are we of the problem? Do we have a sense of the solutions? And basically, are we the team or company that has the capabilities and the skills to uniquely build it where other teams cannot?\n\n(00:37:52):\nOnce you have that, and sometimes what happens is you don't have too much data, and so it's okay to have qualitative scores on this like high, medium, low, T-shirt scores, whatever that is. The key is you're doing it together as a strategy working group, and you're debating the scores and you're reasoning why it should be higher versus lower. There's a ton of alignment and collision that's happening when you're doing that, which is very healthy for the eventual outcome.\n\n(00:38:22):\nOnce you do that, basically you can do a simple sort of addition of the scores and a sort, and what you have is basically the top three and you have the remaining 7 or 12 that are basically not the focus. That's the core of the process, is getting those opportunity areas and getting to a shared sense of how do we prioritize them and why?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:51):\nOkay, and this is all done in a week. I know there's more to it. There's a couple more items that help you move from what you just said to the next step, but I love that this is the core of the biggest element of the process, and you do it in a week and you're only able to do it in a week because of the work you did ahead of time. Again, highlighting the importance of that prep step.\n\n(00:39:13):\nJust to share what you've shared so far, and then we'll finish the strategy sprint step. It's basically do the share out so everyone's on the same page about all the information that, all the inputs essentially. Enumerate all the problems, like individual small problems and then cluster them into 10 to 15 problem clusters. Flip it from here's the problem to here's an opportunity we have. Rank them based on, basically there's these four attributes you shared, which I'll actually, I wrote these down. Impact potential, confidence that it will have the impact, clarity of levers and are they differentiated unique levers? Is there something different from what other folks are doing? Those are ways to rank these ideas and problem clusters. You essentially come up with, here's three bets basically we potentially should take. Okay, and then I think that's where you stopped. Is that right?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:40:03):\nThat's totally right, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:06):\nOkay, cool.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:40:06):\nThose three that are at the top of that pile are basically our strategic pillars. We've sort of gotten our strategic pillars and they basically hold up the strategy. That's why they're called strategic pillars. The idea is once you have the strategic pillars, we basically translate that into a few how might we's? Let's say it's a relevance thing. How might we find the best content for a particular user? How might we surface it in the right place? There's a few how might we's, and the how might we's are basically intended to help the next phase of the process, which is the design sprint.\n\n(00:40:43):\nYou generate these areas, these strategic pillars, you generate the how might we's. How might we's are typically pretty straightforward. Once you have the strategic pillars, it takes probably an hour to generate some how might we's for each of them, maybe two or three for each strategic pillar, and then you're done with that stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:00):\nI just want to highlight real quick, this phrasing is really important. I used exactly the same phrasing. I had a PM that I worked with and his name was Andrew Chen, but not the Andrew Chen people know about, that's an investor, who had this concept of fertile questions that create ideas and spark ideas and solutions. This phrase, \"How might we\", is actually really powerful as a way to come up with ideas to solve problems. It's just like, how might we increase discoverability in our app? How might we improve relevance? There's something magical about that phrasing that it opens up your mind to, how might we? Let's think about it. Versus like, how do we improve discovery? That's a different, your brain works differently hearing this. That is a really powerful phrasing. Just wanted to highlight that.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:41:47):\nYeah, that's awesome. It's also something that designers are familiar with, Lenny, so it flows really well into sort of a design sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nOkay, so you have these how might we'd. You have three pillars, maybe three or four or five how might we's to solve these opportunities/problems, and then what happens after that?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:06):\nExactly. Then the third day is it's good to start fresh. The team's accomplished a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:13):\nThis was all the first two days.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:14):\nThis is the first two days, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:15):\nWow. Okay. So much done in two days.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:42:18):\nYeah, exactly. The second day is particularly intense on the team, so it's good to give them a break, because it's a lot of really mental sort of wrestling, and so give the team a bit of a break. Then the third day is when people are a little bit refreshed, we get to winning aspiration. Winning aspiration is super interesting because it's a very creative exercise. You basically imagine in two years, because that's the typical time horizon of a smaller strategy, is like 18 months to 24 months. This is what I tell the team. Imagine two years there's a newspaper, there's a journalist that covers this work, and there's a newspaper article that comes out. I want you to imagine the progress on all these strategic pillars and what the headline of that newspaper article looks like. It's called a newspaper headline approach.\n\n(00:43:09):\nBasically, everybody generates a newspaper headline in parallel. It's interesting because you often see there's these common themes that sort of form when people generate these headlines. The forcing function with the headline is also that it has to be somewhat simple and plain speak. It's not too technical. You have to get to a more simple layperson's language and you have to get to the key benefit that ultimately, the impact it has on the world. Those kinds of themes come up often.\n\n(00:43:44):\nThen you do a little bit, you put them all into a blender, you put all of those headlines from the team into a blender, and you mash them together and create the winning aspiration, which is ultimately what does progress on the strategy look like in a couple of years time? That comes from the working group, it's not like one person writing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:09):\nWhat's an example of an aspiration that you've come up with on a project you worked on, a winning aspiration?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:44:14):\nWe did this process for the privacy team when I was at Meta. Really the strategic pillars were around a lot of features that we would build, but the winning aspiration was really like, could we move consumer trust? The newspaper headline is something like, \"Facebook has moved the needle on consumer trust by investing in these areas.\" That's how you create the bigger impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:47):\nThat's a great example. Obviously this is similar to the PR Amazon method and what I love about your approach, as you said early on, is you're just pulling together all of these awesome ideas from all these different methods of strategy work to a very methodical step-by-step process. Taking all the best ideas into, and as you described, an operator's playbook for doing this. I love that. Okay. When you say blender, by the way, I was thinking as you were talking, put them into a blender, what I'm inferring is you just take everyone's headlines and you come up with one that kind of covers the gamut of all three pillars being successful.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:20):\nThat's exactly right. More tactically what I typically do is I put them all on a slide and start, it's almost like a word cloud, and then you start to see these common words. Then you converge those words as the key elements of the final winning aspiration. Then you try to create a nice statement out of that. It also symbolically, everybody sees their own statement on the deck, and that's how you get to the final model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:46):\nAwesome. I feel like AI could help with that now.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:46):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:48):\nJust put in all your headline ideas and it comes up with some suggestions. Okay, cool. Is that the end of the sprint or is there more to the sprint?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:45:55):\nThat's it for the sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:57):\nOkay. At the end of the sprint, what do you have? What are the outputs?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:46:00):\nYeah, this is a great progress on strategy because now we have the three strategic pillars. We have the how might we associate it with the strategic pillars. You also have the why. Why did you get to those three strategic pillars and what are you not focused on and what are the reasons for it? You also have the winning aspiration. It's great progress. The team's done a great job. I think now we sort of move on to the design sprint.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:30):\nIn your experience, how often are these three the correct three that you end up going with versus you learn something over the course of the rest of the sprint and adjust?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:46:38):\nIt's a very good question. We'll speak about an example that I had in Meta where typically during the strategy sprint, you don't change it once you go through the strategy sprint, but eventually there are a lot of signals you get through execution where you sort of have to course correct. We'll talk about one very interesting example of how that sort of changed things here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:01):\nAwesome. Okay. Basically, you've developed your strategy at this point, and in your experience it ends up being... Until you hit the market and test, you don't really know what's going on.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:47:01):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:10):\nBut there's kind of an implication that in your experience doing this, I think you said five or six times, it has been correct and as good as doing it any other approach.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:47:21):\nI would say it's not sort of an empirical study, obviously because of the small sample size, but I would say that it's really opened people's eyes and it's led to really good alignment and eventually good results. Even when it has not, it has led to good organizational buy-in on why and how we are approaching things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:42):\nThis reminds me of, Tomer Cohen was on the podcast, he's CPO of LinkedIn and he has this phrase that always says he says, which is, \"We may be wrong, but we're not confused.\" I love that a core part of this is everyone is completely on the same page, not from the beginning, but once you start this process of here's all the inputs, here's step by step we are working together on narrowing down, so at least everyone understands the why. Which is what sparked your interest in this in the first place, everyone understanding. I know there's a whole rollout at the end too to solve that.\n\n(00:48:14):\nOkay, cool, so we have the sprint. We have basically the three pillars that you're going to invest in, this headline of what it might look like if you're to launch and some solution ideas with how might we's. What comes next?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:48:26):\nYeah. The next phase is the design sprint, and the design sprint can be led by the design person who's in the strategy working group. If you remember, there's engineering, product design and data, so the design person can lead it and the PM can sort of take a bit of a backseat during this process. The input to the design sprint is sort of the three strategic pillars and the how might we's associated with it.\n\n(00:48:50):\nThe goal of the design sprint is not to sort of come up with these are the features we should build. That's not the purpose of the design sprint. The design sprint is to generate a lot of illustrative concepts that bring the strategy to life because a picture is worth a thousand words. Oftentimes, even though you might have the right words in your strategy doc, people might still scratch their head like, \"What do you exactly mean? What are you going to build?\" The illustrative concepts really sort of give people something to latch onto, \"Oh, okay, I get it. This is what you're going to build at the end of the day with this strategy.\"\n\n(00:49:25):\nThe more generative, the better. Then there's the ability to, sometimes if you do the Google Ventures design sprint, you can even test some of it with users and get a little bit of sharpening of things. The goal here is not to build feature-ready designs, it's more to generate concepts. Once you have that, basically the design sprint, and there's different flavors of design sprints, which I won't go into. You can lean on your design lead to decide what's the appropriate way, but the input and the output is what needs to be very emphasized. The input needs to be the strategic pillars. The output needs to be a ton of illustrative concepts to explain each strategic pillar. You could almost have a section where you talk about each strategic pillar and insert those concepts in that section. That's the idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:16):\nWe're going to go through a couple examples to make this very real. You mentioned the design sprint method, which we had the authors on the podcast. They actually didn't go through the design sprint method. They have another book called Make Time that's about productivity. We also had their colleague from Google Ventures that designed a bullseye sprint, which is also an interesting sprint. It's a new thing that helps you figure out your ICP and who to focus your product on and how that informs your product.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:50:40):\nOh, that's right. Interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:41):\nIt's another type of sprint you could use here. The input is here's the three things we're going to invest in, say discovery, relevance, privacy. The output is here's concepts of what this could look like to get people's minds going. Is it just a bunch of mocks basically in a deck at this point?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:00):\nThat's correct. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nOkay, cool. Okay, amazing. That's a week. That's another sprint. PM could maybe take a little bit of a break.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:07):\nAnd designers take the lead.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:09):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:09):\nThe engineers are kind of inputs and thought partners in this, I imagine.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:13):\nThey're optional. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:15):\nOptional, but yeah, ideally they're involved because you want all the best ideas in there.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:19):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:20):\nOkay, cool. What comes next?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:51:21):\nThen the next step is the document writing. This is sort of a solo activity that the PM should take on, but the great news is the PM is not starting from scratch. There's so much great stuff to write. If you remember, there's a ton of user insights, a ton of behavioral insights, a ton of competitive analysis. There's the three strategic pillars, how might we's, winning aspiration. There's a whole bunch of illustrative concepts.\n\n(00:51:48):\nOftentimes, product leads have this sort of creator's block. That is solved here completely because you have a ton of great material. I have to tell you, it doesn't make the job easier. You still have to weave together a good story. That's why I think it takes a week or two. I think it's really about combining, connecting and editing at this point and telling a cohesive story from all those components, but I think the building blocks are really solid and defensible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:17):\nIs there a template or kind of sections you like to include in your strategy doc? As someone sits down and is trying to write this out, what do you want to see there as headings?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:52:26):\nI think you could almost take the building blocks as a little bit of a steer for the template. You start with the broader context where you talk about what the leaders kind of want from this overall effort. Then you get into key insights and analysis where you have user insights, behavioral insights, competitive analysis. Then you get into the strategic pillars and you explain them. You also explain why. In the appendix, you include the full table that you generated on day two of your strategy sprint. You include the full table in the appendix, including the criteria. That's going to be really important because most people are going to ask, \"Why did you pick these?\" That's basically sort of the defensibility.\n\n(00:53:17):\nThen you have the winning aspiration that's very bold. It's a big part of the heart of the deck, and you sort of embed the illustrative concepts into the actual each of the strategic pillars so that it flows well. Then finally, you end with some kind of alignment questions like, \"Hey, do these feel right? Are there things we are missing?\" So that it creates that framework for alignment in the subsequent meetings.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:53:52):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:54):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:00):\n... and to scale and watershed, I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina (00:54:09):\nYes, so we just launched one scheme of file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes, as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder.\n\n(00:54:18):\nWe see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:31):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap, and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina (00:54:43):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We are laser focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations.\n\n(00:54:55):\nWe have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:02):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us, and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:55:17):\nI pulled up Playing to Win, which I know you also pull ideas from, and actually Roger Martin was on the podcast talking about this stuff. And one way I think about it as you're describing a way to break up your strategy doc, is he has these five questions that you ask.\n\n(00:55:31):\nThe first is actually what's your winning aspiration? So I love that you're pulling that in. This is one approach your doc would be. What's your winning aspiration? Where will you play? What market are you going after? How will you win? What capabilities must be in place for you to win? And then what management systems are required?\n\n(00:55:46):\nWe'll link to this framework just in case people want that as a crutch in their thinking strategy, but is there anything that we could link folks to that describe how you like to think about this doc? And if not, it'd be cool if you make a template that folks could borrow.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:00):\nI'm happy to share of the flowchart of the process and the template as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:05):\nAwesome. Okay. So this is how long of a process, this writing of the document?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:10):\nIt's about one to two weeks, and I think it's mostly solo work and hopefully by the end of it there's a very tight doc, and that's what we use to roll out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:21):\nAnd by solo work, I imagine you're looping in this working team to get their feedback as you're pulling it together, or is it just you sit there in a room and then...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:27):\nI would minimize pulling them in, because they've all contributed so much to the process already. So, I would say that at the end of it, obviously, once you have a draft, it's good to share with them, but I wouldn't tap their cycles too much at this point, because they've given a lot already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:47):\nI see. Okay.\n\n(00:56:48):\nAnd how many pages do you see this doc being, roughly? What's a heuristic?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:56:52):\nIt's not too long. I would say probably three or four pages and then an appendix has a lot of additional... Like, the table I spoke about and a lot of additional maybe illustrative concepts. Maybe you can only use a few illustrative concepts in the main section so that there could be others there.\n\n(00:57:09):\nI think usually there's a desire from leaders to say, \"Okay, what are we building next?\" And it's important not to include a roadmap as part of a strategy doc, because a strategy doc is meant to be separate from the roadmap. It's meant to be a companion to your roadmap. And even though there's interest, maybe sometimes you can include a illustrative roadmap in the appendix, but I would try to keep it clean and try to keep it focused on just the strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:40):\nSo at this point you basically developed your strategy, the next step, I think you call rollout, where you just start actually rolling this out, so let's talk about that. But it's important to note how many weeks in this is. This is like six-ish weeks of work and you've got a strategy for your company/product?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:57:58):\nThat's exactly right. So I think you're probably in the last two to three weeks of the process, and pretty important final step is the rollout, and I would start with what I call gatekeepers. And these are people who are absolutely... You have to get their one-on-one alignment and blessing on this before it moves forward. And it's probably not too many, probably two or three people. So I would pre-flight it with them and get their alignment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):\nSo these are one-on-one meetings with these gatekeepers?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (00:58:29):\nThese are one-on-one meetings. Exactly.\n\n(00:58:31):\nAnd then there's a larger group of what I call key stakeholders, people who are impacted by it, different functional leaders, et cetera. And that can be done either async or through a group review. And then there's probably a rolling of list of team roadshows. There's different ways to do this, but the one that I feel is most effective is the roadshow where you have about eight to 10 people in each session, so people feel more comfortable to ask questions and it's more conversational.\n\n(00:59:06):\nSo the purpose of this stage is to land it. It's not to seek too much feedback, so it's a delicate balance. At the same time, you don't want to appear just being too inflexible. So it's a very delicate balance. When people ask questions, you can clarify it, and you can add clarifications to the doc, but I wouldn't change... The most important thing, three strategic pillars, I wouldn't change that. I would defend it using the framework, but if people are like, \"there's really good arguments about the criteria that led to your ranking,\" then it's okay to reconsider it. I've not seeing it happen in my five to six attempts, but it's possible, theoretically possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:47):\nThe core of this approach it sounds like, is you've done a lot of the pre-work where you land in a generally correct place.\n\n(00:59:55):\nOkay, so this is the rollout. So what I'm thinking as you talk, say you're like a PM on a team, say you're working on privacy, it's like an IC, your ICPM, working on strategy. How do you think about including, say, your manager because through this process, when do you start to like, \"Hey, here's what we're planning, here's what we're thinking,\" making sure they're on board? Because I could see this working team off to the side working, working, working. \"Okay, we're ready to roll it out.\" Oftentimes there's like, \"No, wait. There's all this other stuff happening at the company, we don't have resources.\" Where do you loop them in? How do you think about that kind of stakeholder?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:00:29):\nThe the more attuned PMs who understand organizational dynamics, probably keep the manager pretty in sync through the process. I think, definitely, the manager becomes a person who you interview as part of the leadership interviews, so you know what the manager's looking for from the effort.\n\n(01:00:49):\nAnd then once you get to the strategic pillars on day two of the strategy sprint, you probably want to just quickly pre-flight it with the manager and say, \"Hey, look, this is how it's trending, and these are the things we are probably not going to do\" and any issues with that. And then eventually you actually want your manager to support you in some of these bigger meetings, so you enlist their help. So I would say that it's probably each individual style, but I would keep them pretty aligned through the process. But you don't have to be too heavy [inaudible 01:01:23], just be super light.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:24):\nGreat. Makes a lot of sense to me. There's like a...\n\n(01:01:26):\nWe're not going to solve everyone's problems with this one framework, maybe just quickly touch on resourcing. As you think about this. Like a part of a strategy includes like, oh, we also need these resources. Just any thoughts on how to include that? And then I want to get into some examples of how you've actually implemented this.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:01:42):\nSo I actually don't recommend thinking about resources in the strategy phase, because what you're saying is, \"these are the areas of focus\" and the resourcing question becomes more relevant from a road mapping standpoint.\n\n(01:01:55):\nBecause then you say, \"Okay, what percentage of our engineering do we put on strategic pillar A, versus B, versus C? And what are the specific things we build?\" So it becomes a road-mapping question as opposed to a strategy question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):\nAnd so by the end of this, the rollout, the part of the rollout is developing the actual roadmap. We're not going to get deep into that. That could be part two, solve every PM's problems, teach them all the steps of the process, but we're going to cut it off at, here's you have a strategy that is starting to be rolled out.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:24):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:25):\nCool.\n\n(01:02:25):\nLet's go through a couple examples where you actually move into this to make this even more real. I know there's a couple companies you were thinking about sharing, strategies you worked on.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:35):\nI think there's just three quick notes to close off this process and I'll share two examples, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:44):\nPerfect.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:02:46):\nSo the reason I think this process works, the first is because there is a ton of alignment built in within team alignment and leadership alignment built in. And it's not seen as, \"Oh, this PM went off and wrote this strategy doc and I don't agree with most of it.\" And part of this is actually very...\n\n(01:03:09):\nIt goes back to human psychology of just something that comes from you, feels a lot more familiar and easy to accept. So this doc is actually not from the PM, the PM is facilitating it, but it's actually from the strategy working group. And the strategy working group are the leads of the team. And so it's actually... And the leadership inputs have been baked in, so it's actually very team representative. And so hopefully there isn't too much misalignment when you roll it out. And I have seen that, I've seen that work out.\n\n(01:03:43):\nThe second is there's just better results. You get to better problem articulation, you get a better strategic pillar, because there's just more minds on it than if it was just a product lead.\n\n(01:03:55):\nAnd the third thing is you have clearly defensible criteria and outputs, and if you want to change it, like I said, you have to go back to the criteria and the scoring and then say, \"Okay, why do we believe this has to be changed?\" And even a change is easy to justify once you do that. So it creates a lot of benefits, but ultimately, and we'll get to this a little bit more, it has to be tested with execution, and that's the most important thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:22):\nI think it's important to highlight, no framework playbook [inaudible 01:04:26] method is going to guarantee you have the correct strategy that will win and your company will thrive. It's always just the best effort at plan.\n\n(01:04:35):\nAs the quote, \"no good plan survives first contact with the customer.\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:04:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:42):\nCool. Let's talk through some examples.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:04:45):\nso the first example I wanted to talk about is at Zynga. I was at Zynga a very long time ago, and this was the heyday of social gaming on Facebook. The thing that I was extremely impressed about Zynga was the strategic clarity and strategic encoding at the company. And this was not attributable to me, by the way, this was already there when I got there as a entry-level PM, but the kind of strategic clarity there was really, really impressive and it was very evident and observable from all the games.\n\n(01:05:22):\nSo if you look at all the games, there were three elements that were very common across all the games. The first was viral game loops. There's these game loops that just required you to have a social and active social network to be successful and play, and it was very tightly and fictionally integrated into the core of the gameplay. That was the first one.\n\n(01:05:47):\nThe second one was there was this idea of paying to complete things. So you're not paying to skip a whole experience, what you're paying is just to complete it. So what happens then is different people, depending on how much time they have, complete different percentages of a progression task, or a part of the gameplay, and you only had to pay the rest to get through the experience. And it was this interesting experience where people put a lot of investment into it, and they didn't mind paying for the last 20% or 30%, which was very interesting, because it created this market for different elasticity of spend, different times that people had in their lives. And it was very, very clever. So that was again, very common across all the games.\n\n(01:06:38):\nAnd then the third was network. So all of Zynga games had this cross-promotional component at the top of the game and they would promote other games, and it's like the Zynga network was the most important thing, and not an individual game. And those were the three in our parlance now strategic pillars, and there were non-focus areas. It wasn't like...\n\n(01:07:05):\nThe focus wasn't on high-fidelity graphics, it wasn't on complex game mechanics, and this was extremely clear and hard-coded into the company culture and operations. And it was perfectly tuned to the environment at the time. Facebook platform afforded strong support with social graph, and channels, and basically the game studios contributed through different games in a very network accretive way.\n\n(01:07:31):\nSo for example, I was at Zynga San Diego, and we took the company into net new game genres like action strategy, match three puzzle games, but we stayed true to the strategic pillars of the company, and we had to invent new mechanics so that the strategic pillars would work in the new genres that we introduced to the company. And what was fascinating is the company actually had systems to reinforce these strategic pillars.\n\n(01:07:57):\nAnd, for example, the data infrastructure was very incredible at the time, and really reinforced these strategic pillars. There was this function called Central Product Management, which basically propagated best practices, made sure that games were network accretive and all these things worked in harmony to enhance those strategic pillars and reinforce it, and it worked really well. The company, if I remember right, got to a billion dollars, it was the fastest to get to a billion dollars in the history of companies at the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):\nIn revenue.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:08:33):\nIn revenue.\n\n(01:08:35):\nAnd it worked really well until the environment changed and there was a shift to mobile. And temporarily... Basically, if you go back to that resonance concept, that deep resonance between the product and the market was temporarily lost once that shift happened to mobile.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nSo there's a lot here. I think one interesting note here is, as you said, the strategy work you're doing, which sounds like a lot of time, eight to 12 weeks potentially, this lasted a long time for Zynga. And so I think it's important to remember the work you're doing here, even though...\n\n(01:09:06):\nOn the one hand it feels like a long time, on the other hand, it feels like very little time to come up with the things that will most help your business grow. In this case, these three elements for Zynga. And by the way, these three pillars, they didn't emerge from this method, but it helped you see the power of being very clear...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:09:24):\nClear, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:25):\nAnd having everything centered around, we all agree, these are the three ways we win. Okay, cool. And then I think the number three, again, I just want to highlight the power of just very few bets in investments. So it's always three. I've always suggested three as well. Some people are like, \"three to five,\" but I think it's... You just find, in general, three is the right number as much? Try very, very hard to make it three?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:09:46):\nI agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:47):\nOkay, cool.\n\n(01:09:48):\nAnd then I think there's also this element of differentiation being really important. So these three elements you shared for Zynga are just like they're unique and differentiated for Zynga. Network, powers of apps driving other apps, paying to complete, these are things Zynga has figured out, \"this is how we\" win versus other products in the market.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:10:08):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:09):\nSweet. Anything else along those lines with Zynga?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:10:13):\nThat was in hindsight reflection, Lenny, I was pretty naive when I was there, and I realized how... And this was, in fact, what led to my blind spot when I joined Headspace from Zynga, that you even need a strategy. That's the story I said at the beginning.\n\n(01:10:33):\nThe reason is because Zynga had it figured out so well that I didn't actually have a need to exercise that muscle at Zynga, and we just had to come up with new games that applied that strategy. And so it was a net new muscle I had to develop when I got to Headspace.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:48):\nIt's like that parable of the fish swimming in the water where the older fish swims by and he's like, \"How's the water?\" And they're like, \"Hmm?\" And then he leaves and he's like, \"What's water?\" You just don't realize what you're in. You don't realize what you're surrounded by until it's gone.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:06):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:07):\nMaybe one other thing I just want to highlight while we're on this topic is just the power of focus. In the case of Zynga, just this focus on everything we do needs to get these things, these three things, everything we do, we need to do in order to win. And I think that's a recurring theme in what you're talking about, is just focus. The steps of the process are focus on this one part for now. So I think that's a really interesting thread is just the power of focus.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:32):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:33):\nOkay, cool.\n\n(01:11:35):\nAnd now you have another example of your time at Meta.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:11:37):\nAt Meta there's this fascinating example, which I think illustrates a different point, which is...\n\n(01:11:46):\nBasically I was standing up the product strategy for a couple of product growth teams in Reality Labs, Oculus, which was coming up with the Quest II at the time. This is a standalone headset, and then Portal, which was our video conferencing product. And we stood up these teams to go after product growth, which is basically driving hardware sales through software features. And we went through this process that I just described. We stood up strategic pillars, and the strategic pillars were fairly similar for both Portal, which is our video conferencing product, and Oculus.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:24):\nI love Portal by the way. I was a big fan of... Sad that it's no longer around.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:12:31):\nAnd that led to features that are known to everybody, like the Oculus Referrals Program, the Portal Memories Integration, where you see one of your Facebook memories on the Portal, sponsored ad in your Facebook feed. And also we had this section on the Facebook app, which is also from Facebook at the time, and then eventually also from Meta, which is these other products from the Facebook ecosystem. And all those came out of that effort.\n\n(01:13:01):\nAnd about 18 months into it, they actually had very different outcomes. So on one hand the Oculus effort was incredibly successful, and we graduated it into the VR division at Meta, and till today it continues to be an incredibly successful effort. The Portal effort actually didn't move the needle as much as we wanted to, and we sunset it, and we basically redeployed that team to other initiatives. And that's super interesting. Basically it was like the same strategy process. We got the nearly identical strategic pillars, but eventually completely different outcomes.\n\n(01:13:49):\nAnd I think that that illustrates the most important point about strategy, which is intrinsically strategy has no business value. It's basically a document with a few words. And I think it starts accumulating value as you generate business impact and results. And that happens when you actually test strategy with execution.\n\n(01:14:15):\nAnd so ultimately any strategy is only as good as the results it produces. And so one has to have the intellectual honesty, and the humility, and the courage to say when it's working and when it's not. And sometimes what happens is parts of your strategy might work, parts might not, and you have to pivot away from some and double down on some. But I do think there's that evaluation that's really critical and testing strategy with execution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):\nSuch a great point. Just a strategy sitting there in a doc is worthless, where the worth comes from, is it actually having impact and being successful. Makes me think about a product manager also, just a PM is not worth anything until they help you drive impact.\n\n(01:15:02):\nI think an important, to trickle down from that point, is that you don't want to spend too long just thinking about strategy, you want to spend as little time as possible to get to a strong hypothesis, basically to start learning if this is the right path. And so I love that your approach is like this middle ground between give it real time, but don't spend three, four or five months working on this one document that just maybe one day you'll use.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:15:31):\nExactly.\n\n(01:15:31):\nAnd there is room for a six-month process, which we'll get to in a moment. But for small S I wouldn't recommend more than two or three months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:39):\nAnd again, small S strategy is for a couple of years out, not like Exactly. It's like a timeframe. Okay, cool.\n\n(01:15:47):\nOkay. Anything else along those lines of the examples of Meta or Zynga?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:15:53):\nThose are pretty good lessons I would say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:55):\nOkay, sweet.\n\n(01:15:56):\nSo, let's talk about big-S strategy. When should you approach strategy this way and what are just the steps of it?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:16:06):\nSo everything we've spoken about so far is what I would call small S, and it's very problem focused. It's basically what I call present forward.\n\n(01:16:17):\nIt's like you have something, you have a product out there, it has a bunch of problems. How do we make it better for... What are the areas we tackle for maximum impact? Typically led by product managers. And there's this interesting quote by Elon Musk, which is, \"Life has to be about more than just solving problems.\" And he says it in the context of the aspiration to become a multi-planetary species, but I think this is true of every company, big or small. And there needs to be an aspirational and cool component to strategy. And I call this big-S strategy.\n\n(01:16:56):\nI'll run through this at a higher level because I think this is a little bit more fluid in how you build the big-S strategy. And it typically takes longer, potentially up to about six months. The approach is a bit different from small S. And you start with the company mission and vision, and there is a little bit of groundwork that is done on long-term cultural trends, social trends, competitive trends, technological trends, and those are all the backdrop to trigger ideas. And what you do with that backdrop is you, again, do these leadership interviews, but with a different goal of generating long-term futures.\n\n(01:17:41):\nAnd some of the questions you can ask during these interviews are \"What does a day in the life of a user look like in five years? What does the product look like in five to 10 years? Why is the world better in 10 years? And what is the most exciting version of that view?\" And basically take all of that input and cluster it into I would say, three cohesive holes.\n\n(01:18:05):\nAnd what I mean by that is three, at least fairly distinct, descriptions of the future. So to give you almost a very simple example, imagine you doing big S for the future of travel. You could have a future that is talking all about fully autonomous travel, where there's very little human involvement in going from A to B. You could talk about another future where there's extreme speed, where you can get from A to B really fast across the world that is really fast. You could talk about a third where there is no travel, it's virtual travel, and you still have the feeling of travel, and you accomplish the same goals.\n\n(01:18:45):\nBut those are different futures, they have different properties, like different elements to them. And once you generate those distinct futures, you actually generate prototypes with learning goals. And think of these prototypes as concept cars. And the automobile industry uses this notion of concept cars. Concept cars, the interesting thing about concept cars is they're never commercialized. They're often produced for inspiration, and to potentially take some part of them, like maybe a technology or a feature, and that is brought into mainstream production.\n\n(01:19:23):\nSo think of these prototypes as these concept cars that really drive inspiration and potentially give you some small nuggets that you can run with. And then you start doing research with them with potential users, you answer key questions, and you uncover certain elements that resonate with people. So you eliminate a whole bunch of stuff, you combine a whole bunch of stuff, and you establish some winning components that are interesting.\n\n(01:19:48):\nAnd then what you do is you push stuff that is winning into the product, live product, testing. So this is actually something that you actually want to start testing your way into and understanding if it works from a scalable standpoint. And this whole thing is typically led not by the PM team, but by design and UXR. And intentionally it's a little bit more open-ended and green field. And it actually is a very different mind space that people have when they approach big. So the roadmap is really built through a combination of small-S and big-S work. And, for example, at VRChat, we are doing both small-S and big-S work, Lenny. And they are run as parallel work streams. The product management team is leading the charge of the small-S work, and the design team is leading the charge on the big-S work. And it's really exciting stuff. What's coming out of both work streams is really exciting and really different. And so we are building the bridge from both sides and both work streams ultimately flow into one roadmap. It's almost like two tributaries that ultimately merge into one river. That's how I would think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):\nThere's so many things here that are so...\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:01):\nThat's how I would think about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:02):\nThere's so many things here that are so interesting. One is we've had this conversation on the podcast a couple of times, this point that people think and see the world differently. Some people are very open-minded and creative, and think big, blue sky people. Some people, me, just like, \"What are we doing next? How do we move this metric? Let's talk about concrete things that we can do?\" For this big S approach, I think what I'm hearing is make sure the people leading it are very open-minded, creative, blue sky type people. If you're the person that's like, \"How will this move our metric?\" Maybe you shouldn't be leading it and give someone else the reins.\n\n(01:21:40):\nCool. And then with these timelines of doing both at once, it's probably hard to align them fully. So what I'm hearing is it's like these are kind of ongoing sometimes.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:49):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):\nAnd they'll both inform what you're doing. You don't need to have this perfect timeline of-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:21:54):\nI agree to this. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:56):\nSweet. And the big thinking I love, because sometimes, you may experience this, designers often are like, \"Oh, we just work on all this boring, incremental optimization stuff. I want to think bigger.\" Which is great, and this is a really good lever to allow for that in a contained environment. Cool. Let's just go crazy. Let's think about what this could be in the future. Still, let's make sure we're moving some metrics short-term, but let's give us opportunity to think big. And oftentimes the biggest ideas come out of that. So I love it's giving space for both types of thinking, thinking bigger and thinking long term.\n\n(01:22:30):\nAnything else about these two methods that might be interesting to share? Otherwise, I want to talk about AI a little bit, just how that impacts things and a couple other things.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:22:39):\nYeah, yeah. I'll end on one short sort of note on how this all feels when you do it, and then we can segue into AI-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:47):\nGreat, great.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:22:48):\n... Lenny. So I think that whether it's big S or small S, these are incredibly satisfying processes to go through in the end. So once you get to the end, they're incredibly deeply satisfying. But with anything in life that is very deeply satisfying at the end, they have a ton of challenge, frustration, and dead ends while you go through it where you kind of get a lot of self-doubt like, \"Hey, will you ever reach the end?\" And I just want to sort of normalize that. That's actually normal and I want people to expect that as they go through it. And I think that's what makes it even more rewarding when you get to that sort of point where you start to see things connecting.\n\n(01:23:33):\nThe second thing is I would say that the person who's leading the charge on these efforts has to be really good at connecting diverse viewpoints and keeping them all moving forward. And it's not easy, it's very hard because sometimes you have people who take you in different directions and you have to keep it all hanging together.\n\n(01:23:57):\nSo in terms of picking people who have that skill, who are good integrators, who are good connect the dots, I think it's critical for these to be successful. And in some ways low ego because it's not like... They do get to introduce their own ideas, but truly, it's about bringing the team together. So that's the skill that you should look for for these leads.\n\n(01:24:22):\nAnd then the third piece is I would say that I would just approach these with a little bit of a lighter touch and more playful sort of approach, because it's an intensive process, it's a long process. And people can get tired, they can find it grindy. So just having a little bit of playfulness along the way goes a long way in making it feel more tolerable for the people going through it. So those are some thoughts about either of these processes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nThat was really important context, especially this will be frustrating throughout. It sounds really beautiful and great and smooth as you describe it. In reality, there's a lot of pain that goes into... Because you're making hard decisions. A lot of people have opinions, they have perspectives, there's data that's... Rarely is there clear answer from the beginning, so I think that's really important context.\n\n(01:25:08):\nI wanted to actually come back to your point you made about how Elon made this point about life shouldn't just be about solving problems. I think part of that quote is just like we should work on things that are awesome and exciting and inspiring, that aren't just immediately pain solvers. And he's very good at that, just inspiring people to what could be, and we should be thinking much bigger than we are.\n\n(01:25:32):\nI was actually at an interview with Zuck where he said the same thing. He's probably inspired by Elon. He's like, \"I've just gotten to a point in my career where I want to work on awesome stuff, stuff that is just awe inspiring, not just-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:25:43):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:44):\n... another social feature.\" so I think that's a really important point. And there's a lot of power in that. People get really excited about holy moly, I did not imagine this is what Headspace could become, what VRChat could become, what Meta could become. It's just really powerful, getting people really inspired. And I love this process they shared of how to do that.\n\n(01:26:03):\nAnd I didn't actually summarize it, so I have it right here in front of me. I'll just share the five steps of the biggest process. So it's preparation, mission, you figure [inaudible 01:26:10] mission, vision, trends, interview people about where they think things are going. Then you come up with three distinct futures of what the future might look like if you were to do the things you're thinking. Then you build prototypes of what might this look like? And then you actually test these in your product, which I love, to start de-risking these ideas. That helps you converge to here's actual plan we want to execute, and then you turn that into roadmap.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:26:36):\nYeah, yeah. And the first testing of the prototypes is with UXR, so it's more sort of concept testing or prototype testing with a handful of users. And then you use that as synthesizing to a live product test.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:50):\nGreat. Basically, it's like big ideas and then de-risking, validating them along the way-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:26:51):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:55):\n... in various ways to like, \"Okay, maybe this could actually work. Let's try.\" Sweet. Okay, so just two more things. One is I want to talk about AI briefly, of how that impacts this work. And then two, just maybe a recap of the framework for people that are listening, you're like, \"Oh my god, I have so much. I wrote all these notes.\" Let's give them a summary so they could remember to use it.\n\n(01:27:14):\nOkay, cool. So let's talk about AI briefly. How has AI tooling helped you evolve this process? How can people use AI to make this easier?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:27:24):\nSo the first disclaimer is I'm not sort of an AI futurist, but I read all the emerging stuff that's coming out, most of the emerging stuff that's coming out and use some of the tools. And it's fascinating what's happening. And I think it will definitely have an impact on strategy formulation. So what I'll share is what resonates for me in the context of strategy formulation with AI.\n\n(01:27:52):\nSo right away, I think the basic idea is everybody should be using assistance in the strategy formulation process with the basic tools that we have. And there are two ways to get AI to assist you in the strategy formulation process. The first is to support the preparation phase in terms of research. And this could be competitive analysis and, for example, you could do trend analysis from a vast library of competitors' release notes. And you can sort of say, \"Okay, what are the themes of investment of a competitor's release notes?\" Or you could do a reviews analysis of a competitor product and sort of understand what's resonating for users, what's not. And you could also ask a tool like ChatGPT to do a head-to-head comparison between a few players on a certain dimension and really give you a heat map of how they all stack up. And you could also ask an open-ended question like, \"Hey, why is this new product so successful? Why is it getting so many users?\" And there's some good hypothesis that you usually get. So really leverage in sort of the preparation phase from a competitive analysis standpoint.\n\n(01:29:12):\nThe second one is in this idea called generating mock strategies. And I know Claire Rowe at your summit spoke about this, and I think this is absolutely right and should be a critical input into the strategy process, which is asking these tools for a mock strategy. And I call this a mock strategy because it's kind of almost the answer but not quite the answer. So what I've found is that these mock strategies, like let's say I support VRChat now and I ask it like, \"Hey, what should VRChat do? How should we grow?\" And it generates a mock strategy.\n\n(01:29:49):\nWhat I've found is that it's, one, surprisingly good. It's incredibly well-informed and well-articulated. I've also found that its biggest strength is also somewhat its weakness, which is these mock strategies tend to be pretty comprehensive and extensive, and there's an investment recommendation in a vast number of areas. So basically, if you remember, the core of strategy is really to be very targeted and to be very focused. So these mock strategies become an interesting input and the burden is still on the team to down-select into the most important areas for investment. So forcing that choice still, I think, is a human element and needs that layer of additional judgment, which is very context specific to the company. So this is sort of right away, I think people should be doing this.\n\n(01:30:44):\nI think more medium term and probably not too distant future and likely sooner than we all think, there's probably going to be, sort of the model that resonates with me is sort of the multi-agent model, which is you probably have different components of the strategy workflow automated. So you probably have a strategy agent, you probably have a roadmap or feature agent, you have maybe a engineering agent, and these can communicate amongst each other to cycle through results and iterate. And I think Armand Ruiz from IBM has some good definitional frameworks on some of the stuff. He shares it often on LinkedIn.\n\n(01:31:27):\nBut let's take a simple example. I can easily imagine something like this for a topic like onboarding. So every company and product team obsesses about their onboarding experience. And today, there are advanced experimentation frameworks. So imagine you're expecting a large surge in traffic. There's these sort of experimental frameworks like multi-armed bandits that can really help you get to the optimal sort of variation very quickly in real time. And there are variations of that, like contextual multi-armed bandits, there's combinatorial bandits.\n\n(01:32:04):\nBut the interesting thing is they still rely on human design of the variations, the different variations that you test. Even though the experimentation framework is very sophisticated, the variations are still human generated. Now imagine if those variations could actually be generated through generative AI and could be plugged into the advanced experimentation frameworks. The possibilities become infinite. And really, you might be surprised by what you find is the winning onboarding experience that you couldn't even have humanly imagined. And it might be different for every user, different for every sort of territory, etc.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:44):\nThat is such a cool idea, I just want to say. This agent that's just running, thinking about ways to optimize your onboarding, coming up with concepts that you probably review, like, \"Cool, let's try it.\" And then it does it, ships an experiment to run it and just is constantly optimizing your onboarding. Holy shit, that's an awesome idea. I think everyone will have this.\n\n(01:33:06):\nAnd then what that makes me think there's going to be some company that's built the best onboarding agent. That's what you're going to be paying for.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:33:14):\nTotally. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:14):\nOh my god, that's so good. Okay. Great. Great idea.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:33:16):\nYeah, yeah. So then the question becomes, hey, what is our job? Our job becomes architecting bigger and bigger pieces of the product to take advantage of these agents. And there will be a sequential increase in the complexity of workloads that get automated over time. Onboarding is probably relatively on the easier side in terms of complexity of workload. And you get into deeper experiences, eventually AI will get there.\n\n(01:33:44):\nSo funnily enough, when that happens, some of the manual processes I describe about will seem archaic. But I think the fundamentals will still have a long shelf life, and as you think about these automated frameworks as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:59):\nMan, this could be its own podcast. I have this whole post about how AI, how PMs are the best position, role in tech to thrive in a world of AI, which I'll link to that makes people, I find, feel better when they hear you talk about how much might get done through agents in AI.\n\n(01:34:14):\nThe other quick thought I had, and I want to get to the wrap up, is I have this ongoing debate with a friend about strategy in AI. My feeling is in theory, an AI tool will be incredibly good at coming up with your strategy for you because it's just, here's all the data, here's everything you need to know, how do we win? And to me, that feels like the ultimate way AI is good, is just here's data, here's what I found as a path to a winning. But my friend's also arguing that's the one thing that AI will be least good at because that's where we need people and context and discussion, all these things.\n\n(01:34:53):\nI don't know, it's like one or the other. Either AI will be incredibly good at helping you figure out your strategy or the worst.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:34:58):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:00):\nI'm curious. I'm curious, I guess, do you have any quick thoughts on that? Where do you side?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:35:05):\nI think there is a crossover point where the human judgment will be inferior to something that's able to process multiple signals simultaneously. There's an element of lateral thinking as well here, and I'll sort of share a simple example.\n\n(01:35:24):\nFor those who drive Tesla cars with the fully self-driving capabilities, when you make a turn, humans have this fairly narrow field of vision. So you have to look both ways and you have to make a decision combining both those signals, right? Whereas the car has six cameras, which is simultaneously processing and it can make a decision not in sequence, but in parallel. And it moves with confidence at turnings because of that. So there is this crossover point where some of these, the ability to hold multiple signals in the head, it's going to be more... It's going to be stronger.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:09):\nThat makes total sense. What it makes me think about, there's going to be a strategy agent just sitting around always looking for ways to improve your strategy and point you all in a different direction. Oh my god, future is wild, as I've said before.\n\n(01:36:21):\nOkay, let's do a quick wrap up of the process for folks that are taking notes and they're like, \"Cool, here's the overview.\" So let's just do that and then let's go to get to the exciting lightning round.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:36:31):\nI think the quick recap of everything we've covered is that product strategy definitionally sits between mission vision at the top and plan at the bottom. So it sits between those two either at the company level or at the team level. What it does is it forces choice to deploy scarce resources towards maximum impact. And think about the frequency selection and resonance as an analogy, and it ideally includes three components. A handful of areas to focus on, which we call strategic pillars, and several areas that are explicitly not the focus and why. That's really it in terms of what product strategy is.\n\n(01:37:12):\nThere is a smallest flavor of it which focuses on solving problems. It's what I call present forward, and it typically operates in a two-year horizon. We use a five-stage process to get there, and it takes about eight to 12 weeks. There is a biggest process that focuses on an aspirational future, is future backward and typically has a three, five, 10-year horizon, also a five-stage process, and can be ongoing up to a six-month period to give it enough space to generate something exciting.\n\n(01:37:47):\nAnd the roadmap for the company or the team is built from a combination of smallest and biggest work, which is like building a bridge from both sides of a river. And ultimately, any strategy is only as good as the results it can produce. So test and iterate through execution and double down on what's working and pivot away from what's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:10):\nIncredible. I'm glad we did that. Anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:18):\nJust all the best with strategy work and ultimately individual and business success.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:26):\nAmazing. And when I asked you at the beginning, before we started recording, what your goal was for this conversation, your answer was just to create a ripple of success across companies and teams, and I feel like we've done that.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:36):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:37):\nOkay. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning ground. Chandra, are you ready?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:41):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:43):\nLet's do it. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:38:47):\nYeah, I love books on creativity and innovation, Lenny, and some of my classic favorites are Walt Disney's biography. And there's several out there, but I think the one that I like the most is the Triumph of the American Imagination. And what's interesting is it talks about how Walt Disney actually loved the theme parks more than the movies. And the reason for that was he could actually tinker with the theme parks. He could make changes to where the rides were, he could change rides in and out, and then he could observe real sort of changes to reactions of people flowing into the theme parks, which he couldn't do with the movies because once it was produced, it was done, it was out of his control. And it was interesting, he was basically A-B testing long before the term was coined. And it's just a fascinating look into how his brain worked, way ahead of its time.\n\n(01:39:46):\nThe other classic is Ed Catmull's Creativity Inc, and it talks about all the negative forces that eat away at creativity in an organization. How do you, as the leader, have to keep them at bay and make sure the team can innovate?\n\n(01:40:01):\nAnd then there's this probably less popular book, but really good one from Tom Kelly of IDEO, which is The Ten Faces of Innovation. It talks about different archetypes that you need on the team that are essential for creating something special. And you actually need, I think there's the devil's advocate, you need the researcher, you need the ethnographer, you need the stage setter. There's all these interesting personalities that you need to actually make something successful. So I would say those are some of the ones that I usually recommend, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:37):\nThat's a really cool... That third book is really interesting, I haven't heard of that. And Creativity Inc, something I want to highlight real quick is to your point, that a lot of it is how to avoid killing good ideas. And my favorite metaphor from that book is the ugly baby metaphor where every new idea is an ugly baby that people just want to get rid of. Get rid of this ugly baby, we don't want this around here. And just every new idea is ugly when it starts, and you need to protect the ugly baby, basically. Although I don't know who's hurting ugly babies, that's not-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:06):\nYeah, yeah, it feels a bit... Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:08):\nFeels aggressive.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:08):\nHarsh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:11):\nYeah, harsh. Yeah. But it's memorable because I've never forgotten that.\n\n(01:41:14):\nOkay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:41:19):\nYeah, yeah. We watch a lot of animated films with the kids. But were a couple of good movies this year. We really liked If, Imaginary Friend, it's about growing up and forgetting these memories of your younger days, is was a really nice movie. And then of course, we enjoyed Dune II as well. It was a fun watch. But most of our time is dominated by the kids sort of animated folks at home or the cinema.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:53):\nThere's a new Dune TV show, I don't know if you've been watching it. It just started recently on HBO. It's not the best thing in the world, but it gets you a little Dune fix-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:42:01):\nInteresting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:02):\n... in between movies. I think there's a third movie coming out.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:42:04):\nI see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:06):\nThird question, do you have a favorite product you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:42:10):\nYeah, yeah. I've been playing this cute little game for the last few days. It's called Capybara Go! It's a tab-based strategy RPG game. It's got really humorous writing and this cute capybara that goes off on an adventure. It's very well-paced and it's a very well-produced game. It's one game I've been playing recently.\n\n(01:42:37):\nI've also been poking around Bluesky. Bluesky is interesting. I haven't gotten into a habit yet, but it's super interesting concept of empowering the community with these community-generated feeds. It's very different experience. But it's also interesting, there's a trade-off with the simplicity of the product and what you get with the additional complexity. It'll be interesting to see how it plays out, how it scales.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:05):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:43:10):\nSo there was this 1995 interview of Steve Jobs where he talks about this idea of there's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product, and it sort of stuck with me over the years. And the simple way to think about that is it takes a lot of effort to make something special. And conversely, if it's easy, it's probably not that special or not that great. And it's something that I sort of think about when we build product, is there sufficient pain here where it's sort of a proxy for, are we creating something great, is interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:53):\nWow. It makes me think about founder mode a little bit. Like people talk about founder mode. The reason founder mode I think is important is the people that are most committed and passionate and driven to go through that pain and continue to make it... To take it from just an ugly baby idea to an awesome winning product oftentimes needs to be the founder. And that's why I think it's kind of emerged as a trend is it's important to have that drive, to just-\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:43:54):\nSurely. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:22):\n... continue to refine it and not just like, \"I had the idea, go build it now.\"\n\n(01:44:27):\nOkay, final question. You have an amazing background behind you. [inaudible 01:44:31] if people are on YouTube, it's just a beautiful book background, a bunch of objects and books. I'm curious if there's an object on there or a book on there that might be fun to highlight that you're especially into or proud of. And feel free to turn around if you want to look around. Curious if there's one thing that stands out, like, \"Oh, here's this thing, [inaudible 01:44:48].\"\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:44:48):\nOh, well, it's the picture of my kids right in the center, which is without doubt the most important and memorable thing there. It's also caught it a unique time when they were incredibly... They were sort of super embracing each other and it's a phase where they've grown out of it. Now there's a lot more, I think rivalry and then sibling tussles. But that moment is my favorite.\n\n(01:45:18):\nI also have a bunch of fun stuff, like a big sort of Snoopy fan, and so it is... Also a big Beetles fan, so that picture is actually an interesting blend between Snoopy walking, crossing the road and then the Beetles crossing the other way. And then a bunch of books that are more memorable over the years. You'll see Creativity Inc there, you'll see The Ten Phases of Innovation, all of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:45):\nAmazing. Thank you for sharing... Your kids' photo's blocked when you're in the center, so it's like a little Easter egg. Thank you for sharing that. Chandra, this was incredible. It was everything I was hoping it'd be. I think we're going to create that ripple that you were hoping for.\n\n(01:45:57):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:46:02):\nA reasonable choice would be LinkedIn to reach me, and I really, like you and I discussed earlier, I'd be really happy if this creates that kind of ripple effect of successes, both for individuals and for products. And I want everybody to think of this, the stuff I shared as a bit of an open source model. So test some of the concepts, modify it, remix it, and share what worked or did not. And ultimately, that's what makes it all interesting is the community owns it ultimately, and it doesn't belong to one individual. That's what would make me super happy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:44):\nAmazing. Chandra, thank you so much for being here.\n\nChandra Janakiraman (01:46:48):\nThank you so much for having me, Lenny, and thanks for your service to the product community.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):\nSame to you. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:46:57):\nThank you so much for listening.

I was 52, the average age was 26. I had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):\nIt's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode.\n\nChip Conley (00:00:18):\nBrian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration. His point of view is like, \"Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock. Be there.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nEveryone's talking about, \"We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button, and improve conversion.\"\n\nChip Conley (00:00:32):\nIsn't the product the homes and the apartments? Jobot said, \"Nope. Product in the tech industry is something different.\" I just said, \"Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nThis whole story is a really good example of the value of having folks that are older.\n\nChip Conley (00:00:45):\nWhen you have older brains connecting the dots, younger team members being really fast and focused, it's brilliant, and people won't notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nThe Airbnb experienced led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy.\n\nChip Conley (00:00:59):\nIf you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. Midlife is not crisis. I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):\nWell, let's back up a little bit, this near death experience. Today, my guest is Chip Conley. Chip is one of the most extraordinary and interesting people that you'll ever meet. He was a founding member of the board of Burning Nan. He was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur. At 26, he started a hotel chain called Joie de Vivre, which went on to become the second-largest boutique hotel chain in the US.\n\n(00:01:32):\nAfter selling it, Brian Chesky personally recruited Chip to join Airbnb to help Brian and the company transform from a fast-growing startup to the world's most valuable hospitality brand. After leaving Airbnb where he was known as the Modern Elder, chip started the Modern Elder Academy, now known as MEA, the world's first midlife wisdom school, with large sprawling, beautiful campuses in Baja and Santa Fe. He's also written seven books, given a TED Talk, and is just a genuinely interesting and amazing human and friend.\n\n(00:02:01):\nIn our conversation, we explore how to be successful in tech as you age, what he's learned working with and for Brian Chesky, including a lot of real talk, how to build a great culture at your company, his near-death experience, and how it changed the trajectory of his life, and so much more.

This episode is brought to you by Great Question: the all-in-one UX research platform loved by teams at Brex, Canva, Intuit, and more.\n\n(00:02:51):\nOne of the most common things I hear from PMs and founders that I talk to is, \"I know I should be speaking to customers more, but I just don't have the time or the tools.\" That's exactly the gap Great Question fills. Great Question makes it easy for anyone on your team, not just researchers, to recruit participants, run interviews, send surveys, test prototypes, and then share it all with powerful video clips. It's everything you need to put your customers at the center of your product decisions.\n\n(00:03:15):\nWith a prompt as simple as, \"Why did users choose us over competitors?\" Great Question not only reveals what your customers have already shared, but it also makes it incredibly easy to ask them in the moment for fresh insights from the right segment. Picture this: your roadmaps clear, your team's aligned, you're shipping with confidence, and you're building exactly what your customers need. Head to greatquestion.com/Lenny to get started.

Chip, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nChip Conley (00:04:38):\nOh, my god, Lenny, I sort of feel like I'm your father who's so proud of his son. My son has done so well, and I like to talk about, tell all my friends about you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):\nWow, I am honored. I'm happy that I'm making you proud, Chip, and I feel the same in reverse. We got to work together for many years at Airbnb. I got to learn a ton from you. I'm really excited that more people are going to get to learn from you from this conversation. I'm thinking that the way that we break up this conversation is kind of break it up into three parts, which are kind of the three arcs of your career. The three parts are your early career, building Joie de Vivre, your time at Airbnb, where we got to work together, and then talking through what you're working on now, the Modern Elder Academy.\n\n(00:05:22):\nI actually want to start with the middle chapter. I'm going to talk about Airbnb where we got to work together. Let's paint a picture of just what it was like for you to join Airbnb in your fifties surrounded by a bunch of 20 something, 30 somethings reporting to Brian Chesky, who is, I don't know, in his thirties. What was that like?\n\nChip Conley (00:05:41):\nYeah, I wasn't planning on doing this. I got a call from a woman named Natalie Tucci who worked at Airbnb, and said, \"Brian Chesky and I've been talking about having you come in and give a talk. Are you open to that?\" I was like, \"Well, what is Airbnb?\" This was 13 years ago, I think it was the end of 2012. Then Brian called me and said, \"Listen, we really want you to come in.\" I came in and gave a talk about innovation and hospitality.\n\n(00:06:14):\nI think I didn't realize it was sort of a dress rehearsal for Brian to see whether the younger crowd there, I was 52, the average age was 26, would feel good about an old geezer like me with a bricks and mortar boutique hotel background, talking about the industry that Airbnb was disrupting. As it turns out, people liked me. Brian said, \"I want you to come in and work 15 hours a week as a consultant. I want you to be my in-house mentor for both me, and Joe and Nate.\" I said, \"Okay, 15 hours a week is great,\" and then within three weeks, it was 15 hours a day.\n\n(00:07:00):\nI was saying to Brian, \"You're actually not paying me anything.\" He gave me a little bit of stock that would vest in six months and I said, \"I don't know that this deal's working for me. It seems like the company needs to be a little more than you said.\" He said, \"Yeah, I got you. I just wanted you to get in here and see what you could do.\" Long story short is I ended up going full-time. It was hard at first, Lenny, because I didn't understand the tech lingo. I didn't have any background. I was 52. I'd never worked in a tech company before.\n\n(00:07:42):\nI was mentoring Brian on leadership, but he was also my boss. I was the head of global hospitality and strategy, which meant initially, I was in charge of all the hosts in the world. Over time, that meant a lot more things too. I was involved in many parts of the business, definitely not the technical parts, but I think the hardest thing for me was just that initially, when people were talking about product, and Jobot said, \"I'm the chief product officer,\" and I'm like, \"Well, isn't the product the homes and the apartments?\" Jobot said, \"No, product in the tech industry is something different.\"\n\n(00:08:23):\nI had to be both wise and curious, and often the dumbest person in the room. It required me to have a certain amount of humility as well as to be reporting to a guy 21 years younger than me, Brian.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:36):\nThat actually, the point you're making there about what is the product I asked Laura Hughes, formerly Laura Modi, what to talk to you about, who we got to work together. She's the CEO of Bobbie now. You worked closely with her at Airbnb. She said this was the thing that stuck with her most about working with you is coming in and everyone's talking about, \"We got to make the product better. We got to optimize this button and improve conversion, and product, product, product.\"\n\n(00:08:59):\nYou're just like, \"What is the product? I thought the product of Airbnb was the hosts, and the experiences, and the trips.\" I think that shows the value of someone like you coming in with different experience, and also older, and helping us communicate differently to hosts who also don't understand.\n\nChip Conley (00:09:15):\nWell, there's an interesting thing also, Lenny, and you notice the difference in age between our hosts and our guests was probably about 10 years maybe. Over time, it actually got higher, because we started actually reaching out more aggressively to boomers and Gen Xers to be hosts. You had, I remember at one point, and again, let's get into a product talk here, I remember at one point, there was a conversation that was going on about taking Airbnb so it was mobile only.\n\n(00:09:47):\nPartly because back in the day, the two sharing economy darlings were Uber and Airbnb. Of course, Uber was pretty much a mobile only app. Airbnb started as non-mobile and then went mobile. Then it was like, \"Oh, wouldn't it be interesting if everything was mobile?\" At some point, I just said, \"Listen, let's get some older people who are hosts in here to see how well they will be versed in managing their listing purely on mobile.\"\n\n(00:10:18):\nThere were times where I was a voice for older users, in this case, hosts, that was helpful to guys and women in their twenties who were the engineers and designers and product managers. I always liked working with you. I want to just compliment Lenny for a minute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):\nOh, how sweet is that?\n\nChip Conley (00:10:41):\nWe did a lot of different things together, and what I appreciated was you had a humility to you that was different than a lot of the other product managers. There's other product managers, I'm not going to mention their names, and some of these product managers were very good. There were other product managers though who I found it sometimes hard to work with, because they expected me to know as much as they did.\n\n(00:11:07):\nI guess it would be, if the opposite side of that would be an older manager expecting a younger manager to have as much emotional intelligence, because emotional intelligence on average is something we get better at as we get older. I think the key for me to work in that environment and make it work was to not pretend to know things I didn't know, it was to have a sense of humor and humility in how I operated, and it was to show respect and hope that I got it in return. I don't know if you felt that way, Lenny. That's the kind of environment I tried to embody there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:45):\nAbsolutely. There's a couple of threads there I want to follow. One is just working for Brian. A lot of people talk about founder mode, and the power of founder mode, it's so great. That's how we-\n\nChip Conley (00:11:55):\nGuess who-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:57):\nExactly.\n\nChip Conley (00:11:57):\n... populated that recently, that was Brian.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:01):\nExactly. It's great to be in founder mode. It's not as great to be working for someone in founder mode. Often a very challenging place to be.\n\nChip Conley (00:12:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:07):\nYou reported to Brian. Also, you were just your own boss basically your entire career. You never really had to report to someone before. Also, he was in his thirties, you're in your fifties. What was it like working for Brian? The more real you can be, the better, because a lot of people always talk about here, it's like, \"It was wonderful, I learned so much.\" Just like what was that experience? What did you learn from working for someone like Brian?\n\nChip Conley (00:12:30):\nWell, let's start with the fact that I would never have gone to work for Airbnb if I didn't believe in Brian, because quite frankly, when Brian approached me and we started talking about it, I was like, I wasn't sure I liked the business model all that well as a hotelier. I had to believe in something beyond the business model, because I wasn't sure that the business model would work. Although soon after joining, I saw the numbers. I was like, \"Wow, this is working pretty well.\"\n\n(00:12:56):\nI believed in Brian because the thing that Brian showed up with initially was just a curiosity and an appetite for learning. I remember back in 2011, when the big debacle happened with the apartment getting trashed by a guest. Brian decided he was going to go to find George Tenet, the former head of the CIA. Brian would go to experts and say to the expert, \"I don't know what the hell I'm doing.\" He did that with me when it came to hospitality. I appreciated that a guy who had a lot of hubris, and Brian definitely has a lot of hubris, could also have the humility to say, \"I want to learn more about this.\"\n\n(00:13:42):\nIt's sort of a growth mindset. What was hard with Brian is, I'd say, three things. Number one is Brian assumed everybody else was going to work at the same pace and duration, and he still has this issue. The beautiful thing about Brian is he's been very honest in the last couple of years on podcasts about his workaholism, and about the fact that the way he lives his life is not like other people. Back when I joined, his point of view is like, \"Hey, we're having a meeting in the office tonight at 10 o'clock, be there.\"\n\n(00:14:20):\nIt's like, \"Really? No, I don't think so.\" I think the fact that Brian assumed everybody else was as one-dimensional in their focus as him was at times a problem, especially for a guy like me who was, I was in a stage in my career where I have a lot of interests. That was one. Number two is Brian admires and admired back then, Steve Jobs so much that there was a sense that as a guy who came from the product world, from the Rhode Island School of Design, he knew better than anybody else.\n\n(00:15:05):\nThere was this, one of the challenges for a CEO sometimes, and this was my experience in my 24 years of running Joie de Vivre, my boutique hotel company, is it feels good when you feel needed. To come into a room and sort of see something, and then point out the things that are wrong makes you feel good. If you don't have emotional intelligence, that process can really piss people off or demotivate people. In Brian's case, I didn't have to deal with that too much, because he didn't understand, when I was starting, it was really, I was in charge of the hosts around the world.\n\n(00:15:45):\nQuite frankly, the idea of what's the psychology of the host? What's a host entrepreneur like? I went on a world tour to 20 different cities, and went and talked to hosts. I think I came back from that with a little bit of credibility with Brian to say like, \"Hey, yes, our data science team and the quality folks who are doing qualitative interviews, they're getting something out of this.\" I actually went into the homes of these hosts all around the world, and I think I was lucky because Brian did less of that than he did with other people.\n\n(00:16:19):\nFor the product team, my God, a product meeting with Brian would keep people up the night before, not just because they were actually working all night long to get prepared, but also they knew they would work all night long, because they probably wouldn't sleep in anticipation for this. That was another issue, I'd say. I'd say the other thing that, and in each of these cases, I think Brian's getting better. Just like Steve Jobs got better over time when he left and then he came back, he was much better when he came back, from all the people I've talked with who worked with him.\n\n(00:16:53):\nI'd say the third thing for Brian was the sense that adding a zero to something in terms of expectations, or thinking you're going to set a deadline that is unreasonable is necessary. If you don't do that, there's almost an underlying message that people won't kick ass on their own. There was a sense that Brian had that he had to maybe create ridiculous goals, because even if we hit half of that goal, it was very encouraging. What he missed in that was the fact that when you miss a goal, and when you have someone who has power over you setting the goal, or encouraging a particular goal, you're setting people up for a lot of stress.\n\n(00:17:51):\nAt the end of the day, I think Brian is a generational leader as a millennial, and I think he deserves a lot of credit. Airbnb is as successful as it is, partly because of Brian's leadership. I would not have been there without him. Having said that, I had to hold my tongue in meetings sometimes when I saw how he was operating, because I wouldn't have done it that way. I think over time, I hope I had a little bit of influence on him in terms of how to apply some emotional intelligence to leading people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:28):\nFor people in this position, a lot of people work for founders, especially now that founder mode is a thing. Every founder is just like, \"I'm the founder, you got to do what I tell you. It's founder mode. Again, this is how we win. We're in founder mode.\" You shared really good insight of building credibility as a really good lever to work better with someone like that. Is there anything else you just think as tactics to be effective with founders in founder mode?\n\nChip Conley (00:18:53):\nKnowing what I know now, I would say, \"Lenny, let's do a little pep talk, you and me before the meeting.\" I want you to start the meeting with the following as you present and Brian's in the room. \"Brian, let's talk about what we're trying to accomplish here. Let's get really clear,\" and you probably did this, but, \"let's get really clear on what both, what's the intention of this iteration that we're doing on the product? What defines success, and what do I want to get accomplished in this meeting?\"\n\n(00:19:25):\nYou start with that, because that actually helps to make sure there's alignment. Frankly, if there's not alignment, you might as well not have the meeting. Let's spend the rest of this meeting talking about alignment. That's what I would do, because that's something you can come back to over and over again during the rest of the meeting when Brian or the founder, whomever it is, is beating you up on something, saying like, \"Well, let me tell you why it looks like that or why we're doing that.\" It goes back to that, the three principles or the three key goals we're trying to do with this product update. Yeah, so try to set alignment on the front end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:06):\nThat's an important tip for anyone working with anyone, even. I love just that that works especially well here. Then just going back to the credibility piece, what you shared there is you went on this world tour, not something everyone can do, but just getting really close to your customers, and using that as a, \"Hey, I actually know what I'm talking about. You actually should listen to me even though you're the founder.\"\n\nChip Conley (00:20:27):\nYeah, I think the other thing is PowerPoint or whatever tool you're using, just be careful about being overly reliant upon it, especially when you have a combustible founder who may take you off path, such that your deck in its current order makes no sense at all. I always wanted to really limit the deck as much as possible, because I didn't know where the meeting was going to go. I wanted the decks helpful at the start, at the very start, to just set principles, set goals. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:09):\nThis whole story of you joining Airbnb in your fifties is a really good example of intergenerational collaboration, something that you're big on, just the value of having folks that are older working at tech companies. Maybe just talk about that broadly, and then we segue into other elements of your career.\n\nChip Conley (00:21:28):\nI wrote a book called Wisdom at Work: the Making of a Modern Elder after my Airbnb experience. I did a lot of research. I was like, \"Wow, so why do we have less intergenerational collaboration in the workplace, especially in Silicon Valley than we could use?\" I started interviewing people, then I started talking to brain scientists, neuroscientists, and realized that a younger brain has fluid intelligence, tends to be fast and focused, really good at problem solving, very good at linearity in terms of looking at things.\n\n(00:21:59):\nAs you get older, the brain shrinks a little bit and you have crystallized intelligence. In crystallized intelligence, what's going on is you're going from left brain to right brain more adeptly. There's a little bit less focus, a little more holistic thinking, systemic thinking, connecting the dots. You can imagine that on a team when you have older brains connecting the dots, thinking broadly, peripherally, younger team members being really fast and focused, and being able to think linearly how to get things done, that combination can either be successful or not.\n\n(00:22:36):\nWhen it's successful. It's brilliant. I think Laura, Laura Modi, Laura Hughes Modi, who was my director of hospitality, but also we worked in so many different capacities with her in the company, I loved working with her because her brain worked different than my brain. That's the opportunity is when you realize that diversity on a team, there's lots of kinds of diversity, but when it comes to brain diversity, not just with neuro diverse people but age diverse people, you get a benefit, an effective benefit that is not as noticeable, quite frankly, in some other diversities.\n\n(00:23:16):\nI found that over and over was really helpful. Part of my job sometimes was to find the blind spot. Again, if you are very focused, one of the things I said to Brian early on was, \"I've seen the business plan. Now, I know the goals of how big we want to be in three years.\" This was very early in my tenure. I said, \"But what we really have done, everything we're trying to do is to have no regulations and pay no occupancy tax.\" Now, hotels pay a bed tax, occupancy tax, we're not paying it, and we're trying to do everything we can not to pay it.\n\n(00:23:51):\nKnowing that, so for our listeners and viewers to know this, this is something that a guest pays. It's not the host who pays it, the guest pays it. It's part of the bill. If you go and stay in a hotel, there's a big, big tax part of the bill, but it made us more affordable by not having to have our guests pay taxes. Long story short is I said to Brian, \"If we're as big as we're going to be three years from now, I promise you we're going to be regulated. I promise you we're going to be paying occupancy taxes. Let's take some proactive steps toward building a strategy for how we're going to be regulated.\"\n\n(00:24:28):\nThat has consistently been Airbnb's biggest challenge is regulation in municipal markets all around the world. If we'd started a little earlier, maybe in New York, maybe in New York, it wouldn't have gotten to the point where it has been toxic in New York for the last dozen years ever since I was there. There's a few other markets in the world where it was like that. I would just say the value in having some age diversity, even when you have an older person reporting to a younger person, is it can be collaborative.\n\n(00:25:02):\nThere was a guy named John Q. Smith, an engineer who I think you probably remember him at Airbnb. This is a guy who looked younger than he was, and he was a little bit nervous about telling people his age. The thing that was great about John is over time, he was not necessarily going to be the best coder at Airbnb. There was a whole new collection of coders coming in every month, but he became a great manager.\n\n(00:25:32):\nThe beautiful thing about moving from the individual contributor to the manager, the person who can actually bring out the best in a bunch of younger people, who may be better technically than he or she is, but they know how to elevate talent. I call this invisible productivity. It's productivity in which you make everybody else around you better. That's something I tried to do with my teams at Airbnb. Ultimately, I had six different teams, five hospitality and five other teams reporting to me. I did my best to just be the kind of person who wasn't solving all the problems, but I was trying to elevate.\n\n(00:26:11):\nThere's a woman named Lisa Dubost who is at Airbnb, and she, one day, the HR department was reporting to me at one point, and she was running HR. She was 25 and had no background in HR at all. One day she came in to me and she just said, \"Chip, you are my confidant.\" Lisa has a French accent and fluent in French. She said confidant in just the right way. I said, \"Oh, well thank you, Lisa.\" I said to her, \"You haven't given me any juicy details yet. A confidant is someone who has the secrets.\"\n\n(00:26:42):\nShe said to me, \"No, in my part of France, a confidant is somebody who gives you confidence.\" It was like, \"Oh, well, maybe that's what a mentor can be is a confidant, someone who gives you confidence and helps by asking questions, helps you as the younger mentee find your roadmap to success.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:05):\nYou're sharing a lot of really good examples of the value of older folks being within tech companies. Let me just ask you this, how real is ageism in tech? I ask because a lot of people that are hiring are probably thinking, no, no, I'm not biased. I'm going to hire the best person. If they're someone in their fifties, I'll hire them. No problem. It doesn't feel like it actually works out that way often. Just how real of a problem is this? What do you see?\n\nChip Conley (00:27:27):\nYeah, it's clearly a problem. I'd say it's maybe a little bit less of a problem than it was a dozen years ago, because I think a dozen years ago, it was almost a blind spot. In Airbnb, we had a group called Wisdom at Airbnb. It was an employee resource group for people 40 and older. There are lots of these kinds of groups that didn't exist a dozen years ago in all kinds of tech companies, which is good, because it means that there's a voice and a way to congregate with a bunch of people who are older.\n\n(00:28:00):\nUltimately, we had these senior nomads come in and be like the voice of the customer for 10 weeks at Airbnb. It was the Wisdom at Airbnb older employee group that really actually pushed for this with Brian. The challenge is, in a world in which the smartest new people, especially when it comes to technical skills and engineering, are coming in with a whole new set of skills that an older person doesn't have, the older person is both expensive and may be perceived as slow. In the era of AI, it's a whole new ballgame.\n\n(00:28:42):\nThe question, I think, will be if what AI cannot do is the human wisdom piece, artificial intelligence and human wisdom might be the balance beams here. Is it possible that older managers who have a little more emotional intelligence, a little more pattern recognition, a little bit more wisdom, can be a value to a company? The jury's still out. There's a New York Times article that just came out about the question of is AI going to wipe out older people's jobs or younger people's jobs? I think the answer is both, but the question is how bad is it for both of them?\n\n(00:29:29):\nI think what I would say to an older person, and when I say older, I mean like 45 or older, if you've done well financially and you're doing okay, the question you might ask yourself is, are you open, as I ultimately was with Brian in my fourth year at Airbnb? I took a substantial pay cut. I think it went down to 40% or 50% time, and my stock, my options were dropped to that level, my salaries dropped to that level, because I didn't want to work full time anymore. There are a lot of people who can be valuable in a company who have some institutional wisdom, some process knowledge of how to get things done in this organization.\n\n(00:30:08):\nIn tech companies, that's really important. Airbnb, one of the biggest challenges that Airbnb has always been, how do I get shit done around here? Process knowledge allows you to understand, how do you deal with an org chart and get things done partly because you understand the motivations of different groups? That is something you build over time. Long story short is I just think that older people might look at their workload and say, \"I'm willing to take a 20% or a 40% pay cut to go to 80% or 60% time,\" and the company is going to get their money's worth in that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:49):\nThat's a really interesting point, that if you're older and you're maybe less connected to the most cutting edge ways of building and coding, AI makes that a lot easier in many ways where you start to just talk to it. You don't even need to understand what's happening underneath.\n\nChip Conley (00:31:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:05):\nThere's a lot of listeners who are older in tech, there's a lot of listeners who are approaching midlife, let's say, worried about what happens to their career. When you look at people you've worked with and had at your academy, which we'll talk about, who continue to thrive and continue to have a really healthy career in tech, what do they do differently? What do they have in common that other folks you think should work on and focus on?\n\nChip Conley (00:31:28):\nI think this idea being a mentor and a mentor and an intern, there's just the voracious appetite for curiosity. When I talk to someone who's a midlife and wants to be in the tech world or already is, the thing I say is, \"Show up with curiosity and a passionate engagement for what you do, and people won't necessarily notice your wrinkles as much as they'll notice your energy.\" Energy has two parts to it. Energy is, they notice that you are not just sort of resting on your laurels, you have physical energy in how you do your job.\n\n(00:32:04):\nWhen people are like that, they're sort of timeless. They're age fluid, as I say. We talk about gender fluidity. Well, there could be age fluidity. They're not defined by their age. The other part of energy that's important is being positive. That's sort of more energetic, a little bit more California energetic. There's a sense of when someone's got good energy, you're drawn to them. It's about showing up with the kind of energy of someone 10 or 20 years younger than you, and then showing up with positive energy.\n\n(00:32:38):\nI think one of the things that would say I did well at, there's lots of things I didn't do well at Airbnb, but in terms of what I did well is I was very approachable. Over the course of time, the number of mentees I had, the number of people who just wanted to have coffee with me or tea, the number of people who just said, \"Thank you for being in that meeting, you just sort of gave it a positive feeling,\" was really important.\n\n(00:33:04):\nMy energy, both the positive energy part, and then also the fact that yeah, I could work 60 and 70 hours a week, and I could travel around the world as the Secretary of State of the company, which is what Brian called me a couple times on stage. The fact that I could do that meant that no one was looking at me and saying, \"Let's get rid of the old fogey.\" Well, maybe some people the board, but I wasn't aware of them. I just think show up with that passionate engagement, that curiosity, that energy, the ability to be both the learner and the teacher, with respect for people that are younger than you, and you're going to probably do pretty well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:44):\nThat is really great advice. Today's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you. Imagine starting a project at work, and your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what and where to find the data that you need to do your part.\n\n(00:34:11):\nIn fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, to documents and spreadsheets, lives in one tab all in Coda. With Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI, all in one easy to organize tab.

That's C-O-D-A dot I-O slash Lenny to get started for free, and get six months of the team plan. Coda.io/Lenny.\n\n(00:35:03):\nInterestingly, curiosity comes up a lot when I ask AI-forward people, what are they focusing on helping their kids learn most? Curiosity is the most common way to describe. At every stage of life, curiosity is something to cultivate. I want to go to the flip side of companies looking to hire. It feels like there's this untapped supply of awesome people that companies with ageism and tech aren't finding and hiring. To help hiring managers and companies take advantage of this, what's something you suggest they do? How do they shift their mindset or maybe shift the way they hire that might help them find these people?\n\nChip Conley (00:35:39):\nI think we're moving into, there's a book that David Epstein wrote called Range, and the whole premise of range is that we are moving out of the era of the specialists and into the era of the generalists. I think AI is just accelerating this. As we are more reliant upon AI, and AI can be exceptional at technical skills and solutions really expeditiously, I think generalists, people who can think broadly, become all the more important. I think that what I would say to someone in HR or recruiting is beyond what I already said before, is the person passionate?\n\n(00:36:23):\nAre they curious? Are they a learner? Do they have good energy? I would also say, are they a generalist when they're a problem solver? I actually think that's going to be an increasingly important part of how effective companies think broadly. I think that's a key one. I think also, this idea of how do you create intergenerational collaboration in the form of mutual mentorships? One of the things I loved at Airbnb, there were a few people I did this with, where I had something to teach them and they had something to teach me.\n\n(00:37:02):\nA good example, my iPhone, so there's 97% of the utility of my iPhone that I probably don't use and don't know how to use. This was back in, let's say, 2013, 2014. There were people who knew iPhone or Google Suites back then. I'd never used a Google Doc back then when I joined Airbnb. There were people who could teach me something technical, and then they wanted to learn something from me, which would be like, \"How do you want a great meeting,\" or, \"How do you give a great employee review?\" There are a lot of managers who've never been a manager before.\n\n(00:37:45):\nHow do you disperse people like me in the organization so that there's usually not enough time for these young managers to come to some training session on how to do a good employee review. You sort of have to do it out there in the field. It's like apprenticeship back in the trades. You're an electrician apprentice, not because you're watching some video on it, you're out there in the field, doing it. That's a huge value in a younger company when you have some older people who have not been vested with the responsibility of managing those younger people.\n\n(00:38:23):\nThey may actually be reporting to someone younger than them, but they're there to actually be support. In some ways, I think that was part of the unexpected value that I was able to offer to Airbnb and to Brian specifically, because there are a ton of people in Airbnb who were not even in my departments who would come to me and say, \"I'm having a problem. How do I solve this? Can we spend lunch together?\" I almost always said yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nI think the reason people did that in many ways is you just have a very unique aura of wisdom, and it's hard to replicate that, Chip.\n\nChip Conley (00:39:04):\nYes, and it all comes back to the curiosity. If I was just the older elder, dispensing wisdom, people would've gotten bored very quickly. I think the fact, yeah, I was on the board of Burning Man, that's cool. I show up as someone who feels younger than I am. I'm turning 65 this year. The bottom line is I think people lost track of my age, partly because I lost track of my age.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:38):\nThat's such good advice on the front end to be successful as a person kind of getting older in tech is curiosity, positive energy, the way you talked about it, passionate, engagement, is that the term?\n\nChip Conley (00:39:52):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:53):\nThen on the other side is hire generalists. This actually comes up a lot in the AI conversations, just exactly as you said, the power of generalists reminds me, I'm going to this gym now, and the lady there is just like, \"I love AI so much, because I'm just such a big picture person, and I am so bad at just getting, thinking about the details, and AI solves all that for me.\" It's like, \"Here, here's what I want to do. I'll do this, move my house to here, here.\" It's like, \"Here's what you need to do, step one, two, three, four, five.\"\n\nChip Conley (00:40:18):\nIt is remarkable. Since the time I've known you, how fast it has become dominant in our lives. Yeah, I think one of the last thing I'd say is, look, I'm privileged. For those of you who are listening or watching this and you're saying, \"Well, Chip, you were 52 years old and they came to you. That doesn't happen to me. I'm not in that position.\" The thing I would say is, you're right, but I could have been plucked and brought in and partly as Brian's boy, people would've rejected me, because if I didn't show up the right way, it wouldn't have worked well.\n\n(00:41:00):\nThere are lots of people who Brian brought into the company who didn't work well. I think the key is how do you get the foot in the door? At the end of the day, those second and third order of degrees of separation in terms of networking are still essential. The most important thing is to be able to articulate what you have accomplished in a new way that a recruiter says, \"Wow.\" I really tell people I would love to see a resume.\n\n(00:41:41):\nFirst of all, the question that I think it was, who was it? Someone asked it, I don't remember if it was Cheryl Stamberg or someone else asked her, who said, \"What's the biggest problem you're dealing with here, and how can I help you?\" That's a great line. Number two is what I love to see is not so much what roles you've had, what bullet points do you have of your things you've learned? Give me, in a paragraph, a thorny problem you faced. What was the problem, and what skills you used to actually accomplish it, and what was the result of that?\n\n(00:42:22):\nI would love to see a resume like that. The older you are, the more you can actually have a resume like that. Then you can use that as the conversation piece when you're doing interviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:34):\nI love that. I love that we're getting into interview advice and resume advice.\n\nChip Conley (00:42:37):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:38):\nSpeaking of thorny problems, and also why Brian decided to reach out to you, I want to go back to the beginning of your career.\n\nChip Conley (00:42:45):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:46):\nRight out of business-\n\nChip Conley (00:42:47):\nYou're good at this, by the way. You're good at this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:49):\nI was thinking ahead. Okay, so you're in business school, you left business school, you're like, \"Maybe I should start a hotel.\" Something that rarely works out usually probably leads to a lot of money lost and a lot of frustration and just like, \"Okay, what have I done with my life?\" Worked out for you.\n\n(00:43:07):\nEnded up building the second largest boutique hotel chain in the world, Joie de Vivre, beloved. I loved every single experience I've had as Joie de Vivre. When you sold it, I was like, \"That is so sad.\" Talk about just that story. I know this could go on for hours, but what's the-\n\nChip Conley (00:43:21):\nYeah, I'll be brief.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:22):\nYeah.\n\nChip Conley (00:43:23):\n26 years old, couple of years out of Stanford Business School, working for a commercial real estate developer. I was bored silly. I wanted to do something more creative. Bill Graham, famous concert promoter, said to me, because I had gotten to know him, \"What San Francisco really needs is a rock and roll hotel.\" I decided to start looking to find a broken down motel hotel that I could turn into a rock and roll hotel.\n\n(00:43:46):\nI found something in the Tenderloin, and turned it into the Phoenix, which became a famous rock and roll hotel that I have owned for 39 years now. Long story short is that was how I started Joie de Vivre, the company. We grew to 52 hotels around California, became the second largest, as you said, in the world in terms of the number of hotels, boutique hotels that we operated. I loved it till I hated it. In my late forties, I hated it, didn't want to do it anymore. The great recession came along and it was just kicking my ass.\n\n(00:44:23):\nI really went through a bit of what I now call a midlife chrysalis, but a midlife crisis, where I just wanted to change everything. I got through it. I had an NDE, I had a near-death experience where I had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic and I died. From that point forward, I realized every day is a gift and a bonus, and I decided to sell my company at the bottom of the great recession. That's really how I created this space in my life to be able to join Airbnb.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:58):\nWell, let's back up a little bit. This near-death experience, share more there. What happened there?\n\nChip Conley (00:45:04):\nYeah, so I write books. I've written seven or eight books, and I had written a book called Peak: How Great Companies Get Their Mojo from Maslow. It was a book that Brian really liked, and part of the reason he wanted to reach out to me. I was on a book tour, I had a broken ankle. I broke my ankle at a bachelor party playing baseball. I ended up with a cut on my leg and the cut on my leg had fertilizer in it and went septic. I was on a very strong antibiotic and I died.\n\n(00:45:39):\nI went flatlined from the allergic reaction to the antibiotic. I saw, it happened nine times over 90 minutes, I kept dying, kept flatlining, yeah. Ended up in the hospital for three days. They finally said, \"Listen, it's an allergic reaction, we believe.\" They thought it was a heart attack, a bunch of stuff, stroke, et cetera. No, it was the allergic reaction. I saw birds. I saw all this beautiful stuff. We don't have time to go into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:10):\nYou did? What?\n\nChip Conley (00:46:11):\nI did. You want to hear this? Yeah, I saw this beautiful stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:13):\nLet's do it.\n\nChip Conley (00:46:15):\nI think there's a hotel in San Francisco called the Vitale that I built across the street from the ferry building, and it's still there, but it's no longer called the Vitale. In that hotel, there were these slippers in every guest room. One slipper said slow, the other slipper said down. I was wearing these slippers in my flatline thing, flying in the air in a 40-foot tall living room in the Alps, surrounded by birds that were tweeting and chirping at me.\n\n(00:46:50):\nI understood bird talk. I understand exactly what they were saying. They kept telling me, \"If you slow down, you will see beauty and you will see awe.\" There was a bunch of other things, but let me just limit it to that and just say, and then the birds would say, \"It's time to go.\" The birds would go out the big window into the mountains, and I would try to follow them. Right as I would get to the window, all of a sudden, I'd come back to life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:20):\nHoly shit. I love that there was a message inside of this experience. I don't know how many people experienced that. Clearly, this led to a big life change. It's interesting that a lot of times, you need something like that. You've been doing this for how many years at that point? Running Joie de Vivre?\n\nChip Conley (00:47:38):\nAt that point, I'd been running Joie de Vivre for 22 years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):\n22 years. It's interesting that you need something like that a lot of times. Otherwise, it just momentum just keeps carrying you forward.\n\nChip Conley (00:47:46):\nWithin two years, I'd sold it, and I had the chance to move on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:52):\nWith building Joie de Vivre, something you've written about a number of times is just the way you built it is a really unique approach to building a business. Specifically, there's a huge focus on culture, which also came out at Airbnb. Talk about just why you see culture as such an important part of how you build a business like tangibly. A lot of people talk about culture, warm, fuzzy stuff, but you think about it very tangibly.\n\nChip Conley (00:48:15):\nCulture is what happens around here when the boss is not around. The more distributed a company, the more culture is important. The boss is around in a traditional bricks and mortar workplace where everybody shows up at eight and leaves at six, and we all see each other. In my company, in Joie de Vivre, we had 52 hotels, and 25 restaurants, and four spas, and it was distributed. I couldn't be in all those places all the time.\n\n(00:48:52):\nSimilarly, with Airbnb, Airbnb had offices around the world and it was a global company. The more distributed you are, of course, in the remote work world we live in, the more culture is important, and more difficult. When you're remote, there's these few cues you have about how we do things around here. They're usually in a digital, virtual format, which is why it's all the more important for you to have in-person gatherings of a team more often if you are virtual.\n\n(00:49:27):\nAt the end of the day, the reason the culture is important is because it actually helps, it helps guide people in terms of making decisions, but it's also a magnet for the right kind of people. Oracle has a different culture than Apple, which has a different culture than Facebook. You can choose the place you're going to work based upon the culture. There are people who can be very good at what they do, but if they're in the wrong culture, they're in the wrong kind of environment, and they're not willing to shift to fit that culture.\n\n(00:50:01):\nWe saw it at Airbnb all over and over again. In fact, Airbnb saw it, I think when with Amazon people. Apple people have resonated pretty well at Airbnb, Amazon people, less so. Those are two different cultures, Amazon and Apple. Therefore, understanding a culture before you even actually take the job is one of the more important decisions you need to make is like, \"Is this culture a culture that I can live with and maybe influence?\" There's language about culture fit.\n\n(00:50:37):\nI like to say culture add, because culture fit to me can actually be quite negative toward somebody who is the aberration. You have to fit in. Especially if this is a demographic thing, a person of color, a gay person, a person in a wheelchair, so you have to fit in. A culture add suggests that actually having some diversity on the team is helpful, because it actually adds to the culture. You still have to be able to get along in that culture. Culture is an intangible. That's the problem with it is it's hard to measure, but you see its value and you understand whether it's working based upon employee pulse reports and things like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):\nYou talk about having to understand the culture is such a key part of having success at a company. Do you have any advice for just how to understand the culture for someone interviewing? I don't know. You came in, you work part-time, it's easier to experience it all. Any tips there for, \"Okay, this is for me, it's not for me?\"\n\nChip Conley (00:51:39):\nWhen you're interviewing, you're also interviewing them. When you're interviewing, it's not about you having to prove yourself. It's also for them to actually prove themselves as a company, and also try to understand if there is some alignment in the company. The kind of questions I would ask as someone who's being interviewed would be, what are three to five adjectives that define this culture? What's the biggest problem in this culture, in terms of something that's just endemic or baked in across the organization?\n\n(00:52:14):\nIs it ever going to get fixed? How could I come in and maybe help that? Which frankly, at a very junior level, you're not going to be able to help it except for in very minor ways. If you're a senior person, you might be able to help it. Those are the kind of questions I'd want to know. Frankly, if I'm asking that same question about what are the adjectives to multiple people, am I hearing the same thing over and over again? If I'm not, is that because there's not alignment? Is that because different departments have different flavors?\n\n(00:52:48):\nYou could have a culture within a department that's very different than the overall corporate culture. The corporate culture certainly has an enormous oppressive influence, but you can be in a culture, a really great culture of a team or a department, in an overall company culture that's not good. In the long run, that oppressive company culture is either going to have to evolv,e or your department, you may lose people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:23):\nWhen I reflect back on the impact you had at Airbnb, one of the funny things I think about is triangles showing up a lot on decks, and specifically rooted in Maslow's hierarchy, just like everything's this Maslow hierarchy metaphor.\n\nChip Conley (00:53:41):\nTrue.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:43):\nThis one, I don't know, specific piece of this is you have this kind of model you think about for how to help employees be successful at a company. It's kind of rooted in your Peak book philosophy. Maybe just talk about that, and then if there's anything else you want to expand on with this power of thinking through the Maslow hierarchy.\n\nChip Conley (00:54:01):\nMaslow's hierarchy, basically five levels. Later in life, he had a seven and an eight level model, but at the base is the kind of physical, water, food, air, and you move up to self-actualization at the top. To use this model as a hierarchy of needs for employees, customers, and investors is what the Peak model is about. The Peak, my book. The employee model is really simple. It's money or compensation at the base, recognition in the middle, and meaning at the top.\n\n(00:54:39):\nNow, there are some industries and some kinds of jobs in which money is 90% of the pyramid. Just because of the base doesn't mean it's not the dominant part of the pyramid, but the differentiation often is in recognition and meaning. In nonprofits, usually the money piece of it's rather thin. The recognition's this, and meaning's huge. Understanding how do you create an organization, and I gave a TED Talk in 2010 about this topic as well, how do you measure the intangibles of meaning and how do you create an environment where people feel a sense of meaning?\n\n(00:55:18):\nThe customer pyramid, briefly, I'll just say that one, is meeting expectations is the base, meeting desires is in the middle, and then meeting unrecognized needs. I think one of the things that we did at Airbnb about a year after I joined, and when Jonathan Goldenhall was joining, is we really tried to ask ourselves, \"Are we in the home sharing business, or are we in some kind of business that is even bigger and broader than that?\" Ultimately, we came up with the idea that we were in the belong anywhere business.\n\n(00:55:49):\nAirbnb was not in home sharing, we were in belonging anywhere. Once you have that down, that was sort of the unrecognized need at the top of the pyramid. Then that becomes an organizing principle for how do you teach your hosts to create a sense of belonging? How does our marketing and advertising play up the belonging piece, especially and the everywhere piece, because hotels are not everywhere, but homes are? I would just say that this model, the idea of hierarchies is, I think, very helpful. Yeah, my book Peak has been around for 18 years, but I still am asked to give 20 or 30 speeches a year on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:30):\nOh, man. This pyramid of comp, recognition, meaning is really interesting, especially these days, because with all this AI researcher poaching, there's all this talk of just like, \"Will people just go work wherever they get the most money, or is there a mission and meaning to the work they're doing that will keep them not taking a hundred million dollars offer?\" Seems to be happening in a lot of cases, which shows you the power of meaning.\n\nChip Conley (00:56:55):\nYeah. If you know you're working for a toxic company, at some point, your conscience kicks in. Whether it's toxic in terms of the purpose of the company, toxic in terms of the leadership or the culture, life is too short.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:10):\nOkay. You've had two major shifts in your career. You started the hotel chain, then you went to Airbnb. Most recently, the Airbnb experience, I imagine, led you to starting something called the Modern Elder Academy. Talk about what is the Modern Elder Academy?\n\nChip Conley (00:57:28):\nYeah, what is going on with that Modern Elder Academy? The Modern Elder Academy. There was a couple times where I was called the Modern Elder at Airbnb, and then I was told that a Modern Elder is someone who's as curious as they are wise. Jonathan Mildenhall, who is the chief marketing officer at Airbnb, used to call me the Modern Elder as well, and he said, \"If you ever create a school, Modern Elder would be a good name.\"\n\n(00:57:56):\nWe talked about it, and next thing I knew, I was saying, \"Okay, this is called the Modern Elder Academy.\" We now call it MEA because elder is a fraught word on some level, it makes you sound elderly. What I really wanted to create was a place where people could come and do a workshop, they're five day workshops in Baja on the beach, or in Santa Fe on a big four square mile horse ranch, and reimagine and repurpose yourself, and navigate transitions.\n\n(00:58:27):\nWe go through so many transitions in the middle of our life, let's say between, I define midlife as 35 to 75, guys. It's a very long life stage. We go through a lot of transitions. We are constantly evolving our purpose. We're building our wisdom. We have knowledge management tools out there, but we're the wisdom management tools. We're the tools that help us to get wiser over time, and then we need to reframe our relationship with getting older. Becca Levy has shown at Yale that when you shift your mindset on aging from a negative to a positive, you get seven and a half years of additional life, which is more life than any other biohack that's being done right now.\n\n(00:59:08):\nThat's what we do, and we have 7,000 grads from 60 countries, and 56 regional chapters around the world. It's a bit of a movement, and I teach. I teach some of the workshops, and we have all kinds of famous people who come and teach. For me, creating the world's first midlife wisdom school just feels like the natural next thing for me to do. I love hospitality, so it's a very upscale kind of experience, but we have scholarships. I love retreat centers. I was on the board of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur for 10 years. I love wellness.\n\n(00:59:45):\nI've owned the Kabuki Springs and Spa for 28 years, which is the largest spa in San Francisco, and I love education. My book, Wisdom at Work: The Making of a Modern Elder, gave me a curriculum in which we've expanded quite a bit with Harvard, Yale, Stanford, and UC, Berkeley professors helping us create a curriculum around midlife. That's how MEA came about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:14):\nTo your point, I forget who said, I think you said Jonathan has said this was a natural next step for you, I completely agree. It's like, looking back, this is the obvious thing you should be doing right now.\n\nChip Conley (01:00:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):\nAlso, I'm learning more things about you. I didn't know you were involved with the Kabuki Spa. I think Esalen and I knew, you just keep getting more interested.\n\nChip Conley (01:00:31):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:32):\nThere's a couple threads here I want to actually follow. This point you made about shifting your mindset to aging as a positive thing helps you live longer. That's such a powerful point. Can you just speak more to that, just what does that look like?\n\nChip Conley (01:00:43):\nYeah, there's lots of data points. I'll talk about two. One is this Becca Levy study, which has been going on for 15 to 20 years. If you sort of buy into the ageism of American society or Hallmark cards, when you get a card at age 40, 50, or beyond, there's a belief that life gets worse as you get older. If you can survive your midlife crisis, all you have to look forward to is disease, decrepitude, and death. The bottom line is there's a lot of things that get better with age. I wrote a book called Learning to Love Midlife.\n\n(01:01:20):\nThe subtitle says it all: 12 Reasons Why Life Gets Better with Age. What I really wanted to do with that book, which is really, it summarizes the MEA curriculum, I wanted to write a book that sort of helped people to see the upside of aging, the unexpected pleasures of aging. They had a pro-aging, not just an anti-aging point of view. When you actually have a pro-aging point of view and you see the upside of aging, you take better care of yourself, both your mind and your body. You actually are willing to learn and try new things.\n\n(01:01:51):\nOne of my favorite MEA questions is, 10 years from now, what will you regret if you don't learn it or do it now? It's a powerful question, really important question as we get older. When you're young, you've got all of your life left ahead of you. When I moved to Baja part-time in Mexico at age 56, I had a mindset which was, \"I'm too old to learn Spanish. I'm too old to learn to surf,\" but when I said, \"10 years from now, what will I regret if I don't learn it or it now?\" I said, \"Well, 10 years from now, I might still be living in Baja. I should learn Spanish, I should learn how to surf because we're right next to a surf break.\"\n\n(01:02:29):\nI did. What I believe is that anticipated regret is a form of wisdom, and it's a catalyst for taking action. That's one data point. The other data point is something called the U-curve of happiness, and it's been around for 20 years, and it shows the following. It has changed in the last couple of years because young adults are unhappy like never before. A 20 or a 22-year-old, really unhappy, 24-year-old, really unhappy.\n\n(01:02:58):\nHistorically, the way it was is you were happy from 18 to 23 or 24, and then around 23 or 24, you start to see a long, slow decline in life satisfaction that actually bottoms out between 45 and 50. I'm sorry to tell you that, Lenny, since you're 44, but your mileage may vary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):\nYou're saying I'm the least happy I'll ever be. That's only upside. That's great. Yeah.\n\nChip Conley (01:03:21):\nWell, here's the part that's weird is that before this research was done, and it's global research across all demographics, what they found was starting around age 50 or 52, you get happier, so that you're happier in your fifties than your forties, sixties, fifties, seventies, happier than sixties, and the women in their eighties, happier than seventies. Wow. It's partly because we are in around 45 to 50, doing this thing called the midlife unraveling, what Brené Brown calls the midlife unraveling.\n\n(01:03:55):\nYou're unraveling your expectations, what you define as success, your definition of what a beautiful body looks like, and you're liberated into freedom in your fifties and beyond. I can say that, yeah, I'm happier today at 64 than I was at 47 when I was going through my flatline experience, and not wanting to run my company anymore.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:19):\nYou used this term earlier, the midlife chrysalis, was that what it was?\n\nChip Conley (01:04:22):\nChrysalis. Chrysalis, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:23):\nChrysalis. What is that? Is that kind of along the same lines?\n\nChip Conley (01:04:27):\nIf you think about the caterpillar to butterfly journey, midlife is the chrysalis. It's that cocoon in which all of the change is happening. At the time, when you're going through it, it's like, \"Oh, shit. My life is liquefying in front of myself.\" On the other side of it, there's a metamorphosis that happens.\n\n(01:04:48):\nI like to use the language, in fact, I have a podcast called The Midlife Chrysalis, because I want to help change the dialogue around midlife, so that the number one word attached to midlife is not crisis, but in fact, it's maybe chrysalis, and the idea that life is meant to be transformative during that era.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:09):\nThat is actually very empowering. I am sort of going through that, not necessarily in this intense way yet, but that might be coming. You said there's a bunch of upsides to getting older. It might be helpful just to share a couple of those things for folks that are like, \"Oh, wow, I didn't realize that.\"\n\nChip Conley (01:05:23):\nEmotional intelligence grows with age. Our wisdom can grow with age, although we know 70-year-olds who are not as wise as 30-year-olds, so it's a matter of what you do with your life experience. I define wisdom as metabolized experience, mindfully shared for the common good. What else gets better with age? You learn how to edit. You have no more Fs left to give, no more fucks left to give. That is absolutely true, especially for women as they age. You are more spiritually curious. The list is long, and so there are a lot of things that, actually, another one that I love is you're not compartmentalized.\n\n(01:06:01):\nWhen you're younger, you're compartmentalized. As you grow older, you are growing whole, and that means you're alchemizing curiosity and wisdom, introvert, extrovert, masculine, feminine, gravitas, depth, and levity, lightness. The people who I really admire who are 85 years old, they're so present and they're so whole. They are just who they are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):\nThere's a quote I found from you along these lines, the societal narrative on aging is just don't do it.\n\nChip Conley (01:06:31):\nFantastic. Yeah. We sort of say we don't want to age, but we do want to live. Quite frankly, aging and living are the same thing, as are aging and growing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:44):\nComing back to MEA, just for folks that are interested, curious about this, who's this for, would you say? Who should seriously look into this program?\n\nChip Conley (01:06:52):\nMEA is really, the people who tend to come to MEA are in the midst of a transition. It could be selling their company, leaving a job, getting divorced, having kids, becoming an empty nester, taking care of parents till they're passing away, having a health diagnosis that's scary. Average age is 54, and it's people of all walks of life. It's not just the tech industry, but it's very popular in the tech industry. It's people who are looking to maybe do a reframe of their purpose, and maybe even a reinvention of their career.\n\n(01:07:29):\nYeah, the two campuses are just gorgeous. It's been called the Four Seasons meets Blue Zones meets the Esalen Institute, which I like. We have online programs too, and so you don't have to come to either of our campuses in Mexico, or on the beach, or in New Mexico. You can actually do it online.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:54):\nThose three, yeah, that's the tagline. That's your tagline right there. Esalen meets Blue Zones, meets what was the first one?\n\nChip Conley (01:08:00):\nThe Four Seasons.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):\nThe Four Seasons.\n\nChip Conley (01:08:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:03):\nNailed it. Okay. I'm going to zoom out and take us to a recurring segment on this podcast. I want to see if this goes anywhere, AI Corner, and with AI Corner, ask guests, what's a way that you've found AI useful in your work or in your life, any kind of trick you've learned, any workflow, anything you've found useful?\n\nChip Conley (01:08:23):\nYeah, I have a daily blog. It's called Wisdom Well, and it's on the MEA website. When I'm looking for inspiration, AI does it for me, and ultimately, it gives me a first draft. That's good enough for me then to say, \"Okay.\" There's times when I'm missing the inspiration. I tend to write really well in the morning.\n\n(01:08:47):\nIf it's any other time of the day, I do not like writing creatively. If I have a deadline for tomorrow and it's five o'clock in the afternoon, it's like, \"Okay, ChatGPT. I'm on my way to you.\" I tend to use ChatGPT the most because I don't know, I like Claude as well, but yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:03):\nOkay, awesome. I was going to ask which tool you use. What's your workflow there? Is it you use voice mode? Do you just type out, \"Here's what I'm thinking about, write me a little drop blog post?\"\n\nChip Conley (01:09:12):\nThe good news is that at this point, it knows me well enough and my blogs, and I've actually, it knows my weird sense of humor, so it's able to ape me pretty well. I'll just say, \"I need a 250 word post on,\" like today, today's post was a post that ChatGPT helped me with it. I said, \"I believe that there's a refrain that needs to happen with the soul. We tend to say, 'I have a soul, or I don't have a soul,' but what if my soul has me? What if in fact, my job is just to be this vehicle for my soul to go to the next lifetime?\"\n\n(01:09:56):\nMy job is to be this steward of the soul. I said, \"Write me something around that.\" It was just a weird idea. Of course, not all my blog posts are so new age, and I like that. I write a lot on leadership, but that was one that within 30 seconds, I had a 250 word blog post that I then adapted, and there you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:19):\nAmazing. Chip, we've covered a lot of ground. We've gone through your entire life. Maybe actually just the tip of the iceberg. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nChip Conley (01:10:31):\nYes. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nChip Conley (01:10:38):\nMy favorite book of all time, Man's Search for Meaning, Viktor Frankl in a concentration camp in World War II. When someone's going through a hard time in their life, I say, \"Read that book. You'll realize it's not so bad, what you're going through.\" It also really speaks to this idea of despair equals suffering, minus meaning. I wrote a book called Emotional Equations that was a New York Times bestseller that spoke to this idea that what if you could take all of your emotions and turn them into equations?\n\n(01:11:04):\nVery engineering-minded of me. That's one. I love any book by Liz Gilbert, sort of the opposite. Elizabeth Gilbert wrote Eat, Pray, Love. Her book, she's on faculty at MEA. She teaches here. Big Magic is just a beautiful book about sort of how do you get in the flow to allow the genie to come through you. Her Ted Talk in 2009 was about the fact that genius is not about being the genius yourself. It's about being the receptacle for the genie to come through you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:44):\nI want to come back to this equation you shared. I was going to get to it, but I didn't, so this is a good opportunity to. There's a couple that are really interesting to me. This is, you wrote about these in a book. You have a bunch of these equations about living a happier life. The one you shared is despair equals suffering, minus meaning.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:00):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:01):\nThe implication there is if you want less despair, increase the meaning.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:05):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nOr reduce the suffering.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:06):\nSuffering, Buddhist philosophy, the first noble truth of Buddhism is that suffering is ever-present. If suffering's a constant and you have two variables, using some algebra, I guess, you know that if you have more meaning, you have less suffering. That's that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:25):\nThe other one that I love is anxiety equals uncertainty times powerlessness. Maybe talk about that one briefly.\n\nChip Conley (01:12:32):\n98% of anxiety comes from two sources. One is what you don't know, and number two is what you can't control or influence, and based upon social science. You can create an anxiety balance sheet and create four columns. First column is what is it you do know about the thing that's making you anxious? The second column is, what is it you don't know? The third column is what is it you can control or influence? The fourth column is what is it you can't control or influence?\n\n(01:13:01):\nWhen you take free-floating anxiety and put it into an equation, it actually makes it more tangible, and you often are less anxious as a result.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:11):\nBoom. Okay, so if you're feeling anxious right now, this is an exercise you can do and you'll feel less anxious in like five minutes is what I'm hearing.\n\nChip Conley (01:13:19):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):\nOkay, excellent. Very, very good nugget of advice. Okay, let's keep going with the lightning round. Come back from our tangent. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nChip Conley (01:13:29):\nTed Lasso is, I'm a sucker for that show. When it comes to movies, I'm a total movie buff. We have an annual MEA Film Festival at our Santa Fe campus. I would say that the film that I'm most excited about that is coming out that most people have never heard of, it's called I'll Push You. It's the story of two guys, one of whom is in a degenerative health condition and in a wheelchair, and his best friend pushes him the 500 miles of the Camino de Santiago, and it's the relationship they build along that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:08):\nAmazing. Very deep cut. Do you have a favorite product that you recently discovered that you really love?\n\nChip Conley (01:14:17):\nYes. Hair growing material. No. Do you know Viori shorts? I sound like Scott Galloway because he advertises this, but Viori shorts are like, I just love them. They're just breathe and they're comfortable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:33):\nI'm wearing Viori joggers right now. The one downside of Viori, not to make anyone mad, is they're kind of plasticky if you look at the material. I'm trying to like, I don't know, but I do love, there's nothing better. That's the problem. Anything else like this that is all cotton.\n\nChip Conley (01:14:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:51):\nI'm a fan. I have many Viori, I don't know if they're called joggers, just, I don't know, weekenders or something. Anyway, love you, Viori. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find really useful in work or in life? I imagine you have many, but is there one that comes to mind?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:07):\nMy favorite one right now is your painful life lessons are the raw material for your future wisdom. The premise of that is that wisdom often comes through the school of hard knocks. When you're in the midst of a really challenging time, you are developing your future wisdom that's going to be valuable to you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nOkay, final question. You were on the board of Burning Man, or you still are?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:28):\nI was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nWas.\n\nChip Conley (01:15:34):\nI helped found the board of Burning Man. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):\nOkay. No big deal. I don't know if you know this, I got married at Burning Man. We had an unofficial wedding there on bicycles, so it's really meaningful to us. I've been there four or five times. What's something about Burning Man that maybe people don't know, some inside story or a really unexpected piece of the journey? I may imagine there's a lot, but what comes to mind?\n\nChip Conley (01:15:55):\nI would say the best not well-known thing about Burning Man is that Burning Man own owns a place called Fly Ranch. Fly Ranch is about 10 miles from Burning Man. Now, when you go to the Burn, the event around Labor Day, you cannot go over there. It's locked off. It's 3,400 acres. If you look at Fly Ranch, FlyRanch.org, I think it might even be, or it's on the Burning Man site, Fly Ranch is the opposite of Burning Man. Burning Man is this alkaline desert.\n\n(01:16:29):\nThere's no living life there at all. It's very masculine. Fly Ranch is porous, and lots of desert grasses, and hot springs, and hot pools, and birds, and wild horses, and it's one of my favorite hot springs places in the world. Just check it out, and you can go there when it's not during the event. It's quite beautiful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):\nIt feels like it might've inspired MEA in many ways.\n\nChip Conley (01:17:00):\nIt did, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:03):\nChip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChip Conley (01:17:08):\nOnline, MEAWisdom.com is the website for MEA. My website is ChipConley.com, C-O-N-L-E-Y, and I'm on LinkedIn. That's really, from a social media perspective, the thing that I do the most. I actually take my daily blogs and put them on LinkedIn. Then what your community can do, just come say hi, come check me out. If wisdom's interesting to you, and I think wisdom should be interesting to everybody here, on the MEA website, at the very bottom footer, you'll see a bunch of free resources.\n\n(01:17:43):\nOne of them is called Why Successful Leaders Value Wisdom. It is a free resource, and there's also a free resource down there called The Anatomy of a Transition. Those two free resources, understanding how to build your TQ, your transitional intelligence, and understanding how to develop wisdom are two, to my mind, two of the most important modern skills that we can have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:05):\nIt's funny when you say you're on LinkedIn. It doesn't resonate with me. Chip Conley on LinkedIn, posting on LinkedIn, something about...\n\nChip Conley (01:18:13):\nI don't know. Why? Because I'm a little too Burning Man?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):\nYou're just, yeah, exactly. It feels like that's not your vibe, but I love that you do it, because that's where the people are.\n\nChip Conley (01:18:21):\nOh, I put wild, weird stuff up on LinkedIn, and thank God somebody's doing that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:28):\nFor some reason, I don't see it. I need to fix that. Chip, this was incredible. Everything I was hoping it'd be, thank you so much for being here and for sharing-\n\nChip Conley (01:18:34):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:34):\n... your wisdom.\n\nChip Conley (01:18:35):\nI am so proud as I go back, like have your proud Papa who just loves to see you in your element, and I just want to make sure everybody knows the following. Lenny was so good to work with. Whenever you were assigned to a project as a PM, I appreciated it because I just knew that we were going to have great conversations. You're just an interesting dude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:00):\nWell, I appreciate that, Chip. That's going to be the beginning of this whole episode. We're just going to put that up front. Just kidding. That was awesome, Chip. Really appreciate it.\n\nChip Conley (01:19:01):\nThanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:08):\nThanks everyone for listening. Bye, everyone.

  "transcript": "# OpenAI researcher on why soft skills are the future of work | Karina Nguyen\n\n## Transcript\n\nChip Huyen (00:00:00):\nA question that get asked a lot and a lot is, \"How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?\" Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news? If you talk to the users who understand what they want or they don't want, look into the feedback, then you can actually improve the application way, way, way more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nA lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products.\n\nChip Huyen (00:00:19):\nWe are in an ideal crisis. Now, we have all this really cool tools to do everything from scratch and have new design. It can have you write code. You can have new website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nAll this AI hype, the data is actually showing most companies try it, doesn't do a lot. They stop. What do you think is the gap here?\n\nChip Huyen (00:00:38):\nIt's really hard to measure productivity. So, I do ask people to ask their managers, \"Would you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra head count?\" Almost every one, the managers will say head count. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say, \"Want AI assistant.\" Because as managers, you are still growing, so for you having one HR head count is big. Whereas for executives, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:11):\nToday, my guest is Chip Huyen. Unlike a lot of people who share insights into building great AI products and where things are heading, Chip has built multiple successful AI products, platforms, tools. Chip was a core developer on NVIDIA's NeMo platform, an AI researcher at Netflix. She taught machine learning at Stanford. She's also a two-time founder and the author of two of the most popular books in the world of AI, including her most recent book called AI Engineering, which has been the most read book on the O'Reilly platform since its launch.\n\n(00:01:41):\nShe's also gotten to work with a lot of enterprises on their AI strategies, and so she gets to see what's actually happening on the ground inside a lot of different companies. In our conversation, Chip explains a lot of the basics like, what exactly does pre-training and post-training look like? What is RAG? What is reinforcement learning? What is RLHF? We also get into everything she's learned about how to build great AI products, including what people think it takes and what it actually takes. We talk about the most common pitfalls that companies run into, where she's seeing the most productivity gains and so much more.\n\n(00:02:12):\nThis episode is quite technical, more technical than most conversations I've had, and is meant for anyone looking for a more in-depth conversation about AI.

Chip, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nChip Huyen (00:04:34):\nHi, Lenny. I've been a big fan of the podcast for a while, so I'm really excited to be here. Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:40):\nI want to start with this table/chart that you shared on LinkedIn a while ago that went super viral, and I think it went super viral because it hit a nerve with a lot of people. Let me just read this and we'll show this on YouTube for people that are watching. So it's this very simple table you shared of what people think will improve AI apps and what actually improves AI apps. What people think will improve AI apps, staying up to date with the latest AI news, adopting the newest agentic framework, agonizing about what vector databases to use, constantly evaluating what model is smarter, fine-tuning a model. And then you have what actually improves AI apps, talking to users, building more reliable platforms, preparing better data, optimizing end-to-end workflows, writing better prompts. Why do you think this hit such a nerve with people? If you had to boil it down, what do you think people are missing about building successful AI apps?\n\nChip Huyen (00:05:30):\n[inaudible 00:05:30] question that get asked a lot and a lot is that, \"How do we keep up to date with the latest AI news?\" I'm like, \"Why? Why do you need to keep up to date with the latest AI news?\" I know it sound very counter-intuitive, but there's just so much news out there. A lot of people also ask me questions like, \"How do I choose between two different technologies?\" Maybe like recently, MCP versus agent-to-agent protocol? And it was like, \"Which one is better or this or that?\" I think it's a [inaudible 00:05:59] question you should ask them is like, \"First, how much of the improvement could you get from optimal solutions versus non-optimal solutions?\" Right? And sometimes they were like, \"Actually, it's not much.\" Right?\n\n(00:06:10):\nI was like, \"Okay, if it's not much improvement, then why do you want to spend so much time debating something that doesn't make that much difference to your performance?\" Another question they ask is like, \"If you adopted a new technology, how hard it could be to switch that out to another?\" And sometimes they will like, \"Oh, I think it could be a lot of work switching it out.\" And I'm just like, \"Hmm, let's say here's a new technology. It hasn't been tested by a lot of people, and if you would adopt it, you would be stuck with it forever. Do you actually want to adopt it?\" Maybe you want to think twice about over commit to new technologies that hasn't been better tested.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:49):\nI love your just broader advice is just simple like, to build successful AI apps, talk to users, build better data, write better prompts, optimize the user experience, versus just like, what is the latest and greatest? What's the best model to use right now? What's happening in AI? Let me follow this thread of this idea of fine-tuning and basically post-training. There's all these terms that people hear in AI, and I think this is going to be a really good opportunity for people to learn what we're actually talking about, since you actually do these things, you build these things, you work with companies doing these things. There's a few terms I want to sprinkle in through the conversation, but let's start with this one. What's the simplest way for someone to understand? What is the difference between pre-training and post-training and then just how fine-tuning fits into that, just what fine-tuning actually is?\n\nChip Huyen (00:07:34):\nChip disclaimer, I don't have full visibility on what this big secretive frontier labs are doing. But right from what I heard, so I think it's like one is, supervised fine-tuning when you have demonstration data, and you have a bunch of experts, \"Okay, here's a prompt, and here is what the answer should be like.\" You just train it to emulate what the human expert could be like. That's also what a lot of people would like, so open-source models are doing as they do it by distillation. So instead of having human experts to write really great answers to prompts, they get very popular, famous good models to generate a response to it and getting this train smaller models to emulate.\n\n(00:08:23):\nSometimes you see people just like... So, that's because I really appreciate open source community by the way, but going from being able to train models that can emulate a existing good model. It's very different from being [inaudible 00:08:38] trained good models, like an output for existing good model. So, it's a big step there. Yeah, we have my supervised fine-tuning, and another thing that's very big, I'm not sure you have guests talking about it already, but reinforcement learning is everywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:52):\nLet's pause on that because I definitely want to spend time on that, and that's such cool topic that's merging more and more in my conversations. But just to even summarize the things you just shared, which I think is really, really important stuff. So, the idea here is a model, essentially this algorithm piece of code that someone writes and say the frontier models are feeding it just like the entire internet of content, and basically, it's trying to test itself on predicting across all that data the next word, essentially. Token is the correct way of thinking about it, but a simpler way to think about it is the next word in text. As it gets it wrong, it adjusts these things called weights, essentially. Just like, is that a simple way to think about it, even that's just very surface level?\n\nChip Huyen (00:09:35):\nSo, I think of language modeling as a way of encoding statistical information about language, right? So, let's say that we both speak English, so we get a sense of what is more statistically likely. If I say my favorite color is, then you would say, \"Okay, that should be another color.\" The word blue would be much more likely to appear than the word like [inaudible 00:09:59], right? Because statistically, blue is more likely to [inaudible 00:10:02] my favorite color is. So, it's a way of encoding statistical information.\n\n(00:10:07):\nSo when language modeling, when you train a large amount of data, you see a lot of languages, a lot of domains. So it can tell, okay, your basic size is standard. Then the user do the prompts and it could come with the next most likely token. So by the way, it's not a new idea actually. So it's the idea comes very, very old, from the 1951 papers like English entropy. I think it's by Claude Shannon, it's a great paper. And I think it reveals a story I really like is from... Did you read Sherlock Holmes by the way?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:39):\nYeah, I read a few Sherlock Holmes books. Yeah.\n\nChip Huyen (00:10:41):\nYeah. So this is story of when Sherlock Holmes says using this statistical information to help solve a case. So this is his story. There is somebody left a message with a lot of stick figures. So Sherlock Holmes was like, okay, he knows that in English, the most common letter is E. Then the most common stick figure must be E. And then he goes, he stopped like that, [inaudible 00:11:07]. So the code... So I think there's language. So in a way, it's simple language modeling, but instead of at a work level, he does this as character level and token is something in between, right? A token is not quite a word, but it's bigger than a character. So let's say we say token because it would help us reduce vocabulary because which character is smallest amount of vocabulary right now. So alphabet has 26 character, but words can have millions and millions, right? Whereas tokens, you can be able to get the sweet spot between the two.\n\n(00:11:44):\nSo let's say that we have the new word, how to say it, like podcasting, right? Let's say it's a new word, but it can divide a podcast and ing. So people understand, okay, podcast, we know the meaning. We know that ing is a verb, gerund, whatever it is. So we even know the word podcasting so that's why the token comes in. But yeah, the pre-tuning is basically encoding statistical informations of language to have you predict what is most likely. I think that most likely is the most simple way of doing it because it's more building a distribution of, okay, so the next token could be more 90% of the the time it could be a color, 10% of the time could be something else. So it basically distribution so language could pick, depending on your sampling strategy. Do you want it to always pick the most likely token or do you want it to pick something more creative? So I think my sampling strategy, I think is something extremely important. It can have you boost a performance in a huge way and very, very underrated.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):\nOkay, awesome. So essentially, a model is just code with this whole set of weights, essentially the statistical model that has learned to predict what comes next after certain words and phrases?\n\nChip Huyen (00:13:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:03):\nAnd then post-training and fine-tuning, specifically, is doing that same thing. So pre-training you get GPT5. Fine-tuning is someone taking GPT5 and doing the same sort of thing, adjusting these weights a little bit for specific use cases on data that they find is necessary to do their very specific use case. Is that a simple way to think about it?\n\nChip Huyen (00:13:24):\nYeah, I think weights is functions, right? So let's say you have... Maybe it has a functions of maybe Lenny's height is maybe 1X plus something or 2X [inaudible 00:13:38] and plus something is the weights, right? So you change it until you fit the correct data, which is my height and your height. So you can think it's a weight, as just a weight, say function. So you train, adjust the weights so they can fit the data, which is the training data.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):\nAwesome. Okay. So we're talking about pre-training, post-training, fine-tuning. Is there anything else here that's important to share about just what this is exactly? What people need to understand about these parts of training?\n\nChip Huyen (00:14:06):\nSo the vast majority of time, we don't touch on pre-training model. As users, we don't use it at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:12):\nRight. It's already done for us.\n\nChip Huyen (00:14:13):\nYeah. So I think my [inaudible 00:14:15] is a bit of fun process when my friend's training model is they try to play with their pre-training model and they're horrendous. They're saying things like [inaudible 00:14:23] \"Oh, my gosh.\" Yeah, it's crazy. So it's very interesting to look at how much of post-training can change the model behavior and I think that's where a lot of time, is a lot of people are spending energy on nowadays, their frontier lab, is on post-training. Because pre-training, I think... So pre-training have been used to increase the general capacity of capabilities of a model. And it needs a lot of data and model size to increase the model capabilities. And at some point, we are actually have kind of maxed out on the internet data. And people text data max out. I think a lot of people are doing with other data like audios and videos, and everyone's trying to think of what is the new source of data, but where like post-trading, but middle course of this is more of everyone have very similar pre-training data, is that post-training is where they make a big difference nowadays.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:21):\nThis is a good segue to, you talked about supervised learning versus unsupervised learning. I love, we're getting into this, by the way. This is super interesting. So you talk about labeled data. Basically, supervised learning is AI learning on data that somebody has already labeled and told it, here's correct versus incorrect. For example, this is spam versus not spam. This is a good short story. This is not a good short story. We've had the CEOs of a lot of these companies that do this for labs, Mercor and Scale, Handshake, there's Micro, there's a few others. So is that essentially what these companies are doing for labs, giving them labeled data, high-quality data to train on?\n\nChip Huyen (00:15:57):\nIt is in a way, but I think it's more like a product of big equations. So there are a lot more different components than that. So that's why I was talking about reinforcement learning. I'm not sure if your CEO [inaudible 00:16:09] interview bring up that term. So the idea is that once you [inaudible 00:16:14]... So let's say you have a model, give the model a prompt and it produce an output. You want to buy, once you reinforce, encourage the model to produce an output that is better. So now it comes to how do we know that the answer is good or bad? So usually, people relies on signals. So one way to get a first one good or bad is human feedback. They happen to be have two responses. You can, okay, this one one's better than the other. And we do that is because as humans, we tend to, it's very hard to give a concrete score, but it's easier to do comparisons.\n\n(00:16:53):\nIf you ask me, okay, give this song a score, I'm not a musician and don't know how hard it is. It's like yeah, I don't know what, out of 10 I going to remove six. And if you ask me again a month from now and I completely forgotten, okay, maybe now seven, only four, I don't know. But then if you ask me, okay, here are two songs and which one would you prefer to play for the birthday party? I was like, \"Okay, I can prefer this song.\" So comparisons a lot easier. So [inaudible 00:17:18] have a human, you have human feedback and then you use this human feedback to treat a reward model to tell which and then the reward model help you like, okay, it's a model that produce this response.\n\n(00:17:28):\nIt's [inaudible 00:17:30] can score, is this good or bad? And you try to bias toward producing better model, the better responses. Another ways you can, instead of using a human, so you can use AI because the response and say good or bad, right? Or in fact the thing is that people are very big on nowadays, verifiable rewards, which it's natural. So basically, they give it a math problem and then math solutions is a model app a solution. Okay, it's expected response should be 42 and if it doesn't provide 42, then it's wrong. Now it's not a good response. So yes, a lot of time, people using this human laborer, human laborers should produce, how to say, expert questions and I say expected answers and in the ways that [inaudible 00:18:16] systems that verifiable so that the models can be trained on. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:19):\nOkay, I'm really glad you went there. This is essentially RLHF reinforcement learning with human feedback, which is exactly what I wanted to also talk about, right?\n\nChip Huyen (00:18:29):\nYeah. So I think it's general, it's a way of learning. It's training is [inaudible 00:18:33] learning and whether it learn from human feedback or AI feedback or verifiable rewards, I think I say it's just different way of collating signals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:44):\nAwesome. Yeah. We had the CEO of Anthropic on the podcast and he talked about their version of RLHF, which is AI driven reinforcement learning. I love the way you phrased it where basically you want to help the model, you want to reinforce correct behavior and correct answers, and this is the method to do it, whether it's say an engineer seeing an output from a model being like, \"No, here's how I would code it differently.\" And it's training a different model that the original model works with to tell it, am I correct or not correct? Is that right, roughly?\n\nChip Huyen (00:19:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:16):\nOkay.\n\nChip Huyen (00:19:16):\nI think that's a way of looking into it. I think that's a space is so exciting nowadays because there are so many domain expert task that the model developers want models to do well on, right? Let's say you're accountant. Maybe you want to use a model to have accounting task and need a lot of accounting data examples from accountant. So you need to hire a lot of them, should I do it or everyone [inaudible 00:19:41] physics problems, everyone should do, I don't know, legal questions and stuff or engineering questions or somebody was telling me they want to do, using coding to source scientific problems and not just coding to build product, which is another different whole realm of things. And I also using very specific toolings. I'm not sure what apps you use, but maybe like a [inaudible 00:20:04] app or QuickBooks or Google Excel. They have very specific tools, specific expertise. So you want the model [inaudible 00:20:13] learn.\n\n(00:20:13):\nSo they need a lot of humans expert in this area should create data to train them and it's a massive thing people because everyone wants a lot of data and wants [inaudible 00:20:25] unlimited budget. But whether, I think this is also a little bit of low-key, interesting economics. I'm not sure you've talked to the guests about, I thought it's very interesting [inaudible 00:20:35] think about because it's very lopsided, right? Because they're only a very small numbers of frontier labs and they want a lot of data and there's a massive amount of startups or company providing related data. So you can see these companies like this startup doing data labeling. They have maybe some massive AR, but if you ask them, \"Okay, so how many customers you have?\" And they could be very small numbers, I'm not sure. I'm not sure you... I saw you smiling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:03):\nYeah, yeah, yeah, we chatted about that.\n\nChip Huyen (00:21:05):\nYeah, so I'm a little bit like [inaudible 00:21:08] uneasy. I have a company's growing crazy, but it's heavily dependent on two or three companies. And at the same time, if I was this company, frontier labs, what could be the right economical things for me to do? Now I want a lot of startups. I want to have a lot of providers so I can pick and choose, and as this providers can also to compete each other to lower the price and it's so dependent on [inaudible 00:21:34] regardless. So I feel like, yeah, so this whole economics is very interesting to me and I'm curious to see and how it plays out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:42):\nWhat I'm hearing is you're bearish on the future of these data labeling companies because as you said, they don't have a lot of leverage over pricing because they have so few customers and there's so many people getting into the space. So basically, even though there's some of the fastest growing companies in the world, you're feeling like there's a challenge up ahead.\n\nChip Huyen (00:22:00):\nI'm not sure if I'm bearish on it. I think I'm curious because I think things has a way of work out in ways that I don't expect. So I think that maybe these companies, they have a lot of data, maybe they wouldn't be able to use that to have some insight that helps them stay ahead of the curve. So I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):\nA very fair answer. Okay, while we're on this topic, I want to chat about evals, which is a very recurring topic in this podcast. This is the other piece of data content these companies share that AI labs really need. Can you just talk about what an eval is, the simplest way to understand it and then how this helps models get smarter?\n\nChip Huyen (00:22:41):\nSo I think people approach eval, I think they're two very different problems. One is a app builder and can I say have an app that do maybe a chatbot? Very simple answer first thing that came to my mind and I want you to know if chatbot is good or bad. So it needs to come away with evaluate the chatbot. Another thing is, I think of this as a task-specific eval design. So let's say I'm a model developer and I want to make my model better at code writing. And it was like, \"Okay, but how do I even measure code writing?\"\n\n(00:23:19):\nSo I need someone to understand code writing and think about what makes a story good and then design the whole dataset and then criteria to evaluate code writing. So yeah, I think there's that. I think it's more like eval design that is very interesting [inaudible 00:23:39] work criteria, [inaudible 00:23:42] work guidelines, how to do it and then also train people how to do it effectively. So I guess, [inaudible 00:23:49], I think eval is really, really fun because it's extremely creative. I was looking at different eval people built and it was like, \"Wow.\" It's not dry at all. It's just super, super, super fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:01):\nWe had a whole podcast on evals with Hamel and Shreya. That's exactly what they talked about is just, it's actually really fun to create evals for companies, especially. So let's still dig into that one a little bit more. There's this kind of debate online that, I don't know how big of a deal this debate is, but it feels like people spend a lot of time thinking about this, this idea of, do we need evals for AI products? Some of the best companies say they don't really do evals, they just go on vibes. They're just like, \"Is this working well? Can I feel it or not?\" What's your take on just the importance of building evals and the skill of evals for AI apps, not the model companies?\n\nChip Huyen (00:24:39):\nYou don't have to be absolutely perfect, I think, to win. You just need to be good enough and being consistent about it. Okay, this is not a philosophy I follow, but I have worked with enough companies to see that play out. So when I say, why a company don't eval? Let's say you are an executive and you want to have a new use case. So here's a use case you started out, built and it's like it works well. The customers are somewhat happy. You don't have the exact metric for it.\n\n(00:25:05):\nSo the traffic keeps increasing, people seem happy, people keep buying stuff and now here's our engineer coming like, \"Okay, we need eval for it.\" And it was like, \"Okay, how much effort do we need to go into eval?\" And they were like, \"Okay, maybe two engineers, this much, this much.\" And it could maybe would improve that and it was like, \"Okay, so how much expected gain can I get from it?\" And the engineer would be like, \"Oh, maybe you can improve it from 80% to 82%, 85%.\"\n\n(00:25:33):\nAnd it was like, \"Okay, but [inaudible 00:25:35] that two engineers and we going to launch a new feature, then it could give me so much more improvement.\" So I think it's one of them is eval. Sometimes people think of eval as like okay, this is good enough, just don't touch it. If you do spend a lot of energy on eval, it would only incremental improvement where it spends the energy on another use case and maybe [inaudible 00:25:55] good enough that you can vibe check it.\n\n(00:25:57):\nSo I do think maybe that's a debate is about. I do think that a lot of time people just get things to the place where it's like, okay, good enough, people run. But in the end, but of course there's a lot of risk associated with it because if you don't have a clear metric, you have a good visibility to [inaudible 00:26:17] applications or models performing it might do something very dumb or it can cause you, I know something crazy can happen. So yeah, so I do think eval is very, very important if you have, if you operate a scale and where failures can have catastrophic consequences.\n\n(00:26:38):\nThen you do need to be very tyrannical about what you put in front of the users, understand different failure modes, what could go wrong and also maybe in a space when that it's a feature, the product is a competitive advantage. You want to be the best at it. So you want to have a very strong understanding of where you are and where you are with the competitors. But it's just something that's more a low-key, okay, this is like something is like, okay, that's not the core but it helps with our users.\n\n(00:27:04):\nThen maybe you don't need to be so obsessed or theoretical about it. It's like, okay, that's good enough for now and if it fails, then it fails. Okay, I know it's so terrifying. But yeah, I think it's all about the question of return investment. I'm a big fan of eval, I love reading eval. And I says, I understand why some people would choose to not focus on eval right away and choose bringing on new functionalities instead.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):\nAwesome. That is a really pragmatic answer. What I'm hearing is evals are great, very important, especially if you're operating at scale, but pick your battles. You don't need to write evals for every little feature. Something that Hamel and Shreya shared is that people need just, I don't know, five or seven evals for the most important elements of their product. Is that what you see or do you see a lot more in production that people build and need?\n\nChip Huyen (00:27:54):\nI don't think of just a fixed number on the evals. What was the goal of eval? The goal of eval is to guide the product development. So you see eval, because I think I'm a big fan of eval, is that it helps you uncover opportunities where the progress are doing well. So sometimes, we've seen a very obvious [inaudible 00:28:15] where you look at the eval and we realize it's like, okay, it performed really poorly on this specific segment of users and then we look into it's like, okay, what's wrong with it? And it turns out, it's like we just don't have a good messaging to it. So people should just focus on the things that we're doing poorly, can improve significantly. Yeah, so I kind of like the number of eval is really depends. We have seen product with hundreds of different metrics.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:40):\nOh, wow.\n\nChip Huyen (00:28:41):\nPeople going crazy, this is because that product is general, have different names, have one eval for, I don't know, verbosity, have one eval for user sensitive data and another is for length but has a number of, okay, let's just give a good example, concrete example, like deep research. So you have the application, you have views and model to do deep research for you. Okay, have a prompt. Let me say, okay, do me a comprehensive research on only Lenny's Podcast and help me propose, show me report on what kind of topics he's interested in, what kind of videos could get the most views or what topics that he's missing on that he should be covering, right? Have that prompt. Then how do you evaluate the result? I don't think there's one metrics that would help. Maybe it's like maybe you have a hundred, I think somebody has a benchmark and is get a hundred expert, write a bunch of prompts and they go through, on the answers on AI and do it. And it's extremely costly and slow.\n\n(00:29:46):\nBut [inaudible 00:29:47] might have something else. First of all, one way I was thinking about it, I was talking to a friend about it and one way it's like, how would you produce the result of the summary? At first you need to, what you do, gather informations and to gather informations you need to do a lot of search queries. You gather, grab the search results and then some of the search results you aggregate and then maybe say, okay, I'm still missing on this. You have to go another route and on another route, [inaudible 00:30:17] have the summary. So every step of the way, you need evaluations. You don't [inaudible 00:30:21] end-to-end. Maybe it was a search query in my first thing about, okay, now I write five search queries. I might look into how good are the search queries? Do they as they similar to each other because you need five search queries are very similar? Okay, Lenny Podcast, Lenny Podcast last month, Lenny Podcast two months ago.\n\n(00:30:39):\nIt's not very exciting. But if the query is a podcast, the keywords are more diverse and then look at the results of the search query and then say you enter the search query. Lenny Podcast data labeling and they come up with 10 pages, 10 results. And then you come up with like, oh, Lenny Podcast on, I don't know, frontier labs, and you have 10 results. [inaudible 00:31:06] different webpages. Okay, how much of them overlapping... Are we doing both the breadth, getting a lot of page, but also, do we have depth and also do you have relevance because if we come up with a search query, it's completely irrelevant to the original prompt. So I feel like every aspect of it, it would need a way of evaluating. So I don't think it's how many eval should I get, but how many eval do I need to get a good coverage, a high confidence in my application's performance and also to help me understand where it is not performing well so that I can fix it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:43):\nAwesome. And I'm hearing also just especially for the very core use case, the most common path people take in your product is where you want to focus.\n\nChip Huyen (00:31:51):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:54):\nOkay. There's one more term I want to cover and I want to go a somewhat different direction. RAG? People see this term a lot, R-A-G. What does it mean?\n\nChip Huyen (00:32:04):\nSo RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generations [inaudible 00:32:08] not a specific true generative AI. So the idea is just for a lot of questions, we need context to answer. So I think it came pretty, I think it's from the paper 2017. So someone was like, so they realized it's for a bunch of benchmark. When the question answering benchmarks, they realized it's like, okay, if we give the model informations about the questions, the next answer can be much, much better. So what they do with that is try to retrieve information from Wikipedia. So for question [inaudible 00:32:39], just retrieve that and then put it into the context and answer. It does much better. So I feel like it sounds like a no-brainer, right? I mean, obviously. So I think that's what RAG is, as a simplest sense, it's just providing the model with a relevant context so that it can answer the questions. And it's where things get really more interesting because traditionally, when it started out, RAG is mostly text.\n\n(00:33:03):\nSo we talk about a lot of way of how to prepare data so that the model can retrieve effectively. Let's say that not everything is a Wikipedia page. A Wikipedia page is pretty contained and you know, okay, everything about it is about a topic. But a lot of time, you have documents of like [inaudible 00:33:19] and they have a weird way of structures of documents. Let's say that you had documents about Lenny Podcast and in the future, in the beginning a document it's like, from now on, podcast wouldn't refer to Lenny's Podcast. So let's say somebody in the future is like, \"Okay, tell me about Lenny. Lenny's work.\" And because as a [inaudible 00:33:40] document does not have the term Lenny, you just don't know, you might not retrieve it. And if the document is long enough that it's chunked into a different part, so the second part doesn't have the word Lenny, so you cannot reach it. So you have to find a way to process data. So that makes sure it's like... It can retrieve, the information is just relevant to the query even though it might not immediately obvious that it's related.\n\n(00:34:02):\nSo people come up with only thing of, I think, contextual visual, like giving X chunk of the data, the relevant, maybe in a summary metadata so that it knows or some people use as hypothetical questions. It's very interesting for even the chunk of documents, I must generate a bunch of questions that the chunks can help answer so that when I have a query, it's like okay, does it match any of the hypothetical questions? It can fetch it. So it's very interesting approach. Okay, so maybe before I go to the next thing, I just want to say this data preparations for RAG is extremely important. And I would say this in a lot of the companies that I have seen, that's the biggest performance, in their RAG solutions coming from better data preparations, not agonizing over what [inaudible 00:34:51] databases to use because [inaudible 00:34:53] database, of course is very important to care about things like latency or if you have very specific access patterns like read-heavy or write-heavy, of course, it's like it matters. But in term of pure quality answers, I think the data preparation is just [inaudible 00:35:07].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:06):\nWhen you say data preparation, what's an example to make that real and concrete for us to understand?\n\nChip Huyen (00:35:16):\nSo one way is mentioned as in you have chunks of data. So we have think about how big of each chunk should be. Because if it's sort of think about it's a context you want to maximize, maybe you can, it's very simple example. You want to retrieve a thousand words. So if a data chunk is long, then it's more likely to contain more relevant metadata so it can retrieve more. But if it's too long then you have a thousand word. And so chunk is like a thousand words, you can reach one chunk. So it's not very useful. But if it's too short, then you can retrieve more relevant information also. It can retrieve a wider range of documents and chunks, but at the same time each chunk is too small to contain relevant information.\n\n(00:36:02):\nSo we have very nice chunk design, how big each chunk should be. You add contextual informations like summary, metadata, hypothetical questions. Somebody was telling me just a very big performance they got is that from rewriting their data in the question-answering format. Instead of having... So they have a podcast instead of just chunking the podcast, you just reframe, rewrite it into here's a question, here's answers and produce a lot of them. It can use AI for that as well. So that's one example of data processing. A lot of example I see is for people helping, using AI to help specific [inaudible 00:36:40] use and documentations. And we write documentation. Usually a lot of documentation today is written for human reading and AI reading is different because it's different because humans, we have common sense and we kind of know what it is. So one things are, even for human experts, they have the context that AI doesn't quite have.\n\n(00:36:59):\nSo somebody told me that what's a big change they have is let's say, that you have a function. The documentation for this, maybe the library. As a library said okay, the output of this one is maybe talking for, I don't know, some crazy term, maybe some temperature or something on the graph. It should be like one zero or minus one. And as a human expert maybe understand the scale, what one in the scale mean, but for AI, just really doesn't understand what that means. So actually, have another annotation layer for AI. It's like, okay, good temperatures equal one means like that. It's not like it's a actual temperature. It's associated with the scale over there. So just saving all this data processing to make it easier for AI to retrieve the relevant information to answer the questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by Persona, the verified identity platform, helping organizations onboard users fight fraud and build trust. We talk a lot on this podcast about the amazing advances in AI, but this can be a double-edged sword. For every wow moment, there are fraudsters using the same tech to wreak havoc, laundering money, taking over employee identities and impersonating businesses. Persona helps combat these threats with automated user business and employee verification. Whether you're looking to catch candidate fraud, meet age restrictions or keep your platform safe, Persona helps you verify users in a way that's tailored to your specific needs. Best of all, Persona makes it easy to know who you're dealing with without adding friction for good users.

Just head to withpersona.com/lenny to get started. That's withpersona.com/lenny. Thanks again to Persona for sponsoring this episode.\n\n(00:38:51):\nAwesome. Okay. So you've talked a bit about how you work with companies on these sorts of things, on their AI strategies, on their AI products, how they build, which tools they build, all these things. I want to spend a little time here because a lot of companies are building AI products. A lot of companies are not having a good time building AI products. Let me ask a few questions along these lines of what you've learned working with companies that are doing this well. One is just, I guess, in terms of AI tool adoption and adoption in general within companies, there's all this talk recently of just all this AI hype. The data is actually showing most companies try it. Doesn't do a lot, they stop. And so there's all this just maybe this isn't going anywhere. So in terms of just adoption of tools in AI within companies, what are you seeing there?\n\nChip Huyen (00:39:32):\nFor GenAI in company, I think there are two types of GenAI toolings that have been, I've seen ones is to internal productivity, like have coding tools, Slack chatbot, internal knowledge. A lot of big enterprises have some a wrapper around models, so with access to maybe some different type of a RAG solution. I think we talk about data or kind of like text-based RAG. We haven't talked about agentic RAG or I haven't talked about multi-modal RAG yet. But this, yes, it's a whole very exciting area around that. So basically, it should allow the employee to access internal document. Somebody ask, okay, I'm having a baby. What could be the maternal or paternal policy or am I having these operations with the health benefit cover that or I want you to interview, I want to refer my friend. What will be the process for that? So a lot of this having chatbot, internal chatbot to help with internal operations.\n\n(00:40:35):\nAnd another things, another category is more customer facing or partner facing. So product customers support chatbot is a big one. If you're a hotel chain, you might have a booking chatbot, which is somehow massive. A lot of booking chatbot because I guess it's... I do have this theory of a lot of applications companies pursue because they can't measure the concrete outcome. And I feel like booking or a sales chatbot, it's very clear. There was a conversion rate right now with that chatbot with human operators and what could be conversion rate with a chatbot and certain, somehow I think it's very clear outcomes and companies are easier to buy into these solutions. So a lot of companies have that customer facing chatbot.\n\n(00:41:20):\nSo that is another category of tool and I think that for customers or external facing tools, because people are driven to choose applications with clear outcomes. So the questions of adopting them is really based on whether they see the outcome or not. Of course, it's not perfect because sometimes the outcome can be bad not because the idea or the application's idea [inaudible 00:41:52] is bad. It's just because the process of building it is not that great. Yeah. So it's tricky. For the internal adoptions of toolings or internal productivities, that's where it gets tricky. I would say a lot of companies [inaudible 00:42:08] think of AI strategy. I think of AI strategies usually have two key aspects. It's like use cases and the second is talent. You might have great data for great use cases, but you don't have talents and you cannot do it.\n\n(00:42:23):\nSo a lot of time at the beginning with GenAI and sometimes I'm really admire a lot of companies for that, it's just like [inaudible 00:42:28] was like, okay, we need our employees to be very GenAI aware, very AI literate. So what I do is I start maybe adopting a bunch of tools for the team to use. They have a lot of up-skilling workshops, they encourage learning and then it's a really, really good thing. And it's also willing to spend a lot of money into adopting, giving people chargeability, subscriptions, purchase subscriptions, [inaudible 00:42:56] subscriptions to get the employees to be more AI literate. And that's the thing is a lot of... There's a [inaudible 00:43:05] may say, okay, we spend a ton of money on this tooling, but then we don't see because you can see the usage, but people don't seem to use them as much and what is the issue. So yeah, so I think that is tricky. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:20):\nWhat do you think is the issue? Is it just they don't know how to use them? What do you think is the gap here? Do you think we'll get to a place of just like, wow, work is completely different because of AI for a lot of companies?\n\nChip Huyen (00:43:32):\nThe main thing is it's really hard to measure productivity again. So I talk to a lot of people on their website. First of all, [inaudible 00:43:40] is coding. A lot of companies not using coding agents or coding [inaudible 00:43:45] coding. And I was asking, I was like, \"Do you think that it helps with your productivity?\" And a lot of times, the questions are very [inaudible 00:43:56] okay, I feel like it's [inaudible 00:43:59] better. And I said, okay, because we have more PRs, we see more code and then immediate [inaudible 00:44:04]. Okay, but of course, code, number of live code is not a good metric for that. So it's really, really tricky and it's something funny. So I do ask people to ask their managers because I work with usually VP level, so they have multiple teams under them. So I asked them, okay, do you ask some managers, okay, would you rather have access...\n\n(00:44:28):\nWould you rather give everyone on the team very expensive coding agent subscriptions or you get an extra headcount? Let's say maybe and almost everyone could say the managers could say headcount. But if you ask VP level or someone who manage a lot of teams, they would say just like [inaudible 00:44:48] good one, AI, a system as tools. And the reason is that we could say okay, because as manager is right, because you are still growing. You're not as a level when you manage hundreds of thousands of people. So for you, having one HR headcount is big. So you want that not for productivity reasons, but because you just want to have more people working for you. Whereas for executives, you care more about, maybe you have more business metrics that you care about. So you actually think about what actually drive productivity metrics for you. So it is tricky and I think that the question of productivity. I'm not sure it's fundamentally is the [inaudible 00:45:32] more productive, but it's just like we don't have a good way of measuring productivity improvement.\n\n(00:45:37):\nAnother thing is also very [inaudible 00:45:40]. And I think it's like people do tell me that they notice different buckets of employees, different reactions to AI assist tools. First of all, I keep going back to coding because coding is big and it's easier to reason somehow. So it says I have different reports. One team would tell me that... One of people tell me, okay, amongst on his engineers, he thinks senior engineers would get the most output, would be more productive because it's like, okay, so that person's very interesting. So he actually divided his team to three buckets, but he didn't tell them, obviously. He was like, okay, here's more currently best performing, average performing and lowest performing. And then there's a randomized trial. So they give half of each group access to Cursor. And then [inaudible 00:46:31] noticed over time it was like, okay, something funny. The group that get the biggest performance boost, in his opinion, he was very close to his team.\n\n(00:46:39):\nThe biggest performance boost [inaudible 00:46:41] the senior engineer, the highest performing. So the highest performing engineer get the biggest boost out of it. And then the second group is the average performing. So his opinion is like, okay, the highest performing engineers is also normal practice. They also know how to solve problems. So they have some solved problem better. Whereas the people who have the lowest performing, they only don't care much about work. So it's easier to just go on autopilot, get it to generate that code and just do it or just don't know how to do it. Another company, however, they tell me just actually, senior engineers are the one most resistant to using AI as this tooling because they said it's like, okay, but AI, because they are more opinionated and they have very high standard. It was like, okay, but AI code, [inaudible 00:47:30] code just sucks. So just very, very resistant in using it. So I don't know, I haven't quite been able to reconcile very different reports on that yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:39):\nThis is so interesting. So just to make sure I'm hearing what the story, so there's a company you work with, that did a three bucket test with their engineering team where they created three sorts of groups, the highest performing engineers, mid-performing engineers, lowest performing engineers, and gave some of them, so they gave some of them access to say, Cursor. Was it Cursor or what did they give them access to? It was Cursor, right?\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:03):\nI think it was Cursor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:04):\nOkay, cool. And so within-\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:05):\nI didn't work with them. This is more like a friend company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:08):\nOkay. It's a friend's company.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:09):\nSo did they give half of the higher performing engineers Cursor and half not or how did they do the split there?\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:14):\nYeah, so they give half of the entire company but half of each bucket. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:18):\nWhoa.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:19):\nAnd then they observe the difference in productivity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):\nI see. So how do they even do that? They're just like, \"Okay, you get cursor, you don't get cursor.\" How did they do that? That's so interesting.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:31):\nYeah, I didn't get into the mechanics of it, but I was like, \"I respect you for doing a randomized trial on that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:33):\nThat is so cool.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:33):\nYeah. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:34):\nOkay. Wow. How large was this engineering team? Was it like hundreds of people?\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:38):\nIt's not that large. It's about maybe 30 to maybe 40. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:43):\n30 to 40. Okay.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:44):\nWow. Okay. So they found that the highest performing engineers had the most benefit from using AI tools and then behind them was the middle tier engineers and the worst performers or the lowest performers. Okay.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:59):\nBut it's also not the same everywhere.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:59):\nRight. Right. Right, right.\n\nChip Huyen (00:48:59):\nSome companies are different.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):\nRight. This other example you shared of just senior engineers in this one example are most resistant to changing the way they work, which I get. I do feel like the most valuable people right now other than ML researchers and AI researchers like yourself, are senior engineers because it feels like junior engineers are just, so much of this is now done by AI, but an engineer that knows what they're doing that understands how things work at a large scale with AI tools, just basically infinite junior engineers doing their bidding, feels like an extremely valuable and powerful asset.\n\nChip Huyen (00:49:39):\nYeah, I definitely really appreciate, as you see companies, we appreciate engineers who have a good understanding of the whole systems and be able to have good problem solving skill are thinking holistically instead of locally. Or when our company have seen the way they work, as they told me is we're completely different now. So they actually restructured engineering org so that they get more senior engineers should be more in the peer review because they get writing guidelines on what is a good engineering practices, what is the process would be like.\n\n(00:50:12):\nOr maybe like okay, so they write a lot of processes on how to work well. And then they have more junior engineers just produce code and submit PR, but senior engineer more in the reviewing case. So I think it might be prepared for the future. So another company actually told me something very similar. So preparing for the future once they only need a very small group of very, very strong engineers to create processes and reviewing code to get into production but get AI or junior engineers to produce code. But then the question becomes just like, how does one become a very strong senior engineer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:54):\nRight. That's right. That's right. That's the problem. Yeah.\n\nChip Huyen (00:50:57):\nYeah. So I don't know what's the process I was thinking about, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:01):\nNo one's thinking about it. It's a problem. We won't have any more in 10, 20 years. There'll be no more engineers because no one's hiring junior engineers. Although I could make the case. Junior engineers, people just getting into computer science right now, are just AI native. And in theory, you could argue they will become really good really fast if they're curious, aren't just delegating, learning and thinking to AI, but learning how to actually, using it to learn how to code well and architect correctly. You could argue they'll be the most successful engineers in the future.\n\nChip Huyen (00:51:33):\nI do think that what I mentioned said relating to architect. I think I grouped that in my system thinking. I do think it's very important skill because I think AI can help automate a lot of disjointed skills, but knowing how to utilize the skills together to solve problems is hard. So that's a webinar between Mehran Sahami who is one my favorite professors. He was a chair of the curriculum at the CS Department at Stanford. So he spent a lot of time thinking about CS educations, what should students learn nowadays in the area of AI coding. And then the other person is Andrew Ng, which is of course, is a legend in the AI space. And Mehran Sahami, Professor Sahami, said something very interesting. He said a lot of people think that CS is about coding, but it's not. Coding is just a means to an end.\n\n(00:52:27):\nCS is about system thinking, using coding to solve actual problem and problem solving will never go away because what AI can automate more stuff. The problem is just get bigger. But as a process of understanding what caused the issue and how to design step-by-step solution to it, will always be there. So I think an example of, I actually have a lot of issues with AI for in the way of it's debugging. So I'm not sure you use a lot of AI for coding, but something I have noticed and also seen from my friends, it's like it is pretty good when you have very clear, well-defined tasks. Maybe write documentations, fix specific features or build an app from scratch. Doesn't have to interact with a large access in code base, but you added something a little bit more complicated, maybe required interaction with other components and stuff. It's usually not that good.\n\n(00:53:21):\nAnd for example, I was using AI to deploy an applications and it was testing out a new hosting service I was not familiar with. It was like, okay. Usually they inform me, so working AI does give me is confidence to try a new tool. Before what AI is like trying new tools has written, not documentations for the beginning, but I was like, okay, just try it out and learn. So I was testing out this new hosting service and it kept getting a bug, so was very, very annoying. And it was like, okay, I asked [inaudible 00:53:51], fix it. And it kept changing the way, maybe change the environment variable, fix the code, maybe not change from the function to this function, maybe change the language, maybe it doesn't process JavaScript, I don't know, whatever. And it didn't work. And it was like, okay, that's it.\n\n(00:54:07):\nI'm just going to read documentation myself and see what's wrong. And it turns out, it's like I'm on another tier, the [inaudible 00:54:16] I want did not, is not available in this tier, right? So I feel like, okay, so the issue with [inaudible 00:54:22] was just trying to focus on fixing things from a different component versus the issue is from a different component. So I think of, okay, be understanding how different components work together and where the source of issue might come from. You need to give a holistic view of it. And it's made think is like, okay, how do we teach AI system thinking that I have all the human experts having very much [inaudible 00:54:46] scaffold just like, okay, for this kind of problem, look into this, look into that, look into that, and then stuff. So [inaudible 00:54:53] that could be one way, but that's also made me think is, how do we teach humans, system thinking? Yeah. So yeah, I think it's very interesting skill. I do think it's very important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:04):\nThat's exactly the same insight Bret Taylor shared on the podcast. He's the co-founder of Sierra. He created Google Maps. He was CEO of Salesforce, Quip, a few other things. And I asked him just like, should people learn to code? And his point is exactly what you said, which is taking computer science classes is not about learning Java and Python. It's learning how systems work and how code operates and how software works broadly, not just, here's a function to do a thing.\n\n(00:55:32):\nOne thing that I wanted to help people understand, you wrote this book called AI Engineering, which is essentially helping people understand this new genre of engineer and you have this really simple way of thinking about the difference between an ML engineer and an AI engineer, which has a really good corollary to product managers now, of just an AI product manager versus a non-AI product manager. The way you describe it and fill in what I'm missing is just ML engineers built models themselves. AI engineers use existing models to build products. Anything you want to add there?\n\nChip Huyen (00:56:05):\nOne thing I really dislike about writing books is that it has to define this and I think it's like no definitions would be perfect because they always be edge cases. But yeah, in general, I think it's just like GenAI as a service, more as a service, when somebody build the models for you and the base model performance is a pretty [inaudible 00:56:26]. So it's like it's enabled people to just like, okay, now I want to integrate AI into my product. I don't need to learn [inaudible 00:56:34] even though knowing that could really help. But yeah, it makes an entry barrier really low for people who want to use AI to build product and at the same time, AI capabilities are so strong. It's also increased the possibilities, the type applications that AI can be used for. So I think yes, both entry barriers' is super low and a demand for AI applications a lot bigger. So it feels, it's very, very exciting. It's opens up a whole new ball of possibilities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:04):\nYeah. It's like now you don't have the time, now you don't have to spend time building this AI brain. Now you can just use it to do stuff, such an unlock. Okay. Maybe just a final question. You get to see a lot of what's working, what's not working, where things are heading. I'm curious just if you had to think about in the next two or three years, just where things are heading, how do you think building products will be different? How do you think companies working will be different if you had to think of maybe the biggest change we expect to see in the next few years, in terms of how companies work?\n\nChip Huyen (00:57:40):\nI think in a lot of organizations they don't move that fast, but at the same time, they move faster than I expected because again, I think it's like bias and don't work with dinosaur companies who don't care. I think a lot of executives who come to me are very forward-looking. So maybe for me, I'm very biased towards organizations is move fast. So yeah, I think one big change I see just in organizational structure. I think this a lot of value plays in... So before we have a lot of disjointed teams. We have very clear engineering team, product team, but then there's a question of who should write eval? Who should own the metrics? And it turns out, eval, it's not a separate problem. It's a system problem because you need to look into different components, how they interact with each other. You need user behaviors because you need to know what users care about so that you can write eval reflect what users care about.\n\n(00:58:44):\nSo all of that you can sort it from you look into different component architectures, place guardrails and stuff. So it's just engineering, but understanding users is what product. So because of a lot of things and eval is extremely important. So the kind of bring product team and engineering team, even marketing team like user acquisition, very close to each other. So yes, since in a ways if people are structuring, so that's more communications between previously very distinct functions. Another thing is I also see as teams, of course, I think about what can be automated in the next few years and what work cannot be automated. And I seen that people already shedding, actually it's a little bit scary to think about it, but I also think it's the teams, they would've told me, it's just like okay, this is good and you and me, but we have got rid of these functions for a lot of things like previously outsourced, for example.\n\n(00:59:37):\nTraditionally, it's a business outsourcing that's not core to them and can be in a more systematized. So with that, you can actually use AI to automate a lot of that. And so as a separation people thinking more of what is the value of junior engineers or senior engineers, how should we restructure engineering org for that? Yeah, so I do definitely think that is one thing to successful organization. People are just moving pieces around and thinking about use cases, whether you need to spin out new use cases and who would lead a new effort. That is one big change. Another thing in terms of AI, I think there's, I'm not sure how true this is. I guess, I'm also on the camp of thinking that it has merit, is a camp of okay, base models we have probably not quite maxed out, but we're unlikely to see really, really strong, crazily strong model.\n\n(01:00:44):\nSo you remember when we have GPT, right? And then GPT2, which is a big step up, an [inaudible 01:00:49] better than GPT and then GPT3, which much, much bigger than GPT4, much, much bigger. And then of course, GPT5, but it's GPT5, that scale of much bigger step jump compared to the previous, I think it's debatable. So I think that we had disappointment, the base model performance improvement is not going to be mind-blowing. It was in the last three years. So I think there's a lot of improvements when I see in the post-training phase, in the application building phase. And yes, also I think that's where I feel I would see a lot of improvement there. I also very interest in multimodality. So we've seen a lot of text base, but I think there's a lot of audio, videos use cases that is very, very exciting.\n\n(01:01:45):\nAnd I think audios is not quite as solved. Well, I think because I do work with a couple of voice startups and when it comes to, think about voice, it's an entirely different beast. So let's say have chatbot. We go from a text chatbot to voice chatbot. It's like the consoles are completely different because now with voice chatbot, we need to think about latency because I think multiple steps, first have voice to text, text to text, text question into text answer and then text to voice answer. So you have multiple hops and latency become very important. And there's a question, what does it make you sound natural? So for example, people think of in AI and humans, when humans talk to each other, if I say, you try to interrupt me and say, Chip [inaudible 01:02:36]. I would pause and I try to hear you out.\n\n(01:02:38):\nBut sometime even if I just like say some word, like acknowledge when I, mm-hmm, mm-hmm, that I shouldn't stop. It's just continue. So the question of forced interruption and whether it's, should I stop or not, it's a big in what perceived as natural conversations. And that's also regulations because a lot of time, people want to build AI chatbot, voice chatbots that sound like humans, try to trick users into thinking that they're talking to humans, but also maybe potential regulation saying okay, you have to disclose to users when you talk, if the bot is talking to is human or AI. So I think this a whole space, I think it's not quite as solved as you think. But it's not quite like an AI foundation model problem because a human interruption detection, it's actually a classical machining problem.\n\n(01:03:32):\nIt's a different framing, but you can give classifier for that. Or the question of latency, actually a massive engineering challenge, not an AI challenge. Of course, it can be an AI challenge because people are trying to build voice-to-voice model. So instead of having to firstly transcribe the voice from me into text and then get a model [inaudible 01:03:54] text answer and get another model should turn from text to speech, you can just do voice-to-voice directly. So that is something we're working on, but it's very hard. Yeah. So yeah, so even audio, I think of it's the easier than video because video have both image and voice. It's already pretty hard. So I think there's a lot of challenges in that space.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:16):\nThat was an awesome list of things. Let me mirror them back real quick. So what you're predicting in the next few years, things that will change in the way we work, and these actually resonate with so many conversations I've had on this podcast. So says, just kind of doubling down on where things are heading. One is the blurring of lines between different functions instead of just design engineering. Everyone's going to be doing a lot of different things now. Two is, just more of work being automated with agents and all these AI tools and just in theory, productivity going up. Third is, a shifting from pre-training models to post-training, fine-tuning and things like that because to your point, models maybe are slowing down in how smart they're getting.\n\n(01:04:57):\nAlthough, I'll point folks to the, I had a chat with the co-founder of Anthropic. He made a really good point here. He's like, we're really bad at understanding what exponentials feel like when we're in the middle of that. And also, models are being released more often. So the difference between them we may not notice because they're just happening more often versus GPT3 came out a year before after GPT2. Maybe true, maybe not. And then the fourth point you made is this idea of multimodal, investing in multimodal experiences. I cannot wait for ChatGPT voice mode to get better at interruption, exactly what you're saying. I'm just talking to it and then someone makes a little sound and it's like [inaudible 01:05:33]. Okay. And then you have to, and then it's like, and then it stops talking. It's so annoying.\n\nChip Huyen (01:05:36):\nI'm shocked that we don't have better voice assistant at home yet. I think I have been testing out a bunch, honestly. I keep hoping, oh my God, that could be the one and then I know how many of them I just had to give away because they're not that good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:49):\nI think it's coming. I hear it's coming. Anthropic's working with someone that, I don't know if it's launched or not yet.\n\nChip Huyen (01:05:54):\nYeah, [inaudible 01:05:55] want to bring back to what you mentioned about your guest from Anthropic, mentioned about the performance improvement. I think there's a big change, I think this difference between a model-based capability. So I'm talking about the pre-trained model versus the perceived performance perform. So let's say, I'm not sure you thought about, are you familiar with the term test time compute?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:20):\nI don't think so. Help us understand.\n\nChip Huyen (01:06:26):\nSo this idea is like okay, you have a fixed amount of compute. So you're going to spend a lot of compute on pre-training or training the model. Pre-training and then I've spent a lot of some compute fine-tuning and the ratio of pre-training to the post-training compute is crazy, varies between different lab. And also, since then has a spend compute on generate inference. When I have a trends and fine-tuning model and now you want to serve it to users. So I might type a question in a prompt and if generate, do inference and that requires a compute. And I guess, I feel about discussion of should I spend more compute on pre-training or fine-training or inference because inference and people thought I was just like test time compute. So spending more compute on inference is like calling test time compute as a strategy of just allocating more resources, compute resource to generate inference when I shouldn't bring better performance and how does that do it?\n\n(01:07:22):\nLet's say you have a math questions and maybe instead of just generate one answer again generate four different answers and say okay, whichever is the best according to some standard or okay, I have four answers and then maybe three of them say 42 and one of them says 20. You say okay, three of them in agreement. So the answer should be 42. So just people shouldn't generate a bunch of it. Or another thing is a lot of time like reasoning, thinking, it just be able to generate more thinking tokens, like spend more time thinking before showing the final answers. It's like require more compute but also give more better performance. So yeah, so I think it's like from the ease of perspective when the model spend more time exploring different potential answers, thinking longer, it can give you much better final answers. But the base model itself does not change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):\nAwesome.\n\nChip Huyen (01:08:17):\nDoes it make sense?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):\nYes, that does. Absolutely.\n\nChip Huyen (01:08:18):\nYeah?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:19):\nThat is a good corollary to Ben Man's point.\n\nChip Huyen (01:08:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):\nChip, we covered a lot of ground. I've gone through everything I was hoping to learn and more. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nChip Huyen (01:08:34):\nSo I do work with a few companies that does these things of they want employees to come up with ideas. So there's a big debate on what is a better way for AI strategy, should they be top out or bottom up, should executives come up with one or two killer use case and everyone allocate resource to that, should you give engineers and PMs and smart people come up with ideas. And I think it's a mixture of both. So some companies it was like, okay, we hire a bunch of smart people, let's see what they come up with and they organize more hackathons or internal challenge to get people to build product. And one thing that I noticed, a lot of people just don't know what you built. And it shocked me why I feel like we are in some kind of an idea crisis, right?\n\n(01:09:21):\nNow, we have all this really cool tools to have. You do everything from scratch, can have you design, it can have you write code, it can build website. So in theory, we should see a lot more, but at the same time, people are somehow stuck. They don't know what to build. And I think it's like, maybe you see a lot of had to do with maybe society expectations because we have gone into this phase of specializations, people very highly specialized and people are supposed to focus on one thing really well instead of being a big picture. And we don't have a big picture view. It's hard to come up with ideas of what you build.\n\n(01:09:58):\nSo I know what, when I work with this company on this hackathon, we do work on come up with a guideline, how to come up with ideas. And usually what we think of is like, okay, one tip is go look from the last week. For a week, just pay attention to what you do and what frustrates you. And when something frustrates you, think about, is there anything we can do? Can it be done a different way? So it's not frustrating and you can talk, people can swap to accept [inaudible 01:10:27] or teams, and I even see they come on frustrations. Maybe there's something you can think about just to build something around that. So yeah, so I feel like just notice how we work, thinking of ways, constantly ask questions, how can this be better? And then I just build something to address the frustrations, I think it's a good way to learn and adopt AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):\nI think people have felt exactly what you're describing every time they open up one of these vibe coding tools where you could just describe anything you want. I'm like, \"I don't know, what do I want?\" And I love this very tactical piece of advice, just like what frustrates you, just pay attention to where you're frustrated. For example, I just built a very cool little vibe coded app. I was working on a newsletter post inside Google Docs and I pasted all these images into the Google Doc, from screenshots and stuff and then I forgot, oh yeah, you can't take images out of Google Docs. It's like this Hotel of California experience where you can paste stuff into it, very hard to get images back out. So I just went to all the vibe coded tools and just built an app that I can give you a Google Doc URL and it let me download all the images automatically. And it worked amazingly well and I made it really cute. And I'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nChip Huyen (01:11:33):\nOH, I would love to see that. I'm very bullish on using AI, just create micro tools. It's just something just make your life a bit easier.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:41):\nA hundred percent. I feel like that's one of the main ways people are using these tools, just a little niche problem they have. With that, Chip, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nChip Huyen (01:11:54):\nYeah, always. No, no, no. It depends on how hard the questions are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:58):\nThey're very consistent across every guest. So I imagine you've heard them before. First question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nChip Huyen (01:12:10):\nI'm really terrified of book recommendations because I feel like what books [inaudible 01:12:15] you should read really depends on what they want and where they're in life and where they want to get to. But just several books that I do think's have really changed the way I think and see the world. So one thing is The Selfish Gene, that's to understand, it actually helped me with the question whether I want to have kids or not because it's understanding more of a lot of our functions, the way we operate is the functions of our genes and genes want to do one thing, to procreate.\n\n(01:12:46):\nSo yes, in a way, the book also proposed another thing is so everyone wants to live forever and maybe it's not consciously, but subconsciously, we do want that. And there are two ways. One is via genes. Genes [inaudible 01:13:00] want to continue forever, but [inaudible 01:13:03] two ideas. I think there's something [inaudible 01:13:05]. It's just like being able, if you have some ideas out there and then it's last for a long time, it's going to live on. I know it's a little bit abstract, but I thought it's very interesting.\n\n(01:13:16):\nThe other books I really, really like is from the book from Singaporean previous, I think he is [inaudible 01:13:24] as a Father of Singapore, I don't know, Lee Kuan Yew. I'm not sure what's the title is, but he was the one who led Singapore from, he's changed Singapore from a Third World country to a first world country within 25 years. And I have never seen any country leaders spent so much effort into putting down his thought of how to build a country like that.\n\n(01:13:47):\nAnd as I talk a lot about public policy, how to create policies that encourage people to do the right things that is good for the nations and also talking about foreign affairs, foreign policies, the liberation of the country, but other. So it's a really good book to think about. For me, it's a system thinking, but it's a different kind of system which a country, which a lot of us don't get a chance to ever experiment in our life. So it's good to learn about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:13):\nWhat was the name of that second book?\n\nChip Huyen (01:14:15):\nIt's called From Third to First World. Actually, I think I have it somewhere here. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:20):\nThere it is.\n\nChip Huyen (01:14:21):\nIt's a very heavy book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:21):\nShow and tell.\n\nChip Huyen (01:14:23):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:23):\nThat's awesome. I definitely want to read that. That's a really good [inaudible 01:14:26]. I've heard a lot about just the impact he's had and I've seen all these videos on Twitter of just his really wise insights into how to build a thriving society. And clearly, it works.\n\nChip Huyen (01:14:34):\nYeah. Can you believe, how does he time to write such a thick book? It's insane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:39):\nThat is. Claude, please summarize. I'm just joking. By the way, Selfish Gene, I also absolutely love that book. That is such a good choice. It's such an under the radar kind of book that really changed the way I see the world as well. So really good pick. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nChip Huyen (01:14:56):\nSo I watched a lot of movie and TV shows as a research because I working on my first novel and I recently sold it. So I'm interested what makes, it's a drama. It's not a science fiction or anything that tech people usually read. So it very, I know it's a very out of left field and very, so it's almost like reading, watching TV to see what kind of stories become popular, trying to understand the trope and stuff like that. So I'm not sure if the audience will like...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:28):\nWell, what's one? What's one that taught you something about writing?\n\nChip Huyen (01:15:35):\nI think like Yanxi Palace. It's a Chinese TV show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:37):\nCool. Okay. I haven't heard that one on the podcast before. Okay, cool.\n\nChip Huyen (01:15:37):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:43):\nNext question. Do you have a life motto that you often think about, come back to when you're dealing with something hard, whether it's in work or in life?\n\nChip Huyen (01:15:51):\nThis sounds very nihilist. I think to say, in the end, nothing really matters. Usually, I think of in the grand scheme of things, in a billion years, nothing will, no one would ever be there. I think okay, someone will argue with me about that. [inaudible 01:16:05]. So my theory's like, in a billion years, none of us would ever exist. So whatever messy things, like crazy things we do or how bad we do it, I mean, no one would be remember, wouldn't be there to remember it. And I think in a way, it sounds scary, but it's very liberating because it just allows me say, okay, let's just try things out, right? Why does it matter? And there's a story of recently, so I have some family member who passed away recently. And I was talking to my dad because I couldn't be home for that.\n\n(01:16:36):\nI was asking my dad like, \"Okay, os there anything I can do to make the person...\" Something like comfort. So anything that you can get the persons. And my dad was just like, \"What can he possibly want at this moment?\" It just made me feel at the end of life, there's nothing that can bring you, like material can bring you joy. There's no money, no product, nothing. And in way, it makes me feel like, okay, what really do I really care about at the end of the day? So I guess it's like I think about it. It's just like, okay, maybe I fail it, maybe I don't get that contract. Maybe those things, but in the end of life, I don't think that actually really matters. So in a way, it's quite liberating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:15):\nI know you said it might be nihilistic. This is what Steve Jobs shared too in one of his most famous speeches. Just we all die someday day, so don't take things so seriously and it is freeing. Absolutely. It just makes you appreciate every moment, every day you have. Just like, yeah, let's just do something hard and scary. Okay, final question. You talked about how you're writing a novel. Most people in tech have never written something creative and fiction. What's just one thing you learned in the process about how to write better stories, better fiction?\n\nChip Huyen (01:17:46):\nA lot of time when we read, we get tripped up by some small things. So I think I want to do creative writing because I just want to go a better writer and it tells us maybe try a different audience could have me become better at anticipating what this different type of audience would want to hear and what they care about. So it's a way for me to get a... So I think if I write it or even any kind of content creations is about predicting the user's reactions, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:14):\nThe next token.\n\nChip Huyen (01:18:15):\nYou do a podcast.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:15):\nJust kidding.\n\nChip Huyen (01:18:17):\nYeah. Yeah, so you do a podcast, it's like, okay, what kind things that the users could find engaging, right? And I find this a little bit and a lot of companies you have launch a product, you have a narrative coming out and say, okay, how do we position this product in a way that users would want? So I feel like I have done technical writing for a while and I felt like I had some experience trying to predict what engineers would want to hear or care about. But then I don't have any experience like this, completely different type of audience. So that's what I want to, creative writing, writing a story. And that's why I was doing a lot of research [inaudible 01:18:55]. I mean, doing research [inaudible 01:18:56] enjoyed a lot, watching a lot of dramas. I just see what people like. So one thing that I care about is, I think I learned what emotional journey was from a editor.\n\n(01:19:05):\nSo when we write something we care about how users would feel across a story. We want something in the beginning, we want something, we need to have a hook so that people continue reading. But we also don't want too much of drama because we'll get too tired because you're emotionally exhausted because it's like you're being emotionally manipulated a lot of time. So it gave a emotional journey, maybe have some climax or something more chill, maybe like... And also care about another thing I didn't realize is, for me, for technical writing, you entirely focus on the content, the argument. It's very impersonal. For example, people like ML compilers, doesn't matter if they like the person telling them about compiler or not because it's just objective [inaudible 01:19:56]. But for a novel, people care about character likeability.\n\n(01:20:00):\nSo in the first version of my story, it makes the characters a little bit more, very logical, very rational, and just does everything just very rationally. And then the feedback I got is, I have a very good friend read it and he was like, he's an amazing person, he's a great person. And he was like, \"Chip, I'll be honest, I hate that person.\" So it doesn't matter as a story, it's just like the person is so unlikeable, that's why he doesn't want to continue. So is a second version. It makes that person, the character more likable. How she makes that character more likable is that you put in some vulnerability sometimes it's like okay maybe it's person have setback because sometimes we can relate to it. So in a lot of ways, it's very interesting. A lot of it is about understand the emotional bit, like how the users feel, not just about the story but also about the characters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:50):\nThat is so interesting. Wow. I learned a lot more there than I thought. That was awesome. Really good example. Chip, two final questions. Where can folks find you online, if they want to reach out and maybe work with you or maybe even just share the stuff that you offer if folks want to reach out. And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChip Huyen (01:21:08):\nI'm on social media, LinkedIn, Twitter. I don't post a lot, but I keep telling myself that I should do more because I kind of like the conversation with readers. So I'm actually about to I start a Substack. So I have a placeholder for Substack right now and I'm thinking of doing it for more system thinking because I think it's a very interesting skill. I'm also thinking of doing a YouTube channel on book reviews and basically books than help you think better. So I think it's the first book I'm a review is probably like this book because it's my favorite book growing up and I've been keep on reading it. So yeah, so how can you be helpful? Send me books that you like, books that help you have changed the way you think or change you the way you do anything. So I would appreciate it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:00):\nAmazing. I'm excited to read that book.\n\nChip Huyen (01:22:02):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:03):\nChip, thank you so much for being here.\n\nChip Huyen (01:22:05):\nThank you so much, Lenny, for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:07):\nBye everyone.
