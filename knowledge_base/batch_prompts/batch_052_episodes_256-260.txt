I think, in some ways, our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. There's an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere. That would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has a mathematical formula that's going to win on any metric. Whatever metric you care about. You want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.\n\nSpeaker 1 (00:00:52):\nToday, my guest is Tom Conrad. Tom was an engineer at Apple, CTO of Pandora, which he helped take from zero to 80 million users. He's also VP of product at Snap, where he was the right-hand man to Evan Spiegel for two years. He's been on the Board of Sonos for over seven years. He was also part of two infamous product failures, Quibi, where he was chief product officer, which raised over $2 billion and died less than a year after launch.\n\n(00:01:17):\nHe was also a senior engineering leader at Pets.com, which famously went from nothing to a public company, to completely out of business in 19 months. Today, Tom is the CEO of Zero Longevity Science, which is on a mission to extend the lifespan and the health span of the human race. In our conversation, we dig into what Tom's learned from these famous product failures, also, what he's learned from the many product successes. Tom also shares what he's learned about how to pick where to go work and what to avoid. How important understanding the math formula of the business model is. Also, lessons on burnout and health and leadership and contrarian corner. With that, I bring you Tom Conrad, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\nLenny (00:02:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates.\n\n(00:02:25):\nWithin that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team. Including managing the roadmap, their OKI process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda. If your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down.\n\n(00:02:52):\nCoda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place.

It's so fun that I get to be a part of this.\n\nLenny (00:04:46):\nI thought it'd be fun to start with a story about your time at Apple and you building this now very ubiquitous feature of dragging and dropping something into a folder. Which I saw you tweet about or talk about at a talk and the fact that it's still around. Can you just share that story and maybe a lesson from that experience that you've taken away?\n\nTom Conrad (00:05:05):\nSure. Let's see. I was 15 years old when the Macintosh came out. I remember really clearly my entire teenage years. All I wanted to do was to move from Columbus, Ohio to Cupertino and work for Apple. My heroes were that team of people that had written their signatures on the inside of the Macintosh. We cracked open the first Macintosh case. You would find the signatures of the 20 people or so who worked on the Mac. That was my only ambition, truly.\n\n(00:05:40):\nThis was a period where no one wanted to work for Apple. That wasn't a thing. It seems like maybe a little obvious today, but it wasn't an obvious ambition at all back then. Anyway, I went to college. It's all I wanted to do. Studied computer engineering at University of Michigan, and as we talk about my career, it is just over and over and over. I'm going to say an incredibly lucky thing happened. The first incredibly lucky thing that happened for me in my career probably was that University of Michigan happened to be a place that Apple recruited from.\n\n(00:06:08):\nI didn't know that when I chose the school, but it made it reasonably easy to connect to a hiring manager at Apple. I wrote an actual letter and put it in an actual envelope and put it in the mail and got an internship and drove out in my dad's Pontiac from the Midwest to California. Spent a summer interning and my last day of the internship, I was thinking about really what I wanted to do when I came back. Hopefully came back to Apple after I graduated.\n\n(00:06:39):\nI had worked on a product that became shipped. It was called the QuickDraw GX. It was earlier second generation rendering system for the Mac. I'd been that team's intern for the summer. But what I really wanted to do is I wanted to work on the Finder. This is the only thing in the whole world I really wanted to do. I went and found Ron Lichty, who is the manager of the Finder team and said, \"I graduate in 10 months. I'd love to be a part of your team.\"\n\n(00:07:06):\nI think he was like, why are you coming and talking to me now? You're literally going back to Michigan tomorrow. I go back to Michigan in May, the phone rings and Ron says, \"The college recruiting department just told me that I have a college hiring rep and if I don't use it by tomorrow, I lose it.\" He's like, \"I can't even interview you, you can't meet the team, but you're basically a freebie for me. Do you want this job?\"\n\n(00:07:38):\nJust insanely lucky moment, got this job. I get to Apple in the summer of 1992 and I have a laundry list of things that I would like to do to make the Finder more usable. I remember sitting in Ron's office and saying, \"At the grocery store, when you're carrying bags of groceries out, the door's automatically open for you? I think the Finder should do the same thing. When you're dragging an icon around and you want to put it in a folder, you should be able to hover maybe over the folder icons and drill down into the file system to get to where you're going.\n\n(00:08:20):\nThen when you drop the file, all of the folders that opened up between you and your source and your destination would close for you.\" Ron thought that was a fine idea, so that was the way Apple worked in those days. I just went off and started coding that up. I got to the point late one night, two in the morning at Apple, no one else was there, where I needed some kind of animation to indicate that the folder was about to open.\n\n(00:08:48):\nI'm certainly not an animator and I certainly wasn't going to do anything thoughtful in the middle of the night. I just wrote some code that blinked the folder, like selected unselected, selected unselected five times and thought, oh, I'll email one of the really talented visual designers to do something much more interesting. Long story short, apple finally shipped that feature four years later. Sat in the source code repository forever while we did other things.\n\n(00:09:21):\nWhen it shipped four years later, it blinked five times. Roll the clock forward six or seven years, Mac plus 10 comes out, entirely new Finder rewritten from scratch. No spring-loaded folders anywhere to be seen. People complained about it. It got re-implemented. All of the code, brand new. Folder blinks five times when you hover over it. Roll the clock forward another decade, IOS comes along and they added folders. When you drag an icon around, it blinks a few times.\n\n(00:09:51):\nI'm not sure what the point of this story is other than maybe it's something about, I think we all do this as designers and product people. We take these shortcuts that we think that we'll go back later and clean up. Sometimes, it's literally been 30 years that little design detail lingers three implementations later and now it's just a part of the way that these Apple products work. Pretty bizarre.\n\nLenny (00:10:16):\nAs you were talking, I'm on a Mac right now recording this and I just did it just to make sure it's still there and it is indeed still there. I think it blinks three times and then just opens up for you.\n\nTom Conrad (00:10:25):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny (00:10:26):\nFull engineers got royalties on features they build that continue to live on in our product.\n\nTom Conrad (00:10:30):\nOkay, I'll tell you just one other little thing to center you in time about what the Finder was like in 1992. We didn't get royalties, but our names were in the About box. You would go to About the Finder and the seven of us, there were seven engineers at Apple that worked on The Finder. Our names would scroll by the Finder, copyright 1992, yada, yada, yada, one name after another. Totally different era.\n\nLenny (00:10:55):\nIt feels like you got what you wanted with the name scribbled on the motherboard.\n\nTom Conrad (00:10:59):\nFor sure. I've gotten a lot of the things I wanted as a kid.\n\nLenny (00:11:05):\nAlong the same lines, I want to talk a bit about picking where to go work. Clearly you had a sense you wanted to go work at Apple. Over your career, you've landed at a lot of really successful places. You've also landed at a lot of very famous failures that we're going to talk about. What advice would you give people for helping them pick where to go work based on your experience?\n\nTom Conrad (00:11:25):\nWhen I was a kid, my ambition to work at Apple was entirely about the product, so probably that version of me would say, find a product that you're passionate about and go spend your time and energy on that thing. Pretty quickly you learn that an awful lot of your development and day-to-day satisfaction really comes from the people that you get to collaborate with. Can you learn from them? Do you like them? Do they challenge you in the right ways?\n\n(00:11:53):\nDo they give you latitude in the right ways? It's so much about not just what, but who. For a very long time, my advice would've been entirely in the category of life, find something that you love with people that you think are amazing and the rest will take care of itself. Interestingly, I have been lucky enough to have some things that were successful on the metrics, get talked about the most, big audiences, big financial return, et cetera, et cetera. I've also worked on some things that were really notable disasters. When I look back on my career and think about the things that I've done, my professional satisfaction is not well correlated with those external metrics and very, very coordinated with do I love the thing we were building and do I love the people I was working with?\n\nLenny (00:12:43):\nFollowing the thread of the people. I think one of the hardest things is really knowing what the people are like until you join. I think as a chief product officer joining or VP of product, you have a lot of time that you spend with the team. Most people don't. They have an interview and then they're like, all right, I got to make a decision. Do you have any advice for how to help people get a sense if the people are the kind of people they want to work with?\n\nTom Conrad (00:13:03):\nI think people are really, really good at this. Every single time I've taken a job where it turned out that I was working with people who had a different set of values or working styles than I had, I knew. You tell yourself that, at least in my case, I tell myself a story about why the thing I suspect might be the case isn't the case. But you do this in your personal life all the time. You meet people out at dinner, so you get seated next to them at some industry event or something, and sometimes you come home and say to your partner, oh my gosh, the person next to me was just the worst. Then sometimes you're like, I think I made a permanent lifelong connection with this total stranger who just happened to sit next to me.\n\nLenny (00:13:55):\nIt's a very simple piece of advice that I think people don't fully appreciate is just trust your instinct, trust your gut. Just pay attention to what comes up when you're around people at a certain company. Okay, you brought up this phrase of notable disasters, and I want to talk about that. You've worked at two of the most famous notable disasters of product companies, pets.com and Quibi. I think it's really rare someone sees the inside of so much hype and then such a fall at a company. I just want to spend some time in these two areas. Maybe the way to set it up is, what's a lesson you took away from each of these two experiences that you've taken with you to future work and maybe advice you share with people?\n\nTom Conrad (00:14:37):\nProbably the biggest lesson, it's not really about the specifics of the business. The biggest lesson really is these things make you better. In some instances, actually, I think in both instances they became dominoes that opened doors for me in my own ambition and my own professional life that maybe just wouldn't have opened at all if I hadn't gone to those companies and learned those things and had those experiences. Frankly, even in the case of pets.com, even the high profile nature of it.\n\n(00:15:09):\nI could have worked at one of a thousand E-commerce websites in 1999. When I went on to some subsequent job interview or something and talked about my experience, they were like, I never heard of the thing that you worked on. But everybody certainly heard about pets.com. It's a pretty funny example too, of how some struggles are timeless. That was 23, 24 years ago now. While as a leadership team, we made I'm sure all kinds of mistakes.\n\n(00:15:39):\nOne of the things that happened was that there were three overfunded pet E-commerce sites. We all raised in excess of $50 million, which is a tremendous amount of money now. It was a tremendous amount of money then. We all thought it was a zero-sum game. That as one player started to spend on promotion or to spend irrationally on national broadcast television advertising, we all did. It became this unwinnable arms race. There is, I think, a fundamental lesson about having an excess of investment can be its own albatross. Or lead you to make decisions that maybe would be unwise. Then of course, it's just like timing is really important. Chewy is a online pet store worth $9 billion today. They were a private company and bought by PetSmart and then spun back out. But when they were bought by PetSmart, they were acquired for three billion dollars. Biggest E-commerce acquisition of all time. Well, I think it's probably unfair to compare Chewy who executed exceptionally well over a decade, grew their business brick by brick and turned it into something really remarkable.\n\n(00:17:07):\nTo pets.com, which was in a very, very different moment in time and tried to go to market in a really different way. The critique that is often leveled at pets.com, or at least at the time, was like, this is just a stupid business. They're shipping dog food around. You could never make that work. That's just wrong. You absolutely can make it work. Probably can't make it work when 80% of the country on the internet is still on dial up. It was really, really early.\n\nLenny (00:17:33):\nI saw a stat, I think you shared somewhere, that you took pets.com from nothing to a public company to completely out of business in 19 months.\n\nTom Conrad (00:17:40):\nYeah, I think that's about right. The other thing that's forgotten in the tale is that we actually didn't go bankrupt. We shut the company down and returned the remaining balance to the investors, which no public company had ever done before. The leadership team just reached the conclusion that given the way market conditions had evolved, there was just no way we were going to be able to get more capital into the company. It was a company that required additional investment to get to profitability. It was better to wind down early, take the money that we had in the bank and get it back to investors than to just spend every last penny on what was a fruitless attempt to salvage it.\n\nLenny (00:18:29):\nDid not know that. Let's talk about Quibi. What went wrong there? Do you think there was a path to Quibi having worked out? Any big lessons that you took away from that experience that you bring with you?\n\nTom Conrad (00:18:40):\nThe miraculous thing about Quibi for me was it re-lit my enthusiasm for the industry for doing this work. I had left in, I think it was December of 2018, and I thought that maybe I was just done making software. I had done it for a really long time, for 25 years or something. I had changed a lot. The industry had changed a lot. I thought maybe I just didn't have the same passion for it that I had a decade before. It also seemed like maybe it'd be fun to have another chapter of my life that was just completely different.\n\n(00:19:23):\nI had a whole list of things that I thought I might want to do. They're ridiculous. It's like maybe I want to be a pastry chef. Maybe I want to be a landscape photographer. Maybe I want to learn to make bad music to put up on SoundCloud or something. Really the only thing they had in common were they all things that I knew nothing about. People would be like, \"Oh, you think you might want to be a pastry chef? Do you like to bake?\"\n\n(00:19:42):\nI'd be like, \"No, I don't know anything about baking.\" \"Oh, you like landscape photography. Do you take photos?\" \"No, I don't take photos.\" But I was committed to the bit, actually to the point where when Techwrench interviewed me about my departure from Snapchat, I was like, I'm out. I'm going to do something else entirely. That story is very much out there. But a few months after my last day at Snap, I got a call from Meg Whitman and Jeffrey Katzenberg who were starting up, it was for New TV at the time.\n\n(00:20:15):\nThe pitch was, we're going to try to take the best of mobile and Silicon Valley and consumer tech and weld it to the best of Hollywood style content production. To build something completely bespoke and purpose made for consumption on the phone. They were looking for both technology leadership and product leadership and wanted to know if I was interested in one or both. I took the meeting, even though I wasn't really taking these kinds of calls from anybody, it just seemed like who's going to pass up the opportunity to have lunch with the two of them?\n\n(00:20:50):\nI listened to the pitch and politely declined and told them that I was going to be a pastry chef or something. We kept doing that every couple of months for seven months. We'd go to lunch, they would give me an update on the progress they were making, and I would decline the invitation to get involved somehow. Then late in that year, I went to lunch one more time, and Meg explained that they brought on someone to lead technology and they brought another person to lead product.\n\n(00:21:26):\nBoth of them really truly for reasons that are completely disconnected from Quibi itself. Both of them had left after about six weeks. Meg's like, \"We've raised all this money and we told the world that we're shipping this product in about a year. We got an awful lot to do, and I really could use some help. I would consider it a personal favor if you were to come and spend just a couple of days a week helping.\" She's like, \"I'll continue to look for someone who actually wants the job, but it'd be great if you could help me get this off the ground.\" My wife is a freelance writer, marketing strategist, and loves her life as a freelance contributor. She's like, \"You should do this. Why not? It's two days a week. It's just a few months. What's the worst thing that could happen? Maybe you'll like it?\" I'm like, \"No. Here's the thing that will happen. I won't do it two days a week. It will immediately be three days, then four days, then five days, then six days. I just know myself.\"\n\n(00:22:27):\nShe's like, \"No.\" She's like, \"Just on Wednesday night at six o'clock, close your Quibi laptop and be like, all they're paying me for is for Tuesday and Wednesday and then open it back up on Tuesday morning. That's all you've got to do.\" Well, she's right about most things and she's wrong about this. I fell deeply into it right away. It was just so fun to get to build a team from scratch and to design and build a product from scratch.\n\n(00:22:58):\nTo take advantage of all of the modern software architecture stuff that had come into being over the course of the 15 years since we had started Pandora. I'm embarrassed about some of what happened with Quibi for sure, but I'm super grateful for the experience. I just really fell in love with the industry again, and was reminded of just how rewarding it can be to build something and to try to put it out there even if you stumble pretty mightily along the way.\n\nLenny (00:23:35):\nIs there something that you took away from that experience that taught you what to try to avoid? What to try to pull towards?\n\nTom Conrad (00:23:43):\nI think I misunderstood or misjudged companies sometimes by thinking about them really focused on the product execution. If you find an interesting problem that people care about and you solve that problem in a really beautiful, elegant, delightful way, that's 10 times better than anything else that they can get in that same space, they'll tell their friends and all the rest will take care of itself. That was always my ambition.\n\n(00:24:16):\nFind a thing that I cared about building, do a great job building it really delightful way. Go really deep on listening to people and their feedback and iterate your way to success and breaking through that membrane that we all strive to get across. The really great word of mouth. But I think the thing I've come to better appreciate is that companies are also like a math problem that describes how you take investment and pour them into the equation and out the other side comes returns on some time horizon.\n\n(00:24:54):\nYes, there are variables in that equation that are influenced by the product that you build and all of the little details and decisions that you make about making that product great. But if the equation is fundamentally broken or a big swing in and of itself, no amount of iteration and execution can get you out of the failed outputs of the broken equation. I think Quibi made a bet that you could build an entirely bespoke content library that was sufficiently scaled to get people to subscribe and retain for a couple billion dollars. It was a huge amount of money. But we made 70 shows in 18 months, which is more content than all of the major broadcast networks combined made in a single year. It was a pretty major accomplishment. We made a bet that we would augment those sort of-\n\nTom Conrad (00:26:00):\nAnd we made a bet that we would augment those sort of episodic and serialized or Hollywood style shows with a bunch of daily content that we produce at the level of network television, nightly news, and so forth, that would be an alternative to some of the sort of daily content that you might otherwise get on YouTube. And that was going to be about a third of the content spend.\n\n(00:26:26):\nOne super interesting thing that no one talks about is that all of that content was designed to be made day of or day before it aired, so there was no back catalog of it. And it was all designed to be shot in these professional studios that we built out. It was really expensive, like I said, it was like a third of the investment we were going to making content, almost half the investment we were going to be making content.\n\n(00:26:51):\nAnd we launched two weeks into Covid and we couldn't make any of that content, except literally in the garages of the host's homes. And so we had this thing that was supposed to seem really set apart from YouTube, that literally now was being made exactly YouTube content, which is sort of like self-produced at home with very little sort of the support infrastructure of Hollywood. Now, you can argue, I think the content on YouTube is really, really exceptional in this category, and maybe we were never going to do better than that.\n\n(00:27:26):\nBut I think what was really fundamentally broken with Quibi was that the actual foundational equation of can you make enough premium content that's totally bespoke and made for the service and takes advantage of the nature of the phone, it is enough content to get people to sign up and retain, and can you do that for a couple billion dollars? And I think the answer is no. The library has to be much, much bigger, and you have to have, like any company, you have to have sufficient time and energy to iterate on the content format itself, because our roadmap really wanted to innovate on the content format.\n\n(00:28:06):\nAnd so I think part of what happened is pretty quickly it became clear that the math was just wrong. It wasn't going to take 2 billion, it was going to take 6 or 8 or 10 billion. And the risk reward profile of betting 10 billion on the format was just more than anyone could stomach.\n\nLenny (00:28:27):\nWow. I really like this metaphor and this mental model of the math formula of the entire business and thinking of it that way. I knew Covid changed the way people consumed content and that hurt. Quibi I think it was meant to be on the go, not sitting at home where you could watch anything you want. But also the fact that the content couldn't be made as well, as you were hoping to make.\n\nTom Conrad (00:28:46):\nYeah, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:28:49):\nAs a CPO, one of the biggest challenges is pushing back, trying to convince the founders of their mistakes, of doing what they want and just powering through it and dealing with it sometimes I guess is there anything you think you could have done looking back, or was the math formula set up for failure from the beginning and it's probably just not going to work out almost no matter what you did?\n\nTom Conrad (00:29:10):\nOne of the bets was that we weren't going to just use the apparatus of Hollywood to make the content. In part, we are going to use the apparatus of Hollywood to market the content. So Jeffrey had recruited this incredible Rolodex of literally the world's most famous celebrities to make shows for Quibi. We kind of had everyone either made something for launch or was going to make something.\n\n(00:29:42):\nAnd part of what they're going to do is turn up in culture and talk about their shows. We've heard a lot in the last six months about how hard it's to market movies because the stars can't go out and talk about the movies during the strike.\n\n(00:29:54):\nThere was this theory that you could apply the marketing technique of Hollywood to get 20, 30 million people into the theater on opening weekend for Quibi. And that was always a very, very audacious take, I thought. Uber has all the money in the world to experiment with paid user acquisition, and they're not consistently a top 10 most downloaded app in the app store.\n\n(00:30:26):\nBut the theory of Quibi, the math of Quibi, did require us to from day one land in the top 10 and stay there forever. The model would have worked if we could do that. And to the Hollywood marketing apparatus, the numbers that it takes to get there felt kind of small. If you can get 20 million people in to see Shrek on opening night new IP, surely you can get them to take their phone out of their pocket and download this thing and start a free trial.\n\n(00:30:54):\nNow, those of us who have spent our life in Silicon Valley making software and really, really tried to get people to show up and download new IP in large numbers know just how hard that is.\n\n(00:31:09):\nSo maybe if I critique my own contribution to the math equation, maybe I should have beat the drum a little harder about just how unlikely it was that we were going to land the kind of distribution in month one that the model sort of required. If I had to go back and do it again, I think I would spend maybe more time investing and illuminating that aspect of the digital universe.\n\nLenny (00:31:42):\nThat is such a good takeaway of just showing the leaders, here's the data, here's the assumptions that we're all betting on, and do you believe this can happen? And they probably would've said, \"Yes, this will happen. I'm so confident.\"\n\nTom Conrad (00:31:55):\nWhat made it hard was, it wasn't structurally impossible. If you had to be bigger than any app that had ever been made, then you could probably make the case it's impossible. But since you only sort of had the land in the top 10, you couldn't quite say it was impossible, you could just say it was highly improbable.\n\n(00:32:18):\nAnd maybe one of my mistakes was, I guess I imagined that we would launch, and when the likely thing happened that we got millions of people to download the app, which we did, and then when we inevitably struggled to retain those users at high percentages, and we retained at what I think of as a good industry starting point, but we weren't setting any records on retention. I just imagined that what would happen next is the thing that happens in all young companies, you would iterate. You would grind on the funnel until a year later, two years later, six months later, whatever it is. You figured the formula out to get people in and get them to stay and get them to retain.\n\n(00:33:12):\nAnd what I didn't appreciate was just how quickly you go back to the foundational math and then the math really says you just can't. You can't spend two years iterating your way on optimizing the funnels like you would in a startup that had a different cost structure. In a world where you have to spend a billion dollars a year of making content, you just can't afford to not be a hit.\n\nLenny (00:33:40):\nI think it's also important to just remind us, it's okay for these things to happen. People take a bet, as you said, we're going to try this thing, here's our bet, here's our experiment. We're betting on this sort of format in this business. We're going to raise money from investors that know they might lose all their money. And it sometimes doesn't work out. It's part of the game.\n\nTom Conrad (00:33:56):\nIt's certainly painful to take money from investors even if they know what they're doing and to not get them a return. I feel a real responsibility to investors to do better than we did at Quibi.\n\n(00:34:08):\nBut yeah, I mean, there is a risk reward thing that goes along with these investments, and part of the reason they get all the riches on the upside is that they're going to bet on some Quibis along the way too.\n\nLenny (00:34:18):\nSo as you were talking, you said that it was called NewTV, and that sparked a memory, and I searched my email. And I actually got an email from a recruiter in 2018, we just kicked off a very special executive opportunity, the CPO at NewTV, a new venture in Los Angeles, with Jeffrey Katzenberg and Meg Whitman, raising a billion dollars, working with top talent. Are you interested in exploring this opportunity?\n\nTom Conrad (00:34:41):\nLenny, Lenny, Lenny. Your story could have been so much different.\n\nLenny (00:34:46):\nThis could have been Thomas podcast. Lenny, tell me about what happened at Quibi.\n\nTom Conrad (00:34:51):\nI would take that free.\n\nLenny (00:34:54):\nI don't know. There's pros and cons. They even sent this whole PDF, a TV in your pocket, NewTV. Amazing. All right. I'm going to read through this and see what they pitched back in the day.\n\n(00:35:05):\nOkay, let's move on to things that worked out really well, let's call it notable successes, other products you worked on that worked out great. So I'll list a few of them. And maybe what might be helpful is just we'll just go through each one and share what you took away from that experience, a lesson you learned from working on those products.\n\n(00:35:23):\nThe ones that come to mind for me are Snap, Pandora, Apple if we want to go there. Also, you built, I don't know exactly what you did there, but you worked on You Don't Know Jack, this game that I loved. I think if you're an elder millennial, you're just going to like, \"Oh my God, I love that game.\" I don't even remember it exactly, but I just remember the visceral feeling of playing that game and it was so much fun. So that's cool. I didn't know that you worked on that. And then there's also Sonos, which you're on the board.\n\n(00:35:49):\nSo whatever order you think might be most interesting, just going through those and what did you learn from that experience?\n\nTom Conrad (00:35:56):\nI worked at Apple in the interval where Steve was gone, John Skelly, that kind of period, so System 7, System 8, Power Macintosh, that whole era. And we were doing a lot. We shipped a bunch of great hardware. We transitioned the company from Motorola 68,000 CPUs to the Power PC architecture.\n\n(00:36:19):\nBut, particularly in that transition, we really struggled to ship consumer software features. I mentioned that I wrote three LAN folders and some other consumer features in my first six months at Apple, and they shipped four years later, actually after I'd left the company. I was a little surprised they were still in the software repository even, candidly.\n\n(00:36:40):\nBut I'll tell you that one of the things culturally about Apple in that moment was, at least I felt like, a person was really rewarded if they could make a kind of broad contribution across functions. So if you were a talented software engineer, but also a thoughtful product designer, and maybe also had interesting input on product marketing, that you could build a really great reputation inside the company by playing all of those positions a little bit day to day.\n\n(00:37:19):\nAnd so when I left Apple after four years, I look back on my time, I didn't ship as much software as I had hoped, and I felt like a little bit like a professional gadfly. I was six miles wide and a centimeter deep.\n\n(00:37:36):\nAnd I went to work for this company called Berkeley Systems. In addition to You Don't Know Jack, they made a flying toaster screensaver, if you remember. You remember the nineties?\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\nHow could you forget that?\n\nTom Conrad (00:37:50):\nAnd when I met them, they were picking off this game development for this trivia game, and were looking for someone to lead the technical team. And so I joined as technical director for the You Don't Know Jack franchise, managed a team of engineers, and it was a completely different culture than what I was used to at Apple.\n\n(00:38:11):\nIt was certainly the case that I was welcome to weigh in on the game design or the marketing or some other aspect of the deliverables, but my job was to build the software on time with high quality, period. And if I did those things, I'd be rewarded. And if I didn't, I would not be successful. And no amount of insightful feedback on the gameplay or the packaging, or whatever else I might want to do, was going to benefit me and my career at all.\n\n(00:38:48):\nAnd it was such a blessing to be forced to go deep on something, because I spent a lot of time developing chops as an engineering manager, but I also wrote a ton of software. And that's really honestly when I became a software engineer. My college education was insufficient to get me there, and the amount of software I wrote at Apple was insufficient to get me there. But I came out of my Berkeley Systems You Don't Know Jack experience feeling like I could really hold my own technically in a way that just wouldn't have happened.\n\n(00:39:20):\nAnd so I do think that there's something to be said for a culture where there are swim lanes and people are encouraged to be really, really exceptional in their lane. And so I feel really lucky that I stumbled into You Don't Know Jack When I did.\n\n(00:39:36):\nAnd it was also, I mean, it was the first thing that I worked on that had just huge cultural awareness for a couple of years. I mean, it's crazy, they're still making sequels. It has been nearly 30 years, and there are versions of You Don't Know Jack that are in all of the stores, in the PlayStation store, in the Xbox store, in the iOS store. You can play new versions of You Don't Know Jack to this day. It's crazy.\n\nLenny (00:40:07):\nDid not know that. I see the website now and it's a little different, but basically the same.\n\nTom Conrad (00:40:13):\nSo I'd say my lesson from You Don't Know Jack was definitely, it really does pay to get good at something and not just be a generalist.\n\n(00:40:24):\nAnd then, I mean Pandora, it wasn't quite the next thing that happened. After You Don't Know Jack was Pets.com, and then after Pets.com there was nuclear winter in the industry and I worked in enterprise software for a while.\n\n(00:40:37):\nAnd after nuclear winter I had this idea that I was going to build a destination for music discovery on the web. And I've been doing enterprise software, the consumer intranet was non-existent for those years, early aughts.\n\n(00:40:54):\nBut around 2004, things started to thaw a little bit and you started to hear the first signs of the companies that we came to call Web 2.0, Flickr would've been one of the early examples. And one of the enterprise software things I did was a personalization recommendation engine that used a vector space. It's like a lot of the things that we're talking about now in AI, albeit 20 years ago.\n\n(00:41:21):\nAnd so I knew something about recommendation systems in the enterprise space, and I was super passionate about music. I'm not a musician, but I was that kid in college who would corner you and be like, oh, if you like this band, I got to play this for you and [inaudible 00:41:37] with stereo until you would beg to leave.\n\n(00:41:40):\nAnd so I had this idea that maybe I can use the internet to do that at scale, not with just one person, but with hundreds of thousands of people or millions of people maybe. Introduce them to music that they would love but otherwise would miss out on.\n\n(00:41:53):\nAnd I promised that I was going to tell stories about luck in my career, there's been a gazillion of them. But one really dramatic incidence of that is I was sort of biding my time to exit this enterprise software company. I was VP of engineering, a whole team that reported to me. I felt a lot of responsibility to exit in a responsible way. But I was really excited about this digital music company that I was going to start. But I wasn't telling anyone at all because I didn't want ti to get back to the team.\n\n(00:42:25):\nSo I flew down to Los Angeles to go out to Coachella in the spring of 2004, and completely randomly physically bumped into a guy that I had gone to high school with on the polo field, and hadn't seen him in a decade. And the thing that we had in common in high school was we loved music. And so I tell them the story of, I'm going to start this company to do personalized digital music on the internet. And he said, there's this woman I work with who just left our company to move to Oakland to work for this little company called Savage Beast that are also doing something in music recommendation. Do you want to talk to them? And I said, \"Sure, why not?\"\n\n(00:43:11):\nSo I got introduced to Tim Westergren, who was the founder of Savage Beast. Savage Beast was like a seven or eight full-time employees at that point. They made a music recommendation engine that they licensed to other companies to put in consumer products. So Savage Beast's customers were Best Buy, who put it in kiosks, and AOL, who used it on the AOL Music website. And they were looking for a VP of engineering. And I got the offer, thought about it a little bit. I declined because it was kind of this B2B2C thing and I really wanted to do something consumer and I had an idea about the app.\n\n(00:43:49):\nAnd a month later, they called again and said, \"We keep talking to people. We really think that you're the person.\" And interestingly, one of the reasons they thought that I was the person is they were really impressed by the fact that I had run engineering at Pets.com. So I mean, it's just one of those things where these things do pay dividends, even when they're a disaster.\n\n(00:44:07):\nAnd honestly, what I would really say was almost like a lapse in judgment, I said yes, even though it wasn't the product that I wanted to build. And I won't bore you with all of the details, but 90 days later, after some typical early stage founder drama stuff, the founding head of technology and product had resigned completely unrelated to my arrival. And the company had a new CEO, Joe Kennedy, and Joe had this idea for what he called the 1-Click Personal Radio. And Joe is a product marketer and just the best CEO in the whole world. We spent 10 years together building Pandora.\n\n(00:44:51):\nAnd he sort of gave me the keys and just said, \"As long as it fits the brief for 1-Click Personal Radio, it's all yours.\" And I got to build the team and the culture, in collaboration with him and Tim the founder, over the course of the next 10 years, and just every good thing.\n\n(00:45:14):\nSo I mean, there's just a million billion lessons from Pandora, and everything I am as a product leader and then an engineering leader comes from things that happen at Pandora.\n\n(00:45:24):\nBut maybe the thing that I think of first is, I think we met our early audience in an incredibly genuine way. For example, when we launched the support@pandora.com was an alias for all@pandora.com. So if you sent a customer service request to Pandora, every single person in the company received it. And because we made a decision to have no customer support team in the first year, the expectation was that whoever sees the request first should respond to it.\n\n(00:46:01):\nAnd so you would write to us and you would get the founder or you'd get me or you'd get the engineer who wrote the feature or you'd get the CEO. And there were no macros to respond to commonly asked question. There was no read the FAQ. And there were no rules about what you could and couldn't say. If the person's like, \"I think this feature is stupid and broken,\" we would encourage people to say, \"You know what? I think you're right and I'm really struggling to get our stupid head of product to agree with me. I'm going to CC Tom and maybe we can convince him that this was a bad decision.\"\n\n(00:46:35):\nAnd we did all of that because we thought one of our superpowers as a young company was that we could just engage with our audience as real human beings, not as a shiny brand that was trying to be something that we could just never be. This period is where the iPod and iTunes are at the peak of their powers. And so there was no way we could sort of out-Apple Apple on the brand front.\n\n(00:47:02):\nAnd so we were just ourselves, and I think it really, really was a catalyst for the word of mouth that developed around Pandora. And we never spent any money on paid user acquisition, literally no dollars in the entire time I was there, because people loved the product and they told their friends about it and that's how it grew.\n\nLenny (00:47:21):\nI saw a stat that you grew Pandora from 0 to 80 million users, from 10 employees to 3000 employees, from 0 basically to a multi-billion dollar company.\n\nTom Conrad (00:47:31):\nWe did those things. We did.\n\n(00:47:34):\nAlso, I think my product stewardship in some ways set the scene for Spotify to walk through the digital streaming door and show us the exit. So Pandora is, again, such a privilege to be able to work on something that touched and continues to touch tens of millions of people's lives every month. But it's bittersweet from the standpoint that I think we had an opportunity that in some ways we misplayed.\n\nLenny (00:48:06):\nMy mom is still a huge fan of Pandora, uses it every day for whatever choice.\n\nTom Conrad (00:48:10):\nI mean, it's still going. And the numbers are still tens of millions of people in the US listen every month. So it's a thing. But yeah, it's a little sad that it didn't have quite the staying power that some of these other things that have come along since have.\n\nLenny (00:48:25):\nJust on that topic, do you think there's something that you could have done, someone could have done? Do you think there was an opportunity to become Spotify? Or is it the business model and the math formula was set up in such a way that it was near impossible?\n\nTom Conrad (00:48:37):\nOne of the things that was tough for Pandora was that when we started it, digital music was a category that no investor wanted to touch. It was lawsuits. There was no money to be made. There were relationships with the labels that were completely impossible to nurture. And there had been no big outcomes. I think the biggest exit in digital music when we got going was I think Yahoo had bought Musicmatch for like $400 million. And so that was seen as kind of the ceiling on the opportunity.\n\n(00:49:08):\nAnd along the way we found investors who believed in our vision and invested ultimately hundreds of millions of dollars in the company over its pre-public years. But there was never investor enthusiasm for the company in the category that was anything like the investor enthusiasm that a company like Spotify enjoyed just six, seven years later, Snap enjoyed for its pre-public tenure.\n\n(00:49:35):\nAnd I think part of what was different for Spotify is that the comps were not... Musicmatch was 400 million, they were Pandora at 8 billion, but even above that they were Netflix at 100 billion. And so investors just had this new sort of optimism about what you could do in subscription and in streaming, and Spotify really played that to their advantage in a way that we couldn't because we had gone public and the public market investors were still trying to figure us out. So we didn't have access to capital. It was very hard for us to take the same kind of risks that Spotify took.\n\n(00:50:17):\nBut then I think we just completely misjudged one really important thing, which is that we were really inspired by disrupting terrestrial radio. Terrestrial radio is the predominant form of music consumption in the country. People spend, I can't remember the exact stats, but by minutes consumed, it's something like 10 times more music minutes a month on radio in the aughts and early tens than on owned music. And the advertising supported sort of radio market was a $30 billion category, and recorded music was $8 billion.\n\n(00:50:57):\nAnd so we had this idea that we're going to reinvent radio, and Spotify and Rdio and Apple Music and the 14 others, Rhapsody, which was Spotify before Spotify, they were all going to chase this smaller owned recorded music opportunity, and that we could be left relatively alone over here going after the less sexy but actually bigger market. And I think we just got it wrong. It should have been obvious that inevitably all of your music in any format was going to be delivered as a stream from the cloud. And that the record labels in particular, they were going to set the terms on what the structure was. And the structure that they preferred was the Spotify structure. And we operated under a different licensing...\n\nTom Conrad (00:52:01):\nAnd we operated under a different licensing regime that they hated, that was a statutory license that we got from the government. And it would've been exceptionally risky for us to come out from under the statutory license and do direct deals with the labels, but it was a requirement to play in the world that they imagined as the future, and we should have imagined as the future, too. And eventually, the company got around to it, but it was too late.\n\nLenny (00:52:29):\nIt's interesting that so much of this was rooted in that original vision that you shared of Pandora of the radio, smart radio in your pocket, [inaudible 00:52:37] personal radio that you just stayed on that track, even though there was this other track. But I think it's important to point out, you said it was seven years later. And I feel like there's this interesting trend with the companies you've worked at, pets.com and Pandora, that it's too early, you just come too early at these ideas. And I feel like that tells me Quibi might still happen. There's a Quibi coming seven years from now.\n\nTom Conrad (00:52:59):\nYou know what's really funny about that? Just today, there's a headline about a Hollywood-produced show that's launching on Instagram Reels and TikTok that was shot vertical. And the headline is literally something like, \"Is TikTok the new TV?\" And it's pretty funny that literally, that's what Jeffrey and Meg called it when they were incubating the idea. I mean, I think it's pretty clear that purpose-built video for mobile looks a lot like TikTok. And I don't want to take anything away from all of the innovation in that space that they and the other players are driving that Quibi didn't capture in its initial product definition. But I mean, obviously, we stare at our phones consuming video of all kinds all day every day. So there there's definitely something there.\n\nLenny (00:53:53):\nThe PDF that I mentioned that I got from the recruiter, the first page again says, \"You have a TV in your pocket.\" So it's exactly what they're pitching. That's amazing. All right. I think what I've learned, I need to bet all my money on this new Quibi clone because the timing might be right.\n\n(00:54:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by HelpBar by Chameleon, the free in-app universal search solution built for SaaS.

And our CEO was brilliant, but he was a product marketer. I mean, Joe was all things. He was an engineer by education, and a great marketer, and a great finance person, and just such a utility player at a very, very high level across every discipline. But he was also really, really good at letting his team do their jobs. He really let me run product and engineering. And so not only did I have tremendous latitude to make good and bad decisions about product, I also really got a seat at the table to help lead the company. So rewarding, so gratifying. Best professional experience that one could have.\n\n(00:56:05):\nSo I leave Pandora after a decade. I take a year trying to figure out what I'm going to do next. But after about a year, I got introduced to Evan. And it's kind of a funny story. A mutual friend sent this introduction over. Evan immediately responded and said, \"Why don't you come down to Los Angeles and have a coffee with me?\" So I fly down. It's not clear if it's a job interview or what it is really. I mean, I was just lightly exploring things that were out there and was a big fan of what he was doing with Snapchat. So I spent 45 minutes with him, and then I spent 45 minutes with the head of engineering, and another 45 minutes with the head of legal, and then they tossed me into a conference room with a dozen product designers, all in their mid to late 20s, many of which had gone to school at Stanford with Evan.\n\n(00:57:01):\nI would come to learn all really, really, really impressive super, super talented people, but it was just 10 of us sitting around a conference table. And it wasn't really clear that they knew why they were talking to me, but we had an hour long free ranging conversation. And so I left, and I thought it was a totally fascinating morning, but I wasn't sure what had happened, really. It was like \"Well, with these interviews, it all seemed very ad hoc. Is there a job opening?\" It was a little odd. And I went to lunch on Abbott Kinney and got a text from Evan's admin saying, \"Can you come back to the office? Have you gotten on your plane yet?\" I was like, \"I was just ordering lunch. I'll just come back right away.\"\n\n(00:57:49):\nSo I go back. Now, it's one o'clock in the afternoon. This entire thing started at nine o'clock in the morning. I sit down in the conference room. Evan comes in with a manila envelope and says, \" We loved you. We'd like for you to be our VP of product,\" and handed me a written offer, all the terms, the stock compensation, the whole thing. I'm gobsmacked. I'm flattered, that this is really playing to my ego. I can't believe that this company that feels like maybe the most interesting thing that's happening in consumer tech, that their notoriously brilliant and mercurial founder has taken enough of a shine to me that he wants to give at least some of the keys to the product kingdom over after such a short courtship.\n\n(00:58:34):\nSo I leave, and when some of that buzz wears off, I start to wonder if there's some red flags here maybe. So I tell Evan, \"Listen, I'd like to come back and meet more of the leadership team and spend more time with you, go a little deeper on what this means.\" And so we extend our courtship by another week or so, and I'm super impressed by the rest of the leadership team and the product thinkers and the designers and things that I was going to get to work with on a daily basis. And so I take the job full knowing that it's going to be wildly different than Pandora, where I had all of this latitude to do whatever I might want to do, and in the context of Snapchat, at best, I was going to be Evan's right hand, a person that principally executed his vision.\n\n(00:59:29):\nAnd that's certainly what it was. I mean, Evan and I ended up having a really great collaboration, but it was certainly most days, I was executing on his vision, both at a high level, and very much in the details. And Evan's truly brilliant, I mean, and he's also actually a really nice guy. I think in some ways, he gets a bad rep for... He has very high standards, but he's a very kind person, in my experiences with him. But it was a super exhausting job and not as soul satisfying as I wanted it to be. And after a couple of years, like I said, I thought maybe I just wanted to make croissants or something.\n\n(01:00:14):\nBut one really, really big important lesson that I learned at Snap is about risk taking. And when you have the financial support and the foundational relationship with your investors that Evan has, it really allowed him to take these really big swings, acquire a technology that he thought was game changing, build features speculatively that maybe would be pruned in any other product roadmap planning process because the odds of them having an outsized impact were modest. And it just allowed him time after time to make bets that paid off, and we forget about the ones that don't work when there are so many home runs in those years. And we didn't have... Environmentally, we weren't set up for that at Pandora, but I think in some ways, I wasn't temperamentally inclined to those kinds of big swings. And I think I take bigger risks and encourage bigger swings now because of things I learned from Evan and Snap.\n\nLenny (01:01:18):\nThat is an awesome story. It resonates a lot with what Brian shared about how he thinks about product now and just telling people what to build versus very bottom up, \"Tell us ideas you have.\" That impact, the way you run, we're going to talk a bit about you as CEO now, but I guess, do you have a place that you try to be of CEO as, \"Here's what we're building\"?\n\nTom Conrad (01:01:40):\nAs a product-oriented CEO, how much you should lean in to the details versus set direction and create an environment where great people can do great work, I suspect there's not one answer that applies to every company stage. When I was at Apple, one of the reasons that we struggled to ship things is that Apple did a great job of assembling incredibly, incredibly smart and talented people. Just everyone around me at that early stage in my career was so, so inspiring. But one of the side effects of that is we would get in a room and we would turn over some problem or opportunity, and we would talk ourselves out of every good solution because it wasn't perfect. I used to joke that Apple was the only place in the world where a vote of a thousand to one was a tie because that one person would be so thoughtful in their critique that the other thousand people would be like, \"Hmm, that's right, that's right.\" And even though there's been this huge consensus of what the right answer was, we would talk ourselves out of making decisions.\n\nLenny (01:02:50):\nThat one wasn't Steve Jobs, necessarily? It could be somebody else?\n\nTom Conrad (01:02:53):\nHe wasn't there.\n\nLenny (01:02:55):\nWow.\n\nTom Conrad (01:02:56):\nSo I think what broke Apple out of that mode was Steve came back and they didn't vote anymore. Steve was just making the call. And so I have some sympathy for Brian and Evan, who have these big, thousands of people working for them. And as they delegate, they grow frustrated that there's not progress at the pace that they're looking for, and that there's indecision, and the people on the teams report that there's just churn and no progress, and there's fiefdoms and politics and all the rest, and that as the CEO, as a brilliant product-oriented CEO, they are uniquely situated to come in and cut through all of that garbage and get the trains running on time again.\n\n(01:03:49):\nHaving said all of that, I also think that it can be a mistake to be that kind of leader in a smaller org because part of the opportunity in a small org is to assemble a group of people that are incredibly talented that believe in your mission and where who you can easily influence with a much lighter touch and set them up to build a culture in an organization that can execute. And so I see my job as CEO is to try to surf that edge of I'm really in the details. So I deeply understand the business and the product decisions that we're making and the processes that we're using to run the business, but not overplay my hand with respect to dictating outcomes.\n\n(01:04:40):\nThe one thing you'll always have as CEO is, no matter how much you tell the team that when I swing by their virtual desk and say, \"I've been thinking about this little detail that's not important right now, but what do you think?\" It's like nine out of 10 times, that person is going to go and start working on that thing. And so you do have to be just really careful about the way you engage in some of those details, I think.\n\nLenny (01:05:06):\nThere's a really good episode I had with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he shared this framework called flash tags that they use at Coda, and I think it comes from HubSpot, of you tell people, \"Here's what the subpoena is. Is it an FYI? Is it a suggestion? Is it a do this?\" There's four of them and one's like, \"I will die on this hill. You need to do this.\"\n\nTom Conrad (01:05:27):\nI try to do a lot of that. I wish I could say that in my experience that that pays off. I spend an awful lot of time, even the stuff I say very clearly, just one person's opinion, focus group of one, \"Don't change your priorities to go work on this,\" it has more of an outsized impact on people's behavior than I intended.\n\nLenny (01:05:49):\nYeah. Easier said than done. Coming back to your journey, we've talked through the story up until getting to Quibi, but two years ago, you went in a whole new direction, and you're now the CEO of a company called Zero. What is it like to move from just being a product leader or engi leader at a company to being the CEO for the first time? Why did you choose Zero as that role? And what have you learned as CEO that you wish you knew as a product leader or engi leader at a company that listeners might find useful?\n\nTom Conrad (01:06:19):\nIt's been a really, really incredible couple of years. In the aftermath of Quibi, I spent a lot of time, as we all do, soul-searching about what I learned and what I might want to do next. And as I thought about it, I realized that I really wanted to move on to something where I can have a direct impact on the culture and values of the company that I was involved in. I really got that opportunity at Pandora in a big way. And I had spent the five years of Snapchat and Quibi working for Evan and Meg and Jeffrey who are all incredible business leaders, but have their own very specific style and approach, and that leaves a mark on the culture that's unique to the founder.\n\n(01:07:04):\nAnd then as we've discussed, I'm always really interested in building things that are near and dear to me, and I was particularly thinking about what can I do that could have a really positive impact on the world in my next chapter. I've built an awful lot of media stuff through the years, video games and streaming services and so forth, and it seemed like maybe there was something that had a little bit more weight to it that I could spend my time on. And so my first thought was I would start something, a company idea I was quietly workshopping for some months. And completely independent from all of that, it's eight months into the pandemic, and my own personal health was at an all time low. I was 50 or 60 pounds overweight, my cholesterol was in the red zone. I mean, I was out of breath climbing stairs, which is something that I had never encountered in my life before.\n\n(01:07:59):\nI'm a bit of a yo-yo dieter and I'm always critical of looking in the mirror, but I was never ever really worried about my health, my longevity, and suddenly, I was. And so my solution to that was to go really deep on metabolic health, just thousands of hours of podcasts and videos and glucose monitoring patches and Oura Rings and digital fitness gear and just to try to understand the things that impact health and longevity. And as much as I would like to report that what I learned is that there's some magic pill that you can take, maybe some off label rapamycin or something, the truth is, is that to live a longer and healthier life, you really have to attack what I would call metabolic disease, which will manifest in overweight and obesity and pre-diabetes and diabetes and high cholesterol and all of these things that impact your long-term health.\n\n(01:08:59):\nAnd so I found Zero in this path and was using it to help with my own health journey. And Mike Maser founded the company four and a half years ago, and he and I were talking in this interval about my own experience with the product. I was just giving him product feedback and so forth, and he was telling me a little bit about his own entrepreneurial journey. And somewhere in the conversation, Mike said, \"My intention is to step up into the executive chair role and to find a CEO for the company.\" So again, in my story, just over and over and over, this incredibly fortuitous thing happened. I just knew immediately that it ticked all the boxes, \"Here's a chance to lead something that already had some momentum to impact the culture and values in a really direct way and was really, really close to my own personal journey.\"\n\n(01:09:50):\nAnd so we know we've got a great little company and 27 people, we've got more than a million users on the platform every month. Over a hundred thousand of them pay us with tens of millions of dollars of revenue through the years, and have had double-digit growth even coming out of the pandemic when lots of health and fitness companies saw retreats. And most importantly, it actually works. 75% of the people who use the platform lose weight. People lose, on average, five to 10% of their body weight in the first 60 days. And because of the success that people have, we grow just completely organically. We have no paid user acquisition at all. It's really a word of mouth business.\n\n(01:10:31):\nBut that's not to say that it's not challenging. All startups are challenging. And what we've really focused on for the last couple of years is we've been really focused on unit economics, really trying to understand how much value can we derive and deliver for every person who downloads and installs the app, how do we convert them through all of the funnels efficiently and get them engaged with the product and get them to retain and drive that up in a really systematic way. And with my whole career, I'm definitely a person who started off thinking software development was mostly an art form, you find brilliant visionaries who have a deep understanding of human behavior, and they craft solutions for problems that other people don't see, and they make them delightful, and they get all the little details right. And when you found product market fit for the art, then you optimize them through a really quantitative take.\n\n(01:11:34):\nAnd so I'm definitely a person that sees both sides of that left brain and right brain equation that's important in software. But here's the thing my eyes have really opened to in the last two years. While companies are definitely the software that they make and the products that they deliver and that there is an art and science to that, as I described, there is also, if you step back, there is an equation that describes the business. It talks about how you turn investment into returns. And I suppose if I had come up with finance and been a business major that maybe that's the way that I would've conceived of companies to begin with. So maybe it's a little embarrassing that I had to be 53 years old before, I think, the scales fell through my eyes and I was like, \"Oh, companies are equations.\"\n\n(01:12:24):\nAnd so when we first started talking about lifetime value and customer acquisition costs and getting those two things balanced and just the thinking about the unit economics of the business, my natural instinct was to go immediately to the leaf nodes of the equation like, \"Oh, what percentage of people do we convert from install to registered and from registered to trial,\" and these very way down at the bottom of all the funnels and to ask the product team like, \"Let's try to optimize these.\" And in the process though of trying to understand where we could take the business as we optimize those various dimensions and trying to understand too which of the dimensions had the most leverage, I started building these ever more sophisticated models that describe the whole business.\n\n(01:13:16):\nI mean, in startups, you get to wear a lot of hats. And definitely a hat that I'm wearing that I didn't anticipate at all is I'm the full-time FP&A guy for Zero. And so I built this spreadsheet that aggregates data from all of our business intelligence tools and raw data from our subscription transactions and looks at all of our historical results and all of our expenses and spend and then could use that to predict future scenarios by manipulating all of these variables. And it's just not at all the way I ever thought about products before. And I know that you've got lots of listeners like, \"This guy's an idiot. This is a fundamental way to contemplate product work.\"\n\n(01:14:05):\nBut if there's anybody out there like me who thought of it as art first and then optimization in the details, it is really, really powerful to spend the time to create the model that describes the whole thing so you can identify what are the high leverage points to focus on. So been doing a lot of that at the company in the last two years and it's really starting to deliver incredible results. Like everything in life, I mean, you sign up for things so you can learn, and that's the big one for me in the last year.\n\nLenny (01:14:36):\nI really love that takeaway of as a CEO coming back to share, here's what you should be thinking about that the CEO is probably thinking about, as a product leader, you may not be, of trying to actually spend the time to think about the business model and understand it deeply because your founders are thinking about it all the time. And so if you're not, you're missing out on here's a way to influence them, here's a way to...\n\nTom Conrad (01:14:57):\nIt's so funny too because it's a thing I suddenly understand something that mystified me through my entire career, which was I'd go to board meetings and the investors would ask these probing questions, but they were really never about the product and what the product did and what the product roadmap was and what the features were and what this... It all seemed to operate at this level that was almost completely independent of the details of the \"what is the solution you put into the world\", which as a product-oriented thinker, was just completely baffling to me. And I now realize that they were tilling the soil that I'm talking about, they were tilling.\n\n(01:15:39):\nIt doesn't really matter what the screens are and what the features are. I mean, it certainly matters, but that there's another higher order way to look at a company, which is really about the optimization of this equation. And I think particularly, if you sit on 25 boards, it's probably a much more efficient way to evaluate how your companies are doing and where to spend your time and how to help by thinking about them abstracted up at that layer. So I will never stop thinking about software development as being an art form and I will never stop enjoying the days when I get to lean in on the details, but it's been pretty eyeopening.\n\nLenny (01:16:18):\nThe other thing that stands out here, one is I think this is especially true for consumer subscription apps, which I've done some research on. And basically, they never work. There's Duolingo, there's Zero, which I didn't know how much scale you guys reached. My math here real quick. So you have a million users, a hundred thousand paying users. You charge at 10 bucks a month. I know there's a discount for an annual plan, but basically, you're making somewhere around a million dollars a month, which you don't have to confirm or deny it, but that's the math I just did, and that's crazy. So congrats. That's a rare successful consumer subscription app. It never happens.\n\nTom Conrad (01:16:53):\nAnd like I said, every startup is hard, and I never stop being surprised at the new hard things that pop up every day. But we're on a really great run. We've had a tremendous year, and I'm just so, so proud of the team we've assembled. They're incredible for the last.\n\nLenny (01:17:08):\nPart of the reason you're so successful is exactly what you said. There's a huge focus on LTV/CAC, the math formula, because for these sorts of businesses, the crux of it is can you acquire people for less money than you need to spend?\n\nTom Conrad (01:17:21):\nOne thing that's really fortunate for Zero is Mike Maser, who founded the company, and I have both been around the block long enough and enough times that we remember 2008, we remember 2000. And so in these moments in the pandemic, there were companies in our category that were raising hundreds of billions of dollars with the intention of throwing it at paid user acquisition. And we made a conscious decision to optimize the value of the organic traffic that we were getting and to drive our growth through LTV expansion rather than top of funnel expansion, which was candidly not in fashion in 2021, 2022.\n\nTom Conrad (01:18:00):\n... in 2021, 2022. It turns out it's much more in fashion these days as companies are called upon to be much more capital efficient than they were during the pandemic era. I guess I feel somewhat fortunate that my natural inclination as an entrepreneur is more in sync with the expectations of the market than it was for a while.\n\nLenny (01:18:27):\nOkay. So you've probably had the longest career arc of anyone I've had on this podcast. You've worked at all of these different companies in a lot of different phases. You're still at it. And I'm curious what you've learned about how to maintain your mental health and avoid burnout essentially through this journey. You mentioned you take some time off. Is there anything else you found or is that a trick of just how to not burnout?\n\nTom Conrad (01:18:51):\nDo you know this Japanese concept called Ikigai?\n\nLenny (01:18:55):\nMm-hmm. Yeah, but share it. Share it for folks that may not be familiar.\n\nTom Conrad (01:18:59):\nSo the idea is it's a Venn diagram and there are four spheres. There's a sphere that's labeled what you love. There's a sphere labeled what you're good at. There's a sphere labeled what the world needs, and there's a sphere called what you can be paid for, and where they all intersect is this Japanese idea, Ikigai. It's the intersection of what you're good at, what you love, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. If you find that, it's Ikigai. And interestingly, your listeners should go and find this because there are interesting ways to label the other intersections, the intersections where all four don't come together. And what's really interesting is that the ones that are three but not four, I think because they're the ones that are close but not quite to this really satisfying thing. And so it's like when you find those, it's really easy to choose a job or to choose a path where you have three but not four, which is a really great recipe if you're feeling like there's something just out of your reach that's really important.\n\n(01:20:09):\nAnyway, it's a great framework to think about your life and your career. So to start, I'm incredibly lucky that it's all Ikigai for me. What I'm good at, what I love, what the world needs, what I get paid for, they have always overlapped. And a big part of it is just what I love is this world. I love software, I love building software, I love writing software, I love using software. People are like, \"What are your hobbies?\" I don't think I have any hobbies and I think about, \"Well, what kinds of things do I do on the weekend for fun?\" And it's like I'm teaching myself After Effects or something, which I will immediately forget, but it's just fun to go really deep on some piece of interesting software.\n\n(01:21:02):\nSo I'm very lucky. And so I think that has been super sustaining for me. One of the reasons I've been able to do it as long as I have without really burning out is that just, it's what I do. And in some ways it's why I come back to it. It's easy to say, \"I'm going to become a pastry chef,\" but left to my own devices, I use software, I make software. It's my hobby, it's my passion, it's all the things.\n\n(01:21:29):\nBut a couple of thoughts about how one engages with their work. One thing is I'm really not a #hustling kind of leader. There was a woman that I worked with on the Finder just out of college that left a really big mark on me. My own style of work then, I think I mentioned my memory of flashing, blinking the folder animation was a 2: 00 AM kind of thing. I was 23 years old. I woke up at 11 o'clock in the morning. I went to the office, I screwed around and played video games in the Apple Arcade and went to a couple of meetings and had lunch and stood at the whiteboard and pontificated about some nonsense. And then about four o'clock every day I would start writing software and I would write software until 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning and then I would go out to dinner with people from the team in the middle of it and whatever.\n\n(01:22:29):\nAnd so it kind of looked like I spent 14 hours a day, six or seven days a week at Apple, and I was celebrated for this. There was lots of nights where I would work clear through the night and my boss would come in the next morning, he'd be like, \"Are you still here?\" And I'm like, \"I'm still here. Look at this cool thing I did.\" And I got a lot of attention for that. And then there's this woman on the team who showed up every single morning at 8:30, sat at her desk, wrote a ton of great software, and every night packed her stuff up and left. And she contributed more than I ever did. And I don't think she got the same kind of recognition that I got because of the way she did the work.\n\n(01:23:11):\nAnd when we were building the team and culture at Pandora, I thought about her a lot and really made a point of saying that I just wasn't interested in performative contribution, that it's the work that matters and what I want to celebrate is if you can show up and do it and go home and have other things in your life, because I think that's a recipe for being able to do it on a sustained basis rather than burning yourself out.\n\n(01:23:38):\nI think there's some nuance in this. I think 22 year old me was always going to want to work through the night. And so I think creating space that that's okay too is important. And I think maybe in some ways at Pandora it was almost like that wasn't okay. It was like, \"You should be taking more breaks. Why are you going this hard?\" But I do try to create environments where people have a reasonable balance between their regular life and their technology life or room for that if they choose it. And I do think that that has through the years, has helped me keep at it, but I still work a lot of nights and weekends because I love it. It's what I do.\n\n(01:24:16):\nHere's the other thing. I got very, very lucky with the Pandora experience and got this outsized, probably inappropriate financial reward for being a part of it and gave me options that I never imagined that I would have. And so after 10 years I left and I didn't know what I would do, but I did really need a break. It was a really hard job and that was definitely a moment where I needed some time to recover. But I think if you had asked me on that first day, I would say, \"I don't know why these people find success and then start another company right away. Why? There's so many things you could do in the world, why would you start another company? It's so hard.\"\n\n(01:25:02):\nAnd I was particularly in love with the idea that I had access to experience. I didn't really care about things, I didn't want a fancy watch or whatever, a car, but I wanted to see the world. And so I thought, \"I'm going to just go and I'm going to live in London for three months, then I come back to San Francisco for a month. I'm going to go live in Mexico City for three months and I'm going to just have this life where I'm soaking up experiences.\" And after doing that for six months, the thing that I came to realize is that what I care about way more than experiences is relationships. If you're the person who is constantly on a plane seeking out some new experience, it's really hard to form and maintain intimate, satisfying relationships.\n\n(01:25:47):\nSo I went back to San Francisco, I'm like, \"I can't be all over the world if I want to be engaged with friends and like-minded people.\" And you know what people do on Monday morning? They go to work. And so if you want to be engaged with humanity, where they are on Monday morning is at work. And so more than I had the itch to build things, which I do very much have, I had the itch to collaborate, to be in the game with other people. So that was what took me to Snapchat, took me out of chasing experiences and took me back to building again. And then as we've already described, at a point I thought, \"Well, I care about this collaboration, but maybe it doesn't need to be software that I'm creating in the world.\" And Quibi gave me a chance to fall back in love with that process again. And here we are, more software.\n\nLenny (01:26:48):\nPlus being on a board of a hardware company. What you just shared reminds me of Mark Manson's book, The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck. Have you read this book?\n\nTom Conrad (01:26:58):\nI have not.\n\nLenny (01:26:59):\nOkay. It sold a bazillion copies, and the core of it is that we get joy out of solving problems and we think we'll be happy when we have freedom to do nothing. But it turns out freedom is only helpful to help us discover the problems we just want to keep solving.\n\nTom Conrad (01:27:16):\nYeah, totally. I think that's exactly right. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:27:20):\nIt sounds like that's the experience you went on. Last question, this new segment, I'm going to call Contrarian Corner. And the question is, is there something that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't?\n\nTom Conrad (01:27:35):\nThere's a segment in our industry that believes this very intensely, which is there's this belief that everybody needs to be a founder. And I think in some ways our industry would be much better off if there were fewer founders. I use an entire category of smart, creative, hardworking, talented, borderline visionary people who can raise that $2 million seed and go off and build some stupid company that's never going to go anywhere, that would be so much better off finding a team that needs their skillset and working on a problem that has, as I described, the mathematical formula that's going to win, that has the market opportunity that's the right size, that has the 10X thinking that can really... And I'm a little biased here because while I am a CEO for the first time now, I've never been a founder and I've been lucky enough to find a bunch of young teams that could benefit from my skills and enthusiasms, and sometimes to some success and sometimes to some embarrassment, but always really, really interesting.\n\n(01:28:53):\nYeah. If you're out there and you think that the only possible way you can be successful in this industry on any metric, whatever metric you care about: you want the acclaim of your peers, you want financial reward, you want any of the things that people aspire to, outside impact on culture, whatever the thing is that gets you out of bed every morning, you can achieve that in collaboration with others. You don't have to be the person that raises the seed round.\n\nLenny (01:29:24):\nI 100% agree with that. I'm always telling people, \"Don't start a company. It's super painful, very rarely works out. It's so hard.\" I don't know what's harder, being a product manager or being a founder, probably being a founder. They're both very hard.\n\nTom Conrad (01:29:37):\nYeah, it is quite hard too. Yeah. Yeah. And just to be perfectly clear, there's something really special about founders. At both Pandora and now at Zero, the actual founders have from time to time said, \"Well, you're like a founder.\" And I'm like, \"I'm nothing like a founder. You took all the risk. When I showed up, there was a team and there was momentum and there was money in the bank. I appreciate your desire to say complimentary things, but 'You're like a founder' is not one that I'll take.\"\n\nLenny (01:30:08):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTom Conrad (01:30:11):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny (01:30:13):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nTom Conrad (01:30:17):\nI really love Elad Gil's High Growth Handbook. It's organized into chapters about foundational company building, building a leadership team, building a board, and in addition to the thoughtful synthesis on that topic from Elad, he has an interview of someone that he does relevant to that section on each of the chapters. Really, really great read and super actionable if you're a leader in a young company. In a completely different end of the spectrum, I love big, complicated science fiction and there's a lot of garbage science fiction out there to be sure, but when you find something special, it's the best. So probably through the years in that category, there's a book called Hyperion by Dan Simmons. That's just a total classic. Everybody should read it.\n\nLenny (01:31:08):\nI read that. I think I read the first couple in the first one.\n\nTom Conrad (01:31:11):\nYeah. There is a sequel that's exceptional as well. And it's probably worth warning your readers that Hyperion is quite long and has an absolute cliffhanger.\n\nLenny (01:31:21):\nI think they're making a show out of it, which is going to be wild. I don't know how they do a show around that book. I thought you were going to say this other book, A Fire Upon the Deep. Have you heard of this book?\n\nTom Conrad (01:31:29):\nOh, that's so good too.\n\nLenny (01:31:31):\nOkay. That's also very complicated, but incredible.\n\nTom Conrad (01:31:34):\nYeah, I had completely forgotten about that. That's a very special book. There's a couple in that series too.\n\nLenny (01:31:40):\nYeah, I think I only read the first one. Also, Three-Body Problem is the other one that I always think about. It's come up a couple of times on this podcast. Let's move on to the next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or a TV show?\n\nTom Conrad (01:31:53):\nI consume a lot of video content, both stuff that I'm very proud to talk about and stuff that I'm less proud to talk about, but I really liked the new Damon Lindelof show that's on Peacock called Mrs. Davis. So Lindelof, of course, from Lost and the new Watchmen on HBO, and Mrs. Davis is about an AI that you wear in your ear, like the HER AI and a nun that is hell-bent on the AI's destruction, and it reads like an early Coen brothers movie. It's super darkly funny and really, really thoughtful and unlike too much streaming, I think it's seven episodes, and it is a perfectly encapsulated story that has a beginning, middle, and an end and doesn't need to ever have another episode. It's amazing. Get yourself a Peacock subscription for at least a month to watch Mrs. Davis.\n\nLenny (01:32:56):\nFavorite interview question you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nTom Conrad (01:32:59):\nThere are two things about interviews. The first is I always encourage people when they're thinking about their interview questions to take any question that they're tempted to pull from their own current experience with the goal of trying to, how would this person solve this thing that I'm working through right now? Because just causing the other person to speculate and oftentimes about your own business, I think you know really well that they don't actually know anything about, it creates this imbalance between the interviewer and the interviewee that feels out of sync with how I think about the collaborative nature of a great interview. So I tell people that almost every interview question should start with, \"Tell me about a time in your career when...\" to give them permission or to set their expectation that I'm asking them to tell me about something they've actually done that is relevant to the topic that I'm probing.\n\n(01:33:59):\nSo that's just a structural thing that I try to do. And then usually towards the end of the interview, I ask almost everybody, \"Imagine that you had a really great day at work. What was it that you did on that day?\" Because what I'm trying to figure out is left to their own devices, what do they go to naturally because it rewards them? Because I think it's really important to find the highest best use of everyone you hire. And sometimes you can get a little bit to the bottom of what's the highest best use if you understand the things where there's a natural reward mechanism because it's like, \"Well, I had this great day. I'm going to do more of that tomorrow.\" \"What was the thing?\" And it's just pretty illuminating.\n\nLenny (01:34:45):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nTom Conrad (01:34:49):\nI have bought every pair of headphones on the planet, in part because Apple's headphones do not stay in my ears. I've sneezed one across the room, I've lost one down a drainpipe. They don't stay, none of them, the wired ones, the not wired ones, the in-ear ones, and it's left me feeling honestly like I am some kind of anatomical freak. I look at other people wearing them, I'm like, \"What is going on with their ear that it's just staying there perfect?\" It seems inconceivable to me. Nonetheless, I have a pair of AirPods Pro's that I want to love and put up with the fact that I'm going to drop them, lose them, sneeze them across the room.\n\n(01:35:32):\nBut recently I came across this product from a company called Eartune that they're replacement tips and they just have the littlest bit of compression foam on them. They don't make the AirPods so big that they won't fit in the recharging case or anything, and they work. Miraculously, they stay in my ear. And Apple has this feature called Size Fit or something, go in settings, find your AirPods, scroll all the way down in the settings, and you can run this test where they play some audio and they tell you how good the seal is. And that revealed that my right ear is weirder than my left ear. So I actually have to use different tips in either sizes. Suddenly this sounds like a vaguely disgusting conversation that we're having. Anyway, I'm just really thrilled about my ability to wear Apple's AirPods after all these years.\n\nLenny (01:36:32):\nI think what we're learning is you are a mutant, your ears are different. Cool. We'll link to that product in the show notes.\n\nTom Conrad (01:36:40):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (01:36:41):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends, either in work or in life that you find useful?\n\nTom Conrad (01:36:48):\nYou can't be a product person without having an eye rolly Charles Eames quote that's at the center of your existence. And for me, the Charles Eames quote is, \"The details are not the details. They make the design.\" And I just really absolutely believe that, that the devil is in the details when you're a product designer and be uninterested in nuance at your peril.\n\nLenny (01:37:14):\nFinal question. You worked with the creator of the GIF format. How does he pronounce, giff or jiff?\n\nTom Conrad (01:37:22):\nYeah. So before all of this, I worked at a company called CompuServe when I was in high school.\n\nLenny (01:37:29):\nCompuServe, I used CompuServe. I didn't know that. That's amazing.\n\nTom Conrad (01:37:33):\nThere was a guy on the team named Steve Wilhite who invented Graphics Interchange Format, GIF, and he was a straight out of central casting, 1960s neck beard programmer type, and the first I had ever encountered and very prickly. And it's crazy, but at the time, Steve would take all comers in the fight that it was pronounced jiff. Now he's obviously wrong. It's obviously pronounced giff. It's crazy to me now 35 years later, this is still a topic that pops up on the internet every once in a while. It's somehow like Zelig, I cross paths with the guy who created Graphics Interchange Format and I know his opinion on the topic even though it's an unpopular one.\n\nLenny (01:38:35):\nGot it. So he likes jiff, but you agree it's giff?\n\nTom Conrad (01:38:38):\nIt's definitely giff. It's obviously giff.\n\nLenny (01:38:40):\nOkay, great. We're on the same page. We've decided. Let it be known.\n\nTom Conrad (01:38:44):\nLet it be known.\n\nLenny (01:38:45):\nTom, we've talked about successes, we've talked about failures, mental health, general health, all kinds of awesome stories. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask some other questions that I didn't ask, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nTom Conrad (01:39:00):\nI'm @tconrad on all the socials, from Twitter to Threads to Instagram. My DMs are open everywhere, and I would absolutely be delighted to hear from any of your listeners on any topic that they choose. And what can you do for me? I would love for folks to download Zero and give it a try and send me some feedback about what we're doing right and what we're doing wrong, and we'd love to have our little product be part of your life.\n\nLenny (01:39:32):\nAwesome. Tom, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTom Conrad (01:39:35):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:39:36):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

I check it at least 10 times a day. What was the strategy behind it?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:00:06):\nI start backwards. It's like what is the potential here? If you start from the premise that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nIs there anything tactically that would just like, wow, that really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post, share interesting content?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:00:25):\nTo really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products. This is not a traffic jumpstart, it's not an upsell feed. It's really about people that matter, talking about things that I care about professionally. The first thing we did was really making AI first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nHow do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:00:43):\nSo it wasn't like, \"Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?\" It was like, \"Let go of what you've built. Go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nThere's so much I want to dig into here. Is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:00:57):\nAI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's really about...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:07):\nToday my guest is Tomer Cohen. Tomer is chief product officer at LinkedIn overseeing all teams responsible for building and creating LinkedIn products and experiences, including product development, design, business development, content creation, and customer operations. During his tenure at LinkedIn, Tomer was head of the mobile team, led the effort to revamp the LinkedIn feed and to many people surprised, made it extremely interesting in a place I check regularly. And he was also at the center of shifting LinkedIn to an AI first mindset, which started way before AI became cool. In our conversation, Tomer goes inside the strategy behind the transformation of LinkedIn's feed and how they approached making it a place that people wanted to check and make it much more social.\n\n(00:01:49):\nWe also get into the one mindset that Tomer credits for helping him rise so quickly within LinkedIn. Also, why Tomer's most repeated mantra is, \"We might be wrong, but we are not confused.\" And so much more. This episode is for anyone wanting to see what great product leadership looks like and wants to be inspired to think bigger. A big thank you to Shira Gasarch, Dan Roth, Josh Redfern, and Sparsh Argawal for question suggestions that made this episode so interesting. With that, I bring you Tomer Cohen.\n\n(00:02:24):\nTomer, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:02:27):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:28):\nAbsolutely, my pleasure. So as I was preparing for this podcast, I reached out to a bunch of people that have worked with you and asked them what I should ask you on this podcast, and interestingly, every single one of them said this one thing that I need to ask you, which is about this phrase that apparently you use all the time. So first of all, can you guess what this phrase might be?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:02:47):\nI have a few. Sometimes people call them Tomerisms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):\nTomerisms.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:02:50):\nBut probably I might be wrong but not confused.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:54):\nThat's the one. Amazing. Okay, so let's talk about this phrase.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:02:58):\nI don't say it so much anymore. I think it's ingrained into the cultures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:02):\nI was going to say that.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:03:03):\nWhen they think of me, they think of this sentence already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:04):\nThose are the ultimate things where you don't need to say them as much anymore. Okay, so the phrase again is, \"We might be wrong but we're not confused.\"\n\nTomer Cohen (00:03:10):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:11):\nLet's talk about this. So what does this phrase mean and why do you find it so powerful and important to say often?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:03:17):\nYeah, by the way, it's a simple phrase, but it has in my opinion, so much depth into that and ultimately something I really believe in. It's rooted in clarity and principles that ultimately lead to leadership. And the first time I got the inspiration from it was from a startup founder I met many, many years ago. Their company was on the brink of failure. They had their last attempt and they decided on a path forward and after they decided on a path forward, he was still seeing people hedging in different directions and it led into this confusion in the system where we decided people are still hedging, they're still trying out things they thought could work, and he realized that unless they basically all pull through in the same direction, there is no chance they'll be able to be successful.\n\n(00:04:04):\nNow, pulling through in the same direction doesn't mean you're going to be successful, but this gives you a chance of success and that confusion, the system only luck and save you. So that was when he shared that, that was very impactful for me. I think it's a good one for life as well. And for me it comes down to two main parts. One is clarity of thought and clarity of execution, and they're both equally important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by Gamma, an entirely new way to present your ideas powered by AI.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercell, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS, it's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at WorkOS.com to learn more, that's WorkOS.com.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:06:46):\nOn the clarity of thought. What I find people to be attached to, especially when you build an environment with a lot of alpha types is that they get attached to being right or wrong and that really creates a lot of lingering in the system, a lot of confusion and they're still stuck to their ideas. And for me, I get attached to clarity and focus. I think that's much more important. That's why I think when I say I don't mind being wrong, it really comes from a humble place. I would rather go forward with everybody in the same direction than necessarily try to hedge all the time, which will give me no chance of success. The way we start, we do this in our product gens right now, is we actually spend some significant time on what is the problem we're trying to solve for, but not high level, not like, hey, we want to launch this product, we want to launch a video product.\n\n(00:07:35):\nIt's exactly what type of video you're trying to launch for which audience, what is your unique criteria, what are you trying, what is very nuanced about what you're trying to solve for? Ideally, once the time you see the problem, you know exactly the problem you're trying, you actually can imagine that mountain. It's not just a mountain, you can see exactly the road, you can see exactly the end of the base camp. But then when you move to solution, I love solutions that are based on first principles. That they have, there's a principle thinking about it, there's opinions about it. If you talk to folks who work with me, they'll tell you, I push a lot for what is actually your opinion, what is your potentially controversial opinion and the best principles have teeth.\n\n(00:08:18):\nSo saying that we should build a simple product for me is useless. Who doesn't want to build a simple product? But saying that I'm willing to sacrifice or trade off this, that's where I get excited. I'm like, okay, that's a very strong opinion. Let's go into that. Why were you willing to trade off those type of vectors to make it happen? And one thing that I saw also in clarity of thought was this, is I came to the US in 2008, I came from Israel. Our hobby in Israel is to argue. So we argue a lot, it's our love language in many ways. And I come to the US and I notice people say a lot like I don't exactly understand or I'm not exactly clear on this, and it took me a long time to realize they're actually disagreeing.\n\n(00:09:03):\nThey're just masking it with a layer of misunderstanding and a good mentor of mine said, \"Hey, just push back. Are you disagreeing or misunderstanding? If you're misunderstanding, let's spend the night. Let's get to a point where you can articulate my point of view in your words and I can do the same, but if we're disagreeing, let's stop. Why are we spending? Why wasting time just arguing it through?\" So those became really powerful. That's on the clarity of thought, clarity of execution is even more important because many organizations actually reach a decision, they don't act on it, which it's one of those shocking things. They decide this is a top priority, but it doesn't make its way into the organization. And I'll give you an example. Somebody will say, \"Hey, my top priority for my business is this initiative.\" And then I'll say, \"But most of your engineers are working on this migration.\" And they'll say, \"Yeah, we have to finish that.\" I'm like, \"So why don't you say the migration is my number one priority?\" It's like, \"Yeah.\"\n\n(00:10:09):\nIt's like, but that's exactly what you're doing. You have to make sure that what you're sharing as a priority is actually manifested in your resourcing. Then I'm like, \"Hey, this is your top talent. Why is your top talent working on some moonshots that are not in your number one priority?\" And they're like, \"Yeah.\" This is where you start finding that really it doesn't really translate into execution as well and you can solve so much by just making that sure that focus is there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:36):\nSo the big lesson here is to push for clarity and push out anything that is unclear, confusion either in thought and also in execution. One of the folks that I talked to that worked with you about this phrase, Josh Redfern, he said that this phrase became really liberating for him, which is really interesting to hear because it forces you to make a call and to be aligned and make sure everyone is on the same page. I guess thoughts on just why this concept is so liberating.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:11:04):\nIt goes back to little alpha types or type A folks who are just so attached to not getting it wrong. When you need to move forward and it's not about being right or wrong, it's really about not being confused and making sure everybody's pulling in the same direction. That is actually really liberating. And when you know that the whole idea is to have a Socratic conversation about what you're trying to do, then coming to the table with some kind of half-baked ideas or actually not an opinion, I think actually brings into a conversation of feedback.\n\n(00:11:39):\nBut you have to manifest it through, if you just play this through but then you potentially playing the right or wrong game, that's really poor. I also think it's the best way to learn. If you don't know exactly what you're doing, how can you learn back from why you made that decision? So if you had a clear understanding, ultimately it's a growing organization. This is not a one-off project. We're going to build many projects in the future. So if you're not sure about what we're trying to accomplish, how can you know what you learned from it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:09):\nI love that. So the idea here is make it very okay to be wrong, but make it not okay to be confused and not clear about here's what we're doing, here's why we're doing it. Everyone's aligned exactly on the same idea.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:12:19):\nHow can I have a product conversation if I'm not sure what you stand for? It's really hard to have a Socratic conversation, really hard to have. If you ask folks how many time you left a meeting in corporate, it could be a startup or larger companies and you are not sure exactly what was the problem discussed or what are next steps. More often than not, they'll raise their hand. That for me is a waste of building time. So actually that agitates me in another great way, but when I come in and I'm proven wrong or there's a strong challenge or argument, again that's a little bit my love language, I actually enjoy those. I think we leave the conversation much better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:09):\nYou said there's some other Tomerisms, what are some others just that you can share?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:13:14):\nThis is, again, this is classic to building large organizations, but I actually believe in, especially when it comes to products, to really set ambitious goals but then try to over-deliver on them, really set what are you trying to, there's almost like the opposite where people are underplaying it and over delivering, I don't understand what you're trying to do. For me it's like we are here to make an impact. We're here to really set our goals to something really massive. And when I'm trying to visualize this, I see a mountain, you see the peak and the peak exactly how it looks like, you see base camp, you know how to start and maybe the middle of the mountain is kind of blurry, but you'll figure this out. But at least you know the peak you're trying to share, share the peak, share where you're headed to and I think it's just a much more exciting way to build product. It's a much more inspirational way for folks to be part of the product process kind of thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:07):\nI was just chatting with Vlad who worked at Airbnb for many years. He was actually my former manager at Airbnb and he reported to Brian for a long time and we talked about this trait that Brian also is really good at, is just setting crazy high goals. 10 X the goal that you thought you had and what would it take and it worked really well for Airbnb. So I love that you're doubling down on the same idea. Is there an example that comes to mind of one that you, some ambitious goal you set internally at LinkedIn that people are like, \"No way,\" and then it ended up being effective?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:14:35):\nActually there's a lot, when I think about our LinkedIn feed and thinking about when you started off, it was hard to imagine what that product could be because it was more of a promotional in nature product and I was like, no, is going to be a place where millions of people and not just tens of millions will come daily. And that's insane. That makes no sense based on the numbers today, but I don't start building from the numbers today. I start from [inaudible 00:15:04] I start backwards. I'm like, what this could be, what is the potential here? So how many professionals exist in their role? How many of them would love to find a place to share and engage with content? And this is my starting point. I start from there. So I don't start from the existence to set my ambition. I start from what this could be like based on really inspiration and excitement.\n\n(00:15:30):\nAgain, it's not detached from reality completely, but it's also not hooked to it. But then Basecamp could be a good start. You're not asking you to make it the next day, but if you don't have that ambition, there's no way you're going to hit that. There's just no way. And there's so many products across LinkedIn. LinkedIn is a 20 plus year old company that many folks did not give it a chance in almost every phase of it. And I think if anything, it's one of those that just keeps getting better and better every year. And part of it is you keep the landmark on. This really has the potential to do so much for so many people. It's really an economic platform. So if you play from that, one billion members, that's actually pretty small where we can actually go,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:17):\nI'm so happy you went to this example. This is exactly where I wanted to take the conversation. I was very much in the camp you described of LinkedIn, how could LinkedIn possibly become a place that I want to go and browse a feed and post content? As you probably know, for the longest time it was felt like this cringey place as you said, where everyone comes and promotes themselves, \"Hey, I got a promotion or here's my company's new launch.\" And I think it's so underappreciated the turnaround that has happened within LinkedIn. I use it, I'm a multi-day, multi-Dow user. I check it at least 10 times a day. Most of my traffic to my newsletter comes from LinkedIn, not Twitter where people think, it's absurdly underappreciated and it's I think underappreciated what it took to make this happen.\n\n(00:17:02):\nAnd when I saw you guys starting to try to make it a place people post content, I was like, no way, this is not going to work. Why would people want to share stuff on LinkedIn? And it's working, it's amazing. So I want to spend some time here and just try to go inside the strategy that you guys put together to here's how we're going to make this happen. Come, we've shared, you have this peak of here's what we could become. How did you actually turn this around? What was the strategy behind it?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:17:26):\nYeah, by the way, I'm glad you're finding great audience and traffic on LinkedIn. I think your content, actually, your content is exactly what we're trying to build for, it's expertise, it's advice, it's people you can learn from and it's also the views that really matter, not just the volume that matters. I think if we take a step back, there's so much conversation about zero to one products or scaling products, but you don't have much conversations about minus one to one products, like turnaround products. And I think there's obviously the perception of the market you have to deal with, but people I think in minus to one products, at least from my experience and we had a few at LinkedIn, pages is another one, helping businesses build their presence on LinkedIn. What you find is it's actually, most of the time it's internally harder to do because there's so much entrenched flows and processes and metrics that people are using on that specific area.\n\n(00:18:21):\nSo you almost have to change the inner workings of the system to make it work. Going back to the analogy of the mountain, if you start from the premise that I deeply believe in is that LinkedIn ultimately is a platform for economic opportunity that sits on top of a very strong social graph. Then really almost every aspect of economic transaction is possible and knowledge transaction is one of the most powerful economic transactions you can have. It's the biggest accelerant for an experience and we were always very strong at helping people get a job. We have seven hires per minute, but as we were building more and more knowledge and part of it was we bought LinkedIn, we bought Lynda to make it LinkedIn Learning a while back. Today we had 140 hours of learning every minute on LinkedIn happening across the feed and LinkedIn Learning, it's pretty powerful.\n\n(00:19:13):\nAnd the transformation to the LinkedIn feed was exactly like you said. We actually were the first company to have a social feed, but I think we started wrong. So we started with basically activity feed. So it was like who changed what, who changed the job, who connected to who. It was more of like a tracking your network feed and it became more promotional in nature. So in a way just letting that be just naturally just moved into more of a promotional type of feed. And what we've done is we've shifted dramatically into building, actually this was one of the things I was excited about. So after I was leading the mobile team, there was no feed team, there was no unified feed team, there was no feed PM to an extent, I asked to do this role, nobody cared about it. I really believed in it.\n\n(00:20:07):\nI have strong conviction about what I could do there. And I asked to do this role and we assembled the team around it and one of the main things we've done was to really set the new purpose for it, which was this is not a springboard for other products, this is not a traffic jumpstart for, it's not an app self feed, it's really about people that matter talking about things that I care about professionally. It's about knowledge exchange. It's about how can I get the right views to the right experts in a way that actually helps them build a reputation and build their business. And then we started from there backwards. So it was basically setting that ground for that mountain peak that was nowhere to be imagined at the beginning and making our way backwards.\n\n(00:20:55):\nThe first thing we did was really making AI first. So the AI team back then was completely centralized. It was not part of any product team and we brought it together with one unified AI first team. And the belief I had was ultimately the engine of the car was AI and that was almost like de-prioritized or delegated to a team that was not unified in objectives. So bring that in. And then I spent most of my time on objectives and algorithm features and data training, which led me into my passion about training product people to be a first product people. And that was a big transformation there, really shifting and we had incredible AI team, but they were completely, actually, it was a confused operation. They were building something for a whole different purpose and we were trying to aim to that mountain peak and they were putting in a different direction. No bad intent, that's what they were told to do.\n\n(00:21:56):\nSo bringing it together into this SWAT team was the first thing that actually was extremely powerful, but then became the hard work. You have a product that works in a certain way and you almost want to change its DNA altogether. And it was very hard because whenever we were trying to run experiments that were mass in scale, I told you everybody was relying on the feed for their traffic. It just scared the whole system because numbers were shifting up and down and teams were freaking out about meeting their goals. And then I realized that was just spending my time in escalations instead of actually building a great product. So what I did was I carved out two million members and I said, \"Those are my members. I'm going to focus on building that mountain peak. I'm going to build for them.\"\n\n(00:22:45):\nFull liberty and doing whatever, it doesn't hurt numbers, giving the scale and really focus on building a great experience for them. And it wasn't overnight and it wasn't over a week, but over the course of months we've seen dramatic behavior change for those members, almost like secluded, like a country of people that were seeing a different experience of LinkedIn. And once we saw that you actually had strong evidence that wow, if I bring this in, we don't need to spend time talking about how this pie gets slotted between different teams. We can actually grow the pie. The experience just manifests itself in a whole different way and that was a big change internally. It wasn't overnight, but it was really powerful in getting everybody around to see, wow, we have this cohort that is doing extremely well, which was a randomized cohort and then how we can bring it out.\n\n(00:23:39):\nI've also done some crazy things. We've done some negative tests to prove some stuff out, test for the sake of learning. When you run something that you can show that if it's just a promotional feed and you played it out organically over time, engage with the tier rates. We ran some really important ad tests as well, but we're really shown separate, almost like we carved out the different product and we showed that this could work and then we brought it out to the main experience for everybody else. And then that was, I would say the inner workings of minus one to one. Then the scanning part really became when we started to focus on professional opportunities. So when people actually share, how do they get the right views into the experience?\n\n(00:24:19):\nWe don't compete for volume, we're not in the same category of Meta in terms of the skill there, but we will compete all day long for the right people seeing your content. In fact, I think in many ways that's the most powerful part of LinkedIn. How do we make sure that it's professionally productive and safe conversations? How do we trade off bad engagement all day long? In fact, when we started shifting the AI objective from click through into more downstream conversations, spammers actually took notice as well. So they were jumping over the LinkedIn bandwagon, so we had to spend a lot of time removing bad activity from LinkedIn, but that's been the evolution of this process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThat is amazing. There's so much I want to dig into here. Okay, so this two million user carve out that you did, basically everyone was just like, what the hell are you doing to our metrics and goals? You're causing all this trouble for the business. Why is this team hurting our metrics? So that was basically a group that those two million users are the only ones that saw this new updated feed and were they removed from everyone else's metrics so they weren't fluctuated as much or was it just?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:25:26):\nThey could be kept in the overall because it wasn't as important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:29):\nIt was a small percent?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:25:30):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:30):\nOkay. Got it.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:25:30):\nBut for us, they were like the world we were basically able to prove with them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:34):\nGot it. Okay. That's so smart. Okay, so basically you just decided we're only going to move your metrics a little bit, worst case if we stick to it.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:25:41):\nI felt that I tried for a few months to play on the overall experience with everybody, but it was really hard, almost like impossible because you have an organization that is so tied into how things work that I was just hitting walls after walls after escalations and it was just unproductive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:00):\nAnd this is before you were a chief product officer where you could have just said, \"We will take this bet. We know this might hurt metrics short-term\"?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:26:06):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:07):\nOkay, got it. That makes sense. Okay, the other piece, so just like lessons I'm taking away from trying something like this that's an ambitious bet within a company, is put a PM and a team on it with a goal that feels like a core part of the success of just like somebody's ass is on the line to doing this thing.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:26:23):\nAlways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):\nAlways, with focus on this one problem. And then there's the way you described there's this goal for this feed, but how did you actually try to turn that into a goal or metric or a KPI, what was that in the end, was there something there?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:26:35):\nYeah, this is an interesting one, one thing we've done actually because the feed is the first thing you land on. I can't just count how many folks engage with the feed because then I'm counting bypassers kind of thing and bystanders that are actually coming into the experience. So we actually started to look at the more, we go a lot into active, engaged and high value engagement. So we go downstream, we kind of put the onus on looking at more downstream engagement there and we build that as the feed engagement. So really trying to show that we're not just counting some overall whatever it is [inaudible 00:27:09] or sessions at the top level. That's not really helpful because any shifts can help there, but really setting targets for that. There's obviously it's a marketplace, so there's the creation side, there's the consumption side's, there's making sure that's healthy and engaging.\n\n(00:27:23):\nThere was so much we went into that, but I think the best thing was it's almost like you carve out. I think when you do minus one to one, it's really hard unless the CEO says I don't care about how the company performs for the next two years, we're going to go for it. If you want to keep the site keep growing and the experience keep growing, carving out and almost like sending very specific unique metrics but then could easily be extended out once you show it was in retrospect the right way to do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:52):\nAnd then to give people a glimpse into the way your brain works to identify this is a big opportunity. So you talk about just like I see there's a lever that we're not investing enough in and I see this big opportunity to grow of LinkedIn. How did you decide I need to go and bet on this thing and lead this team and I think feed is a huge opportunity?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:28:10):\nI start from beliefs a lot. So I start from what do I believe this could be or where I actually came to LinkedIn this way. In fact my biggest change in my career was when I moved here and I shifted to more like what do I care about? What am I excited about? What do I have conviction on? I think it's really hard to be a strong product leader without having strong conviction about something. So I start there and in fact coming to LinkedIn as an example, when I came into lead mobile, LinkedIn was a desktop first company, then mobile team was an offshoot of entrepreneurs. I came from a startup that I ran and it wasn't a big, it wasn't, it was like, okay, I want to do mobile, I guess fine. It's like noise at this point. Same with feed. And same when I shifted into ads, I felt really strong about the ability to flip that into a great way for companies to grow.\n\n(00:29:04):\nSo for me it starts with a conviction of where things could go, what do I believe in? I believe LinkedIn can be an incredible superpower and daily use case for every professional in the world. I believe knowledge sharing and knowledge exchange is the most amazing way to grow your career and to grow your business. So that needs to be a strong pillar of the experience, what didn't exist before and what is better than the feed experience, the home [inaudible 00:29:32] to actually build it. So I don't get attached to what did not work in the past. That's not, I don't know, maybe it's a mistake sometimes, but that doesn't stop me from thinking about the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):\nHow do you actually make time to think like this? A lot of people are listening. They're just like, \"Okay, I want to think about what could this become?\" Is this just the way brain works? You're always thinking what could this be? Do you set time aside to think quarterly or yearly, what could this be if we really made this amazing?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:30:02):\nIt's a good question. I haven't thought about it. It's like a process I do. I don't sit time aside for this, but I'm very reflective. I try to focus, love the conversations on the dream, what ultimately are we trying to achieve? I think LinkedIn has a great process called vision to values that started from our former CEO, Jeff Winner, which is like if you said this is for company or for a product, which is if you're successful, what change would happen in the world? Which I love. It's just a great phrase. It's just a great empowering phrase. So I actually tend to spend a lot of my time there. I'm also very optimistic in nature. Again, sometimes it's probably, I'm not best for any role perspective. You want somebody a bit more pessimistic about the future, but I tend to lead with beliefs versus evidence. I try to prove my beliefs with evidence, but I don't lead with evidence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:59):\nAwesome. Okay. And then maybe just one more tactical question about this shift that I wish I could spend hours on because it's so interesting, the success you had making the feed so engaging. Is there anything tactically that would just like wow that would really made a big dent in people wanting to come here and post and share interesting content, like a feature or a part of the strategy that really made the feed social?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:31:21):\nI think the lesson would be, for me that was the biggest learning going into AI first that gave me the why is AI so core and why I got to make it a priority all the way to my role today to make sure the rest of the organization thinks AI first. The understanding is is that in a marketplace, if I'm able to satisfy your need on the other side, then it's magic. So ultimately it came down to AI is the ultimate matchmaker. It's underutilized, it's misunderstood, it's run separate from the team. And in a marketplace it's all about value exchange. And if I'm able to do value exchange really well, then people will come back and they do and they engage and actually they come back even more and they spend more time. So for me it was that depth into AI first as the engine that moves the whole organization forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:12):\nGot it. So essentially making sure the content you are seeing is the most engaging you could see based on using AI to make the algorithm really smart?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:32:21):\nOn both sides. If you are the creator, if you're the person sharing, remember this was a while back, I think it was about the former Olympics and person shared an article on LinkedIn about how they should not call it Olympics, they should call it the commercial Olympics because it's all about commercials and less Olympics. And then they sent me this amazing screenshot about how NBC execs who were covering the Olympics were rearing the post, this first to them was gold. It was like, \"Oh my god, my content is influencing, people are seeing it, people that matter.\" So that was really key. Making sure that when you share something, you share your expertise. The right people on the other side are relevant to your content and they see it. That could make your day or your week or actually it could make your living in many ways. And then on the receiving side, when I come in, it's the things I'm excited about seeing.\n\n(00:33:17):\nIt's the things that are relevant, the reason your content resonates so much with other people, I can actually take your podcasts and I can apply them at work. What could be a better way to learn? I'll give you another example, which was very, very recent. I met with a known professor in this field and he shared with me how over the last year and a half he started using LinkedIn because somebody told him, \"You have a great content, why don't you just post it?\" I was like, \"I don't want to post on social media.\" I'm like, \"Oh, LinkedIn is different, share on LinkedIn.\" And he was like, \"I post daily. I have so much content over the years, I post daily.\"\n\n(00:33:51):\nAnd he was like, he basically told me this is unbelievable in terms of economic opportunity I'm getting. He's like, \"I'm getting speaking engagements that are roughly half the salary I make in a year here at the university. Just by people seeing this content and getting to the right people. I was invited to advise prime ministers on their investment strategy for the country and I've been teaching for 20 years, but this platform just completely elevated my ability to reach and influence people.\" That's the magic and that's the value exchange and that's the kind of matchmaking at scale.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nAmazing. That's an awesome story. This episode is brought to you by Merge, product leaders. Yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration, they're not fun for you to scope, build, launch or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS, organizations like Ramp, Dorada and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases in their product or HRIS data to auto-provision and deprovision access for their customer's employees. And yes, if you need AI ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. So want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all? Book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:35:38):\nI want to shift a little bit in talking about this AI first mindset that you've touched on a lot. So you talked about how at the beginning of this investment, you've already been focused on AI before it was as hot as it is today, and I've heard from many people that you're really big on getting people to shift to this mindset of being very AI first. Clearly it's worked really well at LinkedIn. I'm curious just what that actually looks like. I know you could be like, \"Hey guys, we got to be AI first, AI, AI, AI.\" But it's different to actually make people really think differently. How do you actually on the ground help people shift their perspective and think AI first?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:36:14):\nI can spend days on this. This is so important. It's actually so important for me, it's a key focus for me. Actually to your point, long before it became cool to talk about AI in the last two years, and in fact I think I've learned this on myself. So when it comes to the feed, I took the role of the AI product leader, it didn't exist in the company. There was no person that was ever from a product perspective thinking about AI. I think it start with the belief, like we talked about before, I think every technological revolution has dramatically changed the way we build. And AI arguably is the biggest one in our lifetimes. And when I say AI first, it's not about a tech, it's a mindset. It's a start with strategy. It is rare. Maybe now you'll see it, but it was rare two years ago to see anybody in their strategy talk about the role of AI and how they build with AI.\n\n(00:37:02):\nThen it goes to the product and then the talent itself you hire, do they actually think this way? The analogy I would give to people is imagine a river rafting boat and you have everybody on the sides holding the pedals and adding accuracy, adding speed, but there's the guide on the back and they're holding those two pedals. Those two pedals navigate pretty much the boat and those pedals are AI and the guide better be you. And in most cases in companies the guide was somebody else, it wasn't the product leader. So then the question is, if AI actually is directing your product or success and it's the biggest factor and you as the product leader is not the one holding those two pedals, what are you doing? And then I realized that it was a bit of a lack of education in that, there was actually most product users used to think of AI as this black box, magic spells that they don't know how it's working so they're delegating.\n\n(00:38:01):\nAnd obviously that's as far from the truth as possible, but there's so many ways to unpack it. When it came to the feed where I push for example, more specifically for the teams, he doesn't stay as an AI first, there's the objective. I would ask him, \"What is the objective of the algorithm?\" I would challenge you to ask folks more in the folks who are leading products specifically with algorithms inherited built into them, what is the objective of the algorithm and can you write it down for me on a board? They should be able to do so, ultimately it's a mathematical formula and then it's like what features have you added to the algorithm? And this is not user features, this is specifically what parameters to learn on and then what investment do you have in data collections and fine-tuning?\n\n(00:38:49):\nNow everybody talks a big game about fine-tuning but again, two years ago, fine-tuning was something that the product folks thought the engineering team was supposed to do. No, it's the whole organization. In fact, you can build a whole strategy just on data collection and fine-tuning and your product will see tremendous success or you can delegate it and it will never happen. So in many ways that was bringing into the fold, in our phase one, which really started around 2016 for me and every team I went to, the AI component was the area I spent most of my time on. I hired people for that. Product leaders, I spent most of my, back to how do I spend my resources, most of my resources there. And it was my top priority all the way from strategy to talent. And ultimately with the last couple of years we've seen this metamorphosis of AI and this incredible new wave and we've done a pretty big change there as well over the last two years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:49):\nI love this. So I took some notes on what you're talking about. So the big message that I'm taking away so far is as a product leader, you need to think about things that you thought the engineering leader had to think about or the ML engineer was thinking about things like what is the objective of our algorithm? What are the features that we're building into it? What is the data collection strategy? How are we fine-tuning it? As a PM, you should be asking these questions.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:40:13):\nIn fact, you should go all the way to infrastructure. You can have massive lifts in your product outcomes and goals if you probably enhance your infrastructure. How many product people talk about the infrastructure they have? Not many. Influencers, those are things ultimately your goal is to win with your products and build a much more experience to your members and customers. Literally just changing the infrastructure on top of what you build. That could be the biggest lever than you building another button or experience for your members on the top of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:45):\nSo say the PMs at LinkedIn, are you encouraging them all to, how is AI integrating into what you're doing? How do you just set this up so that teams do this well within LinkedIn?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:40:57):\nYeah. So coming into this role in early 2020, we basically established an AI academy. Every PM had to go through training just like we did mobile in 2014, we moved the whole organization to be mobile first, so everybody had to go through this process. I spent a lot of time in my reviews on the AI strategy, the objectives. We make sure there's actually AI practitioners on the product side who are strong, who can teach. So we in waves started to build more of expertise and distinguished leaders across that can actually bring this learning across the board. And then in fall 2022, when we all know what happened, at least a few months after, but we started early, we completely changed our entire almost product operations and portfolio so we can focus on this new wave of AI with LLMs in the front.\n\n(00:41:47):\nSo LinkedIn has been working with AI very closely since the early days, but mostly as a matchmaker. So it was the matchmaker for our marketplaces. Somebody looks to hire this dream candidate and then you have a candidate looking for the dream job and AI would be the one doing the matchmaking. We talked about the knowledge sharing on the feed. It happens in our commerce platform as well. But AI, I was in the background so I never saw it, it was making those matches. And then with the new level of AI, we actually brought AI from the back of our marketplaces really as the matchmaker to the front. And one of the things we've done there was really asking the teams to completely revisit their entire roadmap.\n\n(00:42:35):\nThis is fall of 2022, the world will learn about ChatGPT for several in March 2023. So we had a nice beginning there in terms of getting started. And the goal there was let go of what you've built, let go of your roadmap, go back to the drawing board with what are you trying to solve for, back to that idea of clarity on your problem statement and now tell me what's the solution. That's very much AI first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:03):\nIt reminds me, so one of the folks I pinged about you, Shira Gasarch, she used this quote about you, \"Maybe you were made for such a time as this.\" And it connects to a lot what you're talking about where you've been thinking a lot about. And back then it was called machine learning. It wasn't called AI for a long time and now it's AI. The fact that you've been on this so long is just a perfect synergy for now. It's working its way into everything.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:43:27):\nHere's an example that I think sometimes to bring it to people in a more visceral way if you've been building products, product leaders are used to very much dictate the experience they're building. I want this experience to be exactly like this. I want the member to come from here and this is the options they have and I want them to be able to select this and this will be my default and I want the onboarding to progress this way. And I think this is one of the biggest shifts with this when you become an AI first leader, is that there's a realization that you don't control the experience anymore, you control the ingredients. It's almost like being a chef at the restaurant and you're used to deciding every part of the dish. You're deciding everything from the ambiance to the temperature of the broccoli and then this new technology comes in and say, just give me the ingredients, give me the guidelines of how you cook and now I'll take care of it. I'll take care of it for you.\n\n(00:44:24):\nFor many folks, this is a very scary feeling, they're not used to letting go of the control. Obviously you build safety guards and responsible AI around it and that's super critical. But at the essence of it, AI is not deterministic. So giving it the rope to learn and do that experience for you ultimately would become much, much better. You have to have that belief going into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:50):\nAlong those lines, I'm curious if there's anything you do to avoid, everyone's like, cool AI into everything and then all these stupid things ship, then no one wants. I saw this hilarious meme of like, oh wait, we built a kind of dumb artificial person. Let's integrate it into everything. Now it's everywhere. Is there anything you've learned about just how not to ship stuff that isn't great?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:45:11):\nI can tell you what we've done here and we've failed a lot, but we learned so much along the way. When we started it in fall 2022, literally started with me calling the leaders coming to the room and we talked about, okay, let go of your roadmaps, like what we've done, great, but I want to let go of the roadmaps and I want to instead go back to what you're trying to solve for and let's meet in a couple of weeks and tell me how you're thinking differently about what you're trying to solve for knowing we have this technology in a role for us. So that was a starting point around just setting out some ground and principles around it. But we didn't start with new objectives to solve. So it wasn't like, \"Oh, we have this cool technology, what can we do with it?\" It was like go back to the objectives you were trying to solve and now with this technology, how can you do that objective better?\n\n(00:46:00):\nThe second part is we actually allowed teams to run to really inspire creativity. I didn't want to contain them. I wanted to get them really excited about the potential here. And even some things we're building duplicates for a while of similar ideas but done differently because part of it was I was learning. I was very excited to see what people would come up with and see how they can do it. And there was no playbook for building this really, really well. And in many ways we were writing the playbook. Prompt engineering became a playbook internally for us, which every day was amazing. How do you cognitively reverse engineer the brain a little bit? That was incredible. In fact, a lot of things we've learned so much ahead of the market and even shared with OpenAI and shared with Microsoft. But then after that period of just everybody getting excited and building, we basically brought it down and we did top-down got it.\n\n(00:46:53):\nSo we basically picked back to the objectives we had out of everything that we've seen, those for us look like the best four biggest best we want to want to aim for and we want to converge resourcing across it. So no more everybody's building whatever they want. We also, capacity is also constraint. Cost is a constraint. We want to start bringing them together. So we really much allowed people to, I would say in many words, diverge. But then I would say several weeks after converge, but we had a lot more excitement and understanding about how this thing works and what we can actually do with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:30):\nLove that advice. Basically give people a bunch of time and space to explore and experiment R and D and then as a top-down strategy, pick through this.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:47:40):\nThe top-down, we were like, there was literally, usually I do product jams for every multiple topics we have throughout the quarter. I just did every week. I just reviewed the five bets we had on a reputed basis, nothing else. Because it was so important for them to understand that this is what I care about and we had to be focused about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):\nIt feels like that space to explore and go crazy is important because otherwise people at the company are going to be like, \"Oh, I wish, there's so many, this thing I want to try with AI, we should try it.\" And they'll just be pissed because they don't have time to work on it.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:48:11):\nIt's a great point. It wasn't my intention, but I love that you're saying it. It's a great point because I think it gives them that. I was actually, for me sometimes almost in a, maybe too much, but I try to focus on learning. I was trying. I knew just going like this, we weren't going to learn a lot, but having people come back and trying different things and slightly going crazy and pushing the boundaries, we would learn so much. So for me it was learning, but I love the motivation around, also allowing them to have the energy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:39):\nIt relates to another point that a recent podcast episode I had with Brian Chesky where he introduces chaos sometimes when things are feeling too comfortable, when roadmaps, everything's calm, everything's on schedule. He's just like, \"How do we do this in one day versus in two weeks? Let's just see what happens.\"\n\nTomer Cohen (00:48:56):\nYeah, because I think people get, there is just inertia, people get into their, it's human behavior, people get into their lanes, they start to feel really comfortable within the lanes, and then they don't know that there's a different way to do things and you have to almost externally invoke that or trigger that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:13):\nIf we think about just your career arc, I'm zooming out a little bit. You helped create the mobile experience on LinkedIn. You built the feed initially and now you're in front of AI. I could see why you're so successful at LinkedIn. I was talking to folks about your career arc at LinkedIn and you basically went from senior PM to senior PM number two, to group PM to director, to senior director to VP, to CPO in not that many years, it's a pretty meteoric rise. I wanted to spend a little time here and I want to maybe start with the question of just if you could give one specific piece of advice for someone looking to advance in their career based on what you found to be really effective, what would that be?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:49:53):\nI realized everybody's in every stage in their career and they have different ways to think about the role then what they need. Maybe I'll just share about my journey, what worked for me instead of giving more of a general advice. First of all, I feel super fortunate I'm building. That's what I love doing. I love building, I love working with builders. Sometimes I'm like, I get paid for this, this is insane. But I love my craft and I love getting deep into it. So in many ways I think the things I'm excited about is the things I'm doing. When people are starting off, I usually really focus on learning from great people. People you talk to or have amazing mentors and managers. Some of them don't even know there were every mentors. It's not like a mentor officially. I try to pick up things from people all the time, and that's been just a remarkable experience working with great people.\n\n(00:50:50):\nAnd in many ways, a lot of those great people actually allowed me or empowered me to take on some bigger challenges. So I can see forks in the road where if it wasn't for that person saying something very specific, probably would've done something differently. And it just made me think a lot. So I really tried to absorb learning from great people. But by far, for me personally, again, this is very personal versus generic advice, it was when I moved here, I was an engineer for many years before I moved here for graduate school in 2008. And I always loved building, that was there from a young age but when I moved here, I realized my career path was very much dictated by one thing. It was like, what's most in demand? What's most challenging? And how do I do that? It was very childish in many ways.\n\n(00:51:42):\nIt was not dictated by me, it was in a way dictated by society. So what's the toughest engineering role? What's the best company to go into? What's the best army unit to serve in? And I fell a lot along the way, but I always kept going. And then when I came here, there was a really big challenging for me personally around what do I care about? What matters most to me? And that was, again, it's very personal in many ways. It was very much for me, an impact on learning and actually how do I create impact more broadly? And I shifted 180 in how my thought process used to go. It was less about what was out there and exciting and in demand and challenging and it was more about where did I have strong conviction on, what was I passionate about and where did I feel I could make a dent and learn?\n\n(00:52:35):\nAnd that was my path forward. So after school with a student visa and massive school debt, I decided to start a company which was not a very intelligent decision based on my economic circumstances, but I didn't care. I was like, this is my new path. And then I got into LinkedIn. I didn't apply for a job. I met with who was in my role today, Deep Nishar, at that time and we talked and I said, \"This is how I think this is how LinkedIn mobile should be built.\" And he was like, \"Okay, how about you come and build it?\" I was like, \"Amazing.\" So I didn't apply to LinkedIn and then at LinkedIn I was always like, this is what I want to do, this is what's exciting for me and this is the dent I think I can make and this is my plan for it.\n\n(00:53:21):\nI don't know if this is a recommendation for everybody, but for me it's worked really, really well. It was really pursuing the conviction I had and my excitement and bring that to the fold with people. I do think that in products, in building product, if you're not genuinely excited about what you want to build, you don't have conviction about it, it's going to be very hard for you to make a big impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:45):\nThat's also a similar theme from my most recent podcast with Vlad of just, if you don't actually buy into the mission of the place you're working on, you're not going to have a good time.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:53:54):\nYeah. Say for product people, it's a very fortunate position. I always tell people, if you're in one of the most fortunate positions you can have, because if you just measure thing, for you, just measure based on your career and so on, people are going to evaluate you based on your actual work. It's a very special place. Nobody cares about your title, who cares? It's not. Maybe the company name for some people matters, but for the most part, it's about the impact you created with the products you've built. If I think about somebody's resume, I think if it was a product resume, it would be the products you built and the impact you had with it. I don't care about the companies you worked at, I don't care about the logos, I don't care about the titles. Slightly, again, not to overextend, but somebody, it's almost like an artist, right? It's like whatever, a musician, it's the albums you took out and how well they did. And I think for product people, it's a very fortunate place to be that you get measured based on the impact you had.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:53):\nIt sounds like a LinkedIn feature idea right there. I feel like if there's any company that could make that happen, it'd be you guys. So some of the takeaways here essentially is try to index towards what are you actually excited about and motivated to work on and driven by versus where it's the most amazing company to work at are the most challenging problem.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:55:17):\nYeah, I think sometimes great companies have great opportunities for you to have dent at scale, but you need to be the one doing it. If you are thinking about, I don't know, a title or that did not, once I did the change into my excitement around impact, that's been at least my yardstick. When I look at people that I talk to or interview internally, the first thing to my mind to me is like, \"What did you build and what did you learn and how well did they do?\" That's what I care about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:50):\nI imagine there's also people on the other side where all they do is work on things that really exciting to them and they could use a little pushing towards the other direction of what's actually important in the world.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:55:59):\n100%. If you tell me, again, everybody has their different, if you tell me, \"Hey, you can work on something super exciting, but it's on the fringes of the company or you can work on something which is a bit more grindy, but it's on the core of the company.\" The latter, no doubt, for me, impact first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:19):\nAnd just listening to the story you've told of the things you decided to focus on as a clear example that you saw, hey, there's this huge opportunity in the feed, I'm going to go tackle that or mobile. So I think there's a lot of, it's kind of this Venn diagram is what I'm taking away of just what's important, what am I excited about?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:56:36):\nYeah, this for me. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:38):\nAwesome. Okay, so I note you got to run relatively soon, so we're going to get to our very exciting lightning round. But before we do that, is there anything else that you think would be interesting or useful for folks to know or leave them with? I know we covered a bunch of things already.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:56:52):\nYeah. One thing that actually I've now built it into a podcast, but something I'm really excited about is I don't think there's one way of building. Remember when the Steve Jobs biography came out, everybody read it. Oh, that's the way to build and that was unique to him. And one of the things I love a lot is when I look at great builders, they're all very distinct, they're all different. And I used to do this thing internally, I used to invite product builders of different disciplines and have a fireside chat with them. And I saw people across the company join not just PMs or designers, but folks across and I build that into a podcast.\n\n(00:57:34):\nI love your podcast. Mine is very different. It's more around what is their edge a little bit. This is from the co-founder of Pixar, Ed Catmull, to the CPO of Canva or Spotify, Roblox, but all the way to a chef, Dan Barber, who's the number one chef in the US for many years. And it's just everybody has their craft and they do it differently. It's called BuildingOne, I'm excited about it. It's a little bit of a plug right now, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:03):\nPlease. Yeah. Where do people find it? Let's blow it up. It's called BuildingOne?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:07):\nBuildingOne on Apple or Spotify.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:08):\nPerfect.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:11):\nIt's short and it's really about showing you different disciplines from a chef to an animation director. And really the main learning there is everybody builds differently and you can be very successful, but it's very authentic to how they are personally, and it's how they push their craft to the limit. It's how well they've done their craft.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:29):\nI love that. And something I super believe is just the power of focusing on your strengths and the things that make you a little different versus trying to become good at everything.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:37):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):\nThat's so cool. Okay, BuildOne. We'll link to it in the show notes.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:42):\nBuildingOne, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:43):\nBuildingOne. BuildingOne. Okay. Amazing. And it's on all the podcasting platforms. Okay, great. With that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:51):\nAll right. First question is, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nTomer Cohen (00:58:57):\nSo I have this [inaudible 00:58:58] continuously, actually it's these three.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):\nI love that you have them right there.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:59:02):\nI can just tell you about them but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:03):\nThey look very [inaudible 00:59:04] back there. Don't [inaudible 00:59:05]\n\nTomer Cohen (00:59:05):\nI'm not going to destroy my study. So I love fundamentals. I love studying from fundamentals. So if you're somebody who starts in your career, my fundamental books is One Mindset. It's about growth mindset. It's about basically the ability to continuously grow over time in one sentence is the whole idea is our skills, our abilities are malleable, we can completely develop them, we can build expertise and craft and mastery and it's really a mindset change. And Carol Dweck wrote the book, was also my wife's manager, and that's how we got into that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:05):\nThat's awesome.\n\nTomer Cohen (00:59:38):\nSo that's like our second religion at home. Second book is Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman. I love behavioral economics. When I think about products, I think I always start from people, what is the member expectation? What are they trying to do? And this is the Bible for behavior. So if you're building front end products or even you're thinking about how you rally organization, it's an incredible book. Every page is like a stopper. You have to stop and think. And then lastly, and on the fundamental side is High Output Management by Andy Grove. It's like there's so much basics to doing good manager. It's like I think after you read this book, your managerial skills should start from a B. and then you can over time become an A. But beginning to a B is just a level of putting the effort in and knowing the best practices. So I think those are all fundamentally great books that I really like to give to people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:41):\nThat's awesome. I love that they're right there behind you. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nTomer Cohen (01:00:47):\nYesterday I saw Bluey, you know Bluey?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:49):\nI've heard of Bluey. My kid is not old enough for it yet.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:00:52):\nOh, you're in for a treat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:53):\nOkay.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:00:54):\nI love Bluey. So Bluey is this animation series from Australia and what's beautiful about it's, I can watch it with my six-year-old, nine-year-old and 12-year-old, and we're all going to enjoy it. We're all going to laugh at the same point but at the nuance of the jokes. It's like when I think about a product, the way Bluey is built, it's built for the whole family, but it's built as layers. There's layers of dialogue and points that they're trying to get across, and it's all packaged together into one experience. So for me, it's amazing that I could sit next to my six-year-old daughter, we would both laugh at this, it's a sweet animation kind of thing, it's like a family of dogs. And she would laugh at the nuance of the point, at a different nuance. For me it's like that's a genius creation of how you build a product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:50):\nSpeaking of Ed Catmull, the Pixar does that really well as well.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:01:50):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:56):\nAnd I feel like the story of Bluey is really incredible too. It's just like a random little independent group and they just are making tons of money with it.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:02:02):\nIt's just amazing. The dialogue there is one, it's slightly edgy but not too edgy. It's exactly right. It's just exactly right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:10):\nOkay. Makes me want to watch it. Okay. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, whether it's physical or in digital?\n\nTomer Cohen (01:02:17):\nSo I like playing guitar. It's amateur, I'm not that good, but I love playing it. And there is a combination I've done recently I really like, there's a Spark Amp I have, which allows me to play with effects easily, but that's not what I use it for. I can tune my guitar based on the specific song I like. See, if I want to do Pink Floyd or Metallica or Nirvana or David Bowie, I can get that tune easily. I don't have to be an expert. I can just download the tune to my guitar, which is so great.\n\n(01:02:49):\nAnd then I couple that with the, it's called the Ultimate Guitar app, and basically it doesn't give me the chords and the tabs, it gives me the other instruments, so I can get the drums going. I can get the, it's a violin going, whatever that is that's going in the band. As somebody who does not play so well and plays for itself and nobody's supposed to listen to how I'm playing because it's really just a way for me to enjoy my time. It's just an amazing, I would never get into any band, so this is the closest I can get to get to a band. So I love that combination.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:22):\nI wish we could close this podcast episode with you playing your guitar, but [inaudible 01:03:26].\n\nTomer Cohen (01:03:26):\nI don't know if that will help the ratings of the show.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):\nNo, man, that's amazing. Okay, two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life, share with folks?\n\nTomer Cohen (01:03:38):\nFrom growth mindset there's a motto that I really like. It's called becoming is better than being. It's like the moment you think you achieved something is the moment you start to deteriorate down. It's like we're really trying to grow as human beings. We're trying to learn, we're trying to evolve. Product is a good example. I think the moment you think you actually mastered it is the moment that you become obsolete. So I love the idea that becoming is a better goal than continuously trying to reach some kind of level.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:06):\nLove that. Final question, just to come back to LinkedIn. Is there a fun feature of LinkedIn people don't know about or should check out? Is there anything new that's like, oh, that's something you should try or that's something that might surprise you about LinkedIn these days?\n\nTomer Cohen (01:04:19):\nMaybe I'll give a couple so I don't have to pick the best right off the bat. But one right now, we're heavily invested in video and it's doing so well for those creators. We talked about it like immersive video we can actually come in. We talked about for us, video is obviously a best practice right now in the industry, but on LinkedIn, the right views really matter. So highly encourage creators to think about their video play at LinkedIn. And then I think what we call our coach experience in some cases is so powerful. For job seekers out there, we have people hired on LinkedIn, there's like seven folks hired every minute. Job seeking is a lonely journey.\n\n(01:05:02):\nI was actually in a session recently meeting with job seekers and I was talking to them and one started crying midway into the session because they said, \"I cannot share my journey with anybody because I feel like I'm alone in this. People don't get how hard it is. I feel very accomplished, but I can't get the job. And I wish there was a buddy, I wish there was something that I could talk to brainstorm with who wouldn't judge me, who would just be trying to help me without paying hundreds of dollars to a coach of some sort. I don't have that money.\"\n\n(01:05:38):\nAnd in many ways, when we walked him through the job seeking experience, the coach experience, we build this coach aspect where you can go to any job and you can riff on the job with this really new realities LLM that is tailored to you, personalized to you, private to you, everything from your fit to how to best apply, to consulting about different opportunities, to comparing this to others, to feeling supported. So when we talk to people around, we always, I love to measure the impact of our work by emotion, when we talk to job seekers after that, it was basically the sense of I felt supported. In many ways, getting to that ability to remove the loneliness is amazing. It's a little bit like people need to, we're making it more and more visible and more and more ramped to everybody to a certain point. But that's a really powerful way to just humanize the job seeking experience for everybody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):\nAwesome. And to find that it's just, is it called LinkedIn Coach or?\n\nTomer Cohen (01:06:40):\nIt's in the job. So if you go to the job tab on LinkedIn, actually just a few weeks ago, we just put it on the top. So you don't have to go to the specific job and find it, you can just start there and engage with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:50):\nAwesome. Just to give a quick plug to a future podcast that's coming out, there's this book called Never Search Alone, that we're going to have the author on the podcast soon. And it's all about the same idea of having a buddy that helps you search for a job.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:01):\nYeah. When I think about the future of AI in the sense of belief, that relationship is going to be sacred, the relationship between AI and the human is going to be [inaudible 01:07:10]. Do you know what Nomophobia means?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:11):\nNomaphobia? No.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:14):\nNomophobia.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:15):\nNomophobia. No. Being afraid of something.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:18):\nIt's the anxiety of being away from your phone.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:18):\nI have that.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:25):\nI think we all. I think we're in for AI-nophobia at that point, where you're going to get to a point where AI is going to feel so intimate, so personal that it would actually feel concerning to you to be away from it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):\nOh man, there reminds me of Friend.com, which just launched in a really fun, I don't know if you saw Friend.com, their launch video.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:44):\nNo, I did not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):\nOh, man. Check out Friend.com. It's like a digital friend that just is with you all the time and you're talking to him and it's an AI.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:07:50):\nOh, we're just getting started. There's going to be, we're in for incredible revolution there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:55):\nI'm excited and scared at the same time. Tomer, thank you so much for being here. This was amazing. You're awesome. Two final questions. Where can folks check out stuff that you're working on? You have a course also, you have a podcast, so just give people a sense of where to find that.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:08:07):\nAwesome. So obviously I'm on LinkedIn, reach out anytime. I read everything people send to me. I don't always reply to everything, but I read everything sent to me. And then if you want to go deep on AI first, I have two courses, they're free. I think it's a phenomenal way for you to build or starting to build your expertise, especially if you're in product. It's a great way to go deeper and not just stay on the high level parts of things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:36):\nAmazing. We'll link to all those things in the show notes. Tomer, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTomer Cohen (01:08:40):\nLenny. Thank you. It's our pleasure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:42):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Why most public speaking advice is wrong—and how to finally overcome anxiety | Tristan de Montebello\n\n## Transcript\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:00:00):\nPeople tend to get into a public speaking voice. We'll be in a class and they'll be chatting normally and look super normal. And then we'll say, \"Okay, now just a timer, I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline,\" and I click play, and suddenly I say, \"The important part about doing this,\" and they enter into a different version of themselves, a professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversation. So the cue I often give people is-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nToday my guest is Tristan de Montebello. Tristan is the co-Creator of Ultraspeaking, which is the best public speaking workshop I have ever come across. In 2017, Tristan became the fastest competitor to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. And based on that experience, built a very unique course that helps you quickly build the skills to become better and to become more comfortable speaking in public, and especially speaking on the spot.\n\n(00:01:04):\nI'd like to spend time on this topic on this podcast because becoming a better speaker is such an accelerant of your professional life. And in this episode, we delve into a bunch of tactics and also misconceptions about how to become a better speaker, and to make it even more fun and interesting, we go through a few of the exercises that Tristan and his team have developed live on the podcast. He goes through them, I go through them, it was a lot of fun. I'm excited to hear what you think. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you, Tristan de Montebello.\n\n(00:01:45):\nTristan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:01:49):\nThanks so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:51):\nSo I took an abridged version of this speaking course that you teach called Ultraspeaking, and it immediately made me feel more comfortable public speaking, which I've never felt doing any other course. Public speaking is something it's just is very scary to me as it is for a lot of people, but it's just something I really dread. Even doing these podcast episodes, every time I get nervous before doing these things, as much as it may not seem that way. So this is not my natural habitat speaking, being in public. It may not seem that way to people, but it's true.\n\n(00:02:22):\nAnd the way you approach this stuff is so unique and worked for me. And because of that, I thought it'd be awesome to just bring you on this podcast and basically try to teach people the stuff that you've learned about how to become a better public speaker. I know we're not going to do your course here, but just, what are some very tactical things people can immediately start to apply? And also, I want to make the super interactive, so we're actually going to do some of the exercises that you use in your class. So that's what we're here for. How does that sound?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:02:54):\nThat sounds exciting. I'm in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:56):\nGreat.\n\n(00:02:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation, A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Experimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous, deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shave weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance, and out-of-the-box reporting that helps you avoid annoying prolonged analytic cycles.\n\n(00:03:52):\nEppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's geteppo.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:18):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Command AI. If you're like me and most users that I've built product for, you're probably used to chatbots at the bottom right of websites, where you ask a question and it says something like, \" Check out these three helpful articles. Did that answer your question?\" And then you click away and then a few seconds later you get bombarded with some other useless pop-ups. For those of us who work on software, no one wants their product to feel like this. Command AI is an AI power toolkit for support, product, growth and marketing teams that embeds in your company's product. The AI support agent can deflect upwards of 80% of support questions, providing actually useful answers, and it can magically co-browse with your users to show them around your interface. They do pop-ups too, but their nudges are based on in-product behaviors like confusion or intent classification, which makes them much less annoying and much more impactful.\n\n(00:05:11):\nCommand AI works with web apps, mobile apps and websites, and they work with industry-leading companies like Gusto, Freshworks, HashiCorp, LaunchDarkly, and over 25 million end users interact with Command AI interfaces. To try out Command AI. You can sign up at command.ai/lenny and experience a custom demo of how it works in your app. That's command.ai/lenny.\n\n(00:05:36):\nOkay, so let me first ask just kind of a broad question. What do most people get wrong about public speaking? What are some of, what's maybe the biggest misconception about how to become a better public speaker and how to be good at it?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:05:49):\nI actually think that the biggest misconception with tackling your speaking is that people grossly underestimate just how transformative it could be to your life. And the reason it's so transformative is because speaking is not a specialized skill, it's a meta skill. That means that the better you get at speaking, the better your life gets.\n\n(00:06:16):\nSo an example of a meta skill is fitness, for example. If you were to start saying, \"Okay, I'm going to transform my fitness,\" and you start lifting weights and you start going on runs, obviously your muscles are going to get bigger, you're going to get more in shape, and your cardiovascular system is going to improve. But that's actually only a sliver of the impact it's going to have on your life because you're going to start feeling more energy, and you're going to start having these nice hormones, these endorphins flowing through your body and you're going to feel better about yourself. And when you walk in front of the mirror, suddenly you're going to have a boost in confidence. So naturally, everything else in your life is going to start to improve as a result of you focusing on your fitness. And for speaking, it's the same thing.\n\n(00:07:01):\nThis blew my mind when I went on my own speaking journey, is when I started making breakthroughs in speaking, other things started to feel different. So as you get breakthroughs, how you feel at work feels different. How you feel in your group of friends feels different. How you feel in a group of strangers, especially, how you feel and your family can even be impacted. This seeps into everything else in your life. But the thing is, because there's so much self-consciousness that goes with speaking, we often feel kind of constraints under the layers of overthinking and anxiety that come with speaking. So it can be hard to realize that underneath these layers, you actually have this extraordinary superpower, because as humans we're evolved to speak, this is what we are. So you don't need to teach a baby how to speak, it will learn by itself with no formal education. So what that means is, we all have this incredible hardware.\n\n(00:08:12):\nThe thing is, over the course of our life, because of all these little situations that happen, we start getting bugs in the software and we're not really upgrading our software. The moment you get the bugs and things start working, not working, we start avoiding, and suddenly it's like we're not upgrading our software anymore. So we're stuck on old, buggy software. But the reality is, let's not forget that we have incredible software that were evolved for this. So all we need to do is some debugging and some upgrading of the software and suddenly your entire life can change. So that's really one I want to impart on anybody listening. You have it in, you already have what it takes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:56):\nOkay. So kind of building on what you just talked about, some of this insight of, your life can improve and how you kind of always have to unlearn stuff. One of my favorite maybe core insights and tenets of the way you approach teaching people to speak, is you talk about how if you don't enjoy speaking, you're doing it wrong. And that really helped me because you kind of encourage, you kind of remind people, try to have fun as you're doing. Can you just talk about that insight and why that's important and how that helps people become better?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:09:26):\nWell, I think that's very tied to what you were saying. I see enjoyment as a barometer, if I'm doing things right, I'm probably enjoying myself. If I'm doing things wrong, particularly with speaking, because again, this is something we're naturally evolved to do. So if we're naturally evolved to do it, it's not something that we dislike doing. It has to be something that rewards us. So as soon as things start not feeling enjoyable, it's a sign, hey, I'm probably doing this wrong, guy. There's something here that I'm doing that is making this unenjoyable that's probably not helping me.\n\n(00:10:03):\nAnd I think you mentioned that in those people who can hold an audience who are really good communicators in business, it looks like they feel very comfortable, it looks like they feel like themselves. And if you think about speaking, when you're talking with your kids, or with your partner, or with your best friend, your childhood friend, your parents, ever, we all have environments where we feel completely like ourselves. And when we do, communication is extraordinarily enjoyable. It's just a means to connect with other people, a means to share what we have on our mind and it's very, very empowering and it feels very good.\n\n(00:10:42):\nThen I take the same person with the same skill set and the same ability and I bring them in a business setting, and suddenly I don't feel like myself anymore. And because of the pressure, I start trying to speak differently. So people start having, I'm going to try to think really hard of what I need to say and I want to control the words that are going to come out of my mouth before they come out of my mouth so I make sure I don't make a mistake. And you basically loop in this thing that is so counter what communication is, which is just a natural subconscious scale. So using speaking as a barometer of, hey, if this is not feeling good, I'm probably overthinking. I probably need to relax and try to just feel a little bit more like myself.\n\n(00:11:27):\nBut this also applies to practice, where in your practice, because this is not an overnight thing, you can't just snap your fingers, read a book, and be a better speaker. Well, your practice has to be enjoyable as well because otherwise two weeks in, you're going to quit just like a shitty fitness journey or diet. Right? You have to find joy in it and it has to be structured in a way where it rewards you as well, so that you get more energy and you get more enjoyment while you do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:58):\nAwesome, and we're going to show people how you do that. You do these games, they're games that you play that help you actually learn these skills. So before that, and also I want to get into actual tactics that we can just give people to become better public speakers. But right before we get there, are there any other core insights or principles or lessons that are fundamental to the way you found that it works to become a better public speaker, that kind of inform a lot of the stuff we're going to be talking about?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:12:25):\nThe day I understood that speaking was a subconscious flow-oriented process and not a conscious process, completely changed the way I approached it. So instead of thinking tactics and frameworks and adding more to the outside of the things I need to think about, when I realized when I speak best, I'm actually not thinking about speaking. It's the last thing I think about is the speaking part. I'm completely in tune with whatever it is I'm trying to convey to my audience or the person in front of me. And the goal is to get into a flow state and stay in that flow state all the way through the finish line. That's what really, really changed my mindset about speaking, because then it changes all of the exercise, the exercises you want to do. It changes how you can think about speaking.\n\n(00:13:24):\nAnd one of the ways that changed how I practiced was, instead of focusing on the symptoms of speaking, I started to try and figure out, well, what are the root causes that create these symptoms, and can I address those? So instead of counting my filler words, if that's something that's annoying to me, I'm going to go back and try to figure out, well, what's the root cause of that? Well, the root cause of having lots of filler words or racing in your speaking, is that you probably struggle to feel comfortable slowing down, relaxing, or even pausing when your mind is racing and you feel pressure. Solve that, and not only do the filler words take care of themselves, but the racing takes care of itself and you suddenly have more mind space.\n\n(00:14:11):\nAnd if you feel super constrained in your speaking, very monotonous, then maybe you feel boxed in and you're struggling to allow yourself to feel to be all of what you are under pressure because there's probably a lack of certainty. A lack of trust in, hey, if I let myself be more intense or if I let some of these emotions pop out, or if I take a time to gather my thoughts, is everything going to unravel, or is that going to work for me? And if you haven't proven that to yourself, then you're just going to go for safety and so you're going to be very monotonous and constrained, and that's creates monotony. But if I can solve that, suddenly I have freedom. So thinking through this and understanding that the goal here is upgrading the software and it's really layering, taking all the bad habits away and putting in new habits that I can just stay in this flow state without getting pulled out, that really changes the game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:15):\nThat is a really interesting insight, and I love that you actually demoed that in the way you answered this question, where you took time to get into that state and not just get, um... It's just like, pause.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:15:28):\nPause.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):\nYeah, that was a really beautiful example of that. Okay, let's get into a few tactics just to give people something they can-\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:15:29):\nSure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:34):\n... actually change about the way they speak this week. What are two or three things that you can recommend people tweak in the way that they do public speaking, in the way they speak in meetings and presentations, whatever?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:15:47):\nI actually thought about this because once you think about speaking being much more about the root causes, like play the games that are going to change you at the root, don't focus on the symptoms, then you find yourself sharing much less purely tactical advice and frameworks because we're trying to get out of our brain into our subconscious.\n\n(00:16:10):\nSo when I thought about it, I thought of three things I wanted to share. One makes you sound better or look better, one makes you sound better, and one makes you feel better. So the first makes you look better. Now this is super basic and very crunchy, but it's a bad habit that a lot of people have. That when I am trying to gather my thoughts or think, people tend to look down. And if you're looking down on Zoom, it's three times as bad because it looks like you're looking at your phone or looking at notes if you had any, but even when you're in person, it doesn't look very confident. And so you're suddenly giving off of that vibe of, oh, this person feels a little bit uncertain here, and maybe it's going to look like you stopped speaking and you might get more interrupted.\n\n(00:16:56):\nIf instead you switch that up and you start thinking up. I think up into the right, but you can think in any direction you want, but as long as you're looking up, you actually look thoughtful by default. So suddenly you're looking thoughtful. That means you look more confident because anybody who'd be willing to pause in their speaking is somebody who's confident. And as a result, you're much less likely to get interrupted. So it's a small tweak but makes a real difference.\n\n(00:17:24):\nThe only thing is if you're not used to doing this, if this is not your habit, then it's going to feel a little bit awkward the first time you do it and you probably won't think about doing it. So I recommend writing, think up, on a post-it and putting it on your computer so that it's there for you. And then once you've done it a few times, this will become the new normal and by default, you'll look more confident.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):\nI'm going to do this as we talk. I have a poster right here. Think up.,\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:17:48):\nOh, nice. Think up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):\nOkay, great. What else?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:17:53):\nLook more confident. Now how to sound more confident. This is a really important one, and this concept is called end strong. And it's, we had to bring this up because most people tend to end weak. And why is that? They put freestyle rappers in an fMRI, and what they found out is freestyle rappers have to enter a deep flow state. If you're freestyle rapping, you have a beat, you don't have any lyrics, and you have to get into the beat and invent the lyrics and the melody and everything on the fly. So there's no choice but being completely present. What happens is you can see their brain and it's lit up in a very specific place that shows that they're in flow, and when they get to the very end, the brain just blows up. Before they finish, they start getting pulled out of flow. And this is the same feeling of you're running at school and you see the finish line and just a few yards before you start slowing down. It's just, I don't know, we're built that way.\n\n(00:18:53):\nAnd in speaking, it's the same thing. People tend to give a great answer and then either they kind of taper off at the end, which doesn't leave you with a good impression, or they'll actively say the doubts that are coming up in their mind of maybe they'll be giving a great answer and then suddenly they say, \"I don't really know if that makes sense.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):\nI do that all the time. That's very relatable.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:19:13):\nYeah, but what the thing is, what happens when you do that? When you do that, it's like you're forcing this lens on your audience, where now even if they had the best of experiences with your answer, now they're looking at everything you said through the lens of, oh, this person was kind of uncertain. So it's like you had a very smooth flight across the Atlantic and your landing was absolutely horrible. You were bumpy when you were coming up, and then when you hit the landing, you bounced three times and you thought you were going to die. You're not going to remember the smooth flight, you're going to remember the ending. So a simple tactic here is, anticipate that as you get to the end of anything you're saying, you're going to naturally start regaining consciousness and you're going to start being a little bit more self-aware, and some of those uncertainties are going to pop up. Know that it's coming and make sure you land the plane.\n\n(00:20:14):\nSo what that looks like is, either you just make your ending sound like an ending and then leave it at that, or you can prompt your brain. You can use summary prompts, this is incredibly powerful. It just means you say the beginning of a sentence or the beginning of, yeah, the beginning of a sentence, and your brain's going to fill in the gap. It's going to. You're prompting your brain and your brain will always deliver. So you get to the end, you're like, okay, I got to wrap up now. And so you'll say, \"So to wrap up...\" And your brain's going to fill in the gap. Or, \"In summary, so my point here is, so what I want you to remember,\" and you just place those words and your brain's naturally going to do the work of closing it for you. But make sure you don't let go of the gas pedal at the very last moment, you need to land that plane.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:01):\nAwesome. I could definitely get better at this, great tip.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:21:04):\nYeah, thanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:06):\nI'm going to try to do that as we talk.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:21:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:07):\nAnd what else we got?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:21:09):\nI'll be paying attention to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:11):\nOkay, pressure.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:21:15):\nYeah. The third one is staying in character. And these go hand in hand. And what's really powerful is when you start doing these, there's a beautiful feedback loop that happens that gives you a lot of confidence. So staying in character I said is the one that's going to make you feel more confident.\n\n(00:21:33):\nWhat's staying in character? So it's related to end strong in some sense, in that people tend to self-sabotage a lot. I'm speaking, and obviously as I'm speaking, all of my senses are really, really heightened. So I'm aware of everything, if a word comes out a little bit weird or if it's not the word that I was expecting to hear come out of my mouth, I'm going to be very aware of that because I was expecting something and something different happens. But that happens all the time when speaking. I'm starting to not make as much sense or I feel like I'm rambling, going a little bit too long. All of these create insane noise in the back of my mind, the insecurities. And you have a choice there, because I can tell you right now, nobody can tell. People cannot see what you feel, even though it feels that way when you feel really, really strongly, but people can't see it. You're just looking like a normal speaker, competent and confident. But internally, it feels like everybody can see.\n\n(00:22:34):\nSo you're feeling all this insecurity and it feels like there's an elephant in the room. And so what most people do is they start leaking and they break character. And they'll say, \"Oh, man, I'm not making sense right now,\" or they'll laugh nervously after saying a word that came out weird, which is kind of saying like, \"Oh, I also noticed that this word came out weird and it's okay.\" Right? Or they'll keep letting all of the insecurities and doubts come out when people didn't see it in the first place. So again, it's like I'm forcing these filters onto my audience and now they can only see me through that light.\n\n(00:23:15):\nAnd so one analogy I love for this is, again, a flying analogy. You're on the plane, everything's smooth, you're having a great time watching your movie, and suddenly you're interrupted by the pilot who picks up the intercom and says, \"Oh, ladies and gentlemen, so I just had a red light start blinking here in the cockpit, and I'm not sure what this is. It could be really bad, honestly, but I don't know. So don't worry, please, I'll get back to you soon.\" First thing that's going to happen if you experience that is you're going to think, I wasn't worrying in the first place. But then you start thinking, wait, something probably is going wrong. And now the smallest noise, the tiny little bit of turbulence, a creak on the right, you're going to start thinking, oh no, we're going to die, every time.\n\n(00:24:03):\nSo you're going to make any little mistake, any little imperfection, you're going to turn that into something big. That's what happens when you speak. If you start leaking and letting the insecurities come out, people are going to start thinking, this person doesn't really know what they're talking about. It's like a leader who isn't clear in their direction. Suddenly I'm thinking, wait, I think I have to second guess everything here because I'm not sure about this guy or this person.\n\n(00:24:33):\nAnd the good news is, the solution is very, very simple. The solution is that is just, don't share your insecurities. Put your best foot forward and stay in it the whole time. Stay in character from beginning all the way through past the ending, because you go all the way through your speech, then you got to end strong, which is a form of staying in character, and then let it be. And that's so important, just let it be and you're going to notice something incredible. If you're the type of person who would break character a lot, start staying in character, and the cue use for myself is, stay in it. And the worse it gets, the more I'll say, just stay in it. And what happens is, you stay in it.\n\n(00:25:21):\nAnd you expect everybody at the end to say, \"Oh my God, you looked so uncomfortable, what was happening?\" But people can't see that, that you look confident. So they're just going to give you the reaction that a confident person would get, and you're going to notice, oh wow, I am coming off as confident, and that's going to make you feel more confident. And so it's a very reinforcing cycle. If you start staying in character and ending strong, naturally, you're going to be reinforced by this behavior and you're going to realize, oh, I didn't need to break character. I didn't need to hedge every time I spoke, and that's going to give you much more confident, and you're going to start realizing, people just look confident by default. This is a crazy thing. I want everybody to walk around the world and look at people and think, most of the people I'm looking at are actually nervous right now. You're going to look at them and you're like, I can't tell. Most people speaking up in meetings are feeling a level of nervousness, but you can't tell unless it's through the roof.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:23):\nI love this, and it's something I'm extremely guilty of. And I think the reason I do this and the reason I think a lot of people leak, which I love that term of just I don't leak, that you know, feel something's not going right. The reason I do it is I feel like me being upfront, I know this isn't great-\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:26:41):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:41):\n... makes it okay, but in reality, that's hurting you because it's like when I watch standup comedy. When the comedian's like, \"Oh, sorry, that bombed,\" if he didn't say that or she didn't say that, I'd just forget about it, and we'd move on to the next thing. And it brings all this attention to, oh, I see, okay, it's not going great. Otherwise, you're just like, all right, whatever, I didn't like that joke. And so, yeah, I guess any thoughts on just that, why people do this?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:27:07):\nWell, I think that's exactly that. It's because you're convinced that everybody can tell. And so two things will happen. Either they could tell because it was a big thing and everybody could tell, but you shining light on it is literally that. It's like, hey, everybody, you're driving a train, everybody's in the train, you're the driver as the speaker, everybody's going with you. So if there's a crash on the side of the road, you can keep going and they'll not be looking at the crash a second later and they'll be looking at the next landscape, or you can stop the train and tell everybody, \"Hey, let's look at this crash here real quick. I'm so sorry about it.\" When you keep going, people will forget it in a second and they're not going to pay attention to you. And with the peak end rule, what we we're seeing, people remember the end of experiences more than they remember the beginning of experiences. So you're going to be left with that feeling at the end.\n\n(00:27:58):\nThe other piece is, because most people won't notice it in the first place, they'll be in their own minds. So when you share this, you're popping their bubble. And so I see people speaking all the time where I'm super in tune with the feeling I'm getting when they're speaking. I'm listening to the energy, I'm listening to everything that's happening, so I can try to understand, what state are they in right now? So when I get woken up from that state of somebody saying, \"Oh man, can I go again right now? That really sucked.\" It's even more visible for me.\n\n(00:28:36):\nAnd I'll often have to say, \"Hey, man, I was so into what you were saying,\" and I'll poll the audience, \"is anyone surprised?\" And everybody every time is like, \"No, I thought that you were doing great. I was completely with you.\" So that's the case most of the time, but because we're convinced that people can tell, we want to break that fourth wall or because something happened and we know people can tell, we want to acknowledge it so it doesn't feel like I'm the only one in the room who can't tell that something went wrong here. But this habit of saying, \"No, I'm going to be confident, I'm leading, I'm going to keep us going in a certain direction,\" is extremely powerful and very self-reinforcing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:18):\nOkay, so let's actually show people what this looks like by actually doing some live games. I know one of your principles for Ultraspeaking is you can't learn to speak by not speaking. You need to practice speaking to get better at speaking, and these games are a way to actually do that in a really fun way. So maybe first of all, just why games? When I did this course, I was just like, huh, because it's a bunch of games. I thought this was a public speaking course. So maybe talk about just why you approach it through games, everything you do is a game in this course.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:29:48):\nYeah. Well, the first piece of the puzzle is what you were saying, that you can't get better at speaking without speaking. And it's, intuitively you could think, everybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read 100-\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:30:00):\nEverybody knows that if you want to become a great cook, you can't just read a hundred cookbooks. You actually have to spend most of your time in the kitchen refining your intuition, testing things, experimenting, learning new recipes, and building your timing and everything that goes with it. But in speaking, we tend to do the opposite, probably because it's a little bit scary and because there aren't that many options out there to practice the speaking itself. There aren't that many environments where you can do it right now. So we're kind of left with nothing, so, \"Okay, I'll just go read an article or watch a YouTube short and hope that's going to make a difference.\"\n\n(00:30:38):\nBut maybe the bad news is, you have to do it. You have to ask yourself, \"Am I going to be serious about taking on speaking and making a difference here?\" And if you are, then you're going to have to do the thing. You have to practice speaking. But the good news is, it's only the outside that's scary. As soon as you get started, you're going to get rewarded. And then, the better you get at it, the more enjoyable it becomes.\n\n(00:31:03):\nSo why games then? Well, games number one, are fun to play. And as I was saying earlier, if your practice is not fun, you're going to stop. So you need intrinsic reward with what you're doing. But what all of the Ultraspeaking games have in common is that it's short, deliberate practice, short reps followed by feedback, followed by another rep. So that was more important than the idea that it was a game at first.\n\n(00:31:35):\nWhen we started coaching with Michael Gendler, my co-founder, it was just him and me in my backyard with somebody in front of us testing things out. And we would say, we would give him a speech title just to get a baseline. \"Okay, what's the most incredible invention in the world?\" And we'd watch this person go into their mind and start freaking out. And they'd think, \" The iPhone,\" and then, \"I don't know the iPhone. That's pretty recent. So maybe it's fire. Is it fire though? Was there a bigger maybe communication? I don't know. Wait. Maybe we've evolved for communication.\"\n\n(00:32:08):\nAnd the longer they spent thinking, the worse their answer tended to be, and the more their confidence tended to go down as they were speaking. So then we said, \"Well, we've got to get this person speaking right away.\" So we'd say, \"I'm going to ask you another question, but just start speaking.\" And so, I'd ask them another question and they couldn't start speaking right away.\n\n(00:32:27):\nSo we just tried to compress it more and more and more to turn it into something where then it was like, \"I'm just going to say a word and you have to say something about it, so horses.\" \"Horseback riding is fun because you can go places.\" \"Cats.\" \"Cats are crazy because if they were bigger, they would eat you.\" And I just, almost like word association. Let's get words out.\n\n(00:32:46):\nThen we started developing different games for everything. Every root cause we were seeing, every symptom we were seeing, we'd figure out the root cause and we'd create some sort of a way to get the person into it as quickly as possible. And it's just one day, six months in that we realized, \"Hey, did we just create a game? This feels like a board game.\" And then we created, I have this, we created Speak Before You Think, the game for people who think too much, and this is a bunch of cards with all of our games. And then, Covid hit and we turned it into online games.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:21):\nOh, I didn't know that.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:33:23):\nYeah. The magic of games is short reps, immediate feedback, practice feedback, practice feedback. And it's enjoyable, you get rewarded, you get to adjust as you go. And what's changing is your internal feeling as you're going. So you're learning lessons, but you're internalizing. All of the practice is happening through speaking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:48):\nTo reinforce what you just shared, I haven't shared this with you, but after I took the course, the mini course, I went to see my family in L.A. We visited for a few days, and I was talking about this course and just how fun it was and interesting and how much I learned from it. And I pulled up the games because I have access to the things online. I was just like, \"Hey, you guys want to try this?\" and we started playing some of these games that we're about to get into. And it was just, we spent like an hour just doing this and everyone loved it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:34:15):\nWow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:15):\nEveryone just felt so much better about their public speaking. Afterwards, my mom was like, \"Hey, how do I do that on my own later?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:22):\nWow, that's cool.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:34:23):\nMy sister's like, \"I want to start doing open mic nights because that was really fun just to talk.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:27):\nNice.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:34:28):\nSo were you actually coaching them? How were you walking them through the different games?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:34):\nWe just pulled them up and played them. And then, I shared some of the tips that I learned in the class that we took, just like, \"Try it this way\" or \"Try not to focus on being correct. Just focus on confidence and not leaking that you're not doing great.\" All these things we're going to talk about. Yeah. So it was a lot of fun. So let's get into some of these games. So we're going to try two or three. Which one do you want to start with?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:34:56):\nConductor maybe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):\nSweet. I love Conductor. That one was really insightful to me.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:35:00):\nOkay, so I've got Conductor. The way this game works is that when I click \"start training,\" I'm going to have a random title that's going to appear. And for those of you who are just listening and not watching this, Lenny will say the title out loud so you can hear. And then, what you won't see or what you'll see if you're watching is in front of me, all I'm going to see are a series of random numbers. It's going to start with five, and five is just my natural rate of speaking like I'm speaking right now. But then, I might see a number from one to 10, and each one of these numbers represents an intensity or a state that I have to tap into. So if I see a seven, I automatically have to raise my voice and get into that kind of an energy. And if I see a 10, you could only imagine what that is. But it's also true for the lower ones. If suddenly I see a three, I have to find a way to calm my energy and match the three and go all the way down to one.\n\n(00:36:00):\nAnd then, there might be a slide that says \"breathe,\" which is just an indication to pause. And when I see that slide \"breathe,\" if I just go silent, that's because I'm in front of the breathe slide and I'm not allowed to speak. And in that moment, my goal is just to relax myself and calm myself and then see what happens where I'm at when that slide moves on to the next one. And now we're going to do this. This is going to be 70 seconds, so it's going to be super quick. Ready?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:28):\nYeah. So I'll read the title as soon as it pops up.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:36:31):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:33):\n\"When I grow up.\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:36:36):\nWhen I grow up, I want to have taken on all of my weaknesses or all of the emotional things that are holding me back. Because kind of annoying for me that I'm 40 years old and there's still things that are holding me back that man, I've had these when I was a kid. I was like this when I was 10. And it drives me crazy, because aren't I supposed to be an adult? Aren't I supposed to be mature and have my life together? I have two kids. I have this incredible responsibility. And I have to teach them, I have to show them the way. So I've decided I'm going to hire a coach, and I talked to him just a couple of days ago, so this is perfect timing because I want to unwrap, unravel, and untwine every single one of these emotional blockers so that when I grow up, I'm completely free.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:45):\nThat was so fun to watch. I'm seeing the numbers. If you're on YouTube, you can see what's going on there. If you're not, basically there's different numbers that give Tristan the different energies to be at, and that was masterful.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:37:56):\nI think we saw, what did we see? We saw a six. It went up first, six, seven, then it went down to three. Then we saw, I think a two, a one, then a breathe, and then it went back to a five. How about you give it a go and then we chat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):\nLet's do it. What do you think?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:38:11):\nLadies and gentlemen, let's see this. Here we go. The title is The Greatest Puzzle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:19):\nThe greatest puzzle that I think that I've had in my life, and I think just for most people, is trying to figure out what to do with their life. And I just had to spend so much time thinking... Actually, no, let me change. I'm changing direction. I actually have known from very early on what I wanted to do with my life. I've actually found it to be not much of a puzzle. I knew from pretty early that I wanted to be a software engineer. And interestingly, I became a software. And as I think about the puzzle that created around my life, I ended up... So my life actually started to look like a puzzle instead of what I'd always thought I'd be. So I ended up having a bunch of different careers. And I look back at my life and it started with one piece, and each piece led to all these other careers. Nailed it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:39:33):\nIt's funny. At the end you were like, you didn't even see there was a six that came up and then when you looked up, it had already gone away. That's a good warm-up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:42):\nYeah, yeah. Let's do it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:39:42):\nIt's funny, because what it looked like to me is that, well, you just didn't let yourself play the game. You wanted to... You were more focused on, \"I want to make sure this works well, this looks good, or I don't make a fool of myself\" than \"Let me just play the game.\" So switch your mindset from that. Back in the Creator Cohort, you didn't really care, because if you failed, it didn't matter. So you just played the game. And this is the same idea. Just don't try. Just let yourself play the game.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:43):\nOkay.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:40:15):\nThe game will do good. But that was actually really interesting. I feel kind of similar, which is cool, except I didn't know where it was going. But that feeling of all of these puzzle pieces, and suddenly when I hit Ultraspeaking, it's like, \"Oh wow, every single... There's no more. There are no more gaps.\" That's really cool. Okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:35):\nHere we go.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:40:36):\nYou ready?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:37):\nReady.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:40:38):\nHere we go. \"Integrating new cultures.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:48):\nIt's interesting having a kid. So we just had a kid about a year ago, he is a year and a half. And there's an interesting new experience where there's my family and their culture, there's my wife and her culture. And it was never a big deal for us, these different backgrounds that we have because we could do our own thing, we have our families, they're doing their thing. But now that we have a kid, I have to really think about this. I have to constantly wonder, \"Is he getting both experiences? Is he being pushed in one direction or another? Is he going to get the full benefits of both of these cultures?\" And I find if I don't actually think about it too deeply and just let him have fun and hang out with our different family members, he gets everything that I want him to get; that he experiences my wife's family's culture, my family's culture, and then the combination of my wife and I's new kind of culture and family that we're building. And so, I'm really excited about the future for us all.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:41:57):\nYeah, that was awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:00):\nI'm practicing not leaking. All I think about is how much better it could have been, but now I'm leaking as I say that. See?\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:42:01):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:01):\nIt's hard.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:42:10):\nYeah. You're hedging.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:10):\nHedging.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:42:13):\nSo the point of all of these games is to create turbulence. This is going to be the theme of this podcast. I'm going to share only flight analogies. But if you think about a pilot, a flight simulator, you can think about these games as the flight simulator. You don't put a pilot in a flight simulator and waste those precious hours having them just cruise at 30,000 feet in clear skies. You're going to say, \"Okay, you're going and now hey, you've lost your captain and you have to do something\" or \"Hey, your motor just broke\" or \"You're going into crazy turbulence.\"\n\n(00:42:46):\nSo the gain here is always, every one of these games have in common that we're creating turbulence for you. So it's on purpose that like, \"Ooh, that's interesting how I tend to want to leak, to want to break character. Wow. It's interesting how at the end, the ending strong is not just an automatic habit that I've built for myself.\" So what we want with the turbulence is that it highlights areas that we want to work on. And you can go again and see immediately because you have that same pressure every time. There's no way you can prepare for Conductor. You can do just a ton of reps and get to become the person who can just navigate the turbulence really, really gracefully.\n\n(00:43:29):\nWhich reminds me of a Kevin Kelly quote that I love where he says, \"Pros are just amateurs who've learned to recover gracefully from their mistakes.\" And this is what we're trying to do here. If you know that you can recover from any mistake gracefully, then you're going to have confidence in any speaking scenario. And most of the scenarios you're going to be in are spontaneous, are ones you can't prepare for. So it's that much more important.\n\n(00:43:57):\nSo tell me, what do you remember from going through Conductor and the Creator Cohort, or specifically here, what was coming up and what were some of the things that pop into your mind?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):\nThere's two things that I really took away from it, and it's different doing it now on camera with this whole podcast thing.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:44:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:16):\nBut the things that I really took away that have stuck with me from this exercise is one, is that you have this kind of metaphor of these file folders that you have kind of in your head where every energy level, like a one when you go low and a 10 or even a five, when you're at that energy level, you access different insights and memories and stories. So it's not just like, \"Now I'm going to say the same thing at a 10, or I'm going to say the same thing at a one.\" It's when you let your body just slow down and relax to a one, new thoughts come up, because making it up as you go along and you're just trying to figure it out as you go. And that really happens when you're forced to go from five to, \"Okay,\" and you let your body settle into a one. You're like, \"Oh, okay, here's a new thought that comes to mind.\" So that was really powerful for me because I never had realized that.\n\n(00:45:12):\nAnd then, the other is just this idea of doing these really hard things with very low stakes. It's higher stakes, so maybe that's why it's different, how it feels different doing it here where it's like, \"Oh, this is-\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:45:22):\nYeah. Yeah, this is extremely high stakes for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:26):\nYeah, relatively. But yeah, there it's a couple people and you're like, just don't worry about failing so you don't even have to worry about apologizing or fleaking. It's just like, \"Yeah, I did what I did.\" So those are two really powerful ones. I just like practicing this. And knowing you'll be okay at low stakes builds confidence. I'm like, \"Okay.\" It's making up a minute of talk about the most random thing on the spot, not something that I would feel I'd want to do, but then you realize, \"Okay, it's fine. I can do that.\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:45:54):\nThe common theme for me, and I've been on this journey for seven years now, I still am blown away every week by the lessons I've learned over the course of the seven years, which all come down to your brain, your subconscious is so incredibly powerful. So your hardware is magical. And because I've spent seven years kind of getting rid of the bad habits, getting rid of the gunk and trusting myself more, I allow myself to take many more risks. So I'm jumping into these games still with the same doubts in some sense, but they've just, everything's tapered down way, way, way into the background. So I get to be much more present.\n\n(00:46:43):\nAnd I talked about the summary prompts earlier in the podcast, saying the beginning of a sentence and trusting that your brain's going to fill in the gap is something that's initially hard to do. But when you've done it 1,000, 2,000, 10,000 times, you start believing, \"Hey, maybe my brain will deliver every single time.\" So you can start saying the beginning of sentences the direction you want to go into and your brain fills in the gap, and we're going to do a game on that in a second.\n\n(00:47:12):\nBut the Conductor one is so beautiful because the way we describe it, so that folder one when it came into my mind was my favorite ever. But the original one was when you tap into a certain energy, that creates emotion. And if you tap into that emotion, the words come as a natural consequence. So it's energy leads, emotions follow, and words fill in the gap.\n\n(00:47:44):\nAnd when you experience this for yourself, if you go into Conductor and you play, you realize, \"Okay, if I want more conviction, I can raise my energy or get into a state of conviction and the words that are going to come out, the ideas, the stories, the anecdotes, the examples, everything is going to fit into that. If I feel frustrated, I can dive into that state and stay in that state, and naturally the content is going to follow. It's a very, very powerful game. It's a very exciting game, and it's a game that, especially when you're playing with low stakes, you very quickly feel the effect of, \"Oh, I can see the potential of what it could be if I could just be like this anywhere.\" Maybe you taper out a little bit of the extremes.\n\n(00:48:42):\nBut you can access this for free on Ultraspeaking or the way we did this at first, you just go to Google and type in a random series of nine numbers and then just have a friend say each number, one after the next, and you just match it. I used to just put my hand out and go up and down. So in essence, it's very, very simple to apply it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:03):\nAnd it's just like a lot of fun to just get an excuse to just go wild and high and then just get low. I love that part of it. And let's get into the next theme. But just one other insight I had that you shared with me when I did it the first time is just people have a strength.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:49:16):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:16):\nThey're either, correct me if I'm wrong, they're strong at the highs and just very uncomfortable at the lows or the opposite. And for me, I thought I was going to, \"Oh, obviously I'll be more natural at the lows, because like introvert world.\" And you're like, \"No, you're actually super energized at this high end, and then it's hard for you to access the low.\" And I thought that was really insightful for me.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:49:39):\nYeah. You'll notice it pretty quickly once you jump in, especially with a friend. It's cool because when you get to see, \"Oh, I'm much more comfortable going up than I am going down or vice versa, or I'm stuck in the middle and I am only comfortable when I'm not in the extremes.\" It's just telling you something.\n\n(00:49:59):\nThis is what we want. We want to a mirror in front of us so I can know, \"Okay, what's happening here?\" I'm not very much a fan of actually watching yourself on camera on video, because again, this is an inner game, not an outer game. So when I watch myself on video, I see the outside, which can be useful for certain things, but the fundamentals are inside. So getting a mirror of I play this game and I feel a certain way, \"Oh, interesting. It was easy to go up.\" So I can muster energy pretty quickly, and I'm willing to take risks of jumping into a different energy stage, which might mean changing the direction of where I'm going.\n\n(00:50:37):\nBut slowing down means I need to be willing to take up space. I need to be willing to just be while everybody's looking at me and I'm using up their time. But I'm going to take up space and I'm going to take a moment to go inside and be introspective and really ask myself, \"Okay, what do I want to say here?\" And so, that's a reflection of, \"Well, what does that mean if I struggle to do that?\" And that's why speaking such an interesting skill set.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:08):\nAll right, let's do another game.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:51:10):\nThis next game is called Triple Step. And Triple step is a game for people who struggle to stay on a single thought or get very easily put off their game or distracted. If you're the type of person where you're speaking and suddenly somebody yawns and you just start freaking out thinking, \"I'm so boring and things are horrible, I must be terrible.\" Not, they probably have a baby and they didn't sleep last night. A pen drops and you start losing your ability to stay on track, this is a game for you. Also, a very fun one.\n\n(00:51:46):\nThe principle of the game is pretty simple. Similarly to Conductor, we're going to start with a random speech title. So I have no idea what's going to show up. Then as I'm speaking, in this setting here, I'm going to speak for a minute. There will six random words or series of words that are going to pop up as I'm going through my speech. And my goal is to integrate the words into the speech as seamlessly as I can, as if they were part of the speech the whole time. So in theory, if I do a perfect job, if you're listening, you should struggle to pick out which words were actually the words that were popped up. The likelihood in one minute of me being able to do that is low, but let's see if you can do it. So if you're listening, you're not going to see the words. We'll tell you afterwards what they were. See if you can pick up on them. But otherwise, my goal is just to choose a strong direction and stay on that direction as naturally as I can.\n\n(00:52:43):\nHere we go. The title is, How Would Your Friends Describe You? I've been described as a Labrador by my friends. And I think the reason people describe me as a Labrador is because I am so easy to excite. It's like if you give me a box of french fries, I'm going to go nuts and it's going to be the best french fries I've ever tasted in my life. But if the next day I get a massage, I'll be completely in that experience and the massage is going to be the best massage. And then, I'm going to think, \"I need to get a massage every day.\" I'm going to start daydreaming about massage as my natural day to day.\n\n(00:53:19):\nBut the problem with being a Labrador is that Labradors get kind of excited. So I may be doing cartwheels one second, and the next second I'm supposed to be working. And so, I'll be on my computer, but then I hear the microwave ding and I think, \"Oh, maybe I should go get some food next.\" And so, there's a beautiful trait to being the Labrador that allows me to explore all of what it's like to be human. I always have access to the internet inside me, but there are definitely some drawbacks as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:50):\nOkay. So the words that you had to integrate are french fries, getting a massage, daydreaming, cartwheels, a microwave, and the internet.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:54:05):\nYeah. And so, you might notice that some of the words I'm integrating literally, and some I might integrate more metaphorically like the internet of my mind. It's like I have access to the internet. So you can give yourself as much leeway as possible. The whole point here with Triple Step is you want to be that tree in the storm that is not so rigid that if the wind is too strong it's going to break in half, but not so flexible that it's going to swing every which direction as soon as there's a gust. So you want that firm solid grounding, which is in choosing a clear direction, that one thing off the bat, and then you want to make the words work for you. So stay focused on that one thing. And as the words come in, the more focused you are on that groove you've created for yourself, the easier it will be to let the words work for you. Okay?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:03):\nAnd again, the skill this builds is to be more comfortable with things not going perfectly and being distracted.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:55:12):\nYeah. I would say this one can be used for two other things. Number one is resiliency, right? Because this one will make your brain go crazy. And if you can stay composed within it, with all of these things happening, it really builds this ability to say, \"Well, man, if I can do Triple Step on hard mode, I can do anything. Why would anything else scary? Why would an interview question scare me when I can throw these kinds of things? I can always navigate my way through.\" Right? We're trying to lower the likelihood of a mistake really hurting you.\n\n(00:55:48):\nAnd then, the other piece is this is a game, this one and a game called Rapid Fire Analogies, are games that are really, really nice to use as a way to warm your brain up. So you could use it before a podcast. You could use it before a job interview, before a meeting. When you want to be on, do a few reps of this, and your brain's just going to be completely lit up because it's pulling on so many different parts of your brain that are necessary for communication.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:13):\nOne last thought just before we dive into it. I think it's just to zoom out again, the reason that you've found this is a better way to learn to become better at public speaking, my sense is just if you were to just do the standard thing of just give more talks, find more opportunities to do presentations, it's too broad of a brush to build these different skills, and which you've identified is there's these very specific skills that add up to a great presenter. And these games pick a specific skill and help you just focus on that again and again and again.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:56:51):\nIf you're already practicing, you're already leagues ahead of everyone, because most people aren't practicing. They're you're trying to learn from a video or a YouTube short or an article. You can only go so far with that. But if you are practicing, there are kind of two suboptimal ways that might show up. One is what you're saying. You're doing talks and you're speaking up more, but you're not really practicing. It's kind of, as you were saying, it's broad, broad strokes.\n\n(00:57:17):\nThe other one is you are in a choreography, so it's like learning how to dance, but you only learn choreography. Well, that's all you know how to do. So if I ask you to do, I say, \"Okay, now I'm going to put music on. Just dance.\" You're kind of stuck because you only know how to do the moves you were doing. So we're trying to get people outside of, \"I have to be in my mind, or I have to do things that I've memorized how to do\" and come back to trusting your natural ability to communicate.\n\n(00:57:51):\nSo that's what we're doing here. You can feel like when you don't speak, when you struggle with speaking, you're stuck in this box, and everything around you is tiny and you can feel the sides of the box. And we're expanding the range. We're playing around with all kinds of different things, different tools. And all of them have specific meaning, but even if they didn't that much, you still would be able to, \"Oh wow,\" you're pushing back the sides of the box. And now suddenly, \"Hey, I can move around. I feel comfortable moving my arms and moving my legs and going to the right and the left and up and down.\" And just that act of making you feel more comfortable and more at ease is going to unlock your ability to communicate, because you already know how to do a lot of this. So we're tapping into these different skill sets and we're doing both at the same time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by Brave Search.

I'm pumped.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:59:43):\nLet's do this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:44):\nNo, I'm not going to... I was going to say I'm going to nail it, but no, let's just have fun. Let's have fun.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:59:49):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:50):\nIt goes how it goes.\n\nTristan de Montebello (00:59:52):\nIndeed. Here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:53):\nOkay. And I'll say the title. The best thing about pain. So this is something I recently shared in another talk is just this quote that I always think of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:01):\nIn another talk is just this quote that I always think of, \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek,\" that the thing that is hardest often points you in the direction you want to go. Like I hate blue cheese, but sometimes I find that if I eat the blue cheese and add it to a salad, it ends up being the best salad I've had. Having kids is another amazing example where just kids are... There's so much pain, but it's also, there's nothing that is more joyous than having a kid.\n\n(01:00:29):\nAnd sometimes even growing a beard. I grow this beard and I have to maintain this beard for the rest of my life. And I know people would look at me without a beard and be like, \"What the hell? Well, you look so different now and so young.\" Sometimes I think about just having a sibling and the pain that if I had a brother, if he just hit me, the pain that would come from that, but just then having the brother would be so much worth it, even if he's hitting me all this time.\n\n(01:00:58):\nAnd there, I ran out of time, but that was solid.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:01:04):\nOkay, I realize this is your first time playing Triple Step. It's kind of mean of me if you [inaudible 01:01:09]-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:09):\nI have to go faster.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:01:10):\n... Give you six words. So I'm going to give you four words.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:12):\nOkay. Okay.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:01:13):\nBut here's what I noticed. What I noticed is you were letting the word... The word was the beginning of a new thought. Right, so you say, \"Another thing is beers. Another thing is...\". So you're finishing your thought and then you're moving on to the next one. Try to hold onto one direction. The one direction is approach your fears head on. And then, so when you see a puzzle, it's like, look, this doesn't have to be a hard puzzle because now I know that if it's scary, I do it. And it's like having kids, which I thought was so scary, I just jumped in and now I'm moving forward. And so it's like I'm growing my beard without caring what other people think just because it might be scary, or maybe I cut my beard because that would be something scary. So you're holding onto the line.\n\n(01:02:08):\nWith four, it's going to be a little bit easier to integrate them. Ready?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):\nLet's do it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:02:18):\nSocial-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):\nSocial distancing. It's interesting that social distancing was such a thing that we all had to do for so long. And then all of a sudden we look back at that time we're like, \"Was that actually necessary? Did we actually have to stay far from each other? Did that actually have any impact?\".\n\n(01:02:34):\nThere's all these things we have to learn, like sometimes we look at the stock market and we wonder, \"Should I be paying attention to the stock market? Should I be distancing myself from it? Should I be investing more often? Should I be reading every newspaper that comes out every day to stay on top of what's happening in the world? Should I get closer to this information or should I distance myself? What's better for me?\". And sometimes it feels like you're running this marathon where sometimes you go back and forth. Sometimes it's, \"Let's all be together. Let's pay attention to all the news. Let's hang out.\" And it kind of feels like I just want to just want to go to the toilet and peace out.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:03:24):\nAmazing. That works. That's really good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nOkay.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:03:27):\nThat's really good. Well, tell me what, because again, the games are meant to put you in a state of turbulence and find out what was easy, what was hard, what am I noticing? And now you know what you want to work on. If you did a rep and you got it and it went perfectly, then you're learning nothing. A really easy rep is not worth much. The only reps that are worth something are the ones where you feel an edge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:57):\nYeah. And by the way, we should say the words right, that I had.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:04:00):\nOh, yeah. The first one was the stock market, then a newspaper, which you brought in really, really well, then running a marathon, and then toilet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:13):\nYeah. Okay, great. Yeah, just the fact that I'm okay doing this is a big milestone for me of just like, ah, whatever. Because before doing this thing I'm like, oh my God, I never want to sit there and come up with a talk for a minute on the most random subject, and there's a lot of power in just feeling comfortable just doing it, just like, sure, let's do it. Whatever. Something will come out that's interesting enough.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:04:35):\nThat's why taking on this journey of speaking is so empowering because speaking is a high performance skill. So taking on a high performance skill, and starting to tackle it, and getting kind of good at it is very addictive. It feels really, really good. If you get good at tennis, if you get good at golf, if you get good at anything, product management, it's a addicting, it's exciting. And as soon as you get good, there's nuance to it, and it's energizing in and of itself. And because we have such awesome hardware as humans, we've been speaking all of our life, a lot of us have a pretty decent level to start out with. So you really quickly, you're getting to like, \"Oh, I'm getting some results here. This actually feels good.\" So there's something really energizing about jumping into it. It's the thinking about doing the exercise that's scary, but as soon as you're in it, it's energizing and empowering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:35):\nAnd also just doing it, this is a very hard exercise. Just giving a made up talk for a minute with words you have to integrate, and concepts. And I think just doing that makes a regular talk so much easier also, because you don't have to do that. So there's something there about just doing it on hard mode, learning things, and then, oh, okay, I just have to talk about a thing that I already know about, that I have planned, much easier. Anything else around this game that is worth sharing before we do our final game?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:06:06):\nWe have a whole series of games, and you could probably even invent other games, but some people will play Triple Step and will say, \"Wow, that's so hard.\" And then they'll go and play Conductor and think, \"Wow, this is my game. This is so easy.\" But other people will play Conductor and think it's impossible, and then come play Triple Step and they'll be like, \"Man, this is my jam. I can get this one very, very easy.\"\n\n(01:06:31):\nSo again, it's just a mirror of where you're at. And what's beautiful about this is you start playing around with these games, you're very, very quickly going to see, okay, this is my edge. And where your edge is, as you were saying with your quote, is often where the gold lies. So if you can spend some time there and learn what it is underneath the struggle, what's actually holding you back. When you unlock that, whatever's holding you back in Triple Step, or in Conductor, in any other game, is holding you back elsewhere in your life. So when you unlock it there, it kind of unlocks the other things, which is really nice, like a set of gears.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:12):\nAnd it's interesting, as we were talking, where my mind keeps going is I just want to say how I didn't feel good about my performance, but I'm internalizing the lesson of don't leak how you feel. And that's a really powerful lesson. It's really hard not to just to be like, \"Oh, that was not good.\" I really wanted to say that after every time I tried this and I am making myself not. And I imagine from your perspective you're like, \"No, it's fine. It's like whatever.\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:07:40):\nYeah, absolutely. I was actually thinking, I bet a lot of people watching you do that would think, wow, I don't think I could do that. That would be their first thought.\n\n(01:07:49):\nSo absolutely. And again, and this is a habit. And the noise doesn't completely disappear, but it goes down to being almost imperceptible. So what we're trying to do is we're trying to internalize all of these habits to the point where I don't need to consciously think about them.\n\n(01:08:12):\nSo it's like a gymnast who's doing their tumbling routine and jumps into the air. As they're flipping, they're not consciously trying to think of how to do a flip. They've done it a thousand times. They know how to do a flip. The only thing they have that they may be thinking of, all of their attention is on being completely present to what's happening, relying on your body and your subconscious knowing what to do, is they have kind of like listeners, like in programming, keyboard listeners. You have something that's there that is just listening for anything out of the ordinary. And it's very, very fine-tuned.\n\n(01:08:47):\nSo as I'm speaking, for example, I might think to myself, \"Oh, I may be rambling right now. Maybe I'm going a little bit too long.\" And it's a little listener that's going to just gently, nicely, say, \"Hey, warning, I don't know if you're aware of this.\" And as I hear that, I might say, \"Oh, okay, let me wrap it up.\" Or maybe it's saying, \"I'm not sure if you're being clear,\" or, \"Can you be more precise here?\". Whatever it is, it's just a gentle listener in the background.\n\n(01:09:15):\nSo as you get into the habit of staying in character, and if you had an audience here, we could have asked them right away, \"Well, how do you feel about this?\". You probably would've gotten really good feedback, really positive, which would've kind of jarred that feeling of, wow, I didn't think I did it that good of a job. And people are saying, \"Hey, I thought that was pretty good.\" So As you get that reinforcing pattern, the voice starts going down more and more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:43):\nAwesome. I need that voice to go down. That'd be great.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:09:46):\n[inaudible 01:09:46].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:46):\nOkay, let's do another game.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:09:48):\nAlways does.\n\n(01:09:49):\nCool. Let's do last game. Last one of these practical games. So this is actually a game from one of our courses that I'm pulling out. It's not a standalone game, it's one that's inside of the courses. But again, if you wanted to replicate this yourself, you can very easily do it.\n\n(01:10:09):\nSo what we're going to do here is we're going to work on conviction prompts. So this comes back to this idea of entering a state or changing your energy to impact the words that are coming out of your mouth. So what's going to happen here, is similarly to Triple Step, I'm also going to get a random topic that I just have to start speaking about. But now, instead of getting a word that I have to integrate into my speech naturally, I'm going to get a prompt. So it's going to be the beginning of a sentence that I have to say out loud, and I have to find a way for my brain to just complete the sentence. And the sentences are specifically chosen because they're going to put you in a state of more conviction. So it's going to force me to care more about what I'm saying basically.\n\n(01:10:56):\nAnd this is a game for executive presence. If you think about somebody who you feel has great gravitas or great executive presence, they usually have, there's something about them that's saying, this person really believes in what they're saying. And what this game is showing you is that, hey, there's a way to fast track myself to that place. If I want to have more executive presence, let me bring a little bit more conviction to what I'm saying.\n\n(01:11:27):\nThere's a caveat, small caveat. Maybe 10% of people in the workforce need the opposite. They need, \"Hey, you need to maybe question what you're saying here.\" But the reality is the vast majority of people actually are not truly standing behind their words and their ideas. And what that does is that the people who speak a lot and feel a lot of conviction, their ideas go through more often than the others. And you'd want ideas to stand for themselves, but that's just not reality. So for most people listening to this, if you can bring more conviction to your words, then your ideas are going to have a better chance of being seen equally to those who are already doing that. So this is what this game's about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:14):\nAwesome. Okay.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:12:15):\nOkay, here we go. The title is Saying No. I've had to learn this the hard way as an entrepreneur, that saying no is one of the most important things I can do. But saying no is not saying no to a meeting, because that can be easy. And what I'm going to say now matters a ton. This is saying no to doing all of the exciting projects that I want to do. So as I said earlier, I'm Labrador. I get excited about everything, and I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome, but that doesn't mean I can do every idea. I need to choose a very clear focus and stick to that focus.\n\n(01:13:02):\nAnd this is a game changer. When you start reducing the amount of things you're doing to a painful amount, a painful few amount, then when you get there, suddenly everything else changed. And it astonishes me when I do that, just how much more I can get done, even though I'm doing fewer things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:22):\nI love it. That was great. These words are tough.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:13:27):\nThey were, yeah. This was not an easy one. This was not a... Good thing that I get a tough one. Well deserved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:35):\nLet me read the phrases real quick, just so folks know. So the phrases you had to integrate is, \"This matters a ton. I genuinely believe that every idea is awesome. Game changer.\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:13:45):\nIt was just, \"I genuinely believe that.\" Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:49):\nOh, got it. Okay. \"I generally believe that.\" And then, \"game changer\". And then, \"It astonishes me when.\"\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:13:55):\nAnd I'm so eager for you to go through this, and for anybody listening to try this for themselves, even if you know what's coming. Like, if you want to do this for yourself right now, write the words, the prompts that Lenny just shared, and choose any title, and just speak for a minute, and see if you can integrate those in. Because you're going to notice how if you bring conviction, these words naturally bring that out of you. And it's so interesting to watch the content change as a result of the state you get into and what you say. So it's really powerful to discover just how incredible your brain is.\n\n(01:14:36):\nSo same intention for you I think, is choose a strong direction from the beginning. This is always, in speaking in general, the stronger the direction you choose in the beginning, the more ideas you're going to have. Everything gets easier when you choose a strong direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:54):\nOkay, let's try it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:14:55):\nBut the goal here, is as it says, advocate for an important idea related to the speech title. Ready?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:01):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:15:02):\nHere we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:02):\nYOLO.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:15:06):\nThe title is Space Exploration.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:08):\nI think it's hard to imagine anything more important to the human race than space exploration. I know there's a lot of talk about people wasting time trying to get us to Mars, or trying to not think about what is happening on earth, but I feel like there's nothing more powerful, and important, and inspiring. In fact, the entire world needs to focus more on the value of space exploration. There's so many things we can discover, so many things that can help us on earth, and we cannot forget how much potential exists outside of our little earth, that we think our whole existence and everything that's ever existed on this one planet, when really we're this tiny, pale blue dot. And it just astonishes me when people don't think about this, don't think it matters, don't think they should spend any time getting us into space, investing money in space. And just hearing stories, if nothing else, of people that have gone into space and how life-changing that was for them, should tell us that space exploration is incredibly powerful and important.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:16:14):\nYes, that was awesome. That was so cool. So you had, the title was Space Exploration, and the words were, \"in fact\", \"the entire world\", then, \"We cannot forget that,\" then, \"It astonishes me when,\" and finally \"life changing\". So what was that like? What did it feel like getting...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:41):\nYeah, there's a lot of... It really helps, just like, \"Here's the thing you're going to believe.\" And I don't know if I got lucky with stuff, but it just felt like, okay, I have, something comes up that I'm not going to leak. But anyway, it was like, oh yeah, cool, something interesting happens.\n\n(01:16:57):\nAnd that's one of my other actual, just going on a little quick tangent, insights from the lessons that you guys teach, is that as you are forced to talk, you have new insights emerge. And you almost figure out what you think and know by being forced to get out of your head, and these problems help you along that. But I think that's really interesting, of just like, this will help you develop things, and insights, and take them out of your head.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:17:26):\nYeah. Well, hopefully we get to talk about the Accordion Method, one of the most powerful methods I have, which is very close to this.\n\n(01:17:35):\nBut this is often a prompt I tell people when they're speaking. I say, because people tend to get into a public speaking voice, so we'll be in a class, and they'll be chatting normally, and look super normal. And then we'll say, \"Okay, now just a timer. I'm just going to give you a speech. Just speak for 60 seconds so we get a baseline.\" And I click play, and suddenly I say, \"The important part about doing this,\" and they enter into a different version of themselves, a very professional version, whatever that would mean. It's so much more freeing, powerful, connecting, and effective to speak conversationally.\n\n(01:18:18):\nAnd so the cue I often give people is don't think about us, just think out loud. And that's really what we're doing. We can, most people have a skill set that's up here and a mindset that's down here. And so if you can just change the mindset to match the skill set, you've already made a giant leap. And you do that by reducing the stakes in your mind and by just speaking. And as you do that, when you're thinking out loud, you have these moments of connecting things in your mind, and then naturally it pops out.\n\n(01:18:59):\nAnd if you're doing it well... And I love, there's a really cool Naval Ravikant interview on the Joe Rogan Podcast from many years ago that's phenomenal. And at one point he talks about communication, if I'm not mistaken. I think it's on that podcast. But he says something along the lines of, \"One should discover the words they are saying at the same time their audience is.\" And this comes back to thinking out loud, like if I'm really in my mind, I'm making connections, and suddenly the words are the consequence of it.\n\n(01:19:31):\nSo using prompts, poking your brain, giving these cues naturally creates things that you couldn't have anticipated otherwise. It's like putting constraints on a creative project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:46):\nI love that. Before we segue to a couple of these methods, the Accordion Method is one example, I want to ask about, when people hear this, they may feel like you're helping people more, just like make shit up, and why, why would we want that? Talk about just how this isn't just like, you're not going to actually give talks like this necessarily. This is... And I guess I'm answering the question, but I'm curious if that's how you think about it. This is building a skill so that when you actually want to give a real talk that you've prepared, you are better at it. But yeah, just thoughts on just that potential element.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:20:23):\nYeah, I think that's an important question, and it's a question I hear a lot because we all know a bullshitter, and that's the person who masters the skill of communication but doesn't have anything to show for it.\n\n(01:20:43):\nAnd so this thing happens, is that I see bullshitter and I think to myself, I really, really don't want to become that person. And what happens is it becomes an immune response or like an immune response where the desire not to be that person and the feeling being around that person gives you is so strong that now if I take even the smallest step in that direction of speaking freely, sharing my thoughts out loud, bringing more conviction or confidence to what I'm saying, not leaking, then there's this immediate response like an immune response in my body that's just too strong, that's saying, \"Uh oh, you're becoming the bullshitter. Alarm bells. Alarm bells. Go back to that safe little corner you were in.\"\n\n(01:21:39):\nBut the reality is, if you're thinking that, then you have no chance of becoming a bullshitter. Because if that thought is even popping into your mind, then you're the type of person who has developed a very acute skill set of noticing when people bullshit. And you have that same skill set for yourself. So it's just going to be, now it's just too loud.\n\n(01:22:05):\nSo as we go through this practice, we want to match, \"Hey, I want to match that bullshitter's level of communication, except I'm going to have the ideas to back it up. I'm going to really put effort into my craft, but I'm going to be able to show them in the best possible light.\" And what we want to be able to do is notice, okay, if this is a big thing for you, the bullshitting, and you're noticing a big reaction, just even listening to us, not even playing the games yourself, then you definitely benefit from calming that voice down. So spending time learning these skill sets, because you're most likely atrophied because you're staying away from it. And you're going to have this very powerful listener in the back of your mind that's going to ping you, and it's like, \"Hey, you're at the limit right now. Stay true to what you know.\" And it's going to be a very good compass for yourself. It's going to be there and you can trust it because you developed this capacity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:02):\nAwesome. That's really helpful.\n\n(01:23:05):\nOkay. So, so far we've shared a bunch of techniques, things that you could just start doing today. We've done all these fun games that you could play online. If nothing else, just learning from the techniques these games teach you I think is really helpful. You've shared a bunch of principles of just like, here's how you actually get better at public speaking, and not this way, but that way.\n\n(01:23:27):\nI know you have a couple also methods just like that people can implement that helps them develop talks that I found really helpful. So maybe just as a closing, we talk about these two methods, the Accordion Method, and I think it's the Bow and Arrow Method?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:23:40):\nUh-huh.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:41):\nAwesome. Let's talk about the Accordion Method. We did this in the class briefly, and it was really helpful, and I've been explaining it to people of just like a really cool way of making your talk better. So talk about how that works and how people might be able to implement it when they're trying to develop the talk.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:23:55):\nNow, I'm biased when I'm going to say this, so take this with a pinch of salt, but I think the Accordion Method, the Accordion Method might be one of the things I'm the most proud of in my entire life because it's almost revolutionizing the way I think we should prepare speaking.\n\n(01:24:19):\nSo up until now, we've talked about spontaneous speaking mostly, and that's going to be the vast majority of your speaking. Probably 80% of your speaking is stuff that you can't prepare for. But there are going to be situations where you know you have a deadline and you're going to have to speak. And either you have to speak because it's a job interview, or you're talking to your CEO, or maybe you're presenting to your whole team or an audience of a thousand.\n\n(01:24:45):\nThe old way I think is shitty. I think it's broken, and I haven't found anything out there that is innovating on this. And it drove us crazy with Michael, and that's what gave birth to the Accordion Method. What's the old way? The old way is I have a talk coming up, so I'm going to dump all of my ideas on a piece of paper or multiple pieces of paper. Then I'm going to try rearranging those ideas. And as I'm rearranging the ideas and trying to make them in a talk, I have more inspiration. And I'm thinking, oh, maybe I could say it this way, and I don't want to lose that other thing that I said in the beginning because maybe I would use it.\n\n(01:25:22):\nAnd you start just creating this alien stack of paper with all of your ideas of what your talk might be, and then you're left with 10, 15 pieces of paper. And now as the deadline comes closer, what do you have to do? Well, you have to go through the excruciating pain of turning 10 pages into a script so that you don't forget all of those brilliant lines that you spent so many hours editing. And they're still in writing mode. They're not in your mind.\n\n(01:25:50):\nSo now that I've created that script that I spent a lot of time editing, now I have to memorize it. And memorization is pretty. We're not good at memorization. Robots are good at memorization, humans are not. And memorization is like a chain where you just have all of these links very linearly. And everybody knows the feeling of going through, reciting a poem as a kid, and suddenly you miss one verse and you're lost, and now you're a deer in the headlights.\n\n(01:26:21):\nSo what we're doing with the Accordion Method is instead of preparing our talk by writing, we're going to prepare our talk by speaking, and we're going to do so in a very specific way where we're going down the accordion to create extreme clarity, and to understand what the essence of our talk is, and then back up the accordion to bring back in intentionally just the right pieces.\n\n(01:26:48):\nSo I was thinking of an analogy for this, and one that I really like is imagine you're redecorating your living room. The old way, the writing 10 pages and memorizing it is I'm going to look at my living room and I'm going to rearrange things and put stuff in a corner that I might need later. And then I'm going to bring some new things that I thought could be really nice and I'm going to struggle to make something work.\n\n(01:27:14):\nThe Accordion Method is saying, and imagine this were easy to do with furniture, I'm going to take everything out of my living room except the most essential pieces that make my living room. So I might be left with that one couch that I really love, a pillow, a beautiful light that I bought three years ago, and one or two other small things. And as I look at that, I'm going to have clarity on the vision I want for my living room. And then very slowly, very intentionally, I'm going to go take certain elements that were already there that I might want to bring back in, and I'm going to bring new elements that now I see make sense. And so by the time you finish with your beautiful living room, it's going to be this beautiful minimalistic room that has a very clear design choice, and every element there is there because you chose it. It's there because you did it very intentionally.\n\n(01:28:15):\nSo how does that work with the Accordion Method? What we do is you can go through the first step. If you want, you can write all of those ideas on paper just to get them out of your head. That's totally fine. But from this moment on, there's no more script. And I'm just going to give an example of times, but you can change these time constraints slightly. We're going down the accordion by using time constraints. So for example, you would say, \"I'm going to speak for three minutes.\" So you're going to put a timer, and you have two rules. I have to stay in character the whole time and I have to end strong. So you must make it to the end of the three minutes, and it doesn't matter how bad it sounds, how many mistakes you make. The only point here is I'm trying to get my ideas out into spoken word. So I'm starting to populate my mind with everything and seeing where am I actually at.\n\n(01:29:13):\nThen after the three minutes, you think of, okay, what did I like, what didn't I like? Then you go to two minutes. And you put a timer and you do two minutes again. And you're very strict with those two minutes, because we're just trying to learn something every time. It doesn't need to be perfect. So at the two-minute mark, you do the same thing, but now you had to shave a whole minute out of that content. And as you do that, well, that means getting rid of the noise, getting rid of anything that doesn't feel right.\n\n(01:29:38):\nThen you go down to one minute. And you're going to go down all way to 30 seconds. So you started at a three-minute speech and you make your way down to 30 seconds. By the time you make it to 30 seconds, you're going to have only the essential pieces like that couch and that lamp in the living room. When you have the essential pieces, you're going to have a clear sense of what your talk is about, and it might've changed as you-\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:30:00):\nSense of what your talk is about and it might've changed as you were going down the accordion. And then from that place on, we're going to do another 30 second rep and then we're going to go back up the accordion. So you do another 30 seconds and then you do one minute, two minute, and all the way back up to three minute. And every step of the way you go from 30 seconds to a minute. Initially, a minute felt hard. Now that's double the time you just had. So you can bring in something that's aligned with the talk you want to share, and then two minutes, same. And then when you get to three minutes, one of my clients once said that it felt like he had a football field in his mind. So much space. And now whatever talk you have left there is a very clear, intentional talk.\n\n(01:30:45):\nAnd not only that, and this is why this is such an incredible method, your talk is now internalized. So you're at the stage of I've written a script that I've painfully edited in the old way that you now still have to memorize and it's a written speech that you're going to have to pretend to give in a spoken way. In this case you're there, but it's already completely internalized, not even memorized. It's internalized. You have these pillars, you know where you're going and by the time you make it through the accordion method, you're basically ready to go give it on stage.\n\n(01:31:22):\nBut you could give it now in one minutes, two minutes, three minutes, five minutes. It's very plastic. You're going to be able to navigate different time frames. It's not going to really matter if you make a mistake because you're going to have a deep sense of what your speech is. It's not memorized, it's internalized. So not only have you gotten clarity and built out your speech in a very intentional way, but by the time you get to the end of it, you also actually know it and you're ready to perform it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:51):\nThat example of the three minute when you come back up the accordion, that's exactly how it felt when I did this is just like, \"Wow, so much time now\" because you essentially, the way I think about it is you concentrate it to the best, most important nuggets and then you have time to build on those nuggets and you cut out all the stuff that no one really cares about, which is usually a long introduction, just like now just get to the good stuff and then you expand the good stuff. And it really worked for me and it was a really illuminating experience.\n\n(01:32:19):\nFor someone that wants to actually use this. Say they have a speech coming up, say they're doing an all hands presentation in a week. Do you do this a week ahead of time? Do you do this a few days before? I guess where do you fit this in the workflow so that you actually remember what you want to say when it comes time?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:32:36):\nI can't say do it exactly a week or two weeks or it really depends how well familiar you are with the content. If you have an all hands, and this is something that you've been hashing with your executive team over the past two months, you probably know it really, really well and you have a lot of clarity and now it's just about organizing it nicely. So in that case, maybe you want to do a rough go through the accordion a week ahead of time so you have a clear sense of, \"What is it that I want my audience to remember and what are the pillars that I know I like to hit that feel really good?\"\n\n(01:33:15):\nSo you can think about these as the foundational pillars that support that one thing that you're sharing or bookmarks that I know I have to hit and then what I would like to do. And so that's what I would write down. I wouldn't write a script. I'd write those down. And then before the all hands, maybe the day before, maybe even the morning of, depending on how important this is or how comfortable you feel, then you might go through just one or two reps of it, but now you already know it, so it should come back very, very quickly in your mind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:44):\nAnd it sounds like it's okay to have some bullet points at the end. It's hard for me to imagine going on stage with a bunch of people watching, not have any slide, bullet point, speaker notes. Any problems just having a couple of the bullet points of core points next to me?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:34:01):\nBefore a talk, I might have four things written down. My one thing, and we'll talk about this in the bow and arrow, my one thing, the one thing I want people to remember and then the three bookmarks or pillars that I want to hit. And these are kind of cues or reminders that are going to send me into that part of the speech. So for example, if I'm talking about the accordion method, like what I just said, if I go back and I think through the pillars of this one. Well, my one thing would be the accordion method is more powerful than memorizing and then doing it the old way.\n\n(01:34:35):\nAnd then my bookmarks might be number one, describe the old way or the old way. Number two, the new way or the accordion method. And then number three might be internalize, don't memorize, and that'll be kind of the takeaway.\n\n(01:34:53):\nAnd if I have that in my mind, if I have 30 seconds, I can say the old way sucks because you have to work so hard and memorize everything and you're memorizing written stuff, the accordion method is much more powerful because you are going to compress it and go down and then open it up and then I'll explain that in a second and then I'll say, so you're internalized not memorized. What I realized right now is actually, it's funny enough though, those were the bookmarks there, so that sent me down that path. But actually I would say bookmark number two is probably the living room analogy. So it would be the old way sucks, the living room analogy, and then describe the accordion method.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:36):\nThat's cool. That was an awesome example of just the insights that appear by forcing yourself through this exercise. And it sounds like maybe the best use of this method is if you have a talk all of a sudden short term it's coming, all of a sudden you have to give a talk somewhere. There's a really powerful method to come up with a great talk that's maybe tomorrow, which you didn't expect.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:35:58):\nWhen I say I love this, I use this for myself, I use this with every single client I work with regardless of if it's a five-minute talk, a 20-minute keynote, we're using the accordion method, and you can use this at the macro level or at the micro level, so you can use it for the whole talk, but you can also say, \"Hey, let's hone in on this part one that you're struggling with or part two and let's use the accordion to get clarity there.\"\n\n(01:36:26):\nSo you can use the accordion as almost like a brainstorming way. I just want to see where I end up here and it takes maybe 15 minutes or something to go through a full accordion. It depends the time constraints you give yourself. Sometimes I'll just do two minute, one minute 30 seconds, that's even shorter, but I'll go through it for one piece of the puzzle or it's like, \"Hey, we're almost there. Let's really internalize it. Let's clarify this. Let's get it really, really tight.\" And then I might say, \"Okay, now let's do the whole thing through the accordion. So your 20-minute talk, I want to hear it in three minutes.\" That gets really, really interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:03):\nAmazing. Okay. Anything else along the accordion method before we talk about the final technique before we wrap up?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:37:10):\nWe have a full self-paced course on ultra speaking on the accordion. I think it costs like 30 bucks or something like that to access all of the games and all the platforms. A bunch of them are free, but I think this one's behind the paywall. But we also put together a resource where we go all the way, we describe all of the accordion method, the bow and arrow, staying character ending strong on a free email course that we put together. That's ultraspeaking.com/Lenny. So this is shameless self-promotion, but if you want it to go grab it there, you can grab it there and then the bow and arrow is going to tie into the accordion method as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:53):\nAwesome. I'm glad you mentioned all that and we'll point people to that URL in the show notes. Okay, final topic is the bow and arrow technique. Let's talk about what that is and how folks can use that to give better talks.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:38:05):\nThe bow and arrow starts with a, it's really a mindset shift that most of us are in the weeds, so we're very sensitive and familiar to all of the content that we're working on. If you're in data, then you have all of the data. If you're sharing ideas, you still have all of the ideas. And the mistake that most people do when they're preparing a talk, a presentation, an all hands a meeting, whatever it is we tend to focus more on what we want to say than what we want our audience to remember. So the mindset shift here is stop focusing as much on what you want to say and focus more on what you want your audience to remember.\n\n(01:38:51):\nWhat we found out is if you think about your last all hands, the last big meeting, the last talk you saw on YouTube or in person, you probably don't remember much. In fact, I wager you might only remember one thing from that talk. And that's what this is all based on. We call it the bow and arrow technique because we think you can only remember one thing out of a talk and that it's very powerful to go through that framework or that kind of thinking when you're building a talk. And the one thing is your arrow. And so when you have that one thing to me I say it's literally a single sentence that is the only sentence people would remember if they left your talk. Would you be satisfied with that sentence?\n\n(01:39:37):\nIt takes some times to get to a good one, but if you have a good one, it unlocks everything. It's like you're having a north star or a compass in your pocket. You can always pull it out. You always know where you're going. It gives you a lot of clarity. It's also giving a lot of clarity to your audience obviously.\n\n(01:39:54):\nBut you can't just throw an arrow at somebody's face. You need to notch it in the bow and pull the bow back. And so to pull the bow back, you need to add in weight to that sentence. And that often comes in the form of an interesting anecdote or a data point that's going to support that or a story that's going to add emotion or illustrate it. So you want to find ways in which you can give weight or pull back the bow so that your arrow has that much more impact. So usually the process of clarifying what your arrow is is a back and forth between the bow and the arrows. So if you're going down the accordion method after the first one you might write or before the first one, you might write a tentative arrow, \"Here's my one thing\", and then the next one you say, \"Okay, actually my one thing might be a refined version of that.\"\n\n(01:40:55):\nAnd so you might rewrite it a little bit and then you might tentatively put in what you think the bow is. \"I like the anecdote I used here. I like this data point that I thought was powerful and maybe I can end on this story or this call to action.\" Then you'll put that in and then you go back in and you give that a try and that's starting to simplify in your mind.\n\n(01:41:17):\nAnd as you go, usually one informs the other. By the time you finish the accordion for example, you should have a very clear arrow and those clear bookmarks, which is the bow. But really the thing to remember with the bow and arrow, if you can only remember one thing, is switch your mindset from what I want to say to what I want people to remember and limit whatever that is you want them to remember as much as possible and that's going to give you extreme clarity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:48):\nThat is really helpful. I'm preparing my talk for the summit, and so I'm going to use both of these exercises and what I take away from this last piece is as much as you may want to say a lot of things, really all someone's going to remember, as you said is one thing, if anything, but hopefully they remember that one thing.\n\n(01:42:06):\nSo it's essentially what's the one thing you want people to remember and then what are the pieces of support that will convince them that that's right and that's something that'll stick with them?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:42:16):\nExactly. And again, similar to the accordion method, this works in the macro and the micro. So if you have a talk where you're using slides, use it for the whole talk. But then for every single slide, ask yourself what is my one thing? And you might have some support there as well, but if you don't have a one thing for each slide, either the slide shouldn't exist or it should be multiple slides.\n\n(01:42:45):\nThe symptom of not having a one thing is usually having a slide that says way too many things. I don't know what data point I want you to remember, so I'm going to put all of it on that slide. I'm not sure which piece of information is more important. So I'm going to write down all of my thoughts and I'm going to go through all of them or hope that you go through all of them and extract what you think is interesting. But the reality is people are just going to zone out if you do that. So if you do that slide by slide, you're going to gain incredible clarity and again, you're going to need less preparation and less memorization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:21):\nAnd to build on that, a pro-tip is to make that title of that slide exactly that one thing you want them to take away. Just put it there and tell them exactly what you want them to learn.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:43:31):\nYes. I love that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:43:32):\nSweet. Tristan, we've been on a journey. This was a really unique experimental episode. I had a good time even though I did some hard things, you made me do hard things that are good for me. Is there anything else you want to share before we get to our very exciting lightning round? Is there anything else you want to leave listeners with or a nugget you want to?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:43:50):\nI hope people found value. I mean, we did. This was really a group effort and I really appreciate you working on the agenda, really bringing in the games and trying to make this as practical as possible. I think the only thing I want to leave people with is again, this idea of how transformational tackling speaking can be, and the more constrained you feel with your speaking, the more transformational it will be to your life. So I just want to give this encouragement. It's much, much, much more enjoyable than you think it will be. It can actually be exhilarating and energizing and you feel like you can take over the world once you're on this journey. It's beautiful. And so I just encourage everybody, take the first step and start practicing your speaking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:45):\nAwesome. And I definitely felt that after doing the workshop of just I feel energized, I want to just talk all time, but then I'm like, I need more work. I need more practice. Tristan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:45:01):\nLet's do this lightning round. Here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:04):\nHere we go. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:45:10):\nI was given a book by my first coach, Nathan Seward seven years ago called The Big Leap by Gay Hendricks that I've recommended so many times. And it's based on this idea that we tend to self-sabotage ourselves when we experience too much success or too much happiness. And that that's linked to I think five things that would happen to us when we're growing up. One of them is the... What is it, the wild poppy syndrome or something like that. Like the tallest poppy is the one that's cut first. So if you shine in a family of siblings, then anytime you shine too much we're going to say, \"Hey, hey, hey, that's not cool for the others.\" So that's going to be internalized and hardwired in your body and as an adult, as soon as you start shining a little bit too much, you're going to do the same thing to yourself. So the idea is going from having this point above which you can't be happy to turning it into, he calls it an upward-facing spiral with no upper limit. It's a really exciting and empowering book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:20):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:46:23):\nI haven't watched much very recently, but I'll say one of my favorite TV shows of all time is the Peaky Blinders, English show with Cillian Murphy. I'm absolutely obsessed with that movie that show. I think it's a true masterpiece. And I've recently rewatched, so I'll qualify this as recent. I recently rewatched The Nice Guys with Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe, and I think it's just a brilliant comedy. Brilliant. Another masterpiece, I thought.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:58):\nDo you have a favorite recent product that you have discovered that you really love. Could be an app, it could be something physical.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:47:05):\nI have a physical product actually right in front of me that was gifted to me by my business partner Michael Gendler, co-founder of Ultraspeaking. This is called an Ember Mug, and this keeps whatever you have in it, warm and it's extraordinary, whether you are a coffee drinker or a tea drinker, you know the feeling of pouring this and sipping it and by the fifth sip, it's cold. This keeps it at whatever temperature you want it to for however long you want. And I absolutely love it. I've been using it basically every day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:37):\nI have one of those. I find myself, you could actually control it through the app. You can control the temperature through an app, which I love. I haven't been using mine, but I love the idea. I know a lot of friends love them. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with friends or family, find useful in work or in life?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:47:56):\nI think we are too future focused as a species or as a society and as a result, we're always looking for the next thing. So the motto I share with my friends and my business partners and my family the most I think is these are the good old days. And I remind myself, I'll tell you right now for you and for whoever's listening. I mean think about the podcast, it's never going to be this young, it's never going to feel like it feels right now. And it always feels like these things are eternal, but truly one day you're going to look back and you're think, \"Man, those were really the good old days.\" And so I say it right now, enjoy because these are the good old days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:40):\nI love that. And it's so relevant with a young kid, you're always going to think about, \"Oh, they're little.\" I love that. Final question. You were the fastest person to reach the finals of the world championship of public speaking. I imagine that was quite a journey. I'm curious if there's a story from that experience that comes to mind that's like a wild part of that journey or something that might surprise people.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:49:09):\nWell, the journey lasted almost seven months, and it was the craziest journey of my life. I went into that with no experience whatsoever speaking, so really just a random amateur, and I just climbed the ladder by outworking everybody. The story that came to mind right away was six days before the semifinals. So I'm six days before the semifinals and I've qualified for the semifinals two and a half months ago. So I'm nobody, now I'm going to the semifinals of the world championships of public speaking. So my mind really is struggling to compute, and I had finally unlocked a speech that I thought was worthy of giving on the final stage. You have to show up there for the semifinals with one speech, and then the next day, if ever you win, you're going to the finals and you have to have a brand new speech, a completely different speech that you're going to give on that stage.\n\n(01:50:12):\nSo you need two speeches ready to go, and both of those speeches have to be in theory, world-class. I'm six days before. I was struggling at that, really, really struggling to get that speech together. I finally got something and Michael managed to get me. I was flying I think two days later to Vancouver for the semis, and Michael managed to unlock this one opportunity to speak in front of 50 people to give it a try. And so I ran there. I give the speech, and as usual, we film. I film every single speech. I gave more than a hundred speeches over seven months, and I filmed every single speech. And we'd get home, we'd ask everybody for feedback, and I get home and I'm thinking, \"Man, something is wrong. Something is wrong.\" I was so pumped. I wept. I genuinely wept as I wrote the speech because it was so moving. It was all about my life. It was something that I was so connected to. I don't know, probably the emotion of the pressure as well, but that's how much I believed in that speech.\n\n(01:51:14):\nWe get home, we put the speech on the computer, and as I get to the most important part of the speech, I see two things happen. So this is the moment where I'm expecting people to pull out their tissues. One person pulls up the agenda for the event that they're at and is starting to look at the agenda. Another person pulls out their phone, another person starts going through their purse, and I'm looking at this, and suddenly I realized, \"Oh, this speech, nobody cares about this. This is not a good speech. This is terrible.\" And then I go through all of these feedbacks.\n\n(01:51:53):\nI have 50 pieces of feedback, and all I'm getting is, \"Good luck for the semi-finals. It's going to go great. I thought it was good\", and I'm like, \"I'm going to humiliate myself. This is terrible.\" So I had waves of anxiety. I threw my speech away, and in five days from the ground up, I rebuilt a completely new speech that was basically the best of everything I'd explored, everything I'd experimented with over the course of the three months leading up to that, the jokes that worked the best, like a stand-up comic would. I built my special and I focused on different areas like all of the transitions.\n\n(01:52:38):\nAnd right before the semi-finals, I gave the speech to one person. I was in Vancouver trying to internalize my speech and memorizing it in a plaza where I delimited the size of the stage and I'm just giving my speech out loud to get over the nerves, so I'm ready for the pressure to see if my brain will remember it and everything.\n\n(01:53:01):\nAnyways, I gave it in front of one person who was our district director at Toastmasters, and this is a speech meant for 500 to a thousand people, not one person. So I was scared it would flop. But in the middle of the speech, which is a completely different one, I saw a tear roll down her cheek, and then she just hugged me and said, \"You got it. You did it. You did it.\" I walked out on that stage and I made it, and I won the semi-finals with that speech.\n\n(01:53:32):\nI think to me, that was really the, it showed me that everything I'd done was worth something, that it actually worked. If I was able to build a speech in five days, that could get me a win at the semi-finals of the world championships. That was kind of the ultimate, \"Wow, I won.\" So when I walked into the finals, to me, I felt like I had already won.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:57):\nWow, that is a story. What an arc. Amazing. I'm so happy you asked that question. Now I just want to watch that speech and I want to learn more about this whole championship of public speaking, which I have no insight into. That could be its own podcast interview.\n\n(01:54:13):\nBut Tristan, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible. One of the most interesting episodes I've done. Two final questions. Where can folks learn more about Ultraspeaking? I know you built a page where they could experiment with some of this stuff, so share that. And then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:54:28):\nIf you go to ultraspeaking. com/Lenny, so ultra like U-L-T-R-A ultraspeaking.com/Lenny, we put together, you have five emails that go deep into a bunch of the things that we've talked here. You can also just go to Ultraspeaking.com where you'll get access to a bunch of the games for free, and you can check out everything else that we do. If you want to follow me or hit me up or ask me questions about this podcast, you can do that on Twitter @Montebello, M-O-N-T-E-B-E-L-L-O. And how can listeners be useful to me? Well, first of all, if you made it to here, then I really appreciate you. Thank you. Thank you for being here with us, and what I would love for you to do is to apply this. We said in the beginning, you can't get better at speaking without speaking, and another piece of that puzzle is you want to do the thing that you're trying to get better at. So if you're nervous speaking in front of people, you want to speak in front of people as part of your practice. So the way you could be useful to me is introduce these games to somebody else. Try them for yourself, practice them with somebody else. Go through the accordion method with a friend. Try conductor, and when you succeed and when you have an awesome experience, then you can tell the world that Ultraspeaking helped you do that, and that would be huge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:55:56):\nAwesome. Tristan, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTristan de Montebello (01:56:01):\nThanks, Lenny. It was an honor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:56:03):\nIt was my honor, Tristan. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:56:05):\nThank you so much for listening.

I mean, you have to be ready to pivot at the drop of a hat. I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over everything. So what do you do in that situation? You can be frustrated, absolutely it's frustrating. But we always have to have the ability to A, pivot of course, but also have backup and buffers in those types of scenarios.\nLenny (00:45):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Upasna Gautam. Upasna is a product manager at CNN, where she leads the team responsible for the content management system that journalists use to write and publish their stories. She's also on the frontlines of elevating the discipline of product management within newsrooms through her work at the News Product Alliance. She's also a longtime meditation and mindfulness teacher, which as we discuss ends up being pretty damn handy working at a place like CNN. We dig into how the product team operates within CNN, how they collaborate with journalists for breaking news, dress rehearsals, and also some simple tricks to build your own mindfulness in your day-to-day work as a PM.\n(01:31):\nEnjoy this episode with Upasna Gautam after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

Upasna, welcome to the podcast.\nUpasna Gautam (03:15):\nThank you Lenny, I'm so excited to be here.\nLenny (03:18):\nAs you probably know, I'm on this kind of quest to understand how different companies build product, especially companies that are kind of outside the Silicon Valley, just like standard tech scene. And I've always wondered what it was like to build product at a company like CNN, which is very different from where most, I don't know, tech PMs work. And so I'm really excited to have you on and to give us a little glimpse into what it's like to build product at CNN.\nUpasna Gautam (03:42):\nAwesome, I'm very excited to share as well.\nLenny (03:44):\nSo I was doing a little research on you before this chat, and I noticed that you've been teaching and studying meditation and mindfulness for, I don't know, maybe a decade? And I imagine that comes in handy at a company like CNN, which also I imagine is quite hectic at times with breaking news all the time. And so here's my question, what have you learned or brought from that practice to your ability to lead and ability to just like keep your team calm and focused during I imagine many hectic moments?\nUpasna Gautam (04:16):\nLove that question, and working in product in news is a very [inaudible 00:04:22]. We hear a lot about having the skills to thrive in ambiguity in order to be a successful product manager, but to be a successful product manager in news you have to be able to thrive in chaos. And equanimity is the most important skill I've developed I think across my entire life, and it's due to all of those years of practicing mindfulness and meditation. And equanimity is one of my favorite words, it means mental calmness, composure, evenness of temper, especially in crazy, stressful situations. It's the ability to remain un-rattled in like the highest of highs and the lowest of lows. And if you think about it in the dynamic of a workplace or human interaction, it's really the ability to pause before reacting.\n(05:11):\nAnd reactivity is the root cause of so many of our workplace woes and product management frustrations, and when you're able to pause before reacting you can start to undo and break a lot of those negative patterns in your brain. And in news, and especially the world's biggest breaking news organization, you can cut through that chaos with equanimity because it also really gives you this outsized advantage in everything from stakeholder management, team morale, to the way you're able to translate user feedback, to product development philosophy. And the thing is is you're always going to hear things and feedback that you don't like, and opinions that you don't like, and you're going to get frustrated. That's product management, that's life.\n(05:59):\nBut real power to me comes from equanimity, and that comes from managing your emotional reactions, and not trying to control others. So I think when you're able to cultivate that level of self-awareness for yourself, you're able to chart a clear path forward for your team and serve as a compass in the chaos.\nLenny (06:22):\nIs there a story or an example that comes to mind where things were just like, \"Oh shit,\" and you were able to tap into that skill that you built to stay calm and focused, or even just like help your team stay focused?\nUpasna Gautam (06:33):\nI mean, it happens all the time right? That is the nature of breaking news. I mean, you have to be ready to pivot at the drop of a hat. And so I think more than just like the big, chaotic moments in those daily interactions when there's chaos, I think that's when it really shows its power and helps me navigate those day-to-day interactions when I had a big working session planned with my users to do research with them, or do user testing, and breaking news breaks, and it takes so much time and effort to gather a team of editors across the globe to do a user testing session. And when breaking news happens, they have to prioritize that over everything. So what do you do in that situation? You can be frustrated, absolutely it's frustrating. But you always have to have the ability to, A, pivot of course, but also have backup and buffers in those types of scenario. So any time we're planning we build in buffers for all of that chaos that's happening on a daily basis.\nLenny (07:41):\nWow, that's cool. Is that a real thing that happened? You were like, in a big meeting with all the researchers and then something went off the rails in the world?\nUpasna Gautam (07:47):\nOh yeah, absolutely. Happens all the time.\nLenny (07:49):\nI don't know how much you can go into all this, but what is it that you would do in that case, like as a product team? What are they looking for you to do at that moment?\nUpasna Gautam (07:56):\nFor us it's not really anything we have to do. It is more so, \"Okay, well our goal at this session was to get user testing done, or user feedback from that user testing session with our editors. And so, what do we do? Okay, well good thing we had a backup planned, right?\" We don't actually have to go into that scenario, but since our editors and our journalists are customers we're there to serve their needs, but they're not here to serve our needs. They have a whole another job that they have to do. And so we have to have the ability to adapt and accommodate to those really chaotic schedules across global time zones. And so that happens again like, it's not like once in a while, it's a very regular thing that we have to be aware of and also account for.\nLenny (08:46):\nOkay, again, it's like the journalists are the ones in the meeting that like, \"Oh, they have to go write about the stuff uncovered.\"\nUpasna Gautam (08:50):\nTotally.\nLenny (08:51):\nI see, that makes sense. You said that you built in some buffer time to kind of account for these things. Is there like a systematic way of doing that, or is it just broadly, \"Let's add buffer time\"? Is there like a rule of thumb you think about there?\nUpasna Gautam (09:02):\nIt depends on the scope of the work we're doing at that time. So one of my main responsibilities is to rebuild our content management system, which also involves onboarding our editors and journalists to it off of our legacy platform and onto our new one. So when we're thinking about onboarding especially the teams, our onboarding cycle's very long. It involves training, testing, lots of dialogue and feedback. And then only do we actually test, and then we onboard. And so it is a long cycle, and it's longer than it maybe seems like it needs to be because we have to build in those buffers. Sometimes that buffer is a day or two, and sometimes it's a week or a month. And sometimes when we think we need a buffer, we get it done in a day and we quickly move onto the next phase.\n(09:53):\nAnd so I think that quick decision-making in those times is super-important, because you have to be able to assess the situation as it stands. And so I think mindfulness is so important too in practices like this, because being able to objectively see the scenario for what it is, make a quick decision and move on to the next phase is something we have to analyze every single day.\nLenny (10:16):\nMakes me think a little bit about a lot of CEOs are very busy and pulled into a lot of things, and so you have to kind of account for their schedule. And it sounds like you have many, many people that you work with that have crazy schedules.\nUpasna Gautam (10:29):\nYes.\nLenny (10:30):\nI wanted to dig a little bit deeper into how you, your team works with the news team. It's such a unique way of working, most product teams don't have a whole set of journalists that they have to work with as stakeholders. So I'm curious specifically, say a journalist has like, \"Hey, I'd love to build a special immersive experience for this story,\" or, \"I need some special feature to help support this work that I'm doing.\" How does that work? Do they come to you, and, \"Okay, here's a roadmap [inaudible 00:10:57] maybe in the quarter [inaudible 00:10:59].\" Imagine it's like, \"I need this next week.\" How do you work with the journalist team, basically, on product?\nUpasna Gautam (11:04):\nYep. This is pretty much the foundation of all of my work. We talk to our editorial staff every single day, and after a lot of observation and learning I implemented a system to manage that kind of intake with four different touch points or events. So we have weekly demo days, working sessions, breaking news dress rehearsals, and office hours. So with weekly demo days, I facilitate those with my product design lead and my tech lead. And we use that as an open form of communication to deep dive into features that exist on our platform, also to preview or give a sneak peek of new features to come, and kind of recreate their workflows and do a show and tell. Again, we wanted to open that up as a forum to not just our editorial partners but also anyone across the business who is interested in learning about the product and which is our platform.\n(12:00):\nAnd it was also a great way to kind of evangelize the product too. Coming off of a legacy system after several years onto a brand-new one is a big change at a place like CNN, and so we definitely tried to make sure that smart repetition in different ways is top priority. So, weekly demo days is one. Working sessions are interesting. I use the term working session because it's a combination of several things. This is a really critical part of our onboarding process where we gather breakout groups of our journalists and editors to work with us to recreate their workflows in the new platform. This allows us to address any friction or issues of course that are occurring in their workflows. But also we're able to gather a lot of awesome feedback from them in those sessions.\n(12:54):\nWe used to call them user testing sessions, but decided to move away from that and just call them working sessions so they're more collaborative. And again, it's a really critical part of our onboarding process. We usually do three to six of them depending on the size of the group before the team is actually onboarded for two hours per session. So they're like deep dives into their specific workflows, so as you can imagine the way the politics team programs content is wildly different than the way the entertainment team does, or the way that the health team does, and very different than the way that the CNN homepage even interacts. So all of those are separate teams we have to work with when it comes to getting feedback. So in addition to that, we also do I mentioned breaking news dress rehearsals.\n(13:44):\nAnd you can imagine this is exactly what it sounds like. We create a script and do a simulation of a breaking news scenario to stress test our platform, because all breaking news scenarios are definitely not the same either. So this gives us a lot of great feedback in that short amount of time at the speed of breaking news. And then last but not least, we have office hours which I just started last year, and that's also probably what you can imagine, open blocks of time where me and my product design partner and my tech lead are just there to answer questions, help people troubleshoot any friction they might be experiencing in their workflow, get their feedback. We just wanted to open up another line of communications, so we do those right now once a week. Sometimes they go up to two times a week if we're in a really vigorous onboarding phase.\n(14:33):\nAfter those conversations and sessions and events happen, you know it's our job to translate their needs into the functions that we, A, either maybe already have that we can optimize, B, we build anew, or we tell them it's not viable. And the good thing is that because they've been along for the ride with us throughout the product discovery process we've earned their trust and respect. So that when we tell them something like it's not viable, they usually get it.\nLenny (15:07):\nMan, I have so much questions about just working with journalists. I feel like pushing back on a journalist is probably extra hard versus other types of stakeholders.\nUpasna Gautam (15:14):\nIt is.\nLenny (15:15):\nCan we zoom out a little bit, and you talked about what you work on at CNN, which is the content management system and things around that. Can you just talk about whatever you can share, just like what does the product team look like at CNN, how many PMs are there, how's like the product work structured and where do you fit in there?\nUpasna Gautam (15:31):\nYes. I mentioned earlier my team sits on CNN Digital, and I think when most people think of CNN of course you think of TV and linear programming. I have nothing to do with that, CNN Digital is digital, and it's made up of several teams that are structured around a lot of different product areas. It includes everything from the content management platforms that I work on, to data infrastructure, to personalization, to video experience, which includes like the products of video editor, and the video player, to podcasts, there's a lot. So each of those are product teams. And so we also split out... The way CNN is split out into CNN Digital is because there's a separate core content platform that powers broadcast and linear TV.\n(16:21):\nAnd the one that I work on powers CNN Digital. So on my team, the core platform team, our stakeholders and our customers, like I mentioned, are journalists and are editors. Which presents a really unique dynamic, and it's one that I love. We have direct access to our customers at all times of day, for better or for worse, and they're embedded into our product development process. And each of those teams under CNN Digital is kind of like a squad, very similar to how it is at other larger tech companies. We have PMs, we have engineers, designers, and delivery managers embedded in those squads. And since my team is a core platform team, our main responsibility is to A, build our newer, faster, more flexible content management platform to replace our legacy one, and B, onboard our entire editorial staff to it.\n(17:19):\nAnd so even more specifically my role is focused on rebuilding the tooling and the editorial experience of that platform, as well as doing the actual onboarding of our journalists. So we work cross-functionally because our team kind of is the umbrella over a lot of different teams, so we truly work cross-functionally to make sure that we're serving our journalists with the tools that they need to do their job in the most efficient way possible.\nLenny (17:48):\nWhat would surprise people most about how product is built at CNN?\nUpasna Gautam (17:54):\nI think the most surprising thing may actually be that there's just so many different types of products that we build. Like I said, I think when most people think of CNN you see TV, and you think of Anderson Cooper, and all of the things that are very publicly visible. Most of our product work and product teams all sit behind the scenes, and so I think just that in itself, like the sheer size of that is surprising to a lot of people. So I mentioned like all of the different teams, product teams that are based off of function, content management platforms, infrastructure, personalization, video, podcasts, linear TV. And I think that in itself, like the sheer size of it, we're not the size of Google by any means. But at the same time we have the expertise and the depth and breadth of a lot of those larger tech companies.\nLenny (18:52):\nI'm curious about the day-to-day operational work of how you build product at CNN. So our first question here is just, you use like OKRs, and OKRs with like key objectives, and outcomes, and 70% of a goal is success.\nUpasna Gautam (19:06):\nYeah, absolutely, we do. We've used OKRs for a long time, and they've served as an anchor for my team over the last three years. I can't go into specifics on like what our OKRs are, but I did kind of cover the two main parts of it, which is rebuilding our content management platform and onboarding our users to it. So again, it's a long game at CNN when you're working on a core platform to replace a legacy one. And so we break those OKRs down of course even further into, we look two to three years out and build goals based off of that. Then we break them down by quarter and month, and then out of that for my team and what I do I need to, for my own sake and my team's sake, break those down by the week. And when we're in rapid development phases, we're planning on a daily basis.\nLenny (20:01):\nHow about in terms of just planning broadly? How far out does the product team at CNN plan in detail, like have an actual roadmap? And is that standardized across teams, or can each team kind of do their own approach?\nUpasna Gautam (20:13):\nIt's a combination of both. So we have one that is an over-arching roadmap that tracks to like our company OKRs and our product organization OKRs. And then from there I mentioned we have our squads, product teams, and we have OKRs on those as well track up to the larger, broader ones. And so once we get down to that level though, there is flexibility and we have autonomy to tackle those how we want. Which is really great, because the scope of work across our different product teams is drastically different. Working on core platform, like I do, versus working on video experience, versus podcasts. I mean, it's apples and oranges. And so it's really awesome that we have the flexibility to kind of make it work for us, while also having these larger goals that we know that, \"Okay, this is what we need to work towards.\"\n(21:12):\nAnd I mean, like the saying we always hear in product, of, \"Stay firm on the goal, but flexible on the process.\" And we've definitely been able to use that and leverage that in the way that we track against our goals.\nLenny (21:27):\nSomething else that a lot of people are always curious about is product review meetings and design review meetings. You talked about a couple of these meetings that you have, but do you have standard product review meetings where folks get together and just review stuff and progress? And if so, how do they work? Like who runs them, who comes to them, how do you make decisions, things like that?\nUpasna Gautam (21:46):\nWe have multiple variations of those. Some are standing ceremonies of course, and some are ad-hoc. Again, it's really based on the work we're doing in whatever phase we're in. But when it comes to product review, and product discovery or design review meetings, in addition to my design lead I've made it a point to bring in my tech lead and engineers along for this product discovery ride, and that's definitely been a game-changer as well. When our engineers are able to understand our journalists' needs at the same level as we are, they're able to define the how to do it with so much greater clarity and precision. And so my tech lead is embedded also in our product discovery process, he joins our user testing sessions, and our design jams, and our editorial conversation planning sessions.\n(22:37):\nAnd it's helped him and the rest of our tech and engineering team become experts on the why are we doing this and what are we working towards, to better determine technical feasibility. And he's done an amazing job of also passing that knowledge down to the rest of our engineers on our team, so it's really like this mentality of getting that important feedback from our journalists, understanding their pain points and then sharing and teaching it across the team. And I think the key takeaway on that is it's so important to think of your engineers as partners and not just resources. And when they are embedded into the process right upfront, it makes the whole process in general more efficient.\nLenny (23:21):\nSo it sounds like that was maybe an evolution of the way the team works, as engineering has been looped into a lot of this early stuff more recently?\nUpasna Gautam (23:30):\nTotally, yeah. Recently-\nLenny (23:33):\nCool.\nUpasna Gautam (23:33):\n... meaning, I mean... Again, long game right? Because it's been a couple of years.\nLenny (23:39):\nGot it. Going in a slightly different direction, I'm curious if there's any fun or unique traditions or rituals that the CNN product team has. These are always fun to hear about.\nUpasna Gautam (23:51):\nI'll be very honest, we are not one of the cool teams. The politics team and the breaking news teams have all these cool rituals and fun things that they do.\nLenny (24:02):\nWhat kind of stuff do they do?\nUpasna Gautam (24:03):\nIt's different also because they're usually in-person in the newsroom and I work remotely, and so... And actually most of my team works remotely. And so they have their rituals, but I will say one of the things that we started to do is... So onboarding teams has been a big goal of ours, and that we've slowly checked off the list over 2022. And any time we successfully onboard a team or launch a new feature, it's not anything crazy or fun, like there's only so much you can do when you work remotely. But we definitely make it a point to celebrate, and it's been hard to figure out ways to keep team morale up when you're all-remote. And it started with... We knew we needed to start doing something when we would have a big launch, and it was so anticlimactic.\n(24:51):\nAnd we literally hit publish and onboard onto like a politics page, and we were like, \"Oh, okay, so I guess that's it.\" So one thing we started doing is sending like these gift boxes of like random tchotchkes and stuff that mean things to us from the whole year, and it's like just cheap little gag gifts and stuff that we send to each other. I have random stuff all over my desk, I don't even know if I can share some of it. So we try to make it a point to at least share and celebrate, and then when we're in-person we do too. But again, being remote, there's definitely a challenge there.\nLenny (25:32):\nAre you ever able to get like a cameo from an Anderson Cooper, or someone else on-air to thank the teams? That feels like a cool feature potentially.\nUpasna Gautam (25:41):\nSo one of my key stakeholders, she leads the video team at CNN, and she is a... We've had some discussions about doing a sizzler reel for our content management platform, since we're onboarding people and building new features. And there have been discussions with her about getting a celebrity to come and promote the product for us, so working on it.\nLenny (26:07):\nYeah, it feels like a missed opportunity, you've got so much talent around.\nUpasna Gautam (26:11):\nTotally.\nLenny (26:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data, and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals, or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n(26:52):\nBut getting a SOC to your port can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter, Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Coming back a little bit to the way y'all built product, I'm curious how you balance new product work and new features versus maintenance and bugs. Do you have kind of a... Is there like a philosophy at CNN of how much goes to bugs, maintenance versus new stuff, or is it per team and just, how do y'all think about that?\nUpasna Gautam (27:45):\nIt's certainly team-specific, because again, the scope of work across teams really varies. But since my team's product is an entire platform, it's my job to ensure we're still clear on our goals because like I said, they may change on a week-by-week basis. One sprint might be high-priority feature development, in another sprint maybe we're focused on medium-priority optimizations and bug fixes. But we know that any time there's a critical incident in production, it also takes critical priority over everything else. So it's a balancing and juggling act that relies heavily on intuitive decision-making. But I will say we're also really fortunate to have a global, 24/7 editorial support team that we work really closely with.\n(28:35):\nSo they are the ones who handle, troubleshoot, escalate incidents up to the relevant teams. There are a lot of layers to that protocol when a critical incident occurs. And so our editorial support team is that first layer of support, whereas my team might be the second or third depending on the level of severity and who it gets escalated to. So there's definitely a lot of processes in place, we're not always that first line of defense, which is actually... It alleviates a lot of stress, to know that we have an entire team around the clock globally dedicated just to that.\nLenny (29:12):\nWhen you're talking about these incidents and moments it makes me wonder, is there a memory of just like a wild time of something happened in the news, or just like, \"Oh man, we've got to get on top of this thing\"? Is there like a memory that you think of like, \"Wow, that was crazy\"?\nUpasna Gautam (29:26):\nIt's funny but also crazy and amazing, is... So our new content management platform, we've been building it for a while and stress testing it for a while. And politics and election season at CNN is Superbowl like times a hundred. And so we have to be all hands on deck, like all layers of support intact. And so we have also a lot of layers of fallback in case something happened, right? Like there's layers and layers of infrastructure fallback if CNN.com goes down, or another service goes down. And so it actually did happen a couple of years ago in the 2020 election, and one of the fallbacks at that time, because we were not...\n(30:14):\nWe're still on our current content management platform, but we had our new one as we're building it as one of the levels of fall. And if X, Y, Z fails, then it goes to our current platform, and it did. And so that's actually happened, where our new platform saved the day even though it wasn't fully ready. But that just goes to show we think about that kind of stuff like in granular detail, when we think about everything that could possibly go wrong. Because it has happened, and it will happen, and it does go wrong. So that was kind of cool, it was validation to know that the platform we have is really stable, and strong, and secure, that it was a fallback for the election.\nLenny (31:03):\nOkay, and it must have felt good, it feels like a promotion material right there that your work-in-progress system saved the day.\nUpasna Gautam (31:10):\nYeah, I agree.\nLenny (31:12):\nYou talked about how you have like these breaking news dress rehearsals. I just noted that, and I thought it would be cool to just revisit that briefly. Like, how does that work? You just get the team together, and like, \"Here's a news story that just broke. What do we do?\" Like, how does that work?\nUpasna Gautam (31:27):\nIt is scripted, right. So we can only get so close to the real thing. But one thing we do is we script everything, like the teams and the players that we need involved in it, what the incident is. And it usually starts when breaking news occurs with an email, the news-gathering team sends an email to our writers and our producers. And then from there it goes out all the places it needs to go. There's a video that needs to be created, there's an article that needs to be written. Again, the TV side I have no insight into, it's like a foreign land to me. But as far as the digital scope goes, there's a lot of work that has to be done. Even things like photo and imagery, we have a whole team dedicated just to selecting photos.\n(32:11):\nThe photo desk is very involved with that process. And so that is all scripted out, and so we say, \"Okay, here's the news, here's how it's going to break,\" and then we run it. And so we use interpersonal communication tools at work of course, email, and we run the whole thing from the minute the email is sent to... And of course since we're testing the platform with this breaking news dress rehearsal, to the minute you hit publish on that page. And there's a lot of stuff that goes on in there, and it all happens in the span of minutes. And so while that is happening, while that dress rehearsal is happening, we have our engineers and our editorial support team on hand as well. So they're observing what's happening while it's usually me and one of our editorial stakeholders and leads facilitating the actual rehearsal part.\n(33:02):\nAnd you know, getting user feedback on, \"Okay, did something break, did everything work as it was supposed to work?\" And also allows us to understand like how far we can go with stress testing different features on our system. So each one is different, but it's a crazy amount of stuff and information you can gather in such a short span of time. Because if it cannot serve the needs of breaking news, then it's useless. So it's a lot of work that goes into it for this three-minute event.\nLenny (33:35):\nThat is cool. It feels like just a cool tactic you could use anywhere, and that's a good segue to the next question I had, is just having built product at CNN and seeing how the product team works, what is it that you think you'll take with you to future product teams and future companies if you ever move on to anything else?\nUpasna Gautam (33:53):\nSo I of course can't speak for the entire scene and product team, but I can speak for myself and my specific team. In order to stay competitive in our modern news landscape, building this content management platform and the technology behind it has taught us how to enable rapid development and integration of new features and workflows. And we've been able to quickly test hypotheses while reducing risk, and again, time is of the essence when it comes to breaking news. And when you layer that with a very complex content management technology, there's a lot of moving parts. And we've been able to do that successfully, and it's pretty amazing. And because of that we've developed, I think, this unique skill of high agency under high pressure.\n(34:49):\nAnd I really think that that skill or combination of skills is our superpower, and that is something you can take anywhere, that is something that is an asset to any product development team.\nLenny (35:03):\nLet's circle back to our original topic about mindfulness and meditation. Other than just living through it and either becoming a meditation expert or having worked at a company like CNN that has a lot of this, is there any, I don't know, tactic you could share, something that someone could take tomorrow and be like, \"Okay, I'm going to get better at dealing with crazy, unexpected events,\" based on the experience you've had?\nUpasna Gautam (35:25):\nTwo parts to this. So one, I would be remiss as a meditation educator if I didn't say that there is no substitution for meditation. So just do it, it takes a long time, and it's a lifelong work-in-progress. But the good thing is that it also... Like the more you do it and consistently you do it, it compounds over time. Okay, if you think of any job description for a product manager it's mostly the same core stuff. You need to be able to lead a team without having authority, you need to have great communication skills, you need to be able to bribe in ambiguity, you need to be able to work with a lot of different people on the technical side and business side, all of the stuff that we hear all the time right?\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]But how do you actually become better at those things? Like, there's only so much you can gain from reading a book. To me it's either A, you've got to go do it, and B, meditation has helped so much because of the clarity of mind and clarity of thinking you're able to cultivate because of it, especially when it comes to communication. And this comes back to another tactic I think. So meditation is one, you can't get around it. It's a very, very powerful tool, I will die on that hill. But thinking about workplace tactics, communication is so essential. When I started at CNN it was a very new chapter for me, it's my first official product management role after working a decade in tech, in data and search infrastructure.\n(36:57):\nAnd it was really scary to make that change so far into my career. But when I asked my boss why he took such a big chance on me he said, \"It's because of your communication skills and relationship-building skills, and that I've seen you in a room where engineers listen to you and what you have to say, and you listen to them.\" And he was like, \"That in itself is really, really hard to teach.\" And I was like, \"Okay, yeah, I can do that.\" So when I think about what communication means I also attach that to mindfulness. Like mindful communication is so critical for successful product management, no matter what type of product environment you're in. And it means being like deeply aware of the conversation you're having.\n(37:43):\nAnd when I'm having this conversation with you, I'm only having this conversation with you. When I'm talking to my design lead, I'm only talking to my design lead. When one of my journalists is venting because this feature is not working the way we told them it was going to, I am shutting my mouth and I'm listening to them vent, and then I'm extracting what the root cause of the problem is. And I think the takeaway and the tactic is that goes back to exactly what we talked about in the beginning is the ability to pause before reacting is the key to mindful communication and being a successful product manager. I think a lot of times we are taught to have all the answers, or we're expected to have all of the answers.\n(38:27):\nAnd people assume we have all of the answers so it's a really frustrating, sometimes, place to be in. But, if you listen and you know where to go to get the answers, that in itself is like a tremendous place to be. So I think the power of meditation, being able to pause before reacting lets you do things like conversate in the language of the listener. So when I'm talking to my journalists I'm not using technical terms or like content management technology terms. They have a whole different vocabulary that they use, they have shortcuts that they have lingo for in our content management system. They call things nicknames, and so you have to speak many different languages as a product manager. And if there's one thing that learning and teaching mindfulness has strengthened, it is that communication, yes, it's very important.\n(39:24):\nHow do you become an effective communicator? I think a lot of times we think of speaking articulately first and foremost, or we think about writing well, which those two are really, really important things. But those can't be effective for us as product leaders if we're not listening, so I think listening and being able to converse in the language of the listener is the utmost importance. And how do you do that in your day-to-day? It's like, okay, if you're having a conversation with your customer are you actually listening to what they say, or are you going in with your own assumptions? Because maybe you're a user of the product. And it was very interesting, because I actually started writing freelance for CNN this past year.\n(40:12):\nAnd I was like, \"Oh, okay, I'm a user now.\" And no I'm not, I'm not going to say that it helped me understand their pain points so much more and where they're coming from in a whole different light. But again, I am merely a proxy, I'm not actually the user. What they do is still drastically different. And so when having those customer interactions and stakeholder interactions, the priority should be to listen. And I think that is one of the most important things I've learned, and it's also helped build trust and respect between a previously fragmented structure where product and editorial didn't talk to each other, and now we're a unified partnership.\nLenny (41:00):\nOh, I love that. I love the reminder that a lot of communication is incredibly important for product managers, and so much of it is not actually you talking, it's you being really good at listening, and that makes you a better communicator. I imagine some people listening to this are going to be like, \"Yeah, meditation, I should be doing that.\" What's like one thing someone could do to move forward on the path to starting to meditate? Is there a resource to recommend, a tip of just starting to do something there?\nUpasna Gautam (41:27):\nTotally. I think when people think of meditation, you immediately think of sitting on a mediation cushion like a monk for an hour. And that doesn't have to be true, especially if you're just starting. And there's also of course social media has commercialized what meditation is a lot as well. But at its core, all it is is being deeply aware of the present moment. So I always tell people who are for example like really busy moms who have no time in the morning for an hour-long meditation is, \"Okay, take something in your day that you do every single day. You brush your teeth every morning, right? Okay, take brushing your teeth. Can you brush your teeth and just brush your teeth? And when you're brushing your teeth you are engaging all of your senses, and being fully present and aware of how it feels, how it smells, how it sounds.\"\n(42:27):\nThat's two, three minutes of your day. That's meditation, and I think it's an amazing way and an easy way... Oh, sorry, not easy. Simple, not easy way, always, to think about what meditation actually is. Is like, instead of like having to uproot your whole life and the way you live to bring meditation in, think about what you already do every day and how you can just be more present, like fully present. And that's one of the core examples I give, is start with brushing your teeth and just brush your teeth. There's an old app I've been using for a long time if you're into that, I stopped using it recently but it's still amazing. It's called Insight Timer, the free version is amazing. It started as like a single-frame app probably about 10 years ago, and it's turned into this...\n(43:18):\nThey've done amazing things with that product. So that's what I recommend, but again, you don't... I think, again, when people have a vision of meditation in their mind they're like, \"Well I need these tools, and I need these resources, and I need these things, and I need knowledge.\" You don't need anything, you need five minutes and yourself, and that's it.\nLenny (43:37):\nAmazing. I imagine many people listening to this coming into thinking, \"I'm going to learn about CNN and how they build product,\" and then get a free meditation lesson. What a bonus, that was awesome. I'm going to be brushing my teeth very mindfully today-\nUpasna Gautam (43:49):\nLove it.\nLenny (43:49):\n... my takeaway.\nUpasna Gautam (43:50):\nLove it.\nLenny (43:52):\nFinal question, around something that I know is important to you, that is basically there's this growing shift of product thinking in the news industry at large. And I know that's something that you're passionate about and something you're trying to create, is just to kind of move the media industry and the news industry toward more product thinking. So I'd love for you to just talk about what you're doing there, what's happening there, and then maybe if there's anything people could do to help in that effort.\nUpasna Gautam (44:16):\nCompared to the rest of product management as a discipline and the tech industry, product management in news is still in its, I will say infancy. And that's just because it hasn't been an integrated role for as long as it has been in big tech. But it is starting to become more and more not just prominent now, but people are realizing the value and power of it because especially in smaller newsrooms... I mean, CNN, places like The New York Times, The Washington Post, we have great, embedded, strong product teams. But that is not the case for the majority of newsrooms across the country and the world. Newsrooms are strapped for resources, they are strapped in all resources, including financial resources.\n(45:07):\nAnd so first, bringing in product and tech talent is expensive, and that in itself has forced editorial staff and journalists to take on other jobs that they never signed up for. And so they've had to learn how to do things product management, and engineering, and coding hacks, because there was nobody else to do it. And so it's interesting because a lot of times when you talk to editors and journalists, they're doing so many other things other than just their reporting of the news, right? They've had to take on other roles because of those restraints in the newsroom. And so there was a group established and a community established during the pandemic called the News Product Alliance. And there was like a realization occurring all at the same time that, \"Wow, there's a lot of us doing this work.\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]\"Like, what do we call it? Is this product management?\" And it was, it's product management at so many different levels. And so the News Product Alliance was formed during the pandemic in 2020 I believe by several media and news executives, who had been there and have seen people in their newsrooms do that. And the goal of it is to increase the awareness and education of product thinking and product management in newsrooms, while also increasing the diversity of thought and the diversity of people in those positions as well. And making the resources more readily available, especially for those smaller newsrooms that don't have the money to hire tech talent. And that in itself has...\n(46:56):\nSo that group, the News Product Alliance, has grown dramatically in the past three years since I've been a part of it, since the beginning. And we regularly produce the resources that are catered... Product management resources that are catered to working in a newsroom, because it is different, it is very unique. But there are of course frameworks and processes that are still relevant, right? Like editors who have been cobbling together how to make this thing that they want, but hey, maybe this PRD framework will help you, just to keep it on track. So these very simple, like rudimentary types of things have helped them so much. And so last year we kicked off a mentorship network in which we had about 400 people apply.\n(47:46):\nWe accepted 150 mentees from across the world, and matched them with 50 mentors from different newsrooms across the world in leadership positions. And each mentee defined a goal that they wanted to work on, and all of course having to do with product management. And some of them were creating a product management role for themselves in the newsroom. Some of it was creating a product management practice, maybe they were given the title of product manager and said, \"Okay, you can hire a couple of people.\" But it was all on them, and they had no idea what to do, right? And so some of it, it's across the board, and it's amazing to see people doing this from scratch who never in a million years thought they'd walk into it.\n(48:32):\nYou know, they're not coming from big tech, they don't have startup backgrounds. They had journalism degrees from around the world, and they're learning how to do product, and build... Not just learning how to do it, they're building product practices, they're actually building and developing products and features, and they're creating more leaders in this space as well, and across their newsrooms to empower each other. So it's been really amazing to see, and it's the most valuable professional organization I've been a part of just because it is so niche that talking about product management is always fun. But when you talk about it at a level that specific, it becomes even more valuable.\nLenny (49:16):\nThat is some really impactful product work. Where can people find that if they want to maybe participate, maybe apply if you're doing another cohort in the future?\nUpasna Gautam (49:24):\nGo to Newsproduct.org, there is a very active Slack group with a couple thousand people in it, a very active and popular job board as well. And you just have to submit an application on the website... A form, sorry, on the website to join the Slack, and ten you'll get an invitation to join the Slack. And then you'll have all of the resources at your fingertips, it's very low barrier to entry, and we want everyone and everyone who is interested in the intersection of news and product to be a part of it. And the cool thing about it is like I mentioned, it's a global network. We have people from the biggest newsrooms across the world, to all of the regional ones, to even big tech, one of my fellow board members was doing news at Twitter.\n(50:10):\nOne was working on the Google News Initiative. So it's a really, really awesome group of people, and everyone is so hungry and passionate about sharing and paying it forward.\nLenny (50:23):\nWe'll put a link to this in the show notes. One last question, and what kind of people are you looking for? Who should apply, if they're listening?\nUpasna Gautam (50:29):\nIf you are interested in working in news and have a product background, or the inverse of that, if you work in news and you're interested in breaking into product. So either side of the coin or any combination of that, news media, product technology, even... We have a lot of audience development, and analytics, and data science folks in there too. It's just an amazing community for knowledge sharing in tech and news, so there will be a fit for you somewhere, or to learn something, or at the very least to meet other really amazing people.\nLenny (51:07):\nWell, with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you, and are you ready?\nUpasna Gautam (51:14):\nI'm ready.\nLenny (51:16):\nAll right. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people, or that you've recommended most?\nUpasna Gautam (51:21):\nOne, Mindfulness in Plain English. Two, How To Win Friends and Influence People. I have to attribute a lot of my communication skills to my dad forcing me to read that book when I was like 10 years old, and-\nLenny (51:36):\nWow, 10 years old. Intense.\nUpasna Gautam (51:39):\nHe was an engineer, and they were in their very beginning phases of introducing... Well, at that time there was no product, but product-type stuff into his engineering practice. And so he had to read the book and was like, \"You need to read this book.\" So I never forgot about it. And then the third one is actually, it's not a book, but it's an article that I think is still very powerful and relevant to this day. It's The New Product Development Game, published by Harvard Business Review in 1986. And it looks at a really different approach, one that I resonate a lot with because it's a lot along the lines of how we work at CNN, around rapid development, and time and flexibility being like key anchors of successful product development. So, I threw that in there as well.\nLenny (52:29):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show? And it can't be White Lotus.\nUpasna Gautam (52:32):\nOkay, I haven't even seen that show.\nLenny (52:34):\nOkay, great. That's come up so many times, we've got to not allow it anymore.\nUpasna Gautam (52:38):\nTV show is a toss up between The Mandalorian and Ted Lasso. I know it's not very new, but I don't watch tons and tons of TV, and I usually find like the few that I latch onto, and then I get obsessed with, and then I've got to take a break for a while. So, those are my last two obsessions. Movie is Everything Everywhere All At Once, the last amazing one that really, really struck a chord with me.\nLenny (53:02):\nIf you like Mandalorian check out Andor, it's incredible.\nUpasna Gautam (53:05):\nOh yeah, it's good too.\nLenny (53:06):\nIt's like the best Star Wars thing. Okay, you've seen it. Okay, great, you're on it.\nUpasna Gautam (53:09):\nI still love Mandalorian more, I do like that one too.\nLenny (53:11):\nWow.\nUpasna Gautam (53:12):\nMy husband is obsessed.\nLenny (53:15):\nOkay, okay. Wow, contrarian. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\nUpasna Gautam (53:21):\nWhat's something that would not exist without your initiative?\nLenny (53:28):\nMm-hmm. And what do you look for in an answer that's a sign that this is someone you may want to hire?\nUpasna Gautam (53:31):\nThe whole point of the question is like, do you have and can you exhibit high agency? And especially again, working in news it's so important. And so there's not like a specific answer, I think the ability to actually define something specific and tangible in itself is a really, really, really good sign. I think a lot of people definitely get startled by that question sometimes, because it requires you to kind of have to know what it is that you put on the table, right? So yeah, it's different every single time. But if they can define something out of that question, it's usually a positive sign.\nLenny (54:15):\nCool, thanks for sharing that additional detail. Next question, what's something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process at CNN or on your team specifically that's had a tremendous impact on your ability to execute?\nUpasna Gautam (54:29):\nBridging the gap between product and editorial, that mutual trust and respect has had an outsized impact on our success as a high-performing team.\nLenny (54:38):\nSadly not something other people can use, but that's cool to know. Then we'll have to hire some journalists now, I think, to take advantage of that learning.\nUpasna Gautam (54:46):\nI can add onto that to make it relevant for others-\nLenny (54:50):\nSure.\nUpasna Gautam (54:50):\n... which is, it just goes back to, there's no substitute for having those direct conversations with your customers and your users. And it's like, when you understand that the assumptions you make are not one to one, or ever going to be one to one with their actual feedback. And developing that line of communication with your users and your customers is of utmost importance, I think that in itself is the key takeaway. It's like, how do you bridge the gap between collecting that feedback, having those conversations. Like, how far are you from your users, how frequently are you having conversations, how consistently are you having conversations? And I always think the more frequently and the more consistently, and earlier on in the process that you're having those conversations, the better.\nLenny (55:44):\nFinal question, maybe you already answered this. What's the most crazy or most memorable story from working at CNN?\nUpasna Gautam (55:51):\nEvery election season is absolutely crazy in the best way possible. It's incredible to see our democracy in action, and watch history unfold. And while that's happening, using the platform you had a direct hand in building, and it's never lost on me that my work impacts the world every single day. And on the crazy, frustrating, stressful days, that is what serves as my anchor.\nLenny (56:19):\nAwesome. Plus, this was amazing, I learned how to brush my teeth more mindfully, about elections, downtime, Trump, all these things. Final two questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\nUpasna Gautam (56:34):\nIt's very easy to find me. Online I'm pretty active on Twitter and Instagram. I recently became an amateur content creator, so I share lots of stuff here and there on social. So any social platform... Well not any, only on Twitter, LinkedIn and Instagram. So any of those three is good, and I always love to hear feedback on stuff that resonated and made sense, and the stuff that there are further questions on. Always love having conversations around that. So yeah, DMs are always open.\nLenny (57:10):\nI know we'll link to this in the show notes, but just, what's your handle on these networks?\nUpasna Gautam (57:12):\nIt's my first and last name, very creative. I thought about it all by myself.\nLenny (57:16):\nAwesome. And then I don't know if you answered the second question, how can listeners be useful to you?\nUpasna Gautam (57:21):\nIt's the feedback, right? Like I love to hear what you found valuable, what helped you, what's a tactic that you took away and employed that helped you, things that made sense, things that didn't make sense, what you'd like to hear more about, any specific topic that would be valuable to do a deeper dive on. All of those things are very valuable to me.\nLenny (57:42):\nAmazing. Again, thank you for being here, and adios.\nUpasna Gautam (57:46):\nThank you.\nLenny (57:49):\nThank you so much for listening.

You've been on the board of 20. You've also built two unicorns including Waze. The biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to-\n\nUri Levine (00:00:09):\nFall in love, fall in love, fall in love, fall in love with the problem, and then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nAnything you wanted to share around hiring and firing?\n\nUri Levine (00:00:23):\nEvery time that you hire someone new, mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, knowing what I know today, would I hire this person? If the answer is no, fire them immediately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nLet's actually talk about fundraising.\n\nUri Levine (00:00:37):\nMost people are missing the most important slide of their presentation is the first slide. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point. Now the second most important slide is the last one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:56):\nToday my guest is Uri Levine. Uri is the co-founder of Waze and nine other companies. He sold two companies for over a billion dollars. He's also been on 20 different startup boards, including a dozen he's still currently on. He's also advised over 50 founders and startups over his career. More recently, he wrote a book that summarizes all of his advice for founders called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, A Handbook for Entrepreneurs. In the foreword to the book, Steve Wozniak said, \"This book will change your life and become your Bible if you are an entrepreneur,\" and I cannot disagree with that. This book is very tactical with amazing stories and walks you through the ideation phase all the way to exiting your company.\n\n(00:01:39):\nIn my conversation with Uri, we chat about many of my favorite chapters, including why falling in love with the problem is so important, how to find product market fit, a really clever tactic for firing people who aren't a fit for your company, a ton of really genius tactical advice for improving your fundraising pitch and so much more. With that, I bring you Uri Levine, and if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. Uri, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nUri Levine (00:02:17):\nThank you. Happy to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:18):\nOkay, so here's what I've gathered about your career, and let me know if I've missed anything. You've co-founded 10 different companies, including four you're still operating. You've been on the board of 20 companies. You've advised 50, maybe more, companies. You've also built two unicorns, including Waze, which you sold for over a billion dollars, which back then was an astronomical amount of money. It still is. So does that all sound right? Is there anything big I missed about your career?\n\nUri Levine (00:02:48):\nThat sounds about right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:49):\nI think what's really interesting to me is that from all of that experience, the biggest startup lesson you seem to have taken out of that is to fall in love with the problem. It's what your book is called. You have a T-shirt that you're wearing right now that you wear on every podcast that says that exactly. Clearly this lesson has struck a big chord with you. I'm curious if there's a moment where you realize that that's the core and that's something that every founder needs to get right. Is there an aha moment or is it kind of this progressive like, \"Oh, wow, maybe this is the secret.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:03:19):\nI'm not sure that this is a certain moment. I think that that was evolving over time and realizing that, look, at the end of the day, the entrepreneurship journey is about value creation. The simplest way to create value is solve a problem. That's the simplest way. And in my background, I'm an engineer always looking for the simplest way, and solve a problem is the simplest way, and so this is where fall in love with the problem coming from, and people occasionally would confuse the T-shirt with the book, and now the T-shirt is about 10 or even more years old and the book is only two years old, and so I was wearing those T-shirts for a long while before I wrote the book and when I wrote the book that was obvious that this is going to be the name of the book, but they are way more into that, right?\n\n(00:04:06):\nSo when you fall in love with the problem, then what happened is that the problem is going to serve as the North Star of your journey, and when you have a North Star, you're going to make less deviation from the course and you are way more likely to become successful. But also the story that you are about to tell is way more compelling. Just imagine that we will be here in 2007, just before I started Waze, and I will tell you I'm going to build an AI crowd-source based navigation system and you're going to say, \"Oh, yeah, very interesting,\" but you don't care. If I will tell you I'm going to help you to avoid traffic jams, then you do care, and when your customer cares, they want you to be successful, and when they want you to be successful, they are going to help you to become successful.\n\n(00:04:56):\nAnd so in that sense, fall in love with the problem is really a key to increase the likelihood of being successful. So in general, all of my startups start with a problem. Think of a problem, a big problem, something that it's worth solving, something that the world will become a better place if you solve that and then ask yourself, so who has this problem? If you happen to be the only person on the planet with this problem, I can recommend you a therapist. Don't build a startup. It's way more expensive and takes way longer period of time to build a startup. But if a lot of people actually have this problem, what you really want to do next is go and speak with those people and understand their perception of the problem and only then start to build the solution. If you follow this path and your solution works, it's guaranteed that you're creating value.\n\n(00:05:47):\nIf you start with a solution, you might be building something that no one cares and that's really frustrating. So fall in love with the problem. This is where you want to start. Now this is really hard because I am getting tons of emails every week from entrepreneurs and they all start with what we are doing and I don't really care what you're doing. What I really care about is why you are doing that, and this is the problem that you solve or the value that you create or the value that you create for me. This is what really matters, right? And so if you start your story with, \"Our company is,\" or, \"Our system is,\" and in the recent year everything is, \"Our AI system is,\" or, \"Our AI company is.\" But generally speaking, if you start your story with that, you focus on your solution. If you start with the story with, \"The problem we are solving is,\" Then you focus on the problem. If your story start with, \"The value that we create for you is,\" then you focus on the user. The last two are way better than focus on the solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I've been a super happy customer of Mercury for over a year now and it's honestly hard to imagine a better online banking experience can exist.

Members FDIC.\n\n(00:09:02):\nI want to follow a couple threads here because I imagine there's certain problems people fall in love with. \"Amazing. I want to solve this very obscure problem for my family or a friend of mine,\" and then they realize this is never going to be a huge venture scale business, if that's a goal of theirs. You talked about like, make sure enough people have this problem versus just getting a therapist that's going to help you with this problem. What are some signals and heuristics folks can use to help them understand this is a big enough problem that it's really worth their time?\n\nUri Levine (00:09:30):\nSo people ask me, \"So you send me to speak with users. How many?\" And I will tell them a hundred. You don't need a hundred, but the hundred basically say you need to get out of your comfort zone. It's not just your close friends and family that you need to discuss that. You need to discuss that with people that you don't know. And usually what happen is, and the validation is in most cases is really clear, right? If you tell someone, \"This is the problem I'm going to address,\" and they will tell you, \"Oh, I know someone that has this problem,\" it's not a real problem. If they will tell you, \"No, no, no, no, no. This is not the problem. The problem is,\" and they will give you their description of the problem. This is something that you really want to follow. So if you speak with a hundred people, but if you actually speak with 20 people that you don't know, you will get validated whether or not this problem is real or not.\n\n(00:10:23):\nAnd look, it's not the only way to become successful, right? You look at one of the most successful products in the world, the iPhone, right? And you ask yourself, what was exactly the problem when they started? And the answer is that there was no problem when they started. There were smartphones and people were actually very happy with them. And so occasionally we need to invent something completely new, but solving a problem is simply the simplest way to create value.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:53):\nAnother element of picking a problem to work on, so you say you fall in love with a problem. Is being excited to work on this problem. There's oftentimes problems you find that aren't that exciting to you or you're not excited to work on real estate software, but you find there's a big problem. How important is it that you're personally passionate and excited to work on this thing versus like, \"Oh, wow. This is a huge business opportunity. I got to go after it. It doesn't matter if I'm not that passionate about it.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:11:20):\nFall in love, right? This is really passionate. Really, really passionate. Look, the journey is really hard and complex and long and so you have to be in love in order to go into this journey because otherwise it's not going to be successful. You really want to be passionate. If you're not passionate about the problem, even though that the problem might be real and big and significant, there is not enough drive, there is not enough internal drive to take you through the hardship of the journey, and so you need to be passionate. You need to fall in love. You personally need to fall in love with the problem. And then actually what you're trying to do is engage everyone else to fall in love with the same problem, to go into this journey, into this path and follow your leadership there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:05):\nIs there an example of a pivot that you maybe went through where you realized the problem was not as big as you thought or you realized there's a bigger problem?\n\nUri Levine (00:12:13):\nSo actually there are many, right? So Oversee deals with maybe biggest secret in travel industry. What happened to airfare after you booked your flight? Now you have no idea because you never compare prices after you met the reservation. But you know that airfare is going up and down all the time. It's going up and down before you are making the reservation and keep on going up and down after you're making the reservation. So if this is the price that you paid and this is cancellation fees, if the price drops here, you can rebook the same flight at the cheaper price.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:48):\nGenius.\n\nUri Levine (00:12:49):\nIf you would only keep on comparing prices after that, right? So we started this company that is actually monitoring your own itinerary and we realized that this is going to be huge benefits to travelers and we started that as a B2C company, direct to consumers, and we realized that even though the people really care, they are not willing to take the action that is required, and we ended up with doing that for corporates, and in corporates there are very simple ways for them to engage that automatically, so automatic rebooking and so forth, and we can save corporates about 10% of the travel budget that goes directly to bottom line. So we started that as a B2C and then we realized that this is way harder than we think it is, and we ended up with converting that into B2B, which turns out to be very successful for us. And so occasionally there are companies that you start your journey with one perception and you change that and that will happen multiple times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:00):\nThat's an awesome example. I want to, before I move on to, I'm kind of thinking about this in the phases of starting a company. So we're talking right now about coming up with the idea that you want to commit to. A lot of people that want to start companies are not sure how to find a great idea, so the core advice you're sharing is find something, find a problem, and fall in love with solving that problem in whatever way you can. Do you have any other advice for helping somebody find a problem and finding a startup idea? Where do you find startup ideas? What do you find? What does work for you mostly?\n\nUri Levine (00:14:30):\nSo for me, it's usually personal frustration that leads me to start to think about it, whether or not we can change it. I hate traffic jams, right? I hate leaving money on the table, right? So there are many things that I ran into and I get frustrated and I tell myself, \"No, no, no. There must be a different way to do that.\" But in general, look, the problem itself needs to start from you, right? Something that really bothers you, something that you care about, and then it's the validations of the problem that you speak with many people, try to realize. Now if you'll tell me, oh, this is a B2B, then speak with many businesses, right? Speak with those that you believe actually do have this problem and I understand their perception.\n\n(00:15:13):\nOnce you validate that, then there are few things that you need to realize. One is about the journey itself. This is going to be a multi-dimensional journey. It's going to be at least three dimensions and maybe fourth, right? So the three dimensions, one of them is it's going to be a roller coaster journey with ups and downs and ups and downs. And look, if you'll tell me that all the businesses in the world have ups and downs, I agree, but the frequency of those when you are building a startup? Way higher. I think that I heard the best quote on that from Ben Horowitz, Ben Horowitz from Andreessen Horowitz venture capital firm, and before that he used to be a CEO of a startup and he was asked whether or not he was sleeping well at night and he said, \"Oh, yeah, I slept like a baby. I woke up every two hours and cried.\" And that's really the reality of that. The frequency of the differences are so dramatic that there is nothing compared to that, a roller coaster journey.\n\n(00:16:17):\nIt's also a journey of failures. Look, we are trying to build something new that no one did before, and even though that we think that we know exactly what we are doing, we don't. So we try. We try one thing and it doesn't work. We try another thing and it doesn't work. Or if we keep on trying different things until we find one thing that does work. Now, if you realize that this is going to be a journey of failures, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that if you're afraid to fail, then in reality you already failed because you are not going to try. Albert Einstein used to say that if you haven't failed, that because you haven't tried new things before. If you're going to try new things, you will fail. Michael Jordan used to say that, \"I've failed over and over and over and over again and this is what made me successful.\" And so this is the first conclusion.\n\n(00:17:07):\nThe second conclusion is that you really want to fail fast. Just think about it, right? If you fail fast, you still have plenty of time to try another attempt and build another version of the product. Try another go-to-market approach. Try a different business model so you still have plenty of time to make more and more and more attempts, and the more attempts that you have, you simply increase the likelihood of being successful. Just think that you play basketball, right, and you try to score from half court. If you have one shot and you are not Steph Curry, you are very likely to miss. But if you actually have a lot of shots, one of them you're going to make. That's it. Just think about it. The biggest enemy of good enough is perfect. You don't need to be perfect. You need to be good enough in order to win the market, and the way that you are going to become good enough, by the way, is really simple. You start with not good enough and you iterate and iterate and iterate until you become good enough and then you'll win.\n\n(00:18:10):\nThe third dimension is that this is going to be long journey. Very long. Way longer than you think it is. And the longest part of it is until you figure out product market fit, and product market fit goes into the different phases of building a company. To a certain extent, I would say, look, the difference between a corporate and a startup is that a corporate knows this is our value proposition, this is the product that we are selling, this is the pricing of this product that we are selling, this is the target audience, this is how we are going to sell them, this is how we going to the market, and all we have to do is keep on executing and hopefully nothing will change over the period of time. When you start as a startup, you don't have a product. You don't know what's the business model. You don't know what people are going to pay you for. You don't know how to grow your business, and you need to figure out all of those, and this is going to be a long journey.\n\n(00:19:11):\nNow, the longest part is usually figuring out product market fit and product market fit is really simple. That means that you create value to your customers. If you do not figure out product market fit, you will die. As simple as that. You never heard of a company that did not figure out product market fit. They simply died. That's it. Now, once they do, and for a second I want you to think of, with all the applications that you're using every day, right? From searching Google, using Waze, WhatsApp, Facebook, Netflix, Uber, whatever it is, and ask yourself what is the difference between any of those today and the first time that you have used that? And the answer is that there is no difference. We are searching Google today the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life. We're using Waze today the same way that we used Waze for the first time in their life. So once a company figure out product market fit, they don't change their product anymore because this is the value that they created to the customers and you don't want to change that.\n\n(00:20:14):\nWhat we don't know is how long did it take them to get to this point, right? Beforehand we never heard of them and after that they don't change that anymore. It's a matter of years. For Waze, it was four years. For Microsoft, it was five years. For Netflix, it was 10 years. Now if you'll tell me, \"Oh, today is very different. ChatGPT just started a year ago.\" No, they're seven years old. It took them six years until you heard about them for the first time in your life. So it does take time to create value and this is something that is really significant. Now, at the end of the day, product market fit have one metric. One metric. That's it. Retention. That's really simple. If you create value, they will come back. If they're not coming back, that means that you are not creating value. Now think about your episodes, right, of this podcast, right? Most of your listeners are returning, right? Because you create value for them and they are coming back. That's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):\n100%. Every single one, every episode.\n\nUri Levine (00:21:29):\nOccasionally there are new one, right?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:30):\nAnd there's new ones coming in all the time.\n\nUri Levine (00:21:32):\n[inaudible 00:21:32]. By the way, this is one thing that some businesses don't realize, whether or not their customers are going to be new customers or returning customers, and in many cases they simply fail to realize that upfront and the result is that they are not building the right go-to-market strategy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:56):\nWe covered a lot of ground there. That was amazing. I'm going to follow a number of threads of things you just touched on. You talked about product market fit briefly. What was the moment you felt product market fit with Waze? I don't know if I've ever heard that story.\n\nUri Levine (00:22:09):\nWe started in Israel and Israel is a small place and we ended up with being very successful in Israel and then we said, \"Wait a minute. Waze crowdsource all the data, right?\" Not just the traffic information and speed cams and so forth, but also the map data itself, so we can start from a blank page. And the users while they drive, they create the map and they create traffic information and so forth. And so we figure out that we can start anywhere and we made Waze global at the end of 2009 and we expect that to work the same way that it did in Israel, but it didn't. It was not good enough. It was not good enough in the U.S. It was not good enough in Western Europe. It was not good enough in Latin America, it was not good enough in Asia. It was not good enough anywhere that matters, right?\n\n(00:22:57):\nIt was actually good enough in about four places. In the Czech Republic, in Slovakia, in Latvia and Ecuador, and that's about it. Rest of the world not good enough. So what we did is we spoke with the drivers. Look, they wanted us to be successful. We basically said the drivers are going to fight traffic jams together, so common enemy, togetherness, all goodness. Everyone wanted that to work, right? So people downloaded the app and it simply was not good enough. So they churned, right, because if it's not good enough, you're not coming back. We spoke with them. We asked them what didn't work for them. They told us because they wanted it to work, and we built the next version addressing everything that they've told us, and we know that this is it, and it's not. So we doing it all over again. We speak with the drivers. We ask them what didn't work for them, they tell us. Now we build the next version and now we have the conviction that it's going to work and it's not. Journey of failures.\n\n(00:23:58):\nIteration after iteration after iteration after iteration. More than a year of iterations until beginning of 2011 that we actually started to see that working, and then it's in multiple places. In the U.S., one metropolitan after the other, right? Los Angeles first and then San Francisco and then Washington D.C. and Chicago and New York and Atlanta and so forth. In Europe, one country after the other. Italy first and then France and Netherlands and Sweden and Spain and one country after the other. In Latin America, one country after the other. Colombia first and then Chile and then Brazil and then Mexico and then rest of Latin America. In Asia, multiple countries one after the other. Not all of them, by the way. Not all of them. Japan is a very good example where it didn't work and it will never work. Waze crowdsourced the information, right? Which basically says that as soon as we get to the level of good enough, then we are good enough.\n\n(00:25:01):\nHouse numbering plan. In the U.S., it's really simple, right? Every block is a hundreth numbers, right? And so if I have the map, I can actually count the number of blocks and take you to approximate the right location even if I don't have exactly all the house numbers there. Most of the western world, it's a geographical order. So in Israel, this is going to be sequential order, odd number on one side of the street, even number on the other side of the street starting from one until the end of the street and so forth, so it's enough that I will have few house numbers that I can actually take you to the right place.\n\n(00:25:38):\nIn the UK, house number starts on one side off the street and then on the other side they are coming back, right? And so there is an order. In Japan, it's chronological order. The oldest house in the neighborhood is house number one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:54):\nOh, wow.\n\nUri Levine (00:25:56):\nAnd then the house number two can be miles away, but it's the second oldest house in the neighborhood and so you have to have all the house numbers unless... Until then you are not good enough. And crowdsource is, if you need perfect information, crowdsource may not be the right way to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:17):\nJust to close the loop on this question, when you were launching these markets and it wasn't working, were you actually looking at retention at that point, and if so, was there a number you were looking for? Or was it more qualitative like it's just taken off off into the right. Like where were you actually watching back in the early days?\n\nUri Levine (00:26:32):\nThat was easier for us because we tried to compare everything to Israel, so we looked at the frequency of use or when our people are coming back. How long does it take them until the next try and until the next try. And in generally speaking, if you look at something that have high frequency of use, then you will be looking at three-month retentions of 30, 40, 50% is actually pretty good indication. But usually what would happen is that you would know when they convert and that's going to be after the third or the fourth time, and if they're not getting to the fourth time, then they are basically saying, \"Okay. We gave it a try. We really like this story. We gave it another try, and it's not good enough.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:20):\nThat's a cool heuristic. Do you find that that is useful for other startups, consumer-type startups or is that just something you think specific to Waze at that point, this idea of coming back for the third time?\n\nUri Levine (00:27:29):\nIt's really depending on the frequency of use, right? If I will tell you that I have a startup that helps you to file your tax returns in three minutes, then okay, that's absolutely amazing, but you are only going to do that, next time is next year. By the way, we did have a startup that was doing that. It's still a little bit up and running, but that was really frustrating because the tax authority shut us down.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):\nYou got to fall in with the problem. You got to power through that. Just change the government. Just kidding. The story you told of Waze and iterating is a really good example of falling in love with the problem. You're really passionate about. I want to solve traffic, I hate traffic. By the way, what it made me think about a little bit is Elon, when he hated traffic, he built the boring company and built tunnels underground, and your solution to hate traffic is I'm going to build Waze in a soft wrap.\n\nUri Levine (00:28:29):\nWe start Waze with the vision that we are going to help people to avoid traffic jams. Now the reality is that there are more traffic jams today than there were in 2007. Obviously, number one, I'm not done. And number two, if you ask people what is the value of Waze, then it's not about avoiding traffic. It's about creating certainty and certainty is way higher value than saving time. So you know exactly when you're going to get there and this is a way higher value. And by the way, we learned that in the U.S. market when we spoke with people. They told us, \"If I am living in Cupertino and I need to drive up to San Francisco and I can take 101 or 280, I don't really want to change my route unless there is something dramatic, but what I really want to know is how long it's going to take me. So I'm going to stay on the 101. I'm not going to get into service road. I'm not going to take El Camino Real. I'm not going to try something else. I'm going to stay on the 101. Just let me know how long it's going to take.\" So certainty creates way more value than saving time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:44):\nI want to talk through a couple other of the chapters in your book. So chapter four is around the different phases of a startup journey and your core advice is that it's important to focus on one thing at a time in each of these phases, and the first phase, you call it the all over the place phase, I think, or yeah, the all over phase, and the idea is you need to get out of that as soon as you can and then focus. Can you just kind of talk through these different phases and what you think people do wrong along the phases? Maybe they get them wrong or they focus on the wrong things in each phase.\n\nUri Levine (00:30:17):\nSo initially you think about your new idea from multiple perspective, right? This is the problem. This is how this solution is going to look like. This is what I'm going to do next year. This is my 10 years vision. This is my business model and so forth. So you think about everything, but you actually need to execute only one thing. Now this one thing is figuring out product market fit. It's not one thing, right? Wait a minute. You also need to build an organization and you want that organization to be something that you really like and so there are a lot of operational stuff, but you need to figure out product market fit. As we said earlier, if you don't figure out product market fit, you will die. If you do, then you get to live and die another day and the other day is whether or not you're going to figure out how to grow your business and whether or not you're going to figure out your business model.\n\n(00:31:11):\nNow the good news is that I will tell you that if you create value, you will figure out a business model, at least for the people that you create value for them. They are most likely willing to pay. Now in general, I'm not saying that this is the only business model that is viable, but if you create value, you will figure out a business model. But figuring out a business model is a journey by itself, and guess what? It's going to be a long roller coaster journey of failures. When we started Waze, we thought that we're going to sell map data and traffic information and we ended up with doing advertisement. Very different business model. Because we realized that it's not for us. It's too long sales cycles. We were very mobile internet dynamic company and selling to government is not exactly what we wanted to do, and so we ended up with a different business model, but with a lot of reasoning why this is the right business model for us.\n\n(00:32:14):\nAnd figuring out growth, look, if I would ask a hundred people on the street, how did you hear about Waze? They, 95 of them, if not 99 of them, will tell me, \"Someone told me.\" Word-of-mouth, right? So everyone wants to have word-of-mouth. Word-of-mouth you can only have if you have high frequency of use. If you're doing tax returns once a year, even if you really like the experience, then once a year you're going to tell someone else. If you're using Waze every day, then every day you have an opportunity to tell someone else. So word-of-mouth, even though that everyone would like that, it's only going to happen if you have high frequency of use.\n\n(00:33:01):\nSo those phases requires different focus of the company, right? Initially if you focus on product market fit, then you don't need sales. You have no product to sell. You don't need business development. You don't need even marketing. You need product. You need developers and you need product lead to define the product and lead through the iterations of the product until we get to the level that it's good enough. Once you get there, you shift gears. If the product doesn't change, if we search Google the same way that we searched Google for the first time in our life, then the product development is now not going to be focused about value creation. It's going to be focused about either figuring out business model or figuring out scale, and the entire company shift gears and move to a different phase.\n\n(00:33:54):\nNow, this is really hard. Just think about it. If up until now the product development group was the only things that matters, all of a sudden we think about marketing now because we are now in the go-to-market phase that this is the most important thing of the company. Occasionally I found companies that have challenging and shifting gears so they didn't figure out where the clutch is and you have to because otherwise you're stuck in the previous phase that you kind of finished that journey. This journey is nearly done and you need to shift gears, and if you don't do that, then you get stuck. If you do that, if you try to do multiple things at the same time, you will fail. Focus is not about what we are doing, it's about what we are not doing. These are the hard decisions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:50):\nI like that. So the four phases, just to briefly summarize, it's kind of like come up with the idea, find product market fit, then it's a question of should you keep focusing on growth or should you figure out the business model before focusing heavily on growth? In your advice, it sounds like if it's high frequency, word-of-mouth driven, focus on growth and then you figure out business model later. If not, figure out how you're going to make money and then figure out growth.\n\nUri Levine (00:35:14):\nExactly. Because if you have high frequency of use, you will end up with growth coming by itself, right, for word-of-mouth, and therefore you should do that at the beginning. If you don't have high frequency of use, you are sentenced to acquire users or customers all of your lifetime. If this is the case, then you really want to figure out the business model before you start and go and do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:41):\nThat's really helpful. I think actually a counter example to your point about how frequency of use is necessary for word-of-mouth growth is Airbnb. Something like 70% of Airbnb growth is word-of-mouth and frequency of use is actually really low. It's like once or twice a year. I wonder if it's because the experience is so unique and special that it still works and enough people travel enough times, slash if it was a higher frequency, it would've grown even faster, I imagine.\n\nUri Levine (00:36:09):\nHigh frequency of use is the simplest way for word-of-mouth. The other thing is coolness. If it's really cool, then you'll tell more people, and Airbnb was really cool at the beginning of the journey, so now everyone knows about Airbnb, but when they started that was way cheaper and really unique experience than hotels.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:36):\nIt's still actually mostly word-of-mouth. I think it was probably higher initially, but it's still almost 70, 80% driven by word-of-mouth. So it's still cool enough. Good for them. You have a couple of quotes that I wanted to share, which are along the lines of things you shared. One is just, you have this kind of, what's the most important stage at a company? They all are, but one at a time. I love that line. The other is the main thing is to keep the main thing the main thing. The same advice you just shared. Just like focus. So you're in the PM, product market fit phase. Focus on that. Don't think about growth yet. Don't think about business model yet necessarily. I know investors are going to push you to figure these things out and you'll have to have some story of like, \"Here's how it might make money. Here's how we think we're going to grow.\" Right? You need to think about that a little bit, but maybe don't make that the focus.\n\nUri Levine (00:37:22):\nSo this is one of the areas that investors don't like to hear the truth, right? The truth is that I don't know how I'm going to bring the users. I will figure that out once I get there, but the reality is that right now I don't know, but they don't want to hear that. What they want to hear is that, \"Oh, I know exactly how I'm going to bring them.\" And what I will say is that I know exactly where I'm going to start my experiments, but most of the investors would like to see a coherent story that makes sense, right? This is our business model. This is how we going to make money. This is what we're going to sell. This is how much they're going to pay. This is why it's a simple business model and these are the comparable to this business model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:03):\nYeah. But investors have the final word, unfortunately. They decide if they want to invest or not, and so if your story is not compelling, they're going to be like, \"All right. We'll find someone else.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:38:13):\nYou know, it's seasonality, right? There are periods of time that raising capital is easier and then many of the entrepreneurs will be choosers are not beggars, and there are periods of time that is that way around, and most of the entrepreneurs will be beggars and not choosers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:33):\nImagine a place where you can find all your potential customers and get your message in front of them in a cost-efficient way. If you're a B2B business, that place exists, and it's called LinkedIn. LinkedIn Ads allows you to build the right relationships, drive results, and reach your customers in a respectful environment. Two of my portfolio companies, Webflow and Census are LinkedIn success stories. Census had a 10x increase in pipeline with the LinkedIn startup team. For Webflow, after ramping up on LinkedIn in Q4, they had the highest marketing source revenue quarter to date. With LinkedIn Ads, you'll have direct access to and can build relationships with decision makers including 950 million members, 180 million senior execs and over 10 million C-level executives. You'll be able to drive results with targeting and measurement tools built specifically for B2B.\n\n(00:39:24):\nIn tech, LinkedIn generated two to five x higher return on ad spend than any other social media platforms. Audiences on LinkedIn have two times the buying power of the average web audience, and you'll work with a partner who respects the B2B world you operate in. Make B2B marketing everything it can be and get $100 credit on your next campaign. Just go to LinkedIn.com/podLenny to claim your credit. That's LinkedIn.com/podLenny. Terms and conditions apply.\n\n(00:39:52):\nLet's actually talk about fundraising as a topic I wanted to spend a little time on. How much money have you raised for the companies that you've started total, roughly?\n\nUri Levine (00:40:02):\nSo Waze raised about $50 million throughout the entire journey. We started by raising 12. That was the first investment round, and then we raised the 30, and then there was the last round that we raised actually not a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:23):\nThat's a surprising small amount of money to raise for the outcome.\n\nUri Levine (00:40:28):\nIn general, I would say Israeli startups are leaner than American startups, so you can raise less money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:36):\nYeah, that's amazing.\n\nUri Levine (00:40:37):\nAt way lower valuation, unfortunately, and end up with pretty successful results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):\nThat's amazing.\n\nUri Levine (00:40:45):\nRaising capital, it's a journey by itself and different from the other journeys that you need only once. Raising capital is going to happen multiple times. And if we say that building a startup is a roller coaster journey, then I will say raising capital is a roller coaster journey in the dark.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):\nIt's like Space Mountain.\n\nUri Levine (00:41:09):\nYeah, sort of. And one of the reason is that this is a different ballgame and you don't know how to play at the beginning. I would say a few things about raising capital for the first time. Number one, I spoke with many investors and one of the conversations that I had that they really, really resonate with me was when I spoke with one of the leading VC in Israel and asked their partner, \"How long does it take you to decide if you like the entrepreneur or not?\" And he asked me, \"Do you want the right answer or the real answer?\" Say, \"You know, I heard the right answer so many times, give me the real answer.\" And we were sitting in a small meeting room, so the guy is looking at me and then looking at the door and looking at me again and say, \"It's before they sit down.\" Say, \"Oh, no, no, no. Say that again, right?\"\n\n(00:42:02):\nThat's the first impression. Now we all have first impression. How long does it take you to decide if you like a candidate or not? Second, you go on a date. How long does it take you to decide if you like the date? Seconds. And then maybe there are a few more minutes that you allow yourself to either change your mind or let that first impression solidifies. Now if this is the case and you're looking to raise capital, start with the strongest point at the beginning. Whatever it is, and I don't care if this is the size of the problem. This is the faction that you have. This is the team that you have built. I don't care what it is, start with that, because by the time you'll get there, they might be already setting up their mind. Then start with the strongest point at the beginning. And by the way, finish with that as well.\n\n(00:42:53):\nSo this is the first conclusion. The second conclusion is that I spoke with early stage investors, those that invest the first money in. So company has a story to tell. That's about it, right? No traction, nothing yet is built and so forth, and I asked him, \"Why did you decide to invest in this company and this company and this company?\" And I spoke with many investors, and what I heard was actually pretty consistent. I like the CEO. I like the story. That's it. I like the CEO. I like the story. Now if this is the case, then there are two immediate conclusions. The first one is that the CEO goes alone to the meeting. I need the headlight on me. I don't need any distractions. I don't need my team members. I don't need anything else in the room, just me. Because if I bring other people, then at the end of the day they might say, \"Yeah, I like the team, but the CEO was not specific, right? Was not unique. Was not jumping out of the pages.\" So CEO goes along and tell the story.\n\n(00:44:02):\nThe other part is that they need to tell a good story, and good story is not about facts. It's about creating emotional engagement. It's about creating the sense that the listener would like to be part of this story. And for investor, it's two things. Number one is that they want to believe that this is usable, and number two, they want to believe that you can build it and this is the story that you need to tell. Now, I would say always start with the problem, right? Because guess what? Investors are also users. If they don't think that they're going to use it, so it's relevant for them, and they don't think that they're going to use it? They will basically dismiss that. They will basically say the market is not there.\n\n(00:44:52):\nSo these are two main things. The third thing is it's a different ball game, right? So if you have product and you tell the story to potential customers, the right order of magnitude is that about one third of the listeners will buy. So in a more mature company, their pipeline is going to be three eggs in order to sell at the end of the year one eggs. One third are going to say yes. In investors, it's 1%. Not one third, 1%. So you're going to hear a hundred times no until you hear one yes. And that a hundred times no is something that you need to understand from the beginning because that's really discouraging, right? You go and speak with investors and they tell you... I call that they open up the big book of excuses why not. But in general, they are not going to invest, right?\n\n(00:45:54):\nNow you look at it from the other side, a venture capital partner is likely to see between a hundred and 200 companies a year and invest in one or two. 1%. That's it. So if this is the case, then it's going to be the same case for you. One out of a hundred. If you want to increase the likelihood, learn how to tell a good story, start at the strongest point at the beginning, remember that they are users, too, so their emotional engagement is going to come through the usage, the use case, and not through how big the business is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:34):\nI love the summary at the end. I love that you summarized your points, because I try to do that. You did my job. I love this phrase you have in your book, \"The dance of 100 nos.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:46:44):\nAt the beginning you look at it and you say, \"Okay, they say they decided not to invest because of X, Y, Z,\" right? Whatever it is, right? Google can do that in no time or the market is not big enough or the market is complex or whatever it is, and then you try to argue, and you don't know that it's useless, right? It's like you go on a date and she said no, and you try to argue, right? No, there is nothing to argue anymore, right? That's no.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:16):\nYeah. I look at a lot of startups too. I do a bunch of angel investing, and yeah, if it's not going to be a fit, it's just not going to work, and I could spend all this time trying to explain it to you, but nothing's going to change. And because there's other startups out there is a big part of it, right? You just want to pick the things you can that are the best, not necessarily things that are good ideas. I really like this idea of starting with your strongest point. That's such an important tactical piece of advice. To your point, investors make decisions really quickly, and so starting with something that really catches their attention, it makes so much sense because once you feel like, \"Oh, wow, maybe this is a thing,\" your whole brain is starting to look at it from a, oh, yeah, okay, like you have a positive bend on everything you're hearing versus like, \"No, no, no, this is never going to work and everything is already biased.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:48:00):\nSo I would add here another very strong advice. Most people are missing the most important slide of their presentation. The most important slide of your presentation is the first slide, not the one that you think about it. The first slide. The one that says Company XYZ intro. This slide is going to be presented for the longest period of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:29):\nWow, that's a good point.\n\nUri Levine (00:48:31):\nThe longest period of time in the presentation, this slide is going to be presented on the screen and you didn't say anything there. This is the place that you're going to put your strongest point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):\nI love that. Is there an example of someone that did that or did you do that, one of your startups? What do you put there?\n\nUri Levine (00:48:51):\nI do that all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:52):\nWhat's an example of something you put on that slide that's such a good idea?\n\nUri Levine (00:48:56):\nMaybe size of the market. Maybe description of the problem. Whatever it is, right, the strongest point is there. Now the second most important slide is the last one. Not the summary. The one that says thank you. That's the time to repeat that. So most of their presentations will end up with thank you and my email, right, and this is going to be the last slide, right? Which makes sense. You just missed the opportunity. This is going to be the second-longest displayed slide of the presentation. Maybe the first.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:39):\nYeah. Everyone's sitting there chatting, asking you questions. That's so smart. Are there any more of these tips sitting in your head to share, because these are awesome.\n\nUri Levine (00:49:48):\nI do a lot of public speaking and usually my last slide says one more story and I decide on the story based on the audience and the dialogue so far and so forth. But I have many of stories, many last stories that I would like to tell. The important part is that no one is going to cut you off the stage if you have just one more story, and so this is where you can recap everything. This is where you can do whatever you want, right? Because no one is going to tell you, \"Okay, time is up.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:26):\nRight, and they're not impatient because they're like, \"Okay, it's almost over. Let's just let him finish.\"\n\nUri Levine (00:50:30):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:31):\nYeah. I love that. Speaking of stories, what's the wildest fundraising story that you've been through? Is there one that comes to mind of like, \"Holy shit. I can't believe that happened,\" or, \"I can't believe that worked out\"?\n\nUri Levine (00:50:43):\nOne of the earlier startups that I was guiding was about, eventually rolled into gift cards, but in Israel, when you return something to the store, you don't get your money back. What you get is a gift card for that particular store, right, and obviously if you return something, then it's not necessarily that you have something to buy in the store and you ended up with having a gift card that is never being used, and so why not sell this gift card? What happened is that I heard the story of the CEO and I thought that the story is not good enough, and I told him, \"Look, you have to tell a better story,\" and asked, \"Can you give me an example?\" And I said, \"Yeah, just imagine that,\" and then there was a long story about the microwave stuff working, and I bought a new one and really long, long, long story about with the details, right? How do you make a story make believe? With details. Right? The more details people think that this is real. Right?\n\n(00:51:48):\nIf there are no details, then this is not real. So I told him this story that was like five minutes explaining, trying to fit the microwave into the closet and it didn't fit in into the cabinet, and it didn't fit in, and I had to return it to the box and so forth and whole story. And then I spoke with an investor in Israel and I told him about this new company that I'm going to invest, and I told him the same story about this microwave, right, and he said, \"This is interesting. I would like to meet the CEO.\" Then he met the CO and CEO told him exactly the same story about the microwave. When I tell that, this is my microwave, right?This is personal. This has happened to me. And so he told me, the investor called me up later, he said, \"He told me exactly the same story.\" So that was really funny.\n\n(00:52:44):\nBut at the end of the day, one of the things that makes story authentic is details, because otherwise it's not, right? If you're going to tell me, okay, this is the use case of the product and you end up with explaining a use case in three lines, this is not authentic. If you watch your real users, then what happens is that you actually, and you speak with them, then you have the audacity to tell a good story. Really, really critical. If you want to tell user story, these needs to be, real or you have to learn how to tell a story with many details.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:29):\nBut interestingly, it sounds like the story itself doesn't have to have happened to you in real life. It could be a made-up story, but with a lot of details is the lesson there. Interesting.\n\nUri Levine (00:53:38):\nYep. If you tell it very briefly, then it doesn't sound right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:46):\nAmazing. Any other advice along those lines? I want to talk about two more chapters before we wrap up. Is there anything else around fundraising that you think is important for people to know?\n\nUri Levine (00:53:54):\nSo I will tell you which chapters I would like to speak about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:57):\nLet's do it. I wonder what they are. I wonder if they're the same.\n\nUri Levine (00:54:02):\nUnderstanding users and firing and hiring.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:04):\nOkay, firing and hiring. That was on my list. Okay. Let's start there and then understanding users wasn't, but I'm excited to hear what you have to say there.\n\nUri Levine (00:54:14):\nSo I send the book proposal to many publisher, and there is one chapter that says firing and hiring, and many of them came back and say, \"Oh, it should be hiring and firing.\" And I said, \"No. Firing is hard decision. Hiring is easy decisions.\" You have to first of all learn how to make the hard decisions. Now, the inspirations for this chapter came from many dialogues that I had with entrepreneurs that their startup failed, and I asked them, \"Why, what happened?\" And about half told me the team was not right, and I kept on asking, \"Okay, what do you mean the team was not right?\" And what I heard the most is, \"We had this guy not good enough and this guy not good enough.\" So this is what I heard the most.\n\n(00:54:58):\nAnother thing that I heard quite often is that we had communication issues, right? Something that I actually called ego management issues. And then asked them the most interesting question, \"When did you know that the team is not right?\" Now the answer was actually rather scary. All of them told me within the first month. Then you said, \"Wait a minute. If you knew within the first month that the team is not right and you didn't do anything, the problem was not that the team was not right. The problem was that the CEO did not make hard decision.\" Making hard decisions is hard. Making easy decisions. This is why no one likes to make the hard decisions, because you need to live with the consequences. In a small place like a startup, the hard decisions will always go to the top. Now, if the CEO does not make that hard decisions, the result is always the same. The top performing people would leave. Now, they would leave because they don't want to be in a place that is unable to make hard decisions and they have a choice.\n\n(00:56:02):\nThe nature of the beast is different. Startup is a small organization. Just imagine that you are a small organization, like could be a team, whatever it is, right? 10, 20, 30 people, and there is someone that shouldn't be there, and I don't care if that someone shouldn't be there because they are way underperforming or because they are assholes. I don't really care. They shouldn't be there. Everyone knows. Everyone knows and the CEO doesn't do anything. That's the nature of the beast and this is why top performing people would leave. Now, building a startup is really, really hard, right? It's hard if you have the right team, but if you have people that shouldn't be there that are still there and the top performing people are leaving, then it's going to be mission impossible. The conclusion of this chapter is really, really interesting. If everyone knows within a month and every time that you hire someone new, what I really want you to do is mark your calendars for 30 days down the road and ask yourself one question, \"Knowing what I know today, would I hire this person?\"\n\n(00:57:16):\nAt the end of the day, I'd like to nail that into yes or no, right? Because this is where decisions are being made easily. If you ask yourself that question, if the answer is yes, then go to this person and tell them that you are really excited that they've joined, they are exceeding your expectations, and give them more equity, and you buy their loyalty for life. If the answer is no, fire them immediately. They're already set on a trajectory of not being successful and they're creating damage to you, to the rest of the team and to themselves, right? They deserve to be successful, but it's not going to happen here. They deserve to find someplace else that they can be successful, but it's not going to happen here, and that decision is really, really dramatic.\n\n(00:58:08):\nNow, in many cases with hard decisions, we know what is the right decisions. We are looking for confirmation. If you look for confirmation, then go and speak with the top performing people and tell them, ask them the following, right? \"Assuming XYZ person is going to leave, how sore are you going to feel?\" And you will be surprised that they are going to tell you, \"Oh, it's not a big deal.\" This is your confirmation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:40):\nYeah. We had Elizabeth Stone from Netflix, the CTO of Netflix on, and she talked about this thing they called a keeper test, which is exactly that, where every manager is always asking themselves, \"If this person were to leave tomorrow and tell me they're leaving, would I fight to keep them? And if not, I should just, I need to let them go,\" and that's always top of mind for managers there.\n\nUri Levine (00:58:59):\nYou know, one of my companies had a pretty good year and they decided to have an annual bonuses by and large to nearly all of the employees. And then I asked the CEO, \"So how did you end up with the list?\" And he said, \"Okay. We had these people that getting twice as much the others, and then the others, and then there are four people that are not going to get anything.\" And I asked them, \"Are they still here?\" They shouldn't be here, right? If they are so much underperforming, then they shouldn't be here. But generally you need the time to ask yourself the tough questions because only then you can answer them, right? If you don't ask the tough questions, then you don't answer them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:49):\nYeah. I really love this very tactical piece of advice, which I was definitely going to touch on, of putting a calendar entry into your calendar when you hire someone 30 days in to remind yourself, asking yourself, \"Would I hire this person knowing what I know now? And if not, you should probably let them go.\"\n\nUri Levine (01:00:06):\nBy the way, I can tell you that for everything in your life, right? Everything in your life, ask yourself, \"Knowing what you know today, would you do something different?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):\nWow.\n\nUri Levine (01:00:17):\nIf the answer is yes, then do something different today. Today is the first day of the rest of your life.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:23):\nThat is powerful advice. So what I'm thinking there is if I bought something, maybe return it. What else have you applied that to in your life?\n\nUri Levine (01:00:31):\nRelationship in general. Directions that you're going, right? Do you still like that? I have five children and they're all in their twenties and beginning of thirties and they struggle with their career path, and I basically tell them, \"Look, if you are going to work in a place and you don't like it, then what I want you to do is ask yourself why you are not liking it and whether or not there is something that you can change, and I'm going to ask you the same question in 90 days from now, and if this still is the case, then quit.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):\nIt's interestingly you make that 90 days, which it kind of applies some decisions. You need to wait a little bit more. You need more data. You need more time than necessarily 30 days, but set some kind of timeline.\n\nUri Levine (01:01:24):\nIf you don't set a timeline, it'll never happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:28):\nI think the other really interesting implication here is most decisions are a two-way door. Most decisions, you can change your mind. You can quit. You can leave a relationship. I was thinking you were going to say with your five kids 30 days after they're born, \"Do I still want this kid 30 days with knowing what I know now?\" I'm glad you didn't go there.\n\nUri Levine (01:01:52):\nNo, this is different, right? You go into this journey of having children with the understanding that this is long journey. Go into this journey of building a startup with the understanding that this is a long journey, right? The fact that it's going to be hard? Okay, so it's hard. It is hard, by the way. But yeah, the decisions that obviously they need to be relative to their duration, right? So yeah, raising kids is a long journey.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:29):\nAnd a one-way door, also. Is there anything else you wanted to say around the hiring and firing concept? Clearly firing is the main lesson here, is get really good at firing, firing quickly and decisively.\n\nUri Levine (01:02:41):\nYou know, there are tons of advices in the book and eventually I will tell, even in the hiring process, right, most of us are going to interview candidates and then decide that they like or dislike the candidate, but they don't know. Then speak with someone that does know. Speak with the reference.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:02):\nDo you have a favorite question you like to ask references? Is there something that you find is really helpful to tell you? Give you honest insight?\n\nUri Levine (01:03:09):\nFor reference?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):\nYeah.\n\nUri Levine (01:03:11):\nThat's really simple. Would you hire him? Or would you hire her, right? So essentially at the end of the day you want to nail it into yes or no.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:26):\nYeah. And hope that they're being honest. That's sometimes a challenge.\n\nUri Levine (01:03:31):\nNo, if they will tell me yes, then I would ask them, \"Why didn't you?\" Someone asked me for a reference on someone that I really enjoyed working with. I really think highly of them, and he asked me if they can schedule a call for half an hour and I said, \"Look, I'm traveling. I don't really have time. But if you want an email in one word, take the guy.\" And then he was trying to outsmart and ask me back, \"Can I have that in two words?\" And I said, \"Yeah, take the guy fast.\" When you know, you know. That's it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:07):\nI like that. That's what you want to be looking for. Okay. Amazing. So let's do one more chapter. The one I was going to pick, you choose what you're more excited about, is selling a company. Your last chapter exit. The one you were thinking about going to is talking to users. I imagine that's much more applicable to more people, so that's probably the better choice, but your choice.\n\nUri Levine (01:04:28):\nOkay, then let's stick with understanding users. Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple, wrote the foreword to my book and he called it the Bible for entrepreneurs, and when I sent him the first chapter, he said, \"Wow, I wish I had that When I started.\" I met Steve Wozniak for the first time about 10 years ago. We spoke at the same conference in Guatemala, and look, when I grew up, Steve Wozniak was my technological guru, right so he was the most important person in the technology space in my mind. And then we spoke at the same conference and we had dinner the night before, and the only thing that actually was really important for me is to have a selfie with my idol, right? And so I took up my iPhone and with the iPhone you can take pictures by clicking here on the screen or using the volume button on the side, right?\n\n(01:05:34):\nAnd so I took a selfie with him holding the phone like that and clicking on the volume button and he said, \"Finally.\" And I said, \"Finally what?\" \"Finally someone using it the way that I meant it to be.\" Now you realize that there is no right or wrong. There are different people that are using different products in different ways, and occasionally if I would have large audience, then I would ask the people, \"Okay, how do you use Waze?\" Right? \"So you go to your destination and you enter destination, and then Waze guides you through the screen with the display of the maneuvers that needs to be made or with the audio guidance of turn right, turn left and so forth. If you are watching the screen, raise your hand.\" And then I would have about 70% of the people raise their hand.\" Then I ask people to watch around them and see those people. Then I ask, \"If you are listening to the audio prompt, raise your hand.\" Then I have about 20 or 30 more percent of the people raising their hand. And again, I send people to watch around and see those hands.\n\n(01:06:41):\nThere is no right or wrong. Different people are using it differently. Now, if you are using Waze in a certain way, up until this moment, you didn't know that there are other people that are using it differently, and to be frank, you don't care. You getting your own value the way that you get it, then you don't really care that there are other people that are getting it differently. But if you are building a product and you don't know that, then you are building the wrong product. You don't know that there are other people that are not like you, and you think that you're building the product for yourself, then you're making a big mistake. And the way to figure it out is, by the way, two things. Number one, watch new users. Simply watch users and see what they're doing. And number two, if they're not doing what you expect them to do, then ask them why, because this why is the one that is going to make your product successful. You understand the why and the next version you're going to address that.\n\n(01:07:42):\nNow, this is in particular when it comes to understanding users. Obviously there are a lot of users, but we can group them into several groups of their ability to adapt something new, and something new is not necessarily new technology. We think about it as a new technology, but it's not necessarily about technology. It's about new behavior, right? And then we look at the entire population and every time that we look into large numbers, they will have normal distribution, right? So the bell curve of the distribution, and then we will have about 2% of the populations that they're the innovatives. The innovatives are going to use something new because it's new. That's it. They care about this subject and they going to be the first one to hear about it and they're going to try that out because it's new. The second group is usually what we will get to see as the first users are the early adapters. As soon as they realize that there is value, they're going to give it a try. And if there is value, then they will keep on using it, and if there is no value, then they will quit. Right?\n\n(01:08:55):\nThe third group is the most important group. This is where market leaders are, right? This is called the early majority. This is about one third of the population, and the one that wins the early majority wins the market. The challenge with this group, with the people in this group, is that they're afraid of change. So their state of mind is, don't rock the boat. Whatever I'm currently doing is good enough for me. So if you have Salesforce.com, which is absolutely amazing, their reaction is going to be, \"What's wrong with Excel?\" And because they're afraid of change, they are not going to try something new. Now the reason is that at the end of the day, they're afraid that this is going to be too complex for them and they will not get it, and they don't want to be embarrassed and they don't want to feel like idiots. And guess what? People don't like to feel like idiots, and so they are not going to try. And you need to see those people to understand their barriers for starting to use your service.\n\n(01:10:02):\nAnd by the way, the solution is always the same. Simplicity. Leonardo da Vinci said that simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. If you want to make it simple, in your journey of building a product, we basically say this is iteration to iteration to iteration. In many of those you add features and you add features and you add features until you all of a sudden you add the features that people are using. What you really want to do next is remove the rest of the features that people are not using because they're adding complexity. Now, most of the product owners, they're either innovators or early adopters. You cannot understand an early majority person. If you belong to one group, you cannot understand a person from that group unless you watch them and [inaudible 01:10:57]. So the most important part of understanding users is actually seeing those users. And they are not wrong. This is how they behave.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:09):\nSo a couple of threads there I'll pull out. One is look for surprising uses of your product because, as you said, you'll realize, \"Oh, some people are using this in a way that I didn't expect,\" and it'll remind you people are not the way you are and don't assume that they're going to want exactly what you're building, so pay attention to things that surprise you. We had Jeffrey Moore on the podcast and he talked through a lot of this stuff, and one of the lessons there to help you bridge that gap from, to the, what is it, the third group? How did you describe it? The late majority?\n\nUri Levine (01:11:42):\nThe early majority.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:42):\nThe early majority.\n\nUri Levine (01:11:44):\nLate majority will never use the product. They will use your product only if they have to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:45):\nYeah. The laggards, I think he calls it. They look for basically references. People telling them, \"Hey, you really need to use this.\" A lot of people, just like basically word-of-mouth is the way you described it.\n\nUri Levine (01:11:58):\nNo, not just word-of-mouth. Even occasionally someone to show them how to use it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:03):\nYeah. That makes sense. Just like, \"Here, check out Waze. Here's how it works.\" Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay. Amazing. Is there anything else along those lines as you're talking to customers and understanding what you're looking for that you want to share?\n\nUri Levine (01:12:17):\nOccasionally what happens is that we speak with the wrong customers. So just imagine that we have what I call funnel of use, right? So on top of the funnel, we have people that are download the app, let's say, or have entered their website, and then the next phase is that they registered and the next phase that they're trying to use it for the first time and then the next phase is that they're getting the value and they're coming back, right? In this funnel, what we usually try to do is speak with the users at the bottom of the funnels, those that were successful. But in order to improve, we need to speak with those that fail, those that were unsuccessful, those that did not register, or they did register and did not use, or they did use and did not come back, because they know something that we really need to know. Why? This why is what makes a great product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:19):\nInteresting. I imagine you could also fall into danger there if people that just aren't a fit for your product, there's just no point wasting your time on people that are just not going to be a fit. So is the idea there find people that are really far down the funnel but still bounced and churned?\n\nUri Levine (01:13:34):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:34):\nAwesome. Amazing. Okay. So we've gone through all the chapters I was hoping to go through, plus the ones you were excited about. Final thing before we get to our very exciting lightning round, we have a segment on this podcast called Fail Corner, where I ask a guest to share a time they failed in their career and what they learned from that experience, and I'm curious if there is a story that comes to mind of a time that you failed either in a startup or as you were an employee somewhere and how that was important to you.\n\nUri Levine (01:14:05):\nSo number one, I reserve the right for my biggest failure yet to come. And look, I keep on trying new things. I keep on doing things, and so eventually I will fail as much as... Maybe I'm more successful statistically than others, but I will fail, and this is very, very important part to realize. Don't be afraid to fail, right? In your journey, you're going to fail multiple times, and when you fail and get up, you get up stronger. This is maybe something that I will tell all the parents in the world. The biggest advice that I can give you is teach your children to fail. Because when they get up, they get up stronger, and when they know that they will get out of their comfort zone and they will eventually discover what makes them happy. At the end of the day, as parents, there's only one thing that we really like. We want our kids to be happy in their own way. We don't know what it is. They don't know what it is. We want them to explore, and they will only explore if they are not afraid to fail.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:18):\nYeah. This is a very timely advice for me because our kid is always falling down and it's always this balance between helping them not fall and letting them figure things out.\n\nUri Levine (01:15:27):\nLet them fall. There is a Japanese saying, fall seven times and get up eight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:36):\nUri, is there anything else that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nUri Levine (01:15:43):\nNo, I think that was actually, I really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:45):\nAmazing. Well, we're not done yet. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nUri Levine (01:15:50):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:51):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people other than your own book?\n\nUri Levine (01:15:58):\nMark Randolph of Netflix. That Will Never Work, right? And by the way, it's funny. Mark Randolph wrote endorsement to my book and I reached out to him because I read someplace that he's answering all of his emails, and I reached, I sent him an email and said, \"Look, we have at least three things in common. Number one, I do answer all of my emails as well. Number two, I'm using your product, you are using mine. And number three, I heard more time that will never work than you did.\" And I think that understanding this journey is really, really important, so this is definitely a book that I would recommend. Atomic Habits. Getting habits and improving them, measuring and improving, is really, really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):\nVery cool choices. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nUri Levine (01:17:02):\nI don't watch a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:05):\nEasy, then. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nUri Levine (01:17:11):\nSo I can bet that most of the people say the ChatGPT, but actually no. I recently downloaded the Chess App and I returned to play chess with the computer or something that I haven't done for so many years, and I really enjoy that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:30):\nAmazing. It's actually, I don't think ChatGPT has ever been recommended. Recent choices have been a beautiful Persian rug, a Rivian, a very nice Mercedes, and I think recently it was a course on nervous system regulation.\n\nUri Levine (01:17:48):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:49):\nAll over the place. Two final questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you find really useful in work, your own life? It may be the one on your shirt, but is there any other that you come back to often and find useful?\n\nUri Levine (01:18:03):\nDon't be afraid to fail. I think that in many cases we need to accept the fact that we don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:10):\nImportant words. Final question, is there a problem you're starting to fall in love with more recently, maybe tinkering with a new startup idea? Or are you done with starting companies?\n\nUri Levine (01:18:21):\nI probably will never be done. I have 10 different startups in multiple areas. One of them, Pontera helps people to retire richer, which is one of the biggest challenges in the world in general, but also in the U.S. If I would ask a hundred people on the street that have 401k plans, \"What is your 401k plan invested at?\" 95% of them will tell me, \"I don't know.\" I do know, by the way. In the default. Whatever was the default when they joined, right? Now obviously if you didn't do anything and you think it's right, no, it's not right. It's probably simply not enough. So this is a big problem. I have one in the medical space that is trying to create, I would call that the AI of the medical knowledge, so trying to improve doctors, and in particular in clinical decisions. That is going to change the world.\n\n(01:19:27):\nBut if you would ask me, then I will give you some examples, right? So mobility is still a problem, right? You look at many areas in our lifetime and mobility is still, every year it's, instead of getting better, it's getting lesser. So mobility is still a problem. And medical services, right? U.S. medical services are five to 10 times more expensive than they are in Germany. Now, it's not that they're better. They're simply more expensive. So obviously you ask yourself, \"Okay, where is this inefficiency? Where is it?\" Right? A lot of places of inefficiency in the medical services if they're so expensive. Education. Okay. Anything that I will tell you that we are still doing the same way that our parents did is probably something that we need to revisit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:22):\nI feel like I nerd sniped you with falling in love with problems. Clearly fall in love with a lot of problems. You want to solve them all. You're addicted to startups.\n\nUri Levine (01:20:29):\nThe good news is that there are a lot of problems and the bad news that there are lots of problems.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:34):\nAnd you're there to solve it. I love it. Uri, your book is amazing. It's incredibly practical, full of tons of advice that every founder should read, and it goes from idea all the way to exit. So basically, no matter where you're on the journey, the book is going to be useful to you. Tell people where to find it and where they can follow you for more stuff that you share over time, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nUri Levine (01:20:56):\nSo obviously this is the book. Amazon, Barnes & Noble, basically places that you can find it. You can follow me on LinkedIn. This is pretty much the only network that I'm actually engaged. If you read the book, then you will find my email in the book and then you can email me, as well. And I do answer all of my emails. I want you to read the book. I don't want you to buy the book. I want you to read the book. And the reason is that I have a purpose in life and this is creating value, and I believe that this book is going to be the best return on investment that you ever made. Not the $20 or $30 that it costs, but the time that you're going to spend on reading it, and therefore, I can be valuable for you, and if I can be valuable for you, then I serve my purpose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:53):\nAmazing. If you weren't on YouTube watching this, the book is called Fall in Love with the Problem, Not the Solution, if you're trying to Google it and find that on Amazon. And Uri, thank you so much for being here.\n\nUri Levine (01:22:05):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
