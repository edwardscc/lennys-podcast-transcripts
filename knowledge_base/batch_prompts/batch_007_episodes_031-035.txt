Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there. That informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.\n\nLenny (00:00:33):\nToday my guest is Bill Carr. Bill is the co-author of the book Working Backwards, which is a synthesis of the biggest lessons that Bill and his co-author learned from their many years at Amazon. Bill joined Amazon just five years after it was founded, stayed there for 15 years where he worked on the books business, and then as VP of Digital Media, launched and managed the company's global digital music and video businesses, including Amazon Music, Prime Video, and Amazon Studios. After Amazon, Bill was an executive in residence at Maveron, an early stage VC firm, then chief operating officer at OfferUp. And these days, Bill runs a consulting firm called Working Backwards, LLC, where he and his co-authored, Colin Breyer, help growth stage and public companies implement the many practices developed at Amazon.\n\n(00:01:20):\nIn our conversation, we go many levels deep on how to actually implement a number of the practices and ways of working that helped Amazon become the success that it is today, including the process of how to actually work backwards, how to organize your team with a single-threaded leader, how to divide up your metrics into input and output metrics, how to practice disagreeing and committing, how to implement the Bar Raiser program in your hiring process and so much more.\n\n(00:01:47):\nHuge thank you to Ethan Evans for making this episode possible and introducing me to Bill. With that, I bring you Bill Carr, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:58):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Assembly AI.

You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it altogether and how it can help your team run smoother and be more efficient. I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:03:45):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups.

Thanks so much for having me. Pleasure to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:32):\nIt's my pleasure. So, I was reading your book, and something that I recognized as I was going through this is just how many new ways of working Amazon contributed to the way tech and business runs. And I made this little list, and I'm curious if there's anything I'm forgetting that's obvious. So, obviously the idea of working backwards, the idea of one way and two way door decisions, the concept of disagreeing and committing input and output metrics using memos versus decks, just the idea of two pizza teams, and then I know that evolved into single-threaded leaders. Is there anything else that's just like an obvious core thing that's maybe almost too obvious that I don't even think about that Amazon contributed?\n\nBill Carr (00:05:10):\nThe one that's non-obvious and is really the way in which Amazon created a set of leadership principles that were very real, and the way in which Amazon created a set of processes to reinforce them. I think I certainly haven't encountered anything quite like that. It was very intentional. So, that is also a distinctive element of that we try to point out in our book.\n\nLenny (00:05:42):\nAwesome. Okay. So, maybe we will come back to that, because that is also really powerful mechanism. So, the question I wanted to ask about this is there are companies that are bigger than Amazon, that are more successful than Amazon, that have been around longer than Amazon, but I don't think any other company has contributed so many unique, new ways of working and also been able to coin them into such shareable ways. What would you say it is about Amazon that enables this sort of way of working and also just making things so just proliferate through the culture?\n\nBill Carr (00:06:13):\nThat's actually one of the reasons why Colin and I set out to write our book because everyone knows about Amazon as a innovative product company, at least certainly during the time I was there, which was from 1999 through the end of 2014. The company rolled out all kinds of innovative products. The Kindle, AWS, Alexa, Echo, the Prime subscription itself is innovative and...\n\nLenny (00:06:41):\nAnd it's all those things, by the way.\n\nBill Carr (00:06:43):\nYes, a lot of people around the world use all those things. And obviously, Jeff was a huge driver of those things. But what people don't realize is that Amazon was actually, to some degree, equally focused on process innovation. In many cases, by the way, we stood on other people's shoulders, we cannot take credit for having... For most of these, there were other inspirations or we built on work that others had done, which by the way, was what I think all great companies should do. And again, that's also why we wrote the book was because we would like to allow people to stand on Amazon's shoulders to learn what we learned, and then take all or part of these things and build from there.\n\n(00:07:28):\nBut to more directly answer your question, how or why did this happen. So, this period of both product and process innovation actually occurred in this one narrow window of 2003 to 2007. During that window of time, all of the products I just mentioned and all of the processes except for one were all developed in this one four year period.\n\nLenny (00:07:53):\nWow.\n\nBill Carr (00:07:54):\nAnd this is the period actually where we were going from hypergrowth stage, zero to one company, to what I would call one to whatever, a thousand, infinity. That next step that companies have to make where what happens is things become very complex. We're no longer just a bookstore, we sell a lot of things. We actually branched out beyond just a retail business, we had a third party marketplace business. We were experimenting in those days with providing running websites for third party retailers in those days too. We were developing new things. We were in many countries around the world. So, we'd become very complex. And what happens to that point is that then you reach this point where the CEO can no longer be in every important meeting, can no longer be involved with hiring every person. And you need a system, a method to run the company effectively. And Jeff Bezos is fundamentally, he's a very scientific and analytical thinker.\n\n(00:09:07):\nHis undergraduate degree was in computer science, I'm pretty sure. Although I think he actually started off wanting to get a physics degree, he ended up moving over to computer science. He spent his early days at DE Shaw as a quant on Wall Street. Very quantitative mind. So, he applied this... When he thought about this problem, he said, \"Well, I need to be scientific about this. There needs to be some system or some approach, some mechanism for me to be able to manage such a company. So, I'm going to experiment, like a scientist would, with different ideas, different hypotheses, implement them and see what works, and iteratively improve.\" So that was the mindset which we took... Which by the way, we applied both to process innovation, but also product innovation.\n\nLenny (00:09:55):\nAwesome. I had Eric Reson, and he also happened... I thought about this at the same time, he contributed a lot of core concepts to the way tech worked, and he actually brought up a couple concepts that were on the cutting room floor, basically things that he thought would be things people adopt everywhere. And I'm curious, is there an example of that at Amazon where you built a process and had this clever term for it and just never spread or never actually worked at Amazon? Anything come to mind?\n\nBill Carr (00:10:20):\nThe dev team, the design team, the product team, they're all in one group, and they'll go operate autonomously, but not completely autonomously because we, the senior leadership team, Jeff and the S-Team want to know that they're on the right track. So, we're going to create something called a fitness function, which was let's figure out what are the four or five or six metrics that matter most for your particular area. Let's give a weighting to all of them and then let's create an index for those, and we'll measure that index up and down. And that's the fitness function.\n\nLenny (00:10:52):\nThat is a very nerdy way of organizing teams. I love it.\n\nBill Carr (00:10:55):\nYeah, super nerdy. But we realized after, I don't know how long, several months or a year of doing this, so the fitness function was not a good idea. This is what I would describe as a compound metric where you try to take several important metrics and munge them into one. The problem is it's actually becomes totally meaningless. When you're measuring things, you're trying to understand what actions or reactions are creating the good outputs that you want, revenue, customer growth. But by putting them all together, you basically obfuscate that. And what really we realized is we need to just break each one of these out individually and manage them each in its own way. So today, I discouraged teams and companies from creating any sort of compound metrics.\n\nLenny (00:11:44):\nI've done that once, and it was a terrible idea as well, where we had six different metrics and every quarter, we were going to move a different metric that contributed to a higher metric. And what we realized is we just never learn how to get good at one thing, and then it turns out there's always one thing that actually impacts the bigger goal most. See, you just end up working on that thing anyway.\n\n(00:12:03):\nLet's actually go deeper into the single threaded leader piece since you mentioned it. It's actually come up a lot on this podcast of people working this way where they have a single threaded leader. And so clearly, it's worked. And I guess we'll just help people understand what does a single threaded leader actually mean, and then why is it such an effective way of working.\n\nBill Carr (00:12:23):\nSo, the concept of single-threaded leadership was first... When I was born from this time of complexity at Amazon, and where again, large... Once you get to a certain scale, you get to a point of where there are competing departments, competing interests, and they're competing for some centralized pool of resources. For all of you who are working for a tech company, this is this pool of engineering resources, or today, data science and AI resources. There may be other constrained resources often designed as a constrained resource. But the point is now all these teams want that pool of resources to go build stuff for them, but they're in competition with each other. So, most companies solve this by having an intense, centralized, highly collaborative process. We decided to go in the other direction for the reasons I mentioned, which were that we're just fine, that we're spending all our time in these meetings, planning, and a lot of the work we were doing, the artifacts we create, the documents, the projections, we're actually not very useful either, we're bureaucratic time wasters largely because a lot of the assumptions built into them were deeply flawed.\n\n(00:13:35):\nSo, you're debating numbers in these documents that are based on flawed assumptions, which is a waste of time. So, what we realized instead was how do we get... The three things we really wanted were ownership, speed and agility. And so, we experimented with that and said, \"Let's create teams that can stand alone, where there's a single leader and the cross- functional resources that they need are all either directly report to them or are dedicated to them.\" So they don't necessarily have to be a straight line direct report. In Amazon's case, for the most part it was. There were some dotted line, but it could be all straight line, it could be all dotted line, it could be a mix of the two. But fundamentally, we've moved from what we called a project orientation to a program orientation.\n\n(00:14:24):\nSo, a project orientation means, oh, we are going to do this project to change our search result page and algorithm, and the project is defined in this way and it's going to take six months. The resources will come and swarm on that, and then they'll move off to some other thing in some other part of the company. The program based orientation says, let's stick with the search example. There's a team that works on search, and they always work on search. And instead of thinking about things on a project by project basis, they think holistically about what they need to do to improve search. They have a set of metrics by which they're looking to drive those metrics largely. Ones that they can control. Things like what percent of the time is a customer clicking on one of the top three results in my search page, or how many milliseconds does it take for the page load time in this browser type, on this device type, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(00:15:21):\nAnd they then are running their own roadmap. They're deciding what are the most important things for us to go work on, and having a prioritized list of those things and be able to start at the top of the list and work their way down with the pool of resources that they have. Sometimes, and most times, they may want more resources to be able to tackle more, but they spend less time in resource contention, resource fighting, and instead, focus on building what they can build with the resources that they've got.\n\n(00:15:54):\nAnd so, the benefit of this is if there are success or failures, they're really dependent on themselves now. The only thing they could maybe argue about how they could do better is if they had more resources, which they can petition management for. But this way, it also solves a big management problem, which is instead of management, senior management refereeing every item on a roadmap, they're refereeing which teams have how many resources, which is more of like a once or twice or three times a year decision versus refereeing everything on the product roadmap. And then all the resource contention issues, that's a daily issue. And so, it frees teams up then to actually go and sprint ahead. There's a lot of work you have to do to get ready for this. For example, in a software environment, when we first started and we had a monolithic code base that was not pretty, we weren't ready to do this because you have all those interdependencies.\n\n(00:16:56):\nOnce we moved to a service-based architecture, and then teams could own their code with defined endpoints, APIs that other teams could understand that are well-documented, then we could move in that direction. And the other thing is we had to create, what I would call, countermeasures because there's no free lunch in org structures, any org structure, you're trading off one thing for another thing. In this case, you're trading off potentially functional excellence. So, in other words, if you no longer have every single engineer or every single marketing person or every product person or every biz dev person reporting into a C-level leader of that particular function, and instead, they're spread out in small teams across the company reporting into some generalist who is probably not going to have functional expertise in several of the functions that they're leading, you risk the problem of then the people in those teams not gaining functional competency. That's the downside. And we can talk more about this, but we created a lot of countermeasures to still enable us to have functional excellence while creating these single-threaded teams.\n\nLenny (00:18:07):\nTo drill into this a little bit further, is the origin of this, this recognition at Amazon that the best stuff comes from one person's vision and just one person driving and one person's ask being on the line versus the often, the decision by committee approach?\n\nBill Carr (00:18:24):\nIt is less about that. I do want to be clear, it's one leader and their team who are accountable and responsible. So, with respect to what are we going to go build, how are we going to go measure success, all those things, this team and that leader are responsible for documenting that, writing their plan. Now, they don't just get to go off and do that. There was an intense review process at Amazon where either at some level, whether it be the vice president, senior vice president, or all the way up to the Jeff level and his direct reports called the S-Team, this plan would be reviewed and scrutinized deeply as well, and there'd be a discussion, an interchange, and basically getting alignment between the senior leadership team and each one of these single-threaded teams on that plan before the team could go off and run.\n\n(00:19:17):\nThe beauty of that though is that once we'd had those discussions, those interchanges, then the teams were free to sprint hard after their plan. They didn't have to worry about whether was, \"Am I aligned with my CEO? Am I aligned with my senior vice president?\" They could know that they were. But yes, this creates then clear... If they're going to deliver it or not. It's up to that owner and that team. Whereas when you have this highly cross-functional approach and there's not one clear person who's responsible for this one project that's on this roadmap, I've seen many CEO pull their hair out saying, \"I have no ownership and accountability here. How do I have that?\" They're pushing on a string. Because they can't because their different people and leaders are part owning, half owning a long list of things instead of fully owning a short list of things.\n\nLenny (00:20:15):\nI like that. I like metaphor of pushing on a string. Is this approach similar to just the GM model, or is there a big difference when someone's thinking about going GM model versus the single-threaded leader approach?\n\nBill Carr (00:20:27):\nYeah. Obviously, there are probably different definitions of what people consider the GM model, but I would consider that being this person is a P&L owner, and you can, of course, create mini P&Ls within a P&L. Like for example, in the book business, we could, and I don't know most of the time we didn't do this, but we could have created a P&L owner just for fiction books, or just for professional and technical books, which is a very large category with big differences between the others. And then you say, \"Great.\" Then that team, they have their own dedicated team. They're fully responsible for the revenue numbers and other numbers. But you have to be thoughtful about how you do this because one of the three questions you have to ask when you establish one of these teams is, does the team have the resources within their control to effectively manage this part of this department, this product, this P&L?\n\n(00:21:23):\nAnd sometimes then if you narrow things down too much in some cases, then the answer is no. In other cases, the answer can be yes very easily. A great example, this was in Prime Video, one of the businesses that I managed, we could create a single-threaded team who just was working on applications for TV sets, like Samsung, Sony. We could create another team that's working on game consoles, and another team that's working on mobile phones and tablets. And then within each one of those, we could further break it down. We could have one team working on Xbox and another one on PlayStation, another one just on iOS. In those cases, then it's very clear how you can break the teams down and they can have very clear ownership.\n\nLenny (00:22:06):\nAwesome. Let's go back to the countermeasures topic, and then even just a little more broadly. You talked about one thing that was important to put in place before you moved to the single threaded leader model, which is creating APIs, and basically breaking apart this monolith. What are some other things that you think you need to put in place to be successful in trying to shift to this model?\n\nBill Carr (00:22:26):\nThe other thing was these functional countermeasures. So, let's stick with the engineering, for an example. So, in 2004, 2005-ish, I started managing a single-threaded team. Actually managed two different ones, one for music and one for video, which are now Amazon Music and Prime Video. They weren't called that in those days. But I started managing a small team of software engineers at that point. Well, I have never... Well, I have written lines of code, but that would be back in high school, and we're talking about Basic and Pascal. I have a master's in business, a background in marketing. I'm a generalist, okay? So, I'm not equipped to coach. I couldn't possibly conduct a code review. I couldn't possibly conduct an architectural review. I couldn't possibly coach or mentor an engineer on how to improve their craft. But I was one of many of these examples.\n\n(00:23:28):\nAnd there could be reverse examples where instead of me being a business leader, I was purely an engineer, and now I'm managing a team that does marketing and business development. I wouldn't know anything about those things if that had been my background. So, what we did, and I'll stick with the engineering examples, we came up with various countermeasures. One example was that we still had a C-level leader of engineering in Rick Dalzell, and most of the core infrastructure and core services still reported into Rick. So-\n\nBill Carr (00:24:01):\nCore services still reported in to Rick. So it was things like payments or infrastructure search, and Rick still could be a technical leader for the whole company and he and his team could create things like what are the standard ways that we're going to do code reviews? What are the standard ways across the company that we will interview and screen engineers? What does the promotion process look like? What are the defined steps getting from an SD1 to an SD2, SD3? How do we document and describe what are the requirements? There are many things like this. \n\n(00:24:41):\nEffectively, what it also meant is that anyone who is an engineering vice president, or in many cases a director, they would often have something else beyond their day job of some sort of subject matter expertise area where they would also contribute to the company. A good example of this would be that they might sit on a panel for promotion from a certain level to another level in the engineering world, or they might be available to do code review outside of their organization for another organization. So people had other jobs in addition to their day job to build and maintain functional excellence. There are a lot of examples like this across the company.\n\nLenny (00:25:23):\nLet's go in a different direction and talk about one of my favorite principles of Amazon, which is disagree and commit. I think in the way I even describe it I know is wrong. I think people hear this term and they often use this principle incorrectly. For example, it actually starts with have backbone and then disagree and commit. So I'd love to just hear how you've seen this actually implemented well and what people should do and think about when they're trying to implement something like this at their company.\n\nBill Carr (00:25:49):\nSo when I was at Amazon, there were 10 leadership principles and they've since expanded them. But of those 10, this was always the least well understood when I was at Amazon too, and partly because it is actually the most nuanced and difficult to actually use. So here's what it means. What it means is that have backbone and disagree, meaning when we are making any kind of a decision, important decision, if you are part of that team, part of that unit, it is your obligation to voice your point of view if you disagree with your approach that's been taken. The point of that disagreement, by the way, is to provide usually additional information or a new point of view that people have not considered.\n\n(00:26:40):\nSo I like to geek out a bit on the process of decision-making and have read more and more about this. I think that Peter Drucker probably has the best writing on this topic. But as he would describe it, good decisions are made by first understanding all the different points of view and pros and cons to the potential issue at hand or the potential direction, and that great leaders, what they do is they solicit these different points of views. They have a team that they work with to debate and discuss things. So another way to think about this, a king and their court. In an ideal world, if you assume that there's no political motivations, the court is there to advise the king and help them think through different problems and provide different and opposing points of view to allow the king to arrive at the right decision.\n\n(00:27:41):\nThis is sort of no different than that which is the disagree part is about bringing forth new information, new data, new point of view that would be contrary to the current direction. So that's the disagree part and you're obligated to do it as we would describe sort of all the way up the chain if necessary, if it's an important issue and people are not hearing or understanding your point of view. Now the important point is first of all about hearing and understanding your point of view.\n\n(00:28:11):\nWhat would often happen, I can tell you if someone in a leadership role, someone come to me with a disagreement and many times I'd appreciate it, by the, way because they'd bring some point of view that was useful, but sometimes they bring the disagreement and cite the reasoning behind it and I already knew that reasoning. We'd already thought of that reasoning, we already thought of that, in which case I would say, \"I hear your disagreement. We have already considered that factor. But even though that factor is there, here are these other factors that outweigh that.\"\n\n(00:28:42):\nNow that is the point at which as long as the disagreer is hearing back from the leader that they understand their point of view, understand why they are pushing back and seem to fully understand it, and they've taken that into consideration, that is the point for them to commit. Because the point is you provided your information, they've processed that information and they've decided to go this way with the knowledge of that. Where people get confused about is they don't maybe understand when they're supposed to stop disagreeing is one thing, and so hopefully that explanation made people clear this is when you're supposed to stop, and then the commit part done well means that it's not just like I'm going to commit, I don't really agree with what we're going to do, but I'm going to get behind this.\n\n(00:29:39):\nIdeally it's, oh, now I've heard the argument, I've actually now thought about the argument and hopefully that person has now understood why we're taking that direction. So their commitment is based on that understanding because then they can reflect that understanding back to their organization too. Because the worst thing to do is to say, \"Yeah, we're committed to this. I don't really agree and I still think it's wrong, but I'm committed to it.\" That's not actually commitment. This is really about decision-making and understanding the facts and information that people are going to use to make a decision and then be able reflect that back.\n\nLenny (00:30:22):\nI imagine there are many times I've gone through this where I still don't agree. What's your advice to a manager or to a report of just like, okay, when you actually still don't agree, how do you behave? Do you just behave like, yes, I agree with this and don't really voice your concerns or something else?\n\nBill Carr (00:30:37):\nI work with Jeff on all kinds of different new ideas. Jeff doesn't think a normal person. His level of sort of creativity and the way he thinks, the timescale of which he thinks, there's many ways about the way he thinks that there was no one else in Amazon that thought that way. So there'd be times when even after we've had that discussion, I would maybe still disagree, but then what I would do is I'd focus on, okay, well what is the kernel or the core of why Jeff thinks that we should do this and I would focus on that kernel. I got great advice actually from one of my managers at one point, Steve Kessel who said, \"You have to look for what that is, and then your job is to then take that kernel and try to run with it and expand it and try to see how I can take that idea, that concept, and then make it into something viable.\"\n\n(00:31:41):\nIt doesn't always work, but it's about then having that understanding of what it is, not just sort of going through the motion of stomp, stomp, stomp through it. That's not going to work. Also, I've seen people who try that and their career doesn't go very far. You have to have some degree of faith that there's something there and I'm going to try to do the best I can to make that part. How would I productize that idea? How would I make that viable from a business point of view or whatever the different constraints are.\n\nLenny (00:32:18):\nAwesome. So the advice there is focus on the parts you agree with and think about how you can find out if it's actually right or not.\n\nBill Carr (00:32:25):\nAgree with, or even just you may not even agree, but what is the core of what that person is thinking is the big benefit or good guy or thinking vector that they're on that's causing them to want to go in this direction.\n\nLenny (00:32:42):\nThinking vector, love that term. Along the same lines, another principle that I love is leaders are right a lot. I feel like this is a term that it almost goes unsaid. You almost can say this in a lot of companies. I'm curious just the origin of why that became an important principle and then how it's implemented at Amazon.\n\nBill Carr (00:33:03):\nYeah. So going back to this last discussion, so one fallacy we should all acknowledge is that when you're making these decisions, and you're trying to use data to make decisions, you can make the data kind of look however you want it to look to sort of try to meet your decision. If I'm looking at some issue and I've got some big dataset, I can come up with ways of looking at a dataset to support this idea and ways of looking at that dataset to not support it. So the data rarely makes the decision for you. What is happening is then a lot of judgment and interpretation of the data, weighing that, weighing various factors to then come to a decision. \n\n(00:33:49):\nThat is sort of the right a lot part. The right a lot part comes from having what we call sort of sound judgment, which generally come... Some people maybe are born with this, not a lot of them, mostly they get it through experience. A lot of experiences actually about being wrong, by the way, about making mistakes and by having looked at a lot of problems, made decisions or observed others making decisions, being a student of that, and then using that to understand then how to weight different information when making a decision.\n\n(00:34:27):\nSo right a lot is that you're good at that and that then it proves, and that generally speaking, people want to follow someone who ends up by and large going in the right direction, right? You're the leader of a team. The team is petitioning you on multiple sides. If you keep kind of going off in some direction where most of the team is scratching their head saying, \"I don't think that that was the right decision,\" they're not going to want to follow you very far and you're probably not going to go very far. So this is something that you develop through experience and I'd say from having the opportunities to observe and work for others that are good at this.\n\nLenny (00:35:12):\nI love that it's a lot. I like that it's not just leaders are right. It's right a lot.\n\nBill Carr (00:35:18):\nYeah, yeah. No one is right every time. That is totally unrealistic. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:35:26):\nLet's talk about the titular concept of your book, and that's a word I've never used, but I think it's appropriate, which is working backwards. First of all, just what does it actually mean to work backwards versus working forwards?\n\nBill Carr (00:35:37):\nThe title of the book comes from two things. One is one of the leadership principles, which is that customer obsession, and the principle states something along the lines of that great leaders start with the customer's needs and work backwards from there to sort of meet those needs or solve them. Then also because we created a process in this window I was talking about earlier, the 2004 to 2007 window, we created this process for new product innovation called the Working Backwards PR/FAQ process. They both refer to the same idea, which is that as your guiding star or the point from which you're going to start is what are the customer's problems or what are the customer's needs, and then figure out, okay, well what would be the solution to that, what are potential solutions to that? \n\n(00:36:40):\nTo do those things, starting with without the constraints of my financial constraints, my resource constraints, my legal constraints, my engineering constraints, whatever all those constraints may be, because the problem is what most of us do is we start with those constraints and work forward from there, or we start with things like I got to increase revenue. How do I increase revenue? I need to increase active customers. How do I increase active customers? For customer oriented behavior, we tend to start with those things which may often lead you in the wrong direction.\n\n(00:37:22):\nWhereas we had, as Jeff would say, we took it as an article of faith. If we served customers well, if we prioritized customers and delivered for them, we took it as an article of faith that then things like sales, things like revenue and active customers and things like the share price and free cash flow would follow. So this is important because I still can't give you objective proof that that is true, I don't know who could, and so it was saying this is an article of faith that if we do that we think those other things will work out. \n\n(00:37:57):\nSo therefore, when we're making a decision thinking about a problem, we're going to start with what's best for the customer and then come backward from there. Then in that coming backward process, we're going to have to figure out, well, to do that, gee, I'm going to have to solve this engineering problem, or I'm going to have to figure out how to make this thing cost less or make this thing faster or solve one or more problems. That's the backwards, that informs what's the work you have to do to then create this new solution for customers.\n\nLenny (00:38:36):\nAwesome. So just to summarize, you start with what are the customer's needs and problems, and I think a big part of Amazon's approach is what are the lasting problems they'll always have, which is I think it's lower prices, faster shipping and all those things, and then think with no constraints. When you work with companies to implement this idea of working backwards, is it always what is the customer problem and need versus revenue or growth or something like that? Or is there other examples of where you work backwards from at different sorts of companies?\n\nBill Carr (00:39:07):\nWell, the working backwards part is strictly about the customer's needs. Yeah, we don't want to work backwards from revenue. I guess we didn't really use this term for sort of other things like cost structure. Cost structure was actually a part of working backwards from the customer that if we had a low cost structure, we could afford to give customers lower prices, therefore let's figure out how to have a low cost structure. Because in itself, driving down costs, doing things more efficiently doesn't inherently benefit customers because you could just choose to take more profit. It only does if you decide that in doing so I'm going to lower my prices to customers or provide some other benefit. So no, we used it in this method of I'm starting from the customer, and then very specifically, we used it in this method of new products and features that I'm going to go build on behalf of customers. \n\nLenny (00:40:10):\nAwesome. This episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client and you already have big ideas for the website, but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life?

There's the built-in AI tools, the on canvass collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover, and that's not all. Find out more at wix.com/studio. Okay. So then when you go work with a company to implement this idea of working backwards, what are the very tactical things that you do to help them here? I know PR/FAQ is a part of that, so let's chat about how to actually implement that. What are the steps to shift to working backwards?\n\nBill Carr (00:41:31):\nYeah. So the first shift is to take this, so that's just a concept, right? Working backwards. Well, how do I turn that concept into a scalable, repeatable process? That's exactly where Jeff's mind went. Eventually, without getting into the origin story, we came up with this process called the PR/FAQ process. So what it means is that whenever we're devising a new product or feature, we're going to start by writing a press release describing the feature and describing it in a way that speaks to the customer and to some degree the external press and world where the idea is, in my description of this, it better jump off the page of something like, wow, as a customer I will really need this.\n\n(00:42:17):\nSo what I work first is to say, okay, for your product development process, let's start by using this method as the method to decide what am I going to go build? And oh, by the way, to use it as a method to sort between a lot of different choices of what you might build. In summary, the way that process works is that PR, you're going to describe very carefully and clearly who's the customer, what's their problem, and what's the solution that you're planning to build. That sounds really simple and easy, but it's actually very hard to do that well. to crisply and clearly define those. The first two things are the things that are hardest to define, like who's the customer? Like anyone says, \"All restaurants are my customer.\"\n\n(00:43:08):\nOkay, well, that's a mistake. Now, I mean, which kinds of restaurants are your customers? In what kinds of cities? In what kinds of formats, et cetera, et cetera? Then what is the specific problem you were solving? Ideally, you would some way have quantify that problem or there's some data or customer insights that have led you to understand that problem, to know that it is a meaningful and big problem. Ideally a problem that people would pay money if you could solve that problem for, because you can just look at the economics of that problem, and if instead they use your solution, this would be beneficial to them.\n\n(00:43:50):\nSo I work to have them first implement this PR/FAQ process is the first step. Then the next step really is to go from there to say, \"Okay, writing PR/FAQs is one thing. Well, how do I actually use them? How do we actually develop them?\" Because there's this iterative nature to writing PR/FAQs where it's sort of a concentric circle review. You start off small with one author and with low fidelity writing these things, and then you start to share them with a small group and get feedback and improve it, a wider group, get feedback and improve it, and onward and onward until, depending on the size and scale of your company, you get up to the CEO as a way to strengthen, improve and really codify this idea and determine whether it's a great idea or not. So I help them understand how does that work? How do you do this iterative process? Then once you've done that, then what do I do with these PR/FAQs once I've got them? How do I then think about that with respect to my roadmap?\n\nLenny (00:44:55):\nAwesome. Okay. That was an awesome overview. I'm going to fire off a couple of questions around the first part. Do you still suggest people do it as a press release? It feels like press releases aren't a thing anymore. Do you ever suggest people do it as a tweet or as TikTok video or a blog post?\n\nBill Carr (00:45:09):\nGood question. So the first thing is it's not a real press release, okay? We could change the nature of it, and if instead we wanted to call it the customer problem solution statement, right? We could just change it to that because there really are three money paragraphs in this. First of all. Yeah, it's not meant to be a real press release, so don't use the language you would use if you were sending an actual press release. This is like an internal document. Okay. So that's the first thing.\n\n(00:45:42):\nThe second thing is the heart of it really is that first paragraph, it's a short description, that second paragraph, that's the problem statement, and that third paragraph, that's solution statement. If you wanted to ditch the rest of it and the artifacts of the press release, you could. I think there are other benefits to it, like the headline, is this headline long and drawn out and I can't even tell what the heck this thing is from reading this headline? If you used a tweet that wouldn't work very well. \n\n(00:46:11):\nThe date is also a meaningful thing when you write the press release. The date is meant to be a hypothetical timing on which you're envisioning launching this thing which tells the reader something. Are you thinking that this is something that's so simple and easy, we're going to launch it next month or so complex that we're going to launch it in a year from now. So there are some other directional cues within it. Like I said, with everything, these are tools that people can use and I'm sure that companies will find other ways to improve upon these tools, but if you don't use those parts of them correctly, you're kind of missing out on what's the main benefit that your getting out of this.\n\nLenny (00:46:50):\nDo you try to write it in a way that would be announced, like a press release feel? Or is it mostly just who is the customer? Do you try to pitch it as a part of this experience?\n\nBill Carr (00:47:01):\nSo you try to write it in that way, but the one thing is you don't want to use hyperbole. It would be very factual with numbers, data rich document too. So again, not like a real press release. A lot of internal confidential data would be in this press release.\n\nLenny (00:47:25):\nGot it.\n\nBill Carr (00:47:25):\nSo it's a tool that has a very specific use to it.\n\nLenny (00:47:34):\nIs there a template that we can point people to in the show notes to help them craft this? I think there's a version in your book maybe, but is there some online that we could point people to?\n\nBill Carr (00:47:43):\nYeah, so we have a website related to the book, which is www.workingbackwards.com, and there's a resources section within there and you'll find a template.\n\nLenny (00:47:53):\nAmazing. Okay. Then the concentric circle piece. So the idea there is basically get feedback from an increasingly larger swath of the company and it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go- \n\nLenny (00:48:00):\n... swath of the company. And it sounds like a big part of that is also get buy-in as you go along the way.\n\nBill Carr (00:48:05):\nYes and no. So first of all, there are some things where you may write it and you, the author, if we were in the old world, would take the piece of paper, crumple up and throw in the trash can, which is, in your own, you've realized, \"Now that I put this down on paper and read it, this is not actually that good of an idea. I'm going to try something else.\" By the same token, you may then have written one you think is a pretty good idea, and you show up here or your manager and they give you feedback that makes you want to then ball it up and throw it into the trash can.\n\n(00:48:38):\nSo part of this concentric circle thing is not just that everyone you write lives on and gets all the way to the CEO. There are no stats in this, but let's just say in some imaginary world where, yes, all these things... You're a product manager and you've got a director of product management you report to who reports to some senior vice president of division who reports to a CEO. Well, if you truly run this out and you write 100 PRFAQs in a year, maybe 20 of those make it their way to the CEO. The point is not every single one of them is destined to go that far. The numbers get narrower. And this leads me down to the concept of what you're really trying to create is a product funnel, not a product tunnel. And with a funnel, meaning lots of things at the top, fewer things at the bottom. The tunnel means that everything that comes in is also going to come out the other side.\n\n(00:49:40):\nAnd the problem with that method is that it means you're not actually having a method of consideration and comparing it against other things that you might build or how you deploy what are, frankly, most companies, your most precious resources, which is your engineering team, you should be looking at various choices. You should think of yourself honestly as a venture capitalist. They don't fund every company that they meet with. They actually fund a very, very low percentage of them. And at Amazon, we had lots and lots of PRFAQs that were a great idea, but we didn't ship them because we had other ones that were just a better idea, which had a bigger potential impact. So you want that. You want to create this corpus of ideas that are well-thought-out and select the best ones.\n\nLenny (00:50:27):\nIt feels like a lot of these processes are basically just ways to stop stupid shit from happening. I think the narrative is a good example where you have to expose your thinking deeply. This is a great example of that.\n\nBill Carr (00:50:39):\nYeah. And it's also, I would say, an example of where this is a process to prevent the other process, which is the product development process, from becoming the thing where you just get locked in on, \"What are we doing in this sprint, what are we trying to get done,\" and focused on shipping stuff. What I recommend is you try to break that into two different processes. One is the process of deciding what you should go build, and that's what the PRFAQ is designed for. And then once you've decided that, then, yes, by all means, use all that good thinking, freight, \"Now how can I ship it efficiently and effectively with few to no bugs?\"\n\nLenny (00:51:19):\nI was just reading this Harvard Business Review article, I think that's called the thinking to doing gap, where a lot of companies just spend a lot of time talking about ideas and solutions and not actually doing anything. And so I'm curious how you try to avoid that at Amazon considering there's this period of just like, \"Let's explore, explore, explore, and we're fine.\"\n\nBill Carr (00:51:39):\nThere's a couple ways, and of course I'm somewhat having to imagine what are the problems in such companies where that's going on. So one such version of this problem is what I'd call the-big-idea-that's-not-fleshed-out problem. So I'm sure that every single person listening to this podcast has either themselves done this or have witnessed others in their company who come up with a concept of like, \"Oh, I think if we built this, boy, that would really solve things or that would really work well or that would really grow things.\" And it may sound good to everyone, it may sound good to you, to everyone, and then maybe you start then working on building it. But the reality is that actually once you've spent some time looking at that idea more deeply, you then start to identify several roadblocks or maybe a fatal flaw with this idea. And in fact, no, you shouldn't waste any of your time going into building that thing because it has a fatal flaw.\n\n(00:52:46):\nSo one problem is that companies get stuck, I think, where they never actually go do that documentation. And so it's a debate and discussion about concepts that aren't really well fleshed out. And so people's ability to actually evaluate them in any realistic way is they don't have a good way. And so in those situations, what gets done is probably more of a function of politics or will or a culture of completely top-down. I think the other way is where they're debating and discussing things that they just don't have good methods where then they can take things, and then go build them, meaning they probably don't have the right org structure or processes in place to then go take the good idea, assign it to someone who will own it, go look at it. And after they have owned it and gone and look at it, if it works, then they and their team can go actually build it.\n\n(00:53:50):\nWhat I always found as I became more senior in the company and my role became bigger and bigger is that when something came up, some idea that didn't neatly fit within my org structure, I couldn't necessarily delegate it to someone that this... There were only two things I could possibly do, which is just set it aside altogether because otherwise it'd just be a real distraction to people or I had to decide this was a compelling enough idea that we were going to take a resource, could be one person, could be a whole team, depending on the idea, and I'm going to have to assign that resource to actually go look at this and work at this. Otherwise, it will never happen.\n\nLenny (00:54:31):\nI've been through those many times. Okay. So there's two more concepts I want to try to touch on before we wrap up. The next one is the idea of input and output metrics. This is something that at Airbnb, we super implemented, it became a very defective way of thinking. And actually there's a lot of Amazonians that ended up at Airbnb, a lot of leadership. So there's a lot of this stuff that we ended up doing like the memos. And so on the input and output metrics, could you just describe what that is and why that's so important, why people think about metrics in the wrong way often?\n\nBill Carr (00:55:03):\nYeah, so the origin of this one really was, again, in our early years at Amazon, '99, 2000, 2001, we were a public company then, we were growing. But then growth started to... It wasn't just all up into the right and like, \"Woo-hoo.\" Every company's going to hit a wall eventually, and it's not going to be... If you're so lucky to even been at a company where it's just going up into the right with no gravity, good for you, because million people never experienced that.\n\n(00:55:36):\nWhat most people experience is the reality is that there's a lot of gravity pulling against your revenue numbers and you've put a plan out there and you wanted to grow 15% or 20% or 75% or whatever it was, and now you look like you're not going to hit that number this quarter. And so what ensues then is, \"We're not going to hit our number. What should we do about that to hit our number?\" And this often happens with, well, there's a month or a month and a half left in the quarter, and then we would run around like chickens with our heads cut off and come up with a bunch of ideas that tended to be promotional in nature and tended to be price reduction in nature, or we'll send this extra email or extra ad or whatever it might be-\n\nLenny (00:56:19):\nAnother Prime Day.\n\nBill Carr (00:56:19):\nRight. And the reality is we did that, we went through that enough times, several quarters, and we started to realize, \"Huh, these fire drills don't really work.\" We didn't really get meaningful progress against the number with these last-minute things we decided to go do. And oh, by the way, they were a big distraction. If they did work at all, they pulled revenue that might've just gotten in the next month or next quarter into this one. So it wasn't really a zero-sum game there. And we realized we're not really actually working on things that matter to customers that are going to move the needle over the long term.\n\n(00:56:58):\nAnd this is about the same time when Jeff and the S-Team were reading the book, Good to Great. And you have to ask Jeff what it is, but if you ask me, I think that this was the single most influential and effective management book for our company because what it caused Jeff to do, and I won't describe what... Most of you probably know what it is, if you don't know what it is, go read Good to Great. It is, in my opinion, the best, most important management book you'll ever read. Because what it did is to help us codify our growth flywheel, meaning what are the inputs that if we improve these things, which in our case, was how do we have broad selection? How do we have a great customer experience or great customers experiences in retail? Things like how easy was it to find what you wanted to buy, how easy was it to buy it, and how fast did it get to you. Were the prices low? Do we have lots of merchants on our platform? And by the way, could we drive out costs?\n\n(00:58:06):\nSo we identified these things on our flywheel. And this identification of these things was such a critical moment for the company because then it realized, \"Okay. Well, what we need to do is spend our time focusing on how do I measure each one of those things, and then how do I improve each one of those things?\" So it shifted our focus away from this short-term thinking of pushing the revenue number up to this longer-term thinking that if we just improve these things, whether it's... There's no day that people will wake up 10 years, 20 years, 30 years from now and say, \"All else equal, I'd rather shop at a store with fewer items than more items or a store with higher prices than low prices or a store where things get to me more slowly versus more quickly.\" So if we can just improve these things, this is our path to winning. So those were all inputs to the customer experience. And so we then figured out ways to measure them creating a set of input metrics.\n\n(00:59:03):\nAnd so then when we would develop our operating plans and review our business each week and set our goals, we were hyperfocused on those inputs and the input metrics. As a simple example, there was one tool that Jeff and the leadership team, the S-Team, used called S-Team goals, which are effectively a list of what they would harvest would be like, \"Here are the most important goals for the company that I've harvested from all of our operating plans.\" And I can't remember exactly what year, something around 2007, 2008, they looked at that list, which is about 500 items long by the way, and they counted it up. And of that list, only 10 of them actually had a financial metric in it, like revenue or free cash flow or gross profit. These other things we're generally speaking, all... One of those inputs, like I mentioned to you about low prices, and selection, and speed of the customer experience.\n\n(01:00:03):\nSo, yes, the point was, again, it's this other article... So we took it as an article of faith that if we can just improve these inputs, the outputs will take care of themselves. The inputs are the things that drive the outputs, which are revenue, customer activity, free cashflow. And so one of Amazon's... It's not really a secret, but one of Amazon's great strengths is [inaudible 01:00:28] focus on those things and make just continuous process, continuous improvement on each one of them and measure them rigorously.\n\nLenny (01:00:37):\nThe flywheel, you reminded me. It feels like that's another concept Amazon proliferated through all of companies is everyone's trying to create their own little flywheel, and I imagine everyone has that image of the Amazon flywheel in their head with a little orange circle in the center and the black arrows. On the topic of input metrics, just briefly, what is an example of a good input metric? Because I imagine people that are listening are like, \"Oh, shit. I got to think about my metrics as input and output now.\" What's a sign that's a good input metric?\n\nBill Carr (01:01:02):\nA sign that's a good input metric is, first of all, map your end-to-end customer experience. I never worked at Airbnb, but, okay, step one is that they clicked on some ad somewhere and showed up in the website or the app. Now you're in the app. Now you're looking at this first screen. Well, the first thing, what they're doing is they're browsing and/or they're searching. Okay. How are we measuring the speed, quality, and ease of that browsing and searching? Now they've got onto a detail page for an individual property. How are we measuring the speed, ease, and quality of the different actions they may take like reserve... Forgive me if I get any of my terminology wrong. I'm not an Airbnb-\n\nLenny (01:01:47):\nYou are, but it doesn't matter. It's close enough.\n\nBill Carr (01:01:51):\nSo then you've reserved. Now you have interactions with a property owner. How do I measure the quality of those? How many messages go back and forth? Is a lot of messages a good thing? Is that a bad thing? At first, you may not know the answer to that question. Same thing every step of the way. Then there's the actual rental experience. How do I instrument and measure every part of the customer experience? So you know it's an input metric if it is measuring something with respect to the customer experience. Which ones are the right metrics, which ones are the most causal to the outputs, I couldn't begin to tell you this is actually what you're getting paid for. You work at Airbnb to figure that out. And basically through an iterative process of measuring, observing, improving, and looking at what the effect is on your outputs.\n\n(01:02:49):\nSo, again, we didn't really create this concept. This is a concept from Six Sigma, which is using DMAIC, which is I have a process, there's an output of this process, but the inputs are a black box to me. So how do I understand those inputs? Well, DMAIC stands for define... Oh, boy. Define, measure... The A is going to come back to me in a minute. Improve and control. And I'm going to have to... Oh, gosh. The A is lost. I've lost it for a second here. But-\n\nLenny (01:03:26):\nOh, here it is. I'm looking at... Define, measure, analyze, improve-\n\nBill Carr (01:03:30):\nAnd analyze. Thank you. Yeah, duh, analyze. So we just use that process, which was... And by the way, the way we think about it first is like, \"Well, you need to throw a lot of things at the wall. You don't really know which of these things are going to be the most causal.\" So you know you're doing input metrics. If it is, do you control it? Meaning can you apply resources to make this thing better or worse? Does it touch customers? It doesn't always have to touch customers, but if it is affecting the customer experience, it's almost certainly is an input. And then which ways you're going to measure that input? You need to try more than one way, because again, we tell a story in the book about one of our most important input metrics, which was how much selection do we have, and we were actually not measuring that right for several years. We had to refine that measurement.\n\nLenny (01:04:23):\nSo I don't know if you saw this, but I asked on Twitter what questions I should ask you and tell people you were coming on. And something that came up a bunch is with working backwards, obviously some products Amazon has launched have not worked out. Say the Fire Phone is a classic example. What have you learned from that process of just like, \"Okay. [inaudible 01:04:42] won't work out\"? Also knowing many things are not going to work out, there's no way to really [inaudible 01:04:46].\n\nBill Carr (01:04:47):\nYes. So the one important thing to share is that all these tools that are described in this book that Amazon is using, whether it's using documents and meetings or the PRFAQ process or input metrics, is that none of these things give you the answer. They are tools to help you make decisions. So sometimes you're going to make the wrong decision. Fire Phone is a great example that comes up often, people ask, \"Well, if you've got this great PRFAQ process, how did you get Fire Phone?\" So I was tangential to the Fire Phone team and I worked on it closely and different people have different opinions, so I'll just share my opinion, which is that if you think about, again, how does the PRFAQ process work? Well, there's a customer problem.\n\n(01:05:36):\nWell, what was the problem that the Fire Phone was seeking to solve for customers? I would argue this is a case where we made the mistake of what we had a technology solution in mind, which was 3D effects. And then we took that solution and we're then in search of a problem. I don't think it solved any meaningful problems for customers. And candidly, we had to build a version with the music application and the Prime Video application for this phone. And I couldn't figure out how this 3D part would make it better for the customers to discover, watch, or playback any of these media. Maybe there were games that could have been a great solution, I don't know. But I think the simplest place to go when you see a failed product is to ask yourself, what problem did you solve? And I could get into all kinds of other examples outside of Amazon too, but 9 times out of 10, I think that's where... If it wasn't poor execution, if the product was executed correctly, what was wrong with the concept of the product?\n\nLenny (01:06:48):\nI imagine there was a lot of disagreeing and committing on that concentric circle process. Is there anything that you've found of just the number of disagreement and commits in this process of PRFAQ filtering out, I don't know, that tells you maybe this is not a good idea?\n\nBill Carr (01:07:03):\nNot necessarily. So I'll tell you partly also why the Fire Phone happened was, from my point of view, I think that we had had a number of successful products where, in some cases, there were a lot of people who doubted whether it would work. A lot of people inside Amazon doubted that the Kindle was going to be a good idea. I remember contentious board meetings on this topic. So even within a company that was considered innovative, you would have a lot of people that would doubt things. I can tell you that for years is working on Prime Video, I would tell people about what our envision was of you watching on your TV set and we're going to have our own motion studio. We'll make our own movies and TV shows. And they would laugh at me. They thought that was crazy. So that's not necessarily the sign of whether the product is right or wrong. And so that's a problem actually, that makes it harder to know.\n\nLenny (01:08:02):\nYeah. And I think something Amazon's incredibly good at is being okay with a lot of failures, and I think that's part of the reason there's been so much innovation. Is that true?\n\nBill Carr (01:08:11):\nI'd say it's partially true. I mean, again, it's hard for me to do a compare and contrast with other companies. But I can tell you did we have a lot of things that we launched that failed? Yes. Some of them are very public and obvious. I'll give you one that people don't really realize. It's something called... We had a feature in the early 2000s called Slots. And what it was was it was basically third parties could bid on different search terms and put a little ad in there.\n\nLenny (01:08:11):\nSounds familiar.\n\nBill Carr (01:08:42):\nWell, obviously, that works now on Amazon, but it didn't work then because we simply didn't have the scale that Amazon has today. So a lot of times a product idea, a perfectly good idea, you just have the wrong time or the technology isn't there. I mean, Jeff wrote about a product that was a puck that sat in your kitchen that you would talk to and ask it for things and could shop from it. He wrote about that in 2004. Well, the technology wasn't there to be able to create that little puck, which one day would become Echo. It was a decade away. But we had a lot of things we launched that failed. We were not afraid to take what we considered a well-calculated risk. I think many, many companies are less willing to do so, less committed to product innovation, and really do not want that fear of... They do fear failure, and they're really focused on their near-term financial goals. It's not their fault. It's the way a public company and Wall Street interact with each other creates this dynamic.\n\nLenny (01:09:55):\nJust to pull on that thread a little bit more. It feels like a lot of companies talk about, \"We're okay failing. We're okay launching things that don't work,\" but then in practice, their performance review is impacted. Teams get shut down, budgets get pulled. Is there something that you recommend to companies that want to actually improve in this? What could they actually change and actually do this well?\n\nBill Carr (01:10:16):\nYeah, I just spoke with actually a senior executive at a well-known Silicon Valley company about this topic the other day and said, \"Well, what is it we had structurally at Amazon, especially from a people point of view, that would enable or encourage people to take these risks?\" Because, yes, in a lot of companies, if you go work on the project that fails, then your career is in the garbage can and/or your compensation system, you're going to lose out on that bonus. So there were two things. One was our compensation system. So there were no performance bonuses. So if I was running the book business and I had a killer year from a financial point of view, there was no extra kicker for me. And if I ran the book business and it had a bad year, there was no financial penalty for me either because our compensation was based on the stock price.\n\n(01:11:12):\nSo we all had an incentive to do what was right for the company, frankly, over a long-term because trying to win off of short-term fluctuations off Wall Street is a losing proposition, which meant that therefore, if I am... Because I had that situation, I moved off of working on our largest P&L, and then the book business and music and video business, now I'm going to go work on digital media. There is zero business there. This might not work. Well, my compensation didn't change as a result of that. It didn't change one way or the other. We tended to also have a performance management system that then would change compensation based on evaluating what did you actually deliver more in an input method. We cared about the outputs too, but just there are plenty of people that could be-\n\nBill Carr (01:12:00):\nJust, there are plenty of people that could be in a business that's up and to the right but has nothing to do with them. And so we tried to focus more on, well, what did you actually build and contribute, ways you improved selection or lowered prices, or whatever that might be. So those two things about the compensation mattered a lot. And then the second thing was having a CEO who was really committed to it and it wasn't something that they delegated to someone else.\n\n(01:12:31):\nSo Safi Bahcall, I think, writes about this in his book Loonshots, where part of the conditions that are necessary for innovation to occur are that you actually create different structures of decision-making, of approvals, of all kinds of things, if you create some team that's going to go build something new and innovative. Because most of the structures inside a big company are designed to crush and impede a small innovative team that's trying to go build something new. They need speed, but approval here, approval there, it's going to get in their way.\n\n(01:13:10):\nWe solved that two ways, one was when we went to go build digital media and AWS, we put two of our smartest leaders in the company on those things, Steve Kessel and Andy Jassy. And number two, they were meeting with Jeff regularly. Jeff was deeply engaged with them, reviewing what are we going to go build? Part of the decision to decide where we're going to go build. And so he could then also, between their seniority and of course him being the CEO, they could run interference on these sorts of things too. So even if you want to have innovation, even if you really do crave it, you're willing to take the risk, if you don't set up the organization in the right way, you're just not going to get it.\n\nLenny (01:13:52):\nAmazing. I'm glad we got into that, I wasn't planning to talk about that and I'm glad we did. Final topic, this concept of Bar Raisers, it feels like it's been such a core way of allowing Amazon to scale successfully, and I think that's something a lot of people can implement, it's a very one-off thing you could just implement at your company. Can you just talk about what this idea of a Bar Raiser is in the hiring process and then what people can do if they wanted to add this to their hiring process?\n\nBill Carr (01:14:19):\nSo the Bar Raiser hiring process is a process, it was actually one of the first ones that was established and published, pretty early in the company's history back in 1999. And we created it for a simple reason, to quote one senior leader at Amazon, \"We had new people hiring new people hiring new people.\" We were in our hyper-growth phase, okay? The company was only, what, three, four years old, and we were growing like a weed at that point.\n\n(01:14:47):\nSo this started off actually in our tech org, and what our senior leaders in tech realized is, my gosh, we hire some new engineering leader, and then the next thing is that their job is to go hire the senior managers, and they'll go hire managers. And all these people have been here for a week, so they don't really even know our company yet, they don't know our culture yet, they don't know our standards yet. So what information are they using to make these hires, and what information they were using is obviously they were just using their own personal judgment, and their personal judgment combined with whatever criteria they used at prior companies that they worked for. So let's say if they came over from Microsoft, if Microsoft had some methodology or criteria, they probably would just apply that.\n\n(01:15:38):\nWell, is that methodology or criteria relevant to our company? Because every company has a different culture, and I'm here to tell you that if someone's been a super successful vice president at Microsoft, does not mean they could be as super successful at Amazon or at Google or Facebook. Sometimes they can, but these companies are very different, they all do work very differently. The way leadership happens and decisions are made are very different. So how do we fix this problem other than letting it run rampant and basically hire a bunch of people who are, we don't know if they fit our culture and we don't know if they fit our high standards we have for what we expect of engineering leaders or engineers?\n\n(01:16:21):\nSo they created this Bar Raiser process, which by the way, they borrowed from Microsoft, which had a process called As Appropriate. And the concept was that on every interview loop there's one person, who is not the hiring manager, who doesn't report to the hiring manager, who's not the recruiting manager, they're in the business, they're a software development manager, or they're a marketing manager, and they are on the interview loop and they're a Bar Raiser, which means when we get to the debrief meeting, they will run that meeting, not the hiring manager, not the recruiter, they will run the meeting. And it also means that they technically have veto power over the hiring manager, which, by the way, a good Bar Raiser never uses, or I never saw a Bar Raiser use. I was a Bar Raiser, and in my 15 years at Amazon I never used it, never saw it used.\n\n(01:17:14):\nAnd then finally, which actually was not true in 1999 but later became true, was once we established our leadership principles, we created a set of objective criteria that would be used and an interview methodology that would be used in every interview, which was the objective criteria would be our leadership principles, and the methodology would be behavioral based interviewing.\n\n(01:17:33):\nSo this Bar Raiser basically would be a subject matter expert on how this process worked, they'd conduct the debrief to make sure that we were actually adhering to the process, that people were sticking to the objective criteria rather than saying, \"I don't think we should hire this person because, I don't know, they don't seem to want to work here enough.\" Maybe that's a valid reason, but it's actually not part of our objective criteria. And so the Bar Raiser was there to act as a balance also on the urgency bias that every hiring manager has, which is like, I got to fill these roles, but rather than filling them with the next warm body they find, make sure they fill them with people who actually meet our standards, fit our culture and meet our standards for functional excellence too.\n\nLenny (01:18:21):\nSuch a cool process. Two questions along these lines, one is who has the final decision in hiring, is it the hiring manager?\n\nBill Carr (01:18:27):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:18:28):\nAnd this is just off advice from the Bar Raiser?\n\nBill Carr (01:18:31):\nYeah, so this often gets confused. The decision maker is the hiring manager, the whole interview loop and the Bar Raiser are actually just there to help the hiring manager make the right decision. Now oftentimes the hiring manager could feel like this is actually a bureaucratic process and a group of people that I have to sell and they're just in my way between me and hiring this person, which is kind of a natural feeling to have.\n\n(01:18:54):\nBut one of the feedback I would always give managers who are new to this is like, no, no, no, that's not the way to think about it, think about these people are helping you, because the amount of time you're going to put into the hiring process may seem like a lot, but if you hire the wrong person, boy, that amount of time you're going to have to deal with managing that person, that's going to be a lot more, the impact on the team, impact on you. So making a great decision here is important, they're here to help you.\n\n(01:19:20):\nSo yes, the final decision is with the hiring manager, technically speaking the Bar Raiser could block them from a decision to hire someone, but they would, well done they would help the hiring manager see the reasons not to hire the person through a Socratic method and how they would guide the discussion.\n\nLenny (01:19:40):\nAnd then when you're choosing a Bar Raiser, is there any suggestions you have of who to choose and how often you pull them into these things? Because it could also be a huge time suck.\n\nBill Carr (01:19:49):\nIt is a huge time suck, and it sometimes could be up to 10 hours of my week spent actually as a Bar Raiser. The selection process is you start with, as a company, I would recommend if you wanted to do this, you'd pick a department to pilot it with. Pick people who are A, care a lot about your hiring process, B, appear to be good interviewers, and C, seem to have high standards. It's also a great role for people who are earlier in their career by giving them this additional leadership opportunity. It's a great way to grow and develop leaders, by the way, because this added responsibility is a great way for them to start testing out leadership. And you have to train them properly and you have to have dedication to the process, but I generally would try to pilot it within one group at first.\n\nLenny (01:20:41):\nOne last question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. Many people are listening to this, they're considering implementing some of these things, trying to figure out how to actually make these real. If someone were trying to move along the path of becoming more Amazonian, which of these elements and processes do you think often has the most impact? And/or is there something fundamental that needs to change to allow for some change like this to happen at a company, in your experience?\n\nBill Carr (01:21:10):\nYeah, good question. And the first thing I'd say is one thing to be careful of is a lot of times when I'm talking to a company about these processes they say, well, does this mean we need to turn into Amazon? And first thing I tell them is, well, first of all, I couldn't turn you into Amazon if I wanted to, because you have your own culture. And secondly, no, that's not the idea is for you to try to become Amazon, the purpose is to sort of look at these processes and best practices they have and consider adopting parts or all of them into your organization to improve these, every company of a certain scale has these same processes, so this is just a different way to do them. So you should have scalable, repeatable processes for each one of these, pick one, here's one choice of ways to do these things.\n\n(01:21:58):\nThe other piece of advice I give is that a lot of these changes are relatively profound, they really require buy-in all the way up to the CEO, if you're really going to change the way you do product development, or if you're really going to change the way you do hiring, that probably requires buy-in of the CEO, and so I would seek to get that probably before I would move too fast. Some of these things, though, can be piloted in your own little group, like your one little product development group. You want to decide you want to start writing PR FAQs, you probably can decide to do that. But again, try to check with your leadership.\n\n(01:22:32):\nThe other thing I would just tell you is that for any of these processes, these in our book, or any book, implementing a new process is not easy. And if you go into it lightly and dip your toes into it and try it out, it's probably not going to work for you, because it'll be hard at first, and it requires some level of commitment to actually work through that hard part and say, I'm really committed to doing this, and it will take a few months for you to get good at it. So you have to have commitment and discipline to get through it. Anyone can really do these things, it just requires commitment and discipline.\n\nLenny (01:23:10):\nAnd in our chat we've basically just scratched the surface of a lot of these things, if people want to dig deeper there's obviously your book Working Backwards, which we'll link to in the show notes. I know you also work with companies to implement a lot of these practices. Could you just talk about what it is you can help folks with and then how to potentially engage if they're interested?\n\nBill Carr (01:23:27):\nSure, great. Yeah, Colin, and I, one of the reasons we wrote this book was to pass on what we learned to the next generation of business leaders at scale with a book, but also because we had a passion to work with companies directly one-to-one. And so we are advisors, consultants, call it what you will, but non-traditional, we don't have a team of people working for us. Each of us just work directly with the companies who engage us.\n\n(01:23:55):\nAnd generally speaking what we do is the right kind of company for us to work with, first of all, has to achieve a certain scale. Companies that are in the product market fit phase, they need to focus on getting product market fit, they probably don't really need to focus much on how they put in scalable, durable processes. Like sure, some of these could definitely be helpful to you even if you're in that phase, but really these are designed for, my company's become complex now, I've got multiple product lines, it's well over 100 million in annual run rate, growing fast, complex. So most of our clients are either large, well past series C private companies, or they're public companies. And in most cases, a C-level leader, or the CEO themselves, has read our book and recognizes that they have a lot of the same problems that we had at Amazon, and looks at these as useful solutions and wants us to help them implement them.\n\n(01:24:56):\nSo we tend to usually first actually go in and do an assessment of how they do things today, because to help people move from one place to another we have to understand where they are, and then we come up with a prioritized list along with that, the CEO and C-level leaders, of what are the things that would be most useful, what are the symptoms and problems you're having and what are the root cause solutions that could be found in these processes? And then we sort of prioritize those and come up with a plan to work within the organization to help them implement those. And what's also different is that we're very hands- on working at all levels of the company, and as we do it we will be there in the meetings with the teams to help coach them and teach them along so that we make sure that it actually gets implemented properly and to spec, and they get to the outcome they want.\n\nLenny (01:25:45):\nSounds amazing. How would people engage with you if they wanted to explore this?\n\nBill Carr (01:25:51):\nSimple way is you can just send an email, I'm bill@workingbackwards.com, and Colin is colin@workingbackwards.com. You can also just check out our website, www. workingbackwards.com. We have some information there, we have a contact us form, those would be the best ways.\n\nLenny (01:26:05):\nOkay. Well with that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you, are you ready?\n\nBill Carr (01:26:11):\nI'll try.\n\nLenny (01:26:12):\nInterestingly, as I look through the list, many of them relate to using Amazon, which is pretty funny. The first is, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBill Carr (01:26:23):\nSo I'd say in the management world, not surprisingly, Good to Great. I'd say Drucker on Management, or Drucker, The Effective Executive. And then the other one I'd say that's a little bit different is I'd recommend the Steve Jobs biography. I never worked at Apple, but looking at that arc, a lot of the way those things worked was not that different from what I experienced at Amazon, so it's a good window into what it's like to be inside some company, tech company, that goes through product innovation and big growth. On a personal basis, recent books would be Seveneves by Neal Stephenson is a favorite, and A Gentleman in Moscow.\n\nLenny (01:27:05):\nAmazing. Can you get them all on Amazon?\n\nBill Carr (01:27:07):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:27:07):\nAnother Amazon related question potentially is do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show? Might be on Prime, might not be.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:15):\nYeah, my favorite recent movie is the latest Dune movie, and I can't wait for the new one to come out.\n\nLenny (01:27:20):\nWhen is that coming out? It seems like I've been waiting a long time.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:22):\nI think it's supposed to come out next month. I used to know this, I used to have to know the answer to this question, but I don't anymore. But I anxiously await the next one, I thought that last one was awesome. I even liked the original Dune movie, so I'm probably unusual that way. And I just watched, along with my wife, we just enjoyed watching the TV series A Spy Among Friends, which was on MGM+.\n\nLenny (01:27:50):\nMGM+, I have not even heard of that.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:52):\nI had not actually heard of it either.\n\nLenny (01:27:54):\nAnother one to subscribe to.\n\nBill Carr (01:27:55):\nBut you can basically go onto Prime Video and you can find this show and you can subscribe to MGM+ through that.\n\nLenny (01:28:01):\nThank you Prime. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like, maybe that you bought on Amazon, maybe not.\n\nBill Carr (01:28:08):\nThis one I did not buy on Amazon, and this one is, most of you may not understand this one, but I'm an avid cyclist and I got myself a new set of wheels for my road bike this year, actually my road bike and my gravel bike. It's the Zipp 303 Firecrest, the latest model, and boy, these are just fantastic wheels. They're light, they're sturdy, they absorb all the bumps well, I can use them on a road bike, I can use them on a gravel bike, awesome wheels.\n\nLenny (01:28:35):\nWow, that might be the most obscure random product that we've had yet. Recently we had a humidifier, so I like this collection of products we're building here. Create a wishlist on Amazon maybe.\n\nBill Carr (01:28:47):\nNice.\n\nLenny (01:28:47):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you really like to ask?\n\nBill Carr (01:28:52):\nYeah, it's actually quite basic, it's tell me about your most significant professional accomplishment. And I have to always clarify this, by this I mean not some award you won or some promotion you got, I mean something you built, or some product, some process, some organization you built, something like that. And I could basically then, once they get into that example, ask a lot of probing and follow-up questions and I could fill an entire hour interview just sticking with this one example to really understand how they... Using the STAR method, which is to try to understand everything from the situation to the result, and everything they did in between, who they influenced, how they'd influenced, what decisions they had to make, what roadblocks they encountered. If I just pull on that one string I can learn a whole lot about a candidate.\n\nLenny (01:29:46):\nNext question, what's a favorite life motto that you often find yourself coming back to, sharing with friends, that you find useful?\n\nBill Carr (01:29:55):\nWell, one that I end up coming to a lot professionally, and somewhat personally, is this one called slow is smooth and smooth is fast. This is a, I believe the origins of this one are actually from the Marine Corps for the Scout Snipers, so not trying to promote that particular craft, but the point of it is that actually, and we did this a lot at Amazon, it really oftentimes, to really to go fast, you actually need to go slow first and to be very clear on what you're doing and where you want to go. Most people confuse speed with velocity, and the difference between the two is that velocity has both speed and a vector to it, meaning there's some specific destination. And so I see a lot of people who are going very, very fast, but the destination isn't very clear, they haven't really thought that out well. So slow is smooth, smooth is fast.\n\nLenny (01:30:57):\nThere's a similar quote that I've always thought of, of you've got to go slow to go fast. And I always thought it was was Stephen Covey, but I just Googled as you were chatting and it's someone named Peter Senge in the book Fifth Discipline.\n\nBill Carr (01:31:11):\nIt took me a while, I always wanted to go fast first and not go slow first, so I'd say a lot of my personal development and growth, it's a big thing that I learned from Jeff at Amazon.\n\nLenny (01:31:25):\nFinal question, I don't know if you'll have an answer to this, but is there a pro-tip that you could suggest for using Amazon? Something that people may not know about how to get the most out of using amazon.com?\n\nBill Carr (01:31:36):\nSorry, I have no secret insights. There's not something like if you go on Monday mornings at this time the prices are lower, or something, or in stock is better. No, I know of no such thing.\n\nLenny (01:31:49):\nWhich I think is great, because it's built exactly as it should be for customers.\n\nBill Carr (01:31:54):\nI guess so. But it used to be, maybe in the days of the slower internet, that I would tell you to go at non-peak hours, but this isn't really an issue anymore.\n\nLenny (01:32:06):\nThat'd be wild if that was still an issue. Bill, this was everything I hoped it would be, thank you so much for being here. You already shared where folks can find you online, so I'll skip that question. So final question is, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBill Carr (01:32:19):\nWe're always looking for feedback. You can post a review on Amazon for our book, that's probably the best way. You can fill out the contact us form or send us an email telling us what you found most useful in the book, or what you actually found is missing, what would you like to learn more about? If we were to write another book, or write more, what would you like us to tell you about?\n\nLenny (01:32:46):\nAmazing, and that's bill@workingbackwards.com if they have that feedback. Go buy the book Working Backwards on Amazon and other places, and workingbackwards.com to learn more. Bill, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nBill Carr (01:32:59):\nThanks so much, Lenny, really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny (01:33:00):\nMe too, bye everyone.\n\n(01:33:04):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# 35 years of product design wisdom from Apple, Disney, Pinterest and beyond | Bob Baxley\n\n## Transcript\n\nBob Baxley (00:00:00):\nAlmost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with a phone or with a computer. And unfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. We have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):\nYou actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design.\n\nBob Baxley (00:00:17):\nDesign is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real. Saying a company is design-led does not mean it's designer-led. I've never seen somebody graft it on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist.\n\n(00:00:31):\nIt wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. I just bounced off the culture. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:41):\nWhy did you decide to join Apple?\n\nBob Baxley (00:00:42):\nI just seek out opportunities to witness history. The whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:49):\nWhy do you Think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged? Today, my guest is Bob Baxley. Bob is a designer, executive and advisor who's built in led design teams at Apple, Pinterest, Yahoo, and most recently ThoughtSpot. Over the course of his career that spanned over three decades, Bob has played a pivotal role in the design of the Apple online store, the Apple App Store, Pinterest, and early in his career Yahoo Answers, products that have been used by hundreds of millions of people around the world.\n\n(00:01:21):\nBob also mentors individuals and advises organizations that are working to improve the practice, craft and culture of digital product design. There is something in this conversation for everyone from why you should consider having designed report engineering, why it's your moral obligation to build great products, why you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture or create a prototype of your idea to what the Moon Landing can teach us about building better teams and products. I could listen to Bob all day. I learned a ton from this conversation, including a bunch of really unique insights that I've never heard before.\n\n(00:01:54):\nA big thank you to Annie Warner, Andrew Hogan, Irene A, and Joff Redfern for suggesting questions for this conversation.

Bob, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nBob Baxley (00:04:00):\nLenny, thank you so much. Thanks for having me, but also just thank you for what you do. We are still in early days to try to figure out how to make software together. I think of it like where the film industry was in the 1920s. We've had our talkie moment. We're on the cusp of having our shift to color movement, but we're still trying to figure out how to make movies and a podcast like yours specifically yours I think is one of the greatest resources we have for learning from one another. I appreciate all you're doing for the community and for helping us as a community make better software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:31):\nWow. Well, I really appreciate that. That means a lot coming from you. There's so much I want to talk about in our conversation. There's a story that I hear that you often tell, which is when somebody asked Steve Jobs once, what is your favorite product that you've built that you work on? And his answer, what's that story?\n\nBob Baxley (00:04:49):\nSo I actually can't remember where I heard this, but I believe the story's true. Steve at one point was recounting the products that he had created that he was most proud of, and if I recall the whole list, it was the Apple II, the Mac, the iPod, the iPhone, I think Apple retail was in the list and then he said Apple itself. When I heard that and when I've reflected on it, that is the longest lasting thing. I remember there was also a story that Steve was talking to, I think it was either Ed Catmull or John Lasseter at Pixar, and he said, \"Everything we make is going to be a doorstop in three years, but the stuff you guys make, they're still going to be watching in 100 years.\" So I think Steve had some concept of the longevity of these things.\n\n(00:05:33):\nThey knew the products themselves were very ephemeral, but there's something about the culture of Apple that's lasted a very long time and I personally believe will last for some time yet to come. It's a way of making decisions, it's a way of behaving, it's a way of seeing the value of technology in the world and it infuses everything in that company. I mean everything from the checkout system when you go to the receptionist to what it's like in the cafeteria. At least when I was there, they had patented the pizza box because they had reinvented the pizza box that you would get at Cafe Max because the whole company is constantly asking how can the thing that I'm working on be a little bit better? I think that was something Steve brought to them and had them constantly asking that question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:16):\nOne more Apple question then I'll move on to other stuff. Why do you think that people that have left Apple, a lot of amazing things haven't emerged from people that have left? Humane was a recent example. We're recording this the day after Jony Ive Open AI emerged so we'll see what happens there but just feels like there hasn't been a ton of alumni that have built incredible things.\n\nBob Baxley (00:06:38):\nObviously Tony Fadell would be one with Nest and he'd be an outlier. I think the people that... I went to Pinterest and did not have a successful time in my year and a half at Pinterest. I think my own particular mistake, and I've seen this with some other Apple executives as well as we went directly from Apple, I left Apple on a Friday and I started Pinterest on a Monday. I didn't give myself time to recalibrate to the Pinterest culture. I think at some level, a lot of the challenge is that Apple, and it's not just Apple, I think every major tech company, they have really powerful cultures.\n\n(00:07:11):\nYou get indoctrinated into all those standards and it's really deep. It fuses all of your behavior and how you conduct yourself in the company, away from the company. I think it's pretty hard to immigrate successfully from one of those environments to another. Apple is one of the strongest cultures and there's not many other cultures that natively operate like that. Airbnb is one exception. And so you have guys like Hiroki Asai who leads all of marketing and all of product and Hiroki is crushing at Airbnb. He was incredibly successful at Apple.\n\n(00:07:43):\nIt also should be noted that he had, it was a multi-year gap between the time he left Apple and the time he started Airbnb. He gave himself a little bit of time to get through the... At Apple, I think it was Tim or Steve used to talk about the Apple car wash. Then when you started Apple, they kind of had to take you through the car wash and get off all that stuff that you'd accumulated at other places. It turns out there's a car wash you need to go through when you leave Apple as well. And so I think Hiroki gave himself time to do that and I think that's probably a lot of why he's been so successful at Airbnb. The thing I took away from Apple, and I think this is true for anybody changing from one major culture to another is most likely the new place hires you because of the values of the organization you left, but not the behaviors.\n\n(00:08:23):\nAnd so I think it's important to recalibrate and say, well, I want to hold onto these values. So at Apple, attention to detail, product excellence, doing everything you can for the customer and the user so try to hold onto those values but then think, okay, how are those values best expressed in this culture? I was more successful at expressing those values in the culture of ThoughtSpot, which was my last job than I was in the culture of Pinterest. If I had to do it again, I could probably do better at Pinterest. I think that's useful for anybody leaving one very specific culture and going someplace else, try to hold onto the values but not the behaviors.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:59):\nThis is so interesting and I appreciate you sharing that, the way you described it that it wasn't a successful stint at Pinterest. A lot of people don't share that sort of story and don't put it that way. They see on their LinkedIn, oh, a head of design at Pinterest. Oh, amazing so cool. And then if you're like, oh, okay, but it didn't work out that well, I think that's really interesting. Is there anything more you can share there about what you learned for other people to maybe avoid that sort of situation? Anything you took away from that experience?\n\nBob Baxley (00:09:25):\nOne of my friends that was at Pinterest, I'm still friends with, he said, \"I just thought of it as you bounced off the culture.\" I think that's kind of the way to think of it. I came in thinking I was supposed to behave the way I behaved at Apple, which is very direct, fighting hard. Everybody cares about each other. It's never insulting, but it's intense. That's not really where Pinterest was at the time. Again, all this is a decade ago, so I don't know what any of these companies are like today, but at least when I was there, Pinterest had posters in every conference room that said, big poster that said, say the hard thing. Well, that's where Pinterest was at the time, and I can assure you nobody at Apple was having to remind you to say the hard thing.\n\n(00:10:07):\nAnd so I probably could have picked up on that better than I did. I'll say these careers are really hard and the higher up you go, people think of it like you're climbing a pyramid. I think of it more like you're going out on a branch on a tree and the branch gets a lot more flimsy and can break and you can fall and you get buffeted about by the wind. It's often at a time in your life when there's a lot going on with your family, there could be things going on with your parents' health. I lost my mother when I was at Pinterest. My kids were starting high school, so we're struggling with the teenage years. I had a long commute. It's a lot going on and these jobs are super demanding.\n\n(00:10:46):\nEverything around you is changing really rapidly and you're under tremendous pressure because the financial and success stakes are super high. I think the people falling off of these jobs is the common use case. That is the common story. We have a bias towards survivors and we all talk about how it looks like they made it to the top, but everybody that makes it to the top, there's hundreds of people that don't. One of the things I took away when I was at Pinterest was I came to think that the job of a startup was to grow the founder so they could continue to lead the startup. I think what's true for founders, also true for a lot of the other folks in the executive staff, it's very hard to grow emotionally and developmentally at the rate that the company grows.\n\n(00:11:32):\nA lot of times I think people get outgrown by the role, and I saw that across Apple. I've experienced that myself at different times in my career. I see that happening with my friends and it feels like a failure. I mean, that is the human experience, that's what happens. It's very hard to grow as fast as some of these companies are growing and we could debate the merits of Mark Zuckerberg for example. But when you think about the trajectory from being a kid in a dorm room to within five years, Facebook's a big thing. I mean, think of your own life. Can you process that level of evolution and change? I don't know, I think that's really super hard to do that and stay balanced.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:15):\nAnd also keep doing that for so long. There'll be founders, I think it was Brian's maybe first job or second job, and he's doing that now for 15 years in a row.\n\nBob Baxley (00:12:24):\nOh, founders, it's their life. It's very unusual to see founders move out. I had this other theory that a startup is still a startup until the founder moves aside. By my definition of even Meta is still a startup in a way that Amazon's not, and Airbnb is still a startup in a way that Pinterest is not because Ben's moved on. You don't find out if the culture can sustain itself until the founders are gone and then you really see what's going to happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:49):\nJust to close the loop here, one takeaway here that I think is really interesting is that you can fail in a job and things will be okay. Clearly you're doing A okay and having a place that doesn't work out, doesn't destroy your career, which I think a lot of people feel like if they're not doing well in their current job, it's over. Things are all going to go downhill\n\nBob Baxley (00:13:08):\nYour career's not your life. There's a lot more to it than that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:11):\nAnd then just to give someone something tactical here, so you've realized the culture of Pinterest, you bounced off of it. I love that metaphor. If you were to, when you're looking at new companies, what's one thing you look at or a question you ask or something you now look at to make sure you avoid that in the future, that culture clash?\n\nBob Baxley (00:13:30):\nI'm fortunate at this stage of my career that I usually get to interview with the CEO or the founders or something like that. What I'm usually looking for is do they have a story as to why they believe in design? Really in their heart and soul, do they care about design? Because if I go into a company that doesn't really value the thing that I do, I'm just not going to have a great time and I'm going to be constantly buffeting up against all sorts of people. I want to make sure I've got air cover from the highest people in the company setting the culture.\n\n(00:13:57):\nIn the case of, again, my most recent job was with a company called ThoughtSpot. And ThoughtSpot was founded by a gentleman named Ajeet Singh, and Ajeet grew up in rural India, but he tells this really great story about he studied chemical engineering, he moves to the United States. Early in his career, he's working for Honeywell and they did a couple of engagements with IDEO. As a very young person, he got to see what IDEO did and he realized the power of design and he's taken that to all of his companies. He started Nutanix before he came to ThoughtSpot, before he started ThoughtSpot. And so when I heard that, I'm like, oh, this is a guy that gets design right from the very beginning.\n\n(00:14:32):\nI've also come to believe that I actually have never seen a company that grafted design on after the founding. I could name lots of companies that I think are kind of design led, not always designer led, but design led or design centric. But I've never seen somebody grafted on after the fact. It's there at the beginning in the root DNA or doesn't exist. And so the thing that I'm looking for when I interview is, is it there at the beginning? Can I get a credible story that tracks it back to that?\n\n(00:14:59):\nAnd if that's the case, then I think I can find a way to navigate in that culture. We have a shared value system in a way that as an American, I could immigrate to Australia and the culture would be slightly different, but we'd have a shared value system that I could relate to. If I moved to, I don't know, Burma or China or something, it would be wildly more challenging because the base view of the world, the base understanding of the world's just different and it'd be much harder for me to adapt to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:29):\nI think a way to extrapolate that insight is just whatever function you're in, get a sense of how important that function is to that business. Do the founders value engineering? Do they value product? Do they value design? Depending on who you are.\n\nBob Baxley (00:15:42):\nWhy would you want to work in a place that doesn't value the thing that you do? God, that would suck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):\nYou actually have a really unique perspective on just what is design that I haven't heard before. Let me ask you that question is what is design?\n\nBob Baxley (00:15:55):\nWell, I'm going to go back to the Edward Tufte quote that I use all the time, which is design is clear thinking made visible. And so I think most people when they talk about design, they think of it as the visual expression of an idea. They think of it as a team or a function or a group. I think of it as a holistic mindset. When design thinking became big, I was always really confused because I didn't know how else you could think. That was just how I naturally thought, which is design is trying to imagine the future you want to live in and then take the steps to make it real.\n\n(00:16:27):\nIt's living with a certain type of intentionality in almost a Buddhist type way, which is different from science, which is observational trying to understand. It's a little bit different from engineering, which is we kind of know where we want go at the end, but we're trying to go one step at a time versus design's trying to see some further out future state and account for a larger or a different set of constraints and issues than engineering or some of the other problem solving methodologies. Again, I look at it as a company, does the company think in a design mindset and Apple does, Airbnb does. I don't get the sense that Google does and I don't get the sense that Amazon does. That's not a critique on them. I don't think that those organizations are competing on design in the same way. But again, I want to go work at a place that as an organization thinks in a design type method.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:19):\nAlong those lines, a lot of people imagine every founder, every product builder is just, yes, I'd love amazing design. I'd love our products to be incredibly beautiful, intuitive, so easy for everyone to use and understand, but they don't actually invest in these areas and they don't put a lot of resources into the designing process. What's the best pitch you can make and that you do make to companies to help them see the strategic value of design and the bottom of the value of design.\n\nBob Baxley (00:17:50):\nLet me back up and just dissect a little bit the way you described design, you described it in really tactical terms. You said beautiful, intuitive products that make sense. I think it was something like that. What you were describing was you were describing the part of the iceberg that sits above the water line, which is the result. That's one of the outcomes of design, but that's not the real heavy lifting of design. Design is more like liberal arts or philosophy or something. It's like what do we try to achieve at a much lower level? And so what I talk to founders and people about the value of design, what I'm pushing them on is when we can get organizational alignment around what we want to do philosophically, why do we exist? What's the vision for the company? How do all these things ladder up through vision, through mission, through specific tenets, design strategies.\n\n(00:18:36):\nAnd then into actual execution. How do we ladder that whole thing up so it makes sense as a whole? That's the magic of design. The difference is when you design things, you end up with a bunch of bricks that are piled into a beautiful impenetrable wall. If you don't do that, you end up with a bunch of bricks scattered across the backyard and they don't really add up to anything. I think that's one of the things, if you look, again to go back to Apple, but we could also talk about Lego Lyca, Porsche, Airbnb, Patagonia, there's other companies that make sense as a design centered organization. If you think about everything they do, it all ladders together into one cohesive sensical thing. It's integrated. Makes sense as a unit.\n\n(00:19:20):\nI think that's a huge difference and an incredible strategic advantage because the company can operate with much greater efficiency. They can onboard new people and get them in line. Even Apple, for example, the team that designed the online store, we had six designers for a store that ran in 30 some odd countries, 12 and a half thousand instances of the store doing billions of dollars of revenue. We had six designers. Any other company would've had 60 or more. Apple's able to operate with much smaller staff because they have real clarity of vision of what they're doing. And the benefit of operating with a smaller staff is not just that it saves money on payroll, it's that you have... The way the minds come together to create something that feels like a single whole is a much higher chance when you have fewer people involved.\n\n(00:20:10):\nI joke about The Beatles. You get The Beatles with four people, you don't get The Beatles with eight people and you certainly don't get it with 24 people. The teams get too big and you can't get that what Brian Eno calls scenius. Brian Eno has this great word that he uses, scenius is the genius that comes when you have a group together. Scenius is the collective idea of genius and I think that's something that's really magical that I've experienced in my career, but usually in smaller groups. It's hard to do with a giant group.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:40):\nI love this metaphor of The Beatles as the way most people describe this is designed by committee never works. I love that the way you describe it is the Beatles is like the ideal size a small group versus a committee.\n\nBob Baxley (00:20:54):\nI just always have to point out to people that there are 20 people that worked on the original Mac. I mean it's 20 of them, that's it, 20. Susan Kare was one of them, Andy Hertzfeld, you go through the list, 20 of them are on the patent. There's 24 that are on the iPhone patent. Now there's other people involved, but generally there's 24 people on the iPhone patent. And that was the team. That was Project Purple that was doing that stuff. These are not massive massive groups doing these things. If you had put a massive group, I don't know man, maybe it'd end up with the Zune or something completely different. Who knows?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):\nThey probably did have a massive group on the Zune.\n\nBob Baxley (00:21:27):\nYeah, so there's something, four is too few for what we're trying to achieve at scale. But even if you look at Pixar, any good movie on the scripting and story side, it's usually a fairly small team. Even when you move into character development, stuff like that, it's fairly small and then it really scales when you move into production. It's just hard to figure out something new to do together when there's too many people involved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):\nI think that word new is really key here. I think when people hear this advice, they're thinking at their existing company, should we just keep our company small? Should we not scale this thing that we have? I think what you're describing, which I completely agree with is new stuff for sure you want to keep the team small and tight, but as things grow and scale, what's your take on just, okay, actually it's okay to have a lot of people on this.\n\nBob Baxley (00:22:13):\nWell, you have to bring a lot of people in once you figure out what you're doing. And so to your point, once you realize you're building Disneyland and you've got the whole thing set and people know what it's about, then they can come in and understand, oh, I'm playing my piece over here. I'm supposed to design the line experience for the new ride sitting in Tomorrowland, but I know where that fits into this larger thing. I think you can scale once you have clarity of vision, but it's very difficult to get vision with a lot of people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:42):\nGreat. I think that's really powerful advice. It's just when you're starting something new. I actually had a CPA of N26 who was basically leading Google Hangouts, the initial launch of Google Hangouts, and he told the story of they put so many resources on it. We got to win. We got to do this. Larry Page or Sergey was sitting next to him just like we got to make this work and putting everything they could into it and it didn't work out. And I think that's-\n\nBob Baxley (00:23:07):\nNo, no, the more people you put in it, the slower everything becomes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:09):\nI want to go back to something you said about what design is. I think this is really interesting. And so the way you described design to a lot of people, it sounds like that's like product management also and product leadership, setting, strategy, vision, figuring out how everything fits together. I think your experience here, I think Apple is a very different kind of company where design actually leads a lot of this. At a lot of other companies, it doesn't work that way. Any thoughts? And just how you advise companies, think about the split between design and product management that aren't Apple.\n\nBob Baxley (00:23:38):\nOne of the best lines I ever heard was from my friend Joseph O'Sullivan at dinner one night. He said saying a company is design led does not mean it's designer led. And so what I try to hammer home with people is that when I talk about design as a mindset, I'm talking about it as a mindset. Anybody could have that mindset functioning in any role, any designer could have a product mindset. In fact, I think that's a lot of what the design community is trying to get at now when they say designers should be speaking the language of business. I think what they're saying is designers need to inhabit the product mindset as well. Maybe to some degree even the sales mindset.\n\n(00:24:11):\nLook, both functions matter. I look at my counterparts in product and I assume that they're much better connected to the customer, that they understand much better the business realities, and I expect them to drive the roadmap. I may have some points of view on the roadmap. I may offer some critique. I may have my own suggestions and agenda in there. But once they say this is the roadmap, I have to believe that they're right and I don't try to bleed into their space. I very much believe that once you get into a company, your job is to figure out your role and respect the boundaries between the different groups.\n\n(00:24:43):\nI'm like, you guys tell us what you need us to do, what the features need to be, when they need to be delivered, what the issues are, and then give us the time and space to come up with a solution to those problems. And then we can work together to decide whether or not our solutions actually solve the problem as you understand it, but I'll stay out of your roadmap and you stay out of my design stop and let's try to get to the promised land together. I assume that the product managers, particularly in enterprise SaaS companies, like my team, ThoughtSpot did data analytics. My team didn't know anything about data analytics. We didn't have any of that insight. We didn't have the bandwidth, the mental horsepower to go out and do that stuff. We had our hands full just trying to figure out the UI.\n\n(00:25:22):\nIt's one of the points I try to make too, when people are starting to theorize that gen AI can remove teammates and oh, the designers don't need engineers and the PMs don't need the designers and everybody thinks they can throw engineering overboard. And I'm like, stop it. We all need each other and we need each other because we need those different mindsets. One of those mindsets inhabits somebody's head completely. I just don't think you can simultaneously hold multiple mindsets in your head. It's not that one of my PM counterparts couldn't bring a lot to the design table, it's just I need you to play that position. Like in baseball, the second-\n\nBob Baxley (00:26:00):\nLike in baseball, the second baseman doesn't cover first. That's not how it works. Everybody's got to spread the field and play their position so we can take care of the whole thing and respect that together we're going to come up with something better than any one of us would've come up with alone and embrace the creative tension, welcome it. We still have to all go out to lunch and love each other and have fun together and keep in mind that we're having fun together, but I like the rub. That's where all the magic happens.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:28):\nThat was a very illuminating clarification. Something else that I heard you believe that I haven't heard before is that design share report to engineering.\n\nBob Baxley (00:26:38):\nSo I'll say that every company culture is different and different organizations work in different ways. In my experience, I think that design is most successful at impacting what ships at the end if design is considered phase zero of the engineering process, rather than a by product or a part of the product process. What I've seen happen over and over in my experience, a ThoughtSpot, Pinterest, other places when you're working directly with product, it's easy to leave engineering out of the loop and product and design can go cook up stuff that doesn't quite make sense technically or is really hard to implement or is just a bridge too far. And I think that engineering doesn't feel like they're a part of it, so you bring them at the end and they haven't really been brought along so they don't quite understand how to extrapolate from the specs you make into what should really ship.\n\n(00:27:25):\nMaybe they don't bring the same level of enthusiasm to it, because they haven't been brought along. So I think there's something about having the design and engineering team very tightly connected and kind of living together. And it's not that you have to do that structurally from an organization point of view, but it's hard-pressed if you don't. I also think you can just account for timelines and costs and things better when design's part of engineering. And many of my design friends will push back on this and they'll say design should be its own thing and it should be an independent group and we should have three co-equal branches of government, and that's a solid argument as well, and there's some places where that works beautifully. My experiences at design rarely has a budget or an army, and so it's very hard for them to really hold their own in that sort of a setting.\n\n(00:28:09):\nAlso, although you'll see people argue with me on LinkedIn about how design needs to be measured and we need to have metrics and be held accountable for a number, I don't really believe that in my heart. I've just never seen a number that you could apply to design that we could reliably affect. So I think it's very hard to hold design as an organization accountable for a particular outcome the way that most of the other C-level roles are held accountable. Sales has a number, engineering has very specific expectations, product has very specific expectations. And although I know this will frustrate some of my friends, I just haven't been able to figure out how that works for design. And again, it can vary from culture to culture. Certainly there's very successful chief design officers and we could go through the list. I just think in many companies it's a stretch, it's just hard.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:56):\nWhat I see work, and I'm curious to get your take is just product, engineering, design have exactly the same goal and the more everyone... And their performance as an employee is tied to the same thing essentially because then everyone is pushing in the same direction versus like, oh, I have my engineering goal, I have my design goal, I have my PM goal, and just creates all kinds of weird incentives.\n\nBob Baxley (00:29:17):\nYeah, look, I would kind of defer to you on that, honestly. You've talked to a lot more people across a lot more companies, so you have a much broader set of information you're working with. If you add my whole career together, I've worked at maybe half a dozen places, so a fairly limited sample set. And every design team that I've ever been a part of, I've been a part of. So I also kind of have a biased view as to what didn't work for me in those particular organizations. I'll go back to what I said, every company's different, every culture is slightly different. It's not one size fits all.\n\n(00:29:45):\nI point out the idea of design reporting to engineering just because I don't think people consider the possibility often enough. So there's three options, design is its own thing, design is part of product, design is part of engineering. And I think there's a moment when you can back up and make an intelligent choice about the pros and cons for each of those options inside your org. And so I would encourage people to just take a design mentality and put on that designer mindset just for a moment and say, well, what's the thing that we're trying to produce? What's the incentives that we're trying to create? What's the future state that we're trying to get to? And which of these three options, permutations is going to help us get there the best?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):\nI love how radical this idea is. I've not heard it. I think designers will be like, \" You stop it. Just stop it.\" So have you operated this way? Have you had design report to engineering in companies you've worked at?\n\nBob Baxley (00:30:38):\nSorry, but that's how it worked at Apple the whole time under Steve. Design always reported to engineering. Now I think it's structured a little bit differently, but design has always been part of engineering at Apple, so I saw it work quite effectively there obviously.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:53):\nIt's so interesting. Okay, so say just to give someone something very tactical to do on their team, say they don't want to go to this extreme and move the design org under engineering, what's something you've seen work that helps achieve similar outcomes with having engineers integrated early in the design process?\n\nBob Baxley (00:31:09):\nYeah, look, I think you have to find some way that you are able to identify a few people in engineering that I refer to as creative technologists. So these are people that can come into what's ultimately kind of a fairly airy-fairy philosophical discussion about what we could do and what's right from a conceptual model perspective. Ultimately, it's sort of a philosophy issue. And there's not that many PMs or engineers that can sit in that space and be comfortable with the ambiguity of it all. A PM's likely going to come in and they're going to say, okay, well that was a great one hour. What's the next step? And as a designer I'm always like, well, the next step is we're going to have another meeting and we're going to talk again. And the engineers oftentimes when they're starting to hear different ideas, they're already cutting into the code and they're trying to figure out what's hard and what's easy.\n\n(00:31:54):\nAnd so I think the trick is at the beginning, can you find a small group of people from the different functions that can sit with the ambiguity of the space and talk through a broad range of ideas to identify the direction we want to go into? And then once everybody kind of falls in love with the direction, then you can go into the more tactical mindset of, okay, well, when we can ship it and who can we show it to and how are we going to code it and when's it going to go live and all those sorts of things. But the trick is to try to find a group that can sit, again, in the ambiguous maybe space. I do think it's critical to have everybody together at the beginning so they all feel like they're part of it. And the worst thing is when you bring something fully baked... Well, the worst thing when you bring something fully baked to anybody for their approval.\n\n(00:32:36):\nWe could talk about this when you take a final design to an exec and an exec sees it for the first time in a high resolution state, I'll get to that in a second. But when you go to an engineering team says, \"Hey, we've been working in the lab for six months and we have this thing that we love it and we just can't wait for you guys to build it, and here it is,\" I don't know, [inaudible 00:32:54] mention here. They're going to be excited about. They're not order takers. How do you make them part of the process? And every product of consequence that I worked on, there was some moment when we were showing it to some critical person and you could see that they fell in love with it. Sometimes they're literally pointing at the comps on the board, sometime you're in a meeting and they're just like, \"God, I just love this.\"\n\n(00:33:14):\nAnd for me, that was always the critical moment because I knew that design can't bring you this stuff into the world on its own. We can't raise this baby, we need the village, and we need the village to fall in love with the baby. And so until that happens, you're not really quite sure if this thing's going to take off or not. And so it was always extremely important to me that you had a few key engineers and some product people fall in love with it so they could defend it and embrace it and enhance it and add to it. And you got to bring them along at the very beginning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:46):\nWhat I'm hearing there is there's a big part of just buy-in and then there's also just obviously more good ideas early are great.\n\nBob Baxley (00:33:52):\nYeah, sorry. Buy-in doesn't feel quite right to me, because buy-in feels like, oh, I've come to agree with you. And that's different from it's a part of me. When I'm talking to teams, the thing I try to tell them is, I walk into the office every day with the idea that everyone that I work with is fundamentally a maker. Everybody in product design, engineering, we've all chosen these careers. Everybody's super smart, everybody's super ambitious. Everybody could have done a thousand other things, but they're choosing to spend their precious lifetime and creative energy creating software.\n\n(00:34:28):\nAnd so I believe in my heart that they're all fundamentally makers. And the thing that I know about makers is that they all want to make something they're proud of so they can take it home at the end of the day and show it to their parents and say, \"Look at what I made at school with my friends today.\" That's the fundamental thing, and they're all doing it from their own different points of view and their own different incentives and mindsets, but they all at the end of the day want to make something they're proud of. And so it's not a matter of getting their buy-in, it's a matter of them being a part of it. I don't know, it's a part of their soul in a really deep, meaningful way. And I'm not sure you can graph that onto somebody after the fact. They kind of need to be there at the moment of inception, if you will.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:12):\nWow, that's a really beautiful answer. I imagine for a lot of people hearing this, making every feature and product they build a part of their soul feels like a very high bar if they're building some kind of B2B SaaS software. So I guess just thoughts in just how much you should spend, how much time, how many resources, how deep you go on design for all these things you're building. Say you're building some kind of, I don't know, expense management system or HRS thing, just like, what do you recommend people do with, in terms of just how far to go in design as a lever, as a differentiator maybe?\n\nBob Baxley (00:35:49):\nWell, inherent in your question is this assumption that design takes more time. And so I'm going to kind of reject that premise, because I don't think design takes more time. I think design exists. There is going to be a design. It's whether it's going to be a good one or not. And I think there's things that you can do so that you're able to operate it at a quicker pace as design. Again, if you get the... We haven't talked about tenets yet, but we'll get to that in a moment. If you kind of create a shared philosophical understanding of the product and what you're trying to do, you can go really fast because you're not asking the question of what should you do, you're asking the question of, what would this company with what we stand for do for this thing? And that's a much easier question that's much smaller.\n\n(00:36:29):\nSo if you look at the companies that have the largest design teams, they're often the companies that have the most ambiguous cultures and the most unclear design vision. When you go to companies that really know what they're doing and they're clear that this is who we are, this is what we stand for, the design teams are super small because they're not sitting there trying to do all these permutations with color and typography and ideas. They're operating in a really narrow vein, because they know who they are. It's very much like individuals. When you're a teenager or a young adult, you can spend a lot of time trying to figure out what to wear because you haven't really sorted it out yet. But by the time you get to be a little bit older, you've kind of got your personal style, and so dressing in the morning gets to be a lot easier.\n\n(00:37:09):\nLike at Pinterest. I was at Pinterest at a point when Pinterest wasn't quite sure who it was. And so when we were going to do an onboarding flow, we had to look at a really broad sweep of things, because we were trying to sort it out. But you had other places that knew what they were about, Apple's the key example there, we weren't trying to figure out what it was about. We were trying to figure out what was the apple way to do this particular thing, and so that moves a lot faster.\n\n(00:37:31):\nAnd I agree, look, having your soul at every little checkbox sounds like a high bar and in some ways it is. I think you need to be able to back up and look at the product, maybe not at every state, but generally every six months or a year, you need to back up and ask yourself, am I proud of this? Is this something I am happy to be a part of? Do I believe in this? Is it a representative of my best work given the circumstances I was in, which has limitations around time and resources and everything else, is this the best I could do or am I just sort of trying to get through the day I have other goals?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:06):\nSo let's actually follow the thread of design tenets and principles. This is something I've heard about you, that you're a big fan of design tenets versus design principles. What is the difference? Why is this so important?\n\nBob Baxley (00:38:20):\nYeah, so look, there's whole websites dedicated to design principles, and if you go and you read it, you'll see a lot of principles like simple, clear, beautiful, fast, secure. You'll hear these words and all these words are great. I mean, obviously I have nothing against any of these words, but they're not useful as decision-making tools because nobody would ever argue the opposite. Nobody ever sat in a meeting and said, \"Oh, forget clear. Let's try to make it as confusing as possible.\" So the idea of clear, it's nice to have out there as, I don't know, sort of a platitude to move towards, but I just don't think it helps you make decisions. And so tenets are really decision-making tools and it's sort of like... A classic one is paper versus plastic. It's just too complicated to reconsider that every time you're at the grocery store. So you sort of make a rule for yourself and you're just a paper person or a plastic person, you move on from there.\n\n(00:39:07):\nAnd so it's sort of that at scale. And the story comes from when they were starting to work on Keynotes, apparently the guy who was responsible for originating Keynote went to Steve and said, \"How should we think about Keynote?\" And Steve said, \"I want you to keep three things in mind. One is it should be difficult to make ugly presentations. Two, you should focus on cinematic quality transitions. And three, you should optimize for innovation over PowerPoint compatibility.\" And if you take that last one in particular, if he hadn't kind of said, we're going to go this way instead of that way, that team would've spent the next 10 years gouging each other's eyes out over whether they should try to go for PowerPoint compatibility or innovation. And so when I was at ThoughtSpot, I realized pretty early on that I wasn't going to be able to have any sort of command and control over everything that was going to happen in the product.\n\n(00:39:56):\nThere was too many people involved, too many engineering teams, most of them were in India. I needed to move from a mindset of control to one of choreography. I needed to try to set the culture and set certain design tenets that everyone could internalize and follow and hopefully then make the right decisions in that groove, if you will. And so we had three, I think you can't have more than three or four because you need everybody to memorize them. They can't be consulting a handbook. And so, one of them was documentation is a failure state. In enterprise companies, a lot of times people think, \"Oh, we'll just put it in the manual. It'll be part of the training.\" And I would constantly be coming back and go, \"Stop it. Nobody wants to learn our software. Nobody cares. We are just one more browser tab in a world of browser tabs. We are not this user's complete world. They do not want to learn this stuff.\"\n\n(00:40:46):\nDocumentation's a failure state. Maybe we can't always avoid it, but we should do everything we can to simplify things so you can figure it out in the context of the product. That's number one. Number two is every interaction should start simple and the users should have to opt into complexity. So our main competitor at the time was Tableau. Tableau started with complexity. That was their whole value prop is like, \"We're a super powerful tool. We can do all sorts of stuff.\" So when you sit down at Tableau, it feels like you're flying the space shuttle. And if you're a professional data analyst, that's great. That's the kind of tool you wanted. That wasn't what ThoughtSpot was about. We were trying to take data analytics into the hands of what I call mere mortals, also known as business users, people who didn't live in breathe this stuff every day.\n\n(00:41:26):\nSo our goal with them was they could sit down and it was an approachable piece of software and they could turn on all the bells and whistles and power if they wanted it, so that was the second one. Start simple, let the users opt into complexity. And the third one was the entire product should look and feel like it came from a single mind. And this was a tenet to try to combat the natural tendency of enterprise companies to really fragment because you have all these different teams working on their incentive to work just on their little piece. And so they think about what's right for them and they don't back up to look at the whole thing.\n\n(00:41:55):\nAnd so we had this tenet, the whole thing should look and feel like it came from a single mind to just try to remind people, how does this fit into the whole system? And sometimes we need to go along and do things that work for the product that don't necessarily work quite the way we might want them to for our feature. And so those tenets were all... Again, they were all decision-making tools. And when we would have design debates, we could just come back to this, wait, are we actually starting simple and forcing them to opt into complexity or are we doing something else here?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:21):\nSo there's kind of this implication in this discussion about tenets is that you need to be very opinionated. There's a clear here's what's in and here's what's out. Is there anything more along those lines and are there other tenet examples you could share to give people some inspiration as they think about their potential tenets?\n\nBob Baxley (00:42:39):\nIt's very context specific, so it's a little bit like what are your tenets for parenting? It's a very specific personal type thing that's germane to your particular context. So I'm not sure if I have a lot of other examples, and I haven't heard this used by a lot of other companies, so I haven't been able to add a bunch of stuff. We tried to come out with tenets for individual features and we had trouble with that. It felt like they operated at sort of the design strategy level. And I just think that varies dramatically from company to company. What I would look for is if you're a design leader or a product leader, try to pay attention to what are the debates that we keep having over and over where people kind of seem to be digging in and things sort of seem to be bifurcating into two camps.\n\n(00:43:23):\nAnd then is there something we can do where we just have that debate once and for all, we decide as an organization, we're going left instead of right, and you're absolutely correct. You have to be opinionated, but that's how you're going to win. There's no unopinionated software that's been successful. You have to have a point of view. The question is, what's it going to be? So I'd say practically just try to look for places where it seems the team's having the same debate over and over and have it once, get it done, and put it behind you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:52):\nAnd make it a tenet. And why is the word tenet versus principle so important?\n\nBob Baxley (00:43:57):\nI don't know. I settled on tenet. I'd have to go look up the definition. I was trying to differentiate it from principles because I think principles are just... I describe principles as sort of Applehood & Motherpie. Again, they're just not something people are going to argue over. And so I didn't think it was wise to try to co-op that word and change how people think about it so much as I might be more successful just coming up with a different word altogether.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:24):\nMakes sense. This entire episode is brought to you by Stripe. Every single one of the Forbes top 50 AI companies that has a product in the market today uses Stripe to monetize it. $1.4 trillion flows through Stripe annually, which is equivalent to over 1% of the entire global GDP. And Stripe isn't just a payments platform, they also have a product called Stripe Billing, which powers billing for companies that you may have heard of: OpenAI, Anthropic, Figma, Atlassian, and over 300,000 other companies.\n\n(00:44:56):\nStripe Billing lets you bill and manage customers no matter your pricing model, from simple recurring billing, to usage based billing, to sales negotiated contracts, collect and retain more revenue, automate revenue management workflows, and accept payments globally. Use Stripe to handle all of your payment related needs, including billing, revenue, operations, checkout flows, or simply launching or inventing new business models. Learn all the ways that Stripe can grow revenue for your business at Stripe.com.\n\n(00:45:26):\nOkay. I want to zoom out a little bit and another theme that came up a bunch when I ask people about you and how you think is that you have a really strong feeling that building great product and building successful product is a moral obligation of people that are in tech. Talk about why you feel that way and what that even means.\n\nBob Baxley (00:45:45):\nWell, look, the example I use mostly is if you go to an airport and you look around, you'll see a lot of people using their phone to navigate that system. They're trying to figure out where their gate is, what time their flight's on, whether or not... Can they pull up their boarding pass, et cetera. And just watch people, watch their faces, watch the level of confusion and frustration. Some of them are tech superheroes like you and me and most of your listeners, but a lot of them are just mere mortals and they're not living and breathing this stuff all the time. And a lot of times they're super frustrated and then take that and scale it out to their entire day. And almost everyone living in a modern economy now is going to have hundreds of interactions with the phone or with a computer. And a lot of those interactions are going to be consequential.\n\n(00:46:27):\nUnfortunately, a lot of those interactions are not going to be great. They're going to be confusing and frustrating. When I'm speaking to live audiences, I often ask people, okay, please raise your hand if you've had a frustrating or confusing experience with software in the last month? And obviously every hand goes up. Okay, how about so far this week? Most all hands stay up. I'm like, okay, how about so far today? And most of the hands stay up, and it's often that I speak in the morning, I'm like, okay, everybody's had a frustrating experience with software and it's 10 o'clock in the morning. That's a problem, people, because each one of those interactions, it takes a little bit of energy away from you and it ramps your frustration just a little bit. And the bummer about software, both for the audience and for the creators is that it's an anonymous medium.\n\n(00:47:10):\nNobody gets to see who's making these things. You and I together, we might be able to name six designers that have worked on products we care about. And the only reason we could do that is because a designer and I know a bunch of them. By yourself, I'd be surprised if you could name more than a handful. And again, we work in tech. So if you think about the billions of people out there that don't work in tech, to them, these products are just these crazy faceless things created by a bunch of people who knows where, and these products are causing them untold amounts of frustration and confusion, and it just takes away from their life quality. And I think we have an obligation as product people to put that emotional energy back into people's lives. They don't want to try to figure out how to navigate our login screens or go through our onboarding process, they just want to get home and spend time with their families and pet their dogs and have a nice dinner.\n\n(00:48:02):\nI just think every time we make a demand on the audience, that's a failure on our part. And so I do think it comes... I cast it in a moral way, and I talk about it that way because I don't think many people working in the industry understand the scale of what they're doing, again, because it's an anonymous field. We never see anybody on the other side of the glass.\n\n(00:48:22):\nBut I think with this podcast, it'll go out to, I don't know, hundreds of thousands of people. If you and I saw all the people that will potentially listen to this in one place, we would think to ourselves, oh my goodness, that's like a lot of people. And we might think of it differently. We might behave differently. My team at Apple, but also my friends that are working at Facebook or Google or wherever, it's very hard to really understand that they're creating something in Figma on their computer that's going to be interacted with by billions of people, thousands and thousands of times. If you lose sight of that I think just, I don't know, you get sloppy and disrespectful is the wrong word, but I think you just lose sight of how much impact you're having on other people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:06):\nWow, that's really inspiring. That makes me want to build products and make them awesome. There's so much power to that. What this makes me think about a little bit is kind of random, but when I see someone click and watch one of my podcast videos on YouTube, I'm like, wow, that's one person that's going to spend their time watching this thing. Wow, I really want to make... It gives me more motivation to make these even better and better.\n\nBob Baxley (00:49:31):\nYeah, look, I think you have to find ways to go... You have to find where you go out of your way to see people using software in real time. I've worked on products that have been used by billions of people. I have friends who have touched billions of people. None of us ever get to see anybody use this stuff in the wild, in their natural state. Maybe we see them in a lab or something like that, but I've never seen anybody just randomly using even Pinterest. But there's ways that you can go and as a creator, as a maker, you can go and watch people using software in the wild. So just go observe people going through self-checkout at Target, which is the best self-checkout I've ever seen. Go watch that, then go watch it at some other grocery store where it's not as great and really notice what happens with people.\n\n(00:50:11):\nMuch to my kids' frustration when their friends are over, I often grab their friend's phone and just sort of flip through it to try to understand how people are organizing their home screens and which apps they use. And maybe there's something in there that I haven't seen, I'll ask them what that is and ask them to give me a tour of it. I think we're living in a time where people don't do so many usability studies, so a lot of folks get pretty far into their careers without ever having watched mere mortals actually use software. Instead, we're relying on metrics and stuff, which I sort of joked that relying on metrics to understand what's happening at the user level is like looking at raw data from a radio telescope instead of just going out inside and looking at the night sky. You got to find a way to watch the audience.\n\n(00:50:54):\nFilmmakers can go to a theater, they can watch people, understand stuff. Comedians can go to a comedy club, they can start to develop an intuition about why people laugh. None of us have an obvious way to go watch people use software, so we don't really understand how humans process what's happening on the screen. And you have to just find ways to do that. And fortunately, software is everywhere. It's not just desktop or mobile software. I mean, there's ATM machines, there's ticketing kiosks, there's point of sale systems everywhere. I mean, go watch somebody over 70 fumble with a chip card insert or watch somebody try to figure out Apple Pay. And these are pretty seamless experiences and still there's cognitive friction in all this stuff. Just go rent a car and notice how long it takes you to figure out what the heck is going on with the dashboard. There's lots of opportunities to try to develop that intuition of how people navigate the human computer interaction, and we need to find ways to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:50):\nAn important element of what you're describing here, which I think maybe people miss, is that you're talking about just any software, not your own product, in order to start building your sense of taste and gut feeling for what-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:00):\nBuilding your sense of taste and gut feeling for what works and doesn't work. And I had a guest on recently, Guillermo Rauch from Vercel, founder of Vercel, and he had a really great phrase of something they do at their company. They have this kind of mission of exposure hours. Increase your exposure hours to people using our product. And then you can extrapolate that to any product.\n\nBob Baxley (00:52:26):\nYeah, well there's using your product, but I always think when you're watching somebody use your product, you come into it with a psychological bias that makes it hard for you to really see what's going on. So there's something about just understanding the audience and how they process information on a screen, not your product.\n\n(00:52:40):\nAt one point when I was redesigning a checkout system, we did what I called a reality check, which was we held a traditional usability style exercise in a lab and all that sort of stuff, but we had the subjects come through and go through checkout in other products. So we watched them go through eBay and Williams-Sonoma and Amazon or something like that. And we learned a ton about checkout, about what was important to them, how it turns out ship quote is almost as important as price. Things that if we had been watching them use our own product, I'm not sure we would've picked up on, because we would've been sitting there yelling at them to click on the button. Or we would've had a bias and wanting to see the positive things. Whereas, if you just watch people that are using adjacent products could be super useful.\n\n(00:53:22):\nAnd again, we work in a medium, software is a medium, and we need to understand our medium in the same way. Again, musicians go to concerts, filmmakers go to movies, comedians go to comic clubs. When do people like you and I go watch people just use software? Where do we develop that intuition? And unfortunately I think you have to go out of your way to do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:42):\nTalk about more about this idea that software is a medium. This is something that came up a bunch also in conversations with folks that have worked with you, that this is something that you believe.\n\nBob Baxley (00:53:51):\nYeah, you're so good with the research, Lenny. Yeah, look, so I left Pinterest in 2016, sorry, 2016. And I didn't have anything lined up so I had some time to myself and I was driving up and down the peninsula here in Silicon Valley meeting with other design leaders and just sort of commiserating with people. And you may remember there was a very consequential presidential election in the United States in 2016 and there was some impression that social media had had a significant impact on that election.\n\n(00:54:22):\nSo I was kind of driving around Silicon Valley and I was just sort of wondering what the heck happened. I moved here in 1990 when the hippie ethos that was really at the core of Silicon Valley, and the hippie ethos was still very visible, it was very much a part of what was interesting to me about the valley when I moved here. But 2016 is a long time later and that hippie ethos had gotten pretty quiet.\n\n(00:54:45):\nAnd so I was listening to a podcast about the history of Silicon Valley by a Stanford group. The podcast was called Raw Data, and it was season two. And it starts off with an episode called A Monument to a Dead Child, which is about Stanford University, and it ends with Zuckerberg's testimony in front of Congress. And in the middle of that, they start talking about the counterculture revolution in the late 1960s in San Francisco and elsewhere. And they quote this book by a guy named Fred Turner, I think it is, the book's called From Counterculture to Cyberculture. And he has this quote that is, \"you have to ask why it is personal computing got started in Northern California in the late 1960s when at the time every major tech company in the country was on the East Coast. And the answer is because there was a very small group of people in and around Stanford University that saw software as a new form of media on par with movies, music and books.\"\n\n(00:55:41):\nAnd when I heard that, all of a sudden I went, wait a second, boom. That is why I do this. I am fundamentally a maker. In high school I was a photographer, in college I was going to be a filmmaker, after college I went to music school. After music school I started a graphic design studio. I am a maker. And I realized looking back, I was just hunting for my medium. And it took me until I was 27 to find software as my medium. It's like, oh, I'm a maker that designs software.\n\n(00:56:05):\nAnd then when I heard that software as a medium, that whole concept of what I'd been doing with my life and who I was about, it just sort of all came together really quickly. And I realized, oh, I am into software because software makes me feel a certain way when it's working well. And what I find so troubling now is that a lot of time it's not working that way.\n\n(00:56:27):\nAnd I remember the first time I saw a computer, probably a lot of people on listening to the show can remember maybe the first time they saw a desktop computer, probably the first time they saw a pension zoom on a phone. You remember all that stuff. It was just freaking magic man. It was the future. It was so cool, and it just felt like the most amazing aurora borealis, or sunrise, or whatever. There was a sense of awe and wonder that filled me and probably a lot of listeners, that's probably the thing that motivated you to be in the field.\n\n(00:56:58):\nAnd so I realized software is a medium because there's an emotional component to it. Like a hammer and saw, they're not really pulling out an emotion for me. Maybe there's some, if you're a carpenter, but I don't naturally have an emotion with kitchen tools or things that I think even more sophisticated tools like calculators and pulleys, I still don't have an emotional response to them. But every piece of software I have an emotional response to. I either feel confused or empowered. I feel like my world's gotten bigger or my world's gotten smaller. They all have an emotional component. And I think once you realize and accept that, then you can say, oh, there is an emotional component to what we're doing with this product. I could just leave that to chance, which is what most people do, or I could try to be conscious of it and we could try to bring that into our conception of what the product's about and try to be purposeful in the emotion we're trying to elicit from the user. And I think that's where design and particularly visual design can have a huge impact.\n\n(00:57:58):\nSo again, in many conversations that I'd have in design reviews, some executive would go, \"I don't know, ultimately this just kind of comes down to a matter of opinion.\" And I was always like, \"no, it does not. Whether we choose blue or red is going to elicit a certain emotional response from the user. What is it we want them to feel? And then let's make sure that we design something visually that evokes that emotion.\"\n\n(00:58:21):\nSo again, I think once you really get your head around the fact that there are people on the other side of the glass, real live human beings having emotional moments with the thing that you're putting in their hand and that they're focusing their attention on. You are in those moments. And are you going to own it and show up and be the person you want to be in those moments or not?\n\n(00:58:44):\nA few months ago, I guess a little longer ago, I was talking to the team at Toast who makes the handheld point of sale stuff that they use in restaurants. And the thing I was trying to tell them, is whether or not you see it, tonight, you're going to be at dinner with a few 100 000 people all across the country. And if we take just one example, you're going to be at a very nice diner with a grandmother and her two teenage sons in Ohio, and the check's going to come and the waiter, the waitress is going to hand over the device to that grandmother, because she wants to pick up the bill. And you have the opportunity to either make her look like a superhero, because she knows what she's doing, or to make her look like a fool and one of her teenage grandsons is going to grab the device and do it for her.\n\n(00:59:24):\nYou're at the dinner table, what are you going to do for grandma? You going to show up as well as you can, or are you going to just let this whole thing fall apart, because you didn't think hard enough about grandma? And that's true for Toast, that's true for every product any of us are working on all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:40):\nThis is so interesting and fascinating and inspiring. I was going to ask how you use this insight, that software is kind of the most powerful medium media more than even than TV and movies, and you shared it, which I think is really important. So just to kind of double-down on this, is the advice here is think about the emotion you want the user of your software to have as you're starting the design process, not just what do you want them to do, how fast do you want them to get to this flow, it's what's the emotion you want them to have?\n\nBob Baxley (01:00:09):\nYeah. I often don't think about what I want them to do. I just think that's sort of a selfish way to think about it. They have something they want to do. I'm trying to help them. I just don't ever approach these things of the user's something for me to exploit and take advantage of and manipulate. I know there's people that do approach it that way, which I think is a little unfortunate. But as a designer, I guess I have my own set of values and my own kind of compass on these things that's pushed me in a certain way of thinking about it. And so I'm kind of constantly asking what's the right thing for the user?\n\n(01:00:44):\nAnd I believe in my heart that if we prioritize that wonderful things will happen for all the metrics, including the money metrics that matter. I've never seen a product be successful that used metrics as a driver for what they were doing. I've seen a lot of companies be really successfully seeing metrics as a consequence and a way to evaluate the quality of their decisions, and then using those to triangulate and make better decisions moving forward. So they're kind of a very useful feedback mechanism. But I think there's definitely a risk to confusing, doing something because it's a driver versus something as a consequence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):\nThere's a few more questions I would ask, but I want to come back to something that I asked earlier, that I think is on the minds of a lot of say founders and product managers listening to this. I'm just like, okay, this all is sounds really great. I would love to make these experiences so great. It's going to take us a lot of time to do this really, really well. You said that it doesn't have to. What's a tactical tip or two that you can suggest to a founder or product manager to help them contain the design process while also achieving these outcomes that you're describing?\n\nBob Baxley (01:01:53):\nWell, I think if you can give... Maybe one way to think about it is like a big giant AI prompt. The more context you can give it, the more specificity you can give it, the more this is what I'm about and what we're trying to get to, the more the designer's going to be able to figure out which swim lane they're supposed to be in to produce something.\n\n(01:02:10):\nSo I think if you're going into it feeling like the design process is going to take a lot of time, it's because you haven't been clear in your creative brief, so to speak, which often means you're not really clear in your own head. And I think... I have worked with a lot of founders, and we could identify a bunch of big companies, who I think got started that weren't clear in their own head. I don't want to... Yahoo was an amazing company, but if we just look at Yahoo for a second, I worked there, it was never clear to me what the founding vision of Yahoo was.\n\n(01:02:39):\nAnd I talk a lot about vision statements and we could say the vision statement of Google is organizing all the world's information. That's a great vision. They'll never achieve that. That's something that's always over the horizon. And it's been a very useful organizing principle for their acquisitions and how the company grows.\n\n(01:02:55):\nAmazon to be the Earth's most customer-centric company. Okay, great. That's a vision, they will never get there. It tells you how they're going to expand. Apple doesn't have an explicit vision, but I might describe it as personal computing can have a transformative effect on the lives of individuals. And I think that kind of focuses a lot of what they're trying to do.\n\n(01:03:14):\nDisneyland, still the best vision statement of all time, which is the happiest place on earth. So once you tell an employee this is supposed to be the happiest place on earth, then you're signaling all sorts of things about how they need to pick up the trash and how they need to show up on time and how they need to wear their uniform. You're just signaling a whole bunch of stuff.\n\n(01:03:33):\nSo when I talked to founders, a lot of times they just don't have that clarity of what's the vision of the company. And to go back to Yahoo for a second, I never heard of vision. And so I'm not really sure what they were ever about. They kind of stumbled into the directory and then they added a bunch of stuff around the edges, but it never seemed to make a lot of sense. And so I think people operating inside Yahoo, it ended up being inefficient, because they were having to deal with all that ambiguity.\n\n(01:03:54):\nSo I think that that can also be a pretty big risk for founders. They end up caught up with a product idea, and they think that the company is the product, the company is not the product. The product is the product and the company's bigger than the product. And you need to have some vision that speaks beyond just this particular thing.\n\n(01:04:12):\nI think Slack, honestly, both Slack and Pinterest I think are examples of products that became companies, but neither one of those places really knew what to do next, because they didn't have a bigger vision of the change they were trying to see in the world. So back to you, you were asking a very pragmatic question. I think you need to work on your prompt before you go to your designers and try to give them as much clarity about what you want to produce as possible. And I think if you leave it open as to the emotional response you want users to have, you're inviting a lot of ambiguity, which is going to invite a lot of inefficiency.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:49):\nI love that answer. And it's so interesting that AI can help us work better together as humans, because when you find that the AI is not achieving the outcome you want as effectively as you want, that's a lesson. This also translates the working with humans, make the prompt more specific, add more context in life, not just when you're talking to AI.\n\nBob Baxley (01:05:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:13):\nI love that. That's so interesting. So the advice here is, if you're finding design is taking too long or you want to just level up your success with your design team, give more context, spend more time on the brief, on what you're actually trying to achieve. And make sure there's a clear vision or mission that everyone can row towards.\n\nBob Baxley (01:05:32):\nYeah. Look, design is a problem solving methodology. So the more variables you can remove before they go into the process, the more efficient it's going to be. And if you give designers a lot of ambiguity, they're going to spend a lot of time spinning around, and honestly, that's your fault as the client.\n\n(01:05:48):\nAs a design leader, I think one of my main challenges is frankly trying to make the PMs better clients, helping them get more specific. It's very common for a design team to get extremely ambiguous asks from a product team. And the problem for designers, they have to take all that ambiguity and they've got to wring it all out. So when they give it to engineering, engineering knows exactly what to code, because computers don't tolerate ambiguity. Engineers need to know what the thing's going to be. And so design gets stuck with a really ambiguous input, but they have to have a highly specific output and then often timeboxed to do that. And it's just not a recipe for success.\n\n(01:06:26):\nSo you're much better off either kind of compressing the PRD experience and bringing the designers into that, kind of co-creating with product and design really rapidly. But you need to... You could think of it in some ways as designers are going to draw the storyboards, and if you don't give them a great script, they're going to have a very hard time. And then you can't give the shooting crew ambiguous storyboards or you're just going to waste untold amounts of money on set.\n\n(01:06:51):\nSo if you think about those three steps from script to storyboard to production, it's all about getting rid of ambiguity. And so the more ambiguity that can be removed upstream, the faster design's going to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:03):\nThis begs the question then, you don't want to give designers here exactly. Here's the thing we're designing, make it really great and pretty. There's always this balance of just give designers space to think and be creative and explore. Advice there of just how to navigate that.\n\nBob Baxley (01:07:20):\nWell, if you go back to my example of the script and storyboard, scripts don't contain pictures, there's still a lot of opportunity to think differently and to come up with original things and to have a lot of creative input in the storyboarding process. So the script is living mostly in words, which is largely how PMs function.\n\n(01:07:39):\nThe thing that I will say, to keep in mind for PMs, there's always a tendency on PMs to want to draw something and then try to give a sketch to a designer. And I would caution them against that. Sometimes they have to draw themselves so they can think it out. But if a PM came to me with something that was drawn and kind of fully baked, my response was like, thanks for giving me that. Now I know exactly what we're not going to do. Because as a point of pride, there's no way I'm going to go execute that exact thing.\n\n(01:08:09):\nSo you're right, PMs have to give you the space to operate. And I think a lot of what they're trying to achieve could be done in more informal ways, conversationally and whiteboards, things like that. But yet you need to narrow the problem for the designers, they need constraints. They don't need a tiny little box, but they need constraints. Think in terms of, you don't give them an airport tarmac and you don't even give them a football field. You give them something more like a basketball court, a sort of scale at which they can do their design thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:45):\nI want to talk about basketball later, but not yet. You've shared a lot of counterintuitive lessons on building product, designing, building teams, leadership. Is there another very counterintuitive lesson you've learned about building products, hiring leading teams that goes against common startup wisdom?\n\nBob Baxley (01:09:04):\nThe thing I would say is that you should wait as long as possible to draw a picture. I think that pushes against all the gen AI tools that help you create prototypes. And there's obviously a lot of excitement around that. I can just give a prompt and the AI, they're going to crank out of UI for me.\n\n(01:09:21):\nSo I don't think I'm using the term right, but I had this idea from art that I call the primal mark, and that's the first mark that you make on the canvas. And once you make that mark on the canvas, everything you do after that is in response to that mark. It sort of sets your baseline. And so for me, I always felt that as soon as we drew a picture that looked even remotely real, everybody gravitated towards that and said, oh, that's the thing. And people were so uncomfortable with ambiguity that they can't really deal with the tension of, well, that might not be the thing.\n\n(01:09:53):\nAnd so as soon as you draw a picture that looks even slightly realistic, much less something that comes out of one of these gen AI tools, everybody kind of goes, oh, that's the thing. You just keep doubling down on that thing. And what's happened is you've taken the possibilities from this big broad thing down to this tiny little thing from an AI system that's trained on existing solutions and existing ideas and is maybe not even thinking about it the right way, because all you've really given it is your first-order of thinking.\n\n(01:10:22):\nI think there's a way you can stay in these things conceptually and conversationally, where you can get to your second, third, fourth idea. And that's where stuff gets really interesting. And again, I don't think that has to take a lot of time. That can be over the course of a single meeting, you could get to a second, third, fourth idea. You just have to be willing to not jump at the first thing that looks like a possibility. You get that possibility, you go, okay, well that's interesting, let's table that. What else have we got?\n\n(01:10:47):\nThere's one story that kind of related that's useful. In one of my previous jobs, I was responsible for the public website. I remember coming across one of the product managers one day and she's like, \"Hey, this link on the home page, we have to make it blue.\" I was like, \"Well, we don't use blue links anywhere.\" And she said, \"Yeah, yeah, but we just have to make it blue.\" I was like, \"Well, we're not making it blue.\" And a couple of days go by and I saw the home page and the link had been made blue, because she had got around me and she'd gone to engineering and just made it blue.\n\n(01:11:11):\nAnd I saw her in the hallway again. I was like, \"What the hell's up with that?\" And she goes, \"Well, people couldn't see it.\" And I'm like, \"Oh, they couldn't see it, so it wasn't prominent enough, right?\" She's like, \"Yeah, it wasn't prominent enough.\" I'm like, \"Well, great. There's a 100 different things we could do to make it more prominent, one of which is making it blue, which is the thing that came to you first because you're not a designer, it's naturally... Because it's the most obvious thing, but it actually doesn't fit in with these larger things we're trying to do.\"\n\n(01:11:36):\nSo I've often... I try to encourage the product managers to what's the problem with the thing? And then let us solve it. Don't jump to it and tell us... Don't tell us this is just exactly what we're supposed to do. And again, I do the same thing on the roadmap. You decide the roadmap, tell us what we're supposed to do, I will ask you about it, and I may push back and we may have some back and forth, but that's your responsibility. I'm going to trust that you are trained and you know what you're doing and you're going to make the right call. And I just want you to give me the same level of respect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:06):\nThis advice about not drawing quickly and not making that primal mark, which I love that term, is, I'm curious your take on AI prototyping tools these days. Because that's the extreme version of that. Not only are you just creating a sketch, it's like, oh, it's working, here it is. Here's what it looks like. Thoughts on that, do you discourage people from doing that, PMs especially?\n\nBob Baxley (01:12:27):\nWell, I think it's a production tool. Once you know what you want and you can give it a really robust prompt, then... I haven't played with it a lot myself, because I'm not in an operational role right now, but presumably it's really useful at cranking out that actionable prototype which you can click and experience.\n\n(01:12:43):\nAnd I've said for a long time that an interactive idea needs to be expressed interactively, so we're not talking with our hands and we can really understand what's going to happen. So when the idea is ready to be expressed, I think those tools are probably fantastic. But ideas start off pretty fragile, and the best ideas start off really fragile. And I think when you push them to develop too quickly and you put them out in the world and expect them to be able to stand up to critique too early, you're just going to squash them.\n\n(01:13:10):\nI often think about them like the little plant in the Pixar movie, Wall-E, you've got to give that little guy a little space, a little time, some water and some nourishment, and you can't really just suddenly put him out in the wind and think he's going to make it. And so I think a lot of... There's a lot of very fragile, interesting, quiet ideas that I think you need to give some space. And when you jump to the expression of them, I think you're putting them at risk.\n\n(01:13:33):\nI'll also say that, everybody, when they look at a prototype, what they're focusing on is the visual and textual expression. And so as soon as you produce something in high resolution the feedback you're going to get is going to be about colors and shapes and these presentation layer things, which are very loosely related to usability and value. It's like focusing on the special effects of a movie that has a really bad story.\n\n(01:13:59):\nAnd so at ThoughtSpot, we used to use what we call block brain diagrams, which were even simplified versions of wire frames. It was just big chunky blocks of here's how the screen could be and where things might be located. And because it was so low fidelity, people couldn't get into commenting on what it looked like. We had to talk about conceptually what it was. And so we were trying to build up this firm foundation where we could go from the block frames to wire frames to kind of the final expression.\n\n(01:14:24):\nAnd I think it helped us clarify what we were trying to do conceptually so that by the time we got to the final visual presentation, that stuff was actually really simple. And initially it made the product team really nervous because we would be sitting in these block frames and wire frames for sometimes weeks, and they'd be like, when are we finally going to see the comps?\n\n(01:14:42):\nAnd then what would happen, is because we had such a robust design system, once we locked down on the block frames, we could send it to an agency and they could do the full high-res comps in a day, because they knew exactly what they were doing. And so the PMs were always like, what the hell happened overnight? You're like, well, it turns out that the high-res stuff, that's not the hard thing. The hard thing is the heavy lifting of thinking, what are we really trying to do? That's the hard part.\n\n(01:15:06):\nAnd if you do the high-res stuff, you really muddy the waters. And I think you end up spending a lot more time churning, if you didn't... Again, I'm going to go back to the movie metaphor, because I studied film. If you're trying to fix script issues when you're in production or storyboarding, you're going to churn and you're going to waste a lot of effort. So you've got to figure out what you're trying to do before you go draw the high-res stuff. And I think a lot of the gen AI tools, it's this seductive thing of, hey, let's just go, let's go make the comp and see what we think. I don't really know if you're going to get anything great out of that process, maybe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:42):\nThat's a really interesting counter-narrative because it feels like every team now is just straight to prototypes. I just had the C... She's one of the CPOs at Microsoft. I realize there's many CPOs, and she has this concept of demos before memos and just prompt sets or any PRDs, you should just be prototyping all your ideas. And so it's interesting to hear the perspective of maybe it's actually hurting your ability to come up with a really clever solution versus the obvious solution.\n\nBob Baxley (01:16:10):\nYeah. Look, I think at some point, hopefully people just back up and ask themselves, are we actually producing better product because of this process? And we're going faster, but faster can't be the ultimate goal. You need to be creating something great as well, right? Something that's sustainable and frankly that you're proud of and your users find value in. And if you're just throwing so much spaghetti at the wall, I don't know if having a spaghetti throwing machine that goes faster is...\n\n(01:16:35):\nLook, there's a counter argument that's... You can say, oh, it's like Darwinian evolution, and we're just going to spin through a bunch of random mutations and see what happens. And I used to joke that it's true, that if you take a bunch of hydrogen atoms and give them 14 billion years, you could end up with a tiger, but you don't know you're going to get a tiger and you could get a six headed shrimp instead, and you don't really know when it's going to shift. So I'm not exactly sure Darwinian evolution is the way we create great product, but a lot of companies are making a run at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:02):\nI want to take us to a recurring segment on the podcast called AI Corner. And in AI Corner, I ask guests to share what's one way that you've learned or figured out to use AI in your job to help you do better work, to help you do faster work?\n\nBob Baxley (01:17:17):\nWell, my job right now is trying to figure out what my job is. And so the thing I've been using AI for is I've very explicitly been using it as a life coach. And so I had seen a couple of prompts about asking it what a blind spot was or what my strengths and weaknesses were. I'd seen some prompts about that stuff.\n\n(01:17:34):\nAnd one of them was really fantastic. One of them was, what's an outdated mindset that I'm holding onto that's not still serving me? And it came back with a very polite prompt or very polite response about, well, given your age and your profession, it's not surprising that you're very wedded to the idea of control, but that's not really the world we're living in anymore. And that's not probably going to suit the thing you're trying to do next, which is writing and publishing and speaking and stuff. And although it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase, which I view...\n\nBob Baxley (01:18:00):\nAlthough it's statistically derived, it did come back with a really nice phrase which I've used in your show, which was, try to focus on choreography over control.\n\n(01:18:08):\nAnd so I thought that was really useful. I asked for some of my blind spots, that was also useful. I use it for a lot of exercise input, that's useful. And the exercise that I've gone through most recently was I realized that it was inferring these things about me from the things that I had asked it to help me with in the past.\n\n(01:18:26):\nSo instead, I just switched. I just went to ChatGPT, start a new project and said, I want you to be my life coach. I want you to ask me five questions a day for the next five days. Let's go through those so you can explicitly become better at helping me with this task.\n\n(01:18:40):\nAnd so we've just gone through that process and it's been really useful for me. It's no substitute for a therapist or a real coach or anything like that. It's not a human being. It doesn't care about me. I'm not saying that you should use it instead of these other options. You need a human being as well. But it's been very good at reflecting back to me things that I think have been floating around in my undermind.\n\n(01:19:03):\nSo there's a wonderful book called Hair Brain Tortoise Mind by a gentleman named Guy Claxton. In that, he talks about the undermind. And sometimes you might've heard this as your unconscious or something like that. But I think of your undermind as the part of your brain that's processing information before it gets to language. And then when you go to consciousness, you've turned it into language.\n\n(01:19:25):\nAnd language isn't the full universe of things you can think, language is what you can think in English. And if you talk to multilingual speakers, they'll tell you that they can think things in other languages than what they can think in English.\n\n(01:19:35):\nSo if you only speak English, you're only in one vein of what you could think, but your undermind is operating through all this other stuff. And for the computer nerds out there, you could think about it as a compiled code versus interpreted code.\n\n(01:19:46):\nSo your undermind work in a compiled code and it could do a lot of stuff that you can't really do in the interpreted code which moves slower and has different orientations and we call that consciousness.\n\n(01:19:56):\nSo I was feeding ChatGPT all this stuff over the last year or so, and there are all these patterns in my undermind that had been going into that I wasn't able to express with conscious language.\n\n(01:20:08):\nAnd so when I started asking it questions, I think what it was doing was it was statistically reflecting patterns back to me that already existed in my undermind, but because it was putting them into language, my conscious mind could now recognize them and respond to them.\n\n(01:20:21):\nAnd so again, as a life coach, I found it very useful as a mirror back to things that I was probably already thinking. And it helped me clarify my thoughts. It's not pushing me in new directions that a human might do, but it's still been super useful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:38):\nThat is extremely cool. That is a really cool use case. I don't know if you've heard the Jerry Colona episode that I did recently. Okay, we'll link to it. He's got four questions that he suggests people ask themselves.\n\n(01:20:50):\nThe first is the title of the actual episode, how are you complicit in creating the conditions you say you don't want? And this often leads to a lot of interesting insights about yourself, and there's an important part of it, complicit being like you're not responsible, but you're actually helping achieve a thing.\n\nBob Baxley (01:21:07):\nIt's a powerful word. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:09):\nAnd then also it's an important element of say you don't want, you say you don't want to be busy, but something you just keep creating busyness for yourself, maybe you do want this. So anyway, we'll link to that episode. There's a lot of good stuff there.\n\nBob Baxley (01:21:21):\nYeah, that's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:23):\nOkay, one final question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. This is one that I don't think you have any idea I'm going to ask you about. And so I'm curious where this goes.\n\n(01:21:32):\nThis is a story that Joff Redfern suggested. I ask you. He told me that you're obsessed with space. You love researching space, telling stories about space. There's a story that you share about this guy named John Hobolt. Does that ring a bell?\n\nBob Baxley (01:21:49):\nOh yeah, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:50):\nOkay. Share that story because I think there's something really powerful here for people building products.\n\nBob Baxley (01:21:55):\nSo I should clarify, I am a fan of astronomy and space, but I'm a particular fan of the Apollo program because I view the Apollo program and the moon landings as the greatest peacetime accomplishment of mankind ever.\n\n(01:22:06):\nAnd I think it's an incredible... There's a profound number of leadership lessons and individual lessons to be learned from that program. And I've done multiple talks about this. I could go on for hours.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:20):\nLet's do it. Here we go.\n\nBob Baxley (01:22:22):\nThe particular question you're asking is John Hobolt. So, John was, I can't remember exactly where he was at the NASA hierarchy, but he was one of the people that was tasked with figuring out the question of how do you go to the moon?\n\n(01:22:34):\nSo just to take yourself back in history a little bit, John Kennedy, president Kennedy goes to Rice University, I believe it's 19 September or May 1962, he gives the famous moon speech, we choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it is hard, that whole thing, which I also have to say, and maybe a link to this in the show notes as well, everyone should go watch that talk. That is the perfect Ted talk.\n\n(01:22:54):\nIt clocks in right at 18 minutes. It shows you how to sell a big, giant, bold vision. The specifics that Kennedy gets into the way he sets context at the beginning, the technical problems are going to happen, how much money it's going to cost, the way he puts the passion, why we're going to go to the moon, the whole thing.\n\n(01:23:09):\nIt is an incredible talk. It's the only moonshot talk ever because a moonshot has to actually go to the moon. And so it is an incredible talk. So go watch the talk. But he steps off the stage and people at NASA are like, we've only recently put Alan Shepard into space.\n\n(01:23:27):\nAnd he just went up and went down. That was almost like it was a blue origins type thing that was just up and down. We didn't even do a lap around the earth like the Russians did with Yuri Gagarin. And now we're talking about going to the moon. Nobody knows how to go to the moon.\n\n(01:23:40):\nAnd there was three different options for going to the moon, one at the time, one was to build a big giant rocket and just go straight to the moon. It's called direct ascend. And the main advocate for that was Warner von Braun, who was the main rocket guy in the world. A little bit of a complicated past.\n\n(01:23:53):\nBut nevertheless, Warner von Braun's a big guy. He is, got the president's ear. He's like, let's build a big giant rocket, go to the moon. People are like, yeah, the problem is when you get to the moon, the rocket's still super big. So these guys are going to have to descend a big ladder. That's a problem. So that was one idea.\n\n(01:24:07):\nThere was another called Earth Orbit Rendezvous where you spend two spacecraft into Earth and then you link them up in Earth orbit and then one of them goes off to the moon, but you still got to land that thing on the moon.\n\n(01:24:18):\nAnd then there's a third idea called Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, which is where you build a spacecraft that includes a smaller spacecraft. So you send up two spacecraft together, one of them's smaller, much lighter, and you use that just as the ship that goes down to the moon's surface and back up.\n\n(01:24:31):\nAnd that spacecraft is truly a spacecraft. It only flies in space, which means the engineering requirements around it are profoundly different because it doesn't have to survive re-entry into the earth. And so as a result, it can be much lighter.\n\n(01:24:45):\nAnd it turns out that the whole problem of landing on the moon is it's a weight problem. You got to lift all the stuff off the earth, which is incredibly expensive for fuel. You got to land it on. There's just a lot goes on. And so Hubert had come across this paper from a gentleman named Yuri Kondrachev who was living in Ukraine in the 1916, 1918 when he wrote this paper.\n\n(01:25:05):\nAnd he was the first guy to theorize Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. And I try to take people back to that. You and I can think about going to the moon, but Yuri Kondrachev in 1918 is on the plains of Ukraine looking at the moon, and he's actually thinking about how to really go to the moon.\n\n(01:25:23):\nHe's figuring it out. And so he writes this paper, John discovers it years later, and John's trying to sell Lunar Orbit Rendezvous. It's not going over at NASA. And so eventually he decides to go around all the hierarchy and he sends a very famous memo to one of the top guys at NASA.\n\n(01:25:39):\nThe memo starts somewhat as a voice in the wilderness and then it goes on. And then there's points in there where he's really emphatic, do we want to go to the moon or not? And then he goes through all the math of how going to the moon is all about weight and this was the only way to do it, and there was no other option, stuff like that.\n\n(01:25:54):\nHe just made the case and he risked his whole career. The whole thing could have blown up. He could have been fired for going around the hierarchy and all that sort of stuff, but of course, he's able to champion the idea.\n\n(01:26:04):\nAnd I think it was another year or so after that famous memo, which you could read online, it's nine pages long or something. After the memo, it was still some time before they adopted Lunar Orbit Rendezvous, but eventually they do. And even with Don brought himself was very complimentary to ALT for pushing that perspective.\n\n(01:26:21):\nSo I tell the story, one, because it's just amazing story and it does force you to go back to the moment of like, wait, they didn't actually know how to do it. We only know how to do it now because they've done it. But there's that moment of uncertainty and I think you have to embrace and be amazed at that.\n\n(01:26:41):\nAnd it also shows you the power of these ideas. A really great idea somehow finds a way to live on somehow it just sits out there and it just waits for its time. And Yuri had brought this idea into the world and it just sat around and then somebody it and dusted it off and was able to push for it and it came through.\n\n(01:26:58):\nThen maybe the third lesson is ideas need champions. They need champions willing to put themselves on the line for them. If you believe in something and you've made your case and you can really make your case, have the courage of your convictions and get behind it and fight as hard as you can for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:15):\nSuch a great story. I love that you summarize the takeaways too, by the way. So to me, the takeaways and the lessons here is one is coming back to your Pinterest board in the office, say the hard thing.\n\n(01:27:28):\nTwo is be patient. It may take a little bit of time for a radical idea, especially to resonate and stick and get adoption. So if you're pitching a big new product idea, don't assume that they'll immediately agree. Also, just this idea of if you really believe in it, do go and champion it. There needs to be someone passionately arguing for this.\n\nBob Baxley (01:27:49):\nYeah, I'll just add to that one thing. I think people need to understand that they're advocating for ideas and not for themselves. And when I talk to a lot of designers that may be true for PMS, I hear a lot of people say that they're reluctant to post on social media or on LinkedIn or something because like, \"Well, I don't want to be self-promoting.\"\n\n(01:28:06):\nAnd I try to counsel them like, look, it's not about self-promotion. There are ideas that you care about that you want to see succeed in the world. And so get out there as an advocate of the idea. It's not about you, it's about the idea. And don't be afraid to stand behind the idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):\nWe've spread a lot of good ideas in this conversation, Bob. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nBob Baxley (01:28:33):\nYeah, let's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:34):\nWe added a ding to this. I like that drama you added and there's a whole thing now. Okay, first question, what are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nBob Baxley (01:28:44):\nSo the three books I'm going to recommend, the first one's a beautiful poetic book about typography called The Elements of Typographic Style by Robert Bringhurst. Robert was the poet laureate of Canada. And the first 80 pages will change how you think about typography.\n\n(01:28:59):\nIt will open you up to the wonderful world of typography that we all live in. You'll think differently about every sign you look at, about every movie credit you see, and it will give you an insight into the designer mindset. When you understand typography, I think you understand where designers come from and the best designers I know are just total type nerds. So highly recommend Elements of Typographic Style.\n\n(01:29:23):\nSecond book, Zen and the Motorcycle Maintenance. Many people may know ultimately a philosophy book, but it's about the concept of quality, which I think is a very important topic. So it talks about quality and the importance of how things integrate into cohesive whole, which I believe is the main challenge facing most software teams. They create something that's highly fragmented instead of a single hole. So, Zen in the Motorcycle Maintenance.\n\n(01:29:46):\nAnd then the last one is a book called Time in the Art of Living by Robert Gruden. It's just a very interesting collection of impressionistic views of time and how time passes and what time means. So that's very different from the others and it's not something probably gets recommended on your show too often, but I think it'll help people in their lives in a powerful way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:10):\nI think these are all brand new entries in this question. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nBob Baxley (01:30:19):\nSo I really enjoyed Severance. I enjoyed it as a filmmaker. I was just blown away at the filmmaking. I was intrigued with the story and the characters. And I think as someone who's worked in corporate America, when you understand that it's basically critique and commentary about the modern workplace.\n\n(01:30:35):\nThere were times that I just thought were unbelievably funny and insightful. It was definitely interesting watching it with my wife who was an attorney and hasn't worked in those kinds of environments. So it was like an episode where some people got disappeared and the language that we're using was all around the language you would hear around a layoff.\n\n(01:30:50):\nAnd so I was laughing myself to death, but she was like, \"What? What's going on?\" So that's super fascinating and then I'll throw one other in there, which is not something I've recently seen, but something I highly recommend for everybody, which is Lords of Arabia. The Lords of Arabia is I think one of the two or three best expressions of the medium of film.\n\n(01:31:11):\nAnd so when you think about the ability to hold moving pictures, characters, story, music, photography, set design, costume, the whole constellation of variables that come to play into a movie, I think Lords of Arabia is probably one of the two or three most complete expressions of what the medium is capable of.\n\n(01:31:30):\nAnd I think it's useful to think about in technology, all the different elements of a product and all the different elements of a user interface and how you can break those down the way you can break down all these elements of a movie and how many pieces of software do we use where somebody is actually conducting that symphony in a really coherent, powerful, full on way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:52):\nI love that movie. Next question, do you have a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really love?\n\nBob Baxley (01:31:58):\nYou're focused on recent and I'm just going to push back. No, there's nothing terribly recent. The stuff that I go back to, I'll give you a couple of nerdy ones. I have a Leica M6 cam, which is a film camera, and I recently started shooting with film again, which I absolutely love because it forces me to slow down.\n\n(01:32:14):\nI always talk about Leica cameras, they're obscenely expensive, but the thing about Leica cameras is you show up different when you shoot with a Leica. So when people think about cameras, they think about the quality of the image, they don't think about how the tool is going to change them.\n\n(01:32:28):\nWhen you show up with an iPhone, you're thinking about sharing. When you show up with a film camera, you're thinking about saving film and you're spending more time composing and thinking exactly about the shot. When you show up with a digital SLR, you just take a whole bunch of pictures and hope something's going to turn out.\n\n(01:32:42):\nAnd so I think these cameras are very useful metaphor for being conscious about how the tools you pick are going to impact the thing that you produce. So once you go into Figma, you've made a decision about the thing you're going to produce. If you stay in a sketchbook, you've made a different decision. If you go into something else, you've made a different kind of decision.\n\n(01:33:03):\nSo I say the Leica M6 with film because of that. And then the software product I would point out, which is not terribly new, but I think it's worth noting, is a tool called Habitica. And Habitica is really fascinating. Ultimately, it's a habit tracker and task management app, but it's fundamentally a game.\n\n(01:33:21):\nIt's a role playing game where you create a character and your character revolves and can buy armor and go on quests and things as you check off your habits and stuff. And it is the most interesting expression of shifting conceptual models that I've ever seen.\n\n(01:33:35):\nSo if you think about a conceptual model, it's sort of the software equivalent of a genre in a movie. And so once you say it's a project management software, you're in a certain genre. If you say it's a productivity tool, you're in a certain genre. So if it's social media, you're in a certain genre. So these are different genres.\n\n(01:33:50):\nAnd Habitica is really interesting because it mixes genres, it mixes role playing game with to do manager. And so I think it's a really powerful example of how you can really shift the user's thinking in the same way movies for example. Star Wars is ultimately a cowboy movie set in space.\n\n(01:34:07):\nAnd when you come to those two genre mashups are really interesting. When you come to a rom-com, you have a certain expectation of what's going to happen to a rom-com. If somebody suddenly got shot in a rom-com, that would not make sense to you in the same way that if somebody made a really funny joke in a John Wick movie, it wouldn't make sense.\n\n(01:34:23):\nSo I think Habitica is just the most interesting example I've ever found is somebody really doing a fascinating mashup of conceptual models, which is... Sorry, I'll stop. It's an unexplored and unexploited possibility of software ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):\nI love how profound this lightning round already is. The point about Leica changing the way you even think about the photo is so interesting, I've never thought of it that way. You mentioned Star Wars. Have you seen Andor by the way?\n\nBob Baxley (01:34:50):\nNo, but my wife, everybody's raving about it. I've been watching basketball, so I just haven't had the spare time yet. But okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:57):\nI have a basketball question, but first of all, before we get to that, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to find useful and work in life?\n\nBob Baxley (01:35:04):\nYeah, so there's three quotes that I come back to all the time that I repeat in most of my talks. First one I've already used, which is, design is clear thinking made visible, by Edward Tufte.\n\n(01:35:14):\nSecond one is from the American landscape photographer, Ansel Adams. And I've also alluded to this and the quote is, there's nothing worse than a brilliant image of a fuzzy concept. And then the last one is an African proverb and it goes like this, if you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\n\n(01:35:31):\nAnd I think we've touched on all three of those things today when we've talked about the resolution of comps, we've talked about using gen AI to try to go faster, things like that. And those two ideas collide in interesting way.\n\n(01:35:44):\nPeople think if they cut their colleagues out of the pie, they can go faster. And it's true, they can go faster. You just can't go very far. You need a group if you want to go far. And just because you can create a brilliant image doesn't mean you got a good concept.\n\n(01:35:58):\nGo look on Instagram, you'll find plenty of photographs that tingle your senses from a visual perspective and you will forget them by the time you close the app because they don't mean anything. And so we live in a time when it's very easy to produce things at incredibly high production values, but they don't mean anything. And so they're just like fancy potato chips. There's no nourishment there, man.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:21):\nI love that this connects back to the vibe coding apps and prototypes that people build, but you can do it really quickly, but it won't go too far, potentially, not to hit on those tools. They're amazing.\n\nBob Baxley (01:36:34):\nThey are. All this AI stuff is profoundly amazing and I will encourage people, one of the most amazing things for me about this moment in AI is that this, the kind of AI we're experiencing has been theorized for well over 50 years.\n\n(01:36:46):\nSo there is a vast warehouse of interesting, amazing thoughts from philosophers and engineers and social scientists and people thinking about what is this moment going to mean when we have this sort of artificial intelligence that challenges our conception of what it means to be human.\n\n(01:37:02):\nSo there's so much stuff you could be reading to help you process this moment in the very intense and profound psychological challenges it's bringing forth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:13):\nIt definitely feels like we're finally living in the future. The future's actually happening. It's going to be robots walking around soon. We get self-driving cars all over San Francisco and it's really stark.\n\nBob Baxley (01:37:22):\nIt's a future. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:23):\nIt's a future. Well, that's my concern with a lot of the fiction of the future is most of it is dystopian and here's all the problems that we're going to run into, which is going to be useful. Here's the robot laws that we got to be thinking about.\n\nBob Baxley (01:37:37):\nJust to go back to this idea of how once you create an expression of something, people baseline off of it. I recently got to hear Henry Modisett who's head of design at Perplexity, give a talk. And one of the things he said that just really struck me was that people's conception of AI was founded, was put out there by Hollywood years ago.\n\n(01:37:56):\nSo this idea that AI is going to take stuff over and is ultimately really dystopian and malevolent towards humans and stuff like that, it's actually something that's created by Hollywood and now we're trying to outlive how and stuff like that.\n\n(01:38:11):\nAnd so it's just such a great example of somebody put the concept out there and planted that seed in people's heads and now we're struggling to get people off that baseline and to look at it with fresh eyes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:24):\nThat's a really good point. It's much more entertaining to watch AI try to kill us all, not just, oh, everything's amazing. Great job, AI.\n\n(01:38:34):\nOkay, final question. I know you're a huge sports fan. In particular, you're a big Warriors fan. So let me just ask you this. Say you were running the Warriors, the owner of the Golden State Warriors, what would you change? What would you change to help them win?\n\nBob Baxley (01:38:49):\nA real team can't be dependent on a single player. And I think there's such a dramatic difference in the Warriors when Steph is on the court and off the court. If you listen to the local announcers, they're always like, \"These non-Steph minutes really matter.\"\n\n(01:39:05):\nI look at that, I'm like, that's not really a team then, right? That's Steph in the band of Merriman. And the Warriors are bigger than that and most of these basketball teams are bigger than that currently. I think across a lot of places in the NBA, there's a single player that can go down that makes a difference in the organization's success and that just seems dangerous and not a team.\n\n(01:39:28):\nSo I don't know what to say. I don't know how you replace Steph Curry. He is a singular, if you even call him a generational player, it's a bit bigger than that. He is unequivocally the greatest shooter in the history of the game and he's one of only two or three players has actually fundamentally changed how the game's played.\n\n(01:39:45):\nBut I just know for winning, the Warriors are at risk because Steph is meaningfully old for an NBA player and you can't have the whole franchise built around just him.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:58):\nI love this hot take. A great way to end it, Bob. I can listen to you all day. This is so fun and interesting in so many ways on so many levels. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe learn more about what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBob Baxley (01:40:14):\nSo, Bobbaxley.com is the easiest place right now. It's just a bento site, but I'll get some more stuff up there in the coming days, hopefully before this episode goes out. We'll see.\n\n(01:40:21):\nBut there's plenty of links there that'll help you connect to me on LinkedIn and some of my talks and a few Links to some other things that I find useful. Just find me on LinkedIn. I publish pretty much every day on LinkedIn, so that's an easy way to find me.\n\n(01:40:34):\nI'm happy to be connected to whoever is interested in being connected. And then in terms of how you can help me, I'll go back to what I said earlier. It's not really about me, Lenny, it's about these ideas. It's about the idea that software matters, that we're making something for people on the other side of the glass and that it's a way that we show that we care and that we should care.\n\n(01:40:52):\nSo it's not about me, it's about us together trying to create a digital world that we want to live in. The digital world right now, it's not something we really want to live in. It's not a place any of us would turn our kids loose in. You and I talked about this earlier. The digital world's not safe for our kids. Have we done something wrong? So I hope people take that responsibility more seriously and try to help clean things up a little bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:22):\nI think we've made a dent in that. Bob, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBob Baxley (01:41:26):\nThank you so much, Lenny. It's been a real honor, privilege, and just a ton of fun. So thank you so much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:41:31):\nSame for me. Bye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to find work you love | Bob Moesta (Jobs-to-be-Done co-creator, author of \"Job Moves”)\n\n## Transcript\n\nBob Moesta (00:00:00):\nI think one of the biggest misconceptions around Jobs to Be Done is this notion that it's pain and gain as opposed to context and outcome. When you hear somebody's story and it seems irrational, like we'll have people go, \"Oh my God, that's an anomaly. That doesn't happen.\" But what you realize is that the context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story, you go, \"I can't believe that,\" nine times out of 10, it's because you don't have the rest of the story. And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody to say, \"Why would somebody cut their arm off?\" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it. And so that's what we're trying to do is find, where will people change behavior?\n\nLenny (00:00:38):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Bob Moesta. Bob is the co-creator of the Jobs to Be Done Framework alongside Clay Christensen. And as you'll hear at the top of our conversation, is maybe the most anticipated guest I've had based on the LinkedIn response. Bob has started eight companies and is currently the co-founder and CEO of the Rewired Group, and currently spends his time helping companies of all sizes unlock hidden insights and create successful products and services.\n\n(00:01:12):\nIn our conversation, we get deep into all aspects of the Jobs to Be Done framework.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nBob Moesta (00:04:08):\nThanks, Lenny. Excited to be here. Big fan.\n\nLenny (00:04:10):\nAh, I'm a big fan of yours. I wasn't even super familiar with you before we started organizing this podcast chat.And then as you saw, I posted on LinkedIn what questions people had for you and around Jobs to Be Done in general. And I've never seen so many comments and questions and so much passion for guests I had on, I think there was over-\n\nBob Moesta (00:04:30):\nReally?\n\nLenny (00:04:30):\nAbsolutely. There's, I don't don't know, 130 questions and comments and folks like Jason Fried, founder of 37signals and Des from Intercom came out and just like, I'm excited for this episode, so we got some here.\n\nBob Moesta (00:04:45):\nI've worked with all of them, they're great people and fun to work with.\n\nLenny (00:04:48):\nI just had no idea there's so much passion for Jobs to Be Done. I have a million questions for you, a lot of them coming from the audience, some from me. So I'm excited to dig into a lot of this stuff.\n\nBob Moesta (00:04:57):\nAll right, let's dive in.\n\nLenny (00:04:58):\nOkay, so I thought it'd be useful just to start with the very basics briefly, just what is the simplest way to understand the Jobs to Be Done framework?\n\nBob Moesta (00:05:07):\nI think the easiest way to think about it is that I'm an engineer, electrical, basically have been building product for almost 30 years and one of the lies I was told growing up was build it and they will come. And so we always think about it from a technological, how do I build this thing? And all right, who wants this product? And what I realized very early in my career is that really it didn't work, I couldn't make it work.\n\n(00:05:31):\nAnd so Jobs to Be Done is this whole premise that people hire products, they don't buy them, they hire them to make progress in their life. And if we can take a step back and look at it, we see it in a very different light to realize at some point they're in some context and there's some outcome they want. And if we can understand that, we start to realize that different things compete, right?\n\n(00:05:51):\nA simple example is think of Snickers and Milky Way, right? They're both candy bars, they're both bought in the checkout aisle, they're both made almost with the same ingredients, one has peanuts, one doesn't. And if you start to compare the products and do a competitive benchmark, you start to get to one's a little softer, one's a little harder, one's got a few more calories, one's got less calories. But when you talk to people about when's the last time they ate a Snickers, when time's the last time they ate a Milky Way, you start to realize that Snickers typically is a case where they missed the last meal, they've got a lot of work to do, they're running out of energy and they want to basically get back to the tasks as fast as possible. And so you start to realize that Snickers is about almost like a meal replacement and it's about the stomach is growling and things like that. And you start to realize that if they didn't have a Snickers, it competes with a protein drink, it competes with a Red Bull, a coffee.\n\n(00:06:49):\nBut a Milky Way typically is eaten after an emotional experience, could be positive, could be negative. It's usually eaten alone, and it's taking time to regroup after this emotional thing. And you start to realize that it competes with things like a glass of wine, a brownie, and to be honest, a run. And so when you start to realize that, jobs helps you see the true competitive set from what we call the demand side of the world as opposed to the competitive set from the supply side of the world, which is the technology or the underlying business model by how which we're making it. And so it allows you to actually see what customers really want as opposed to trying to figure out, how do we sell things to people?\n\nLenny (00:07:29):\nTo maybe follow up on this example a bit, how often do you find these jobs emerge after they've developed a product, in this case I guess Snickers or Milky Way, how often is it just like they see this problem and actually apply this approach even accidentally?\n\nBob Moesta (00:07:44):\nWhat's interesting is that at least for me, the thing is what I learned was that supply and demand are not as connected as everybody thinks. Most people think they create a product and that creates demand. But the real thing that if you start to study causality is that a struggling moment causes demand. And you start to realize that in some cases that struggling moment exists and can exist for a long time and nobody solved it. So one of the companies I helped was Southern New Hampshire University and Paul Le Blanc. And one of the things in 2010, we found basically these anomalies, these people who were going to school but not actually coming to class and watching everything online. And it was like 50 or 60 of them and the anomalies basically, and they're paying full price, they didn't want to come. For Paul, it was kind of like why are they doing this?\n\n(00:08:29):\nAnd when we went to study them, we realized that they actually had a very different job than a typical 18 to 24 year old because one, they were a little bit older, typically they had either already had a degree or they basically had tried to go to college and it didn't work. And it was about basically time now that they had responsibility to do something new. And so they didn't actually build the product at all. And as they started to look and say how many people want to go back to school but can't? They started to realize it's not a thousand people, it's not 10,000 people, they have over 200,000 students. They're one of the largest universities in the world. And so all of this starts with a struggling moment, not with a product.\n\n(00:09:06):\nAnd so that's what we mean when we're customer-centric is that we're studying the struggling moments they have and people like Intercom and Basecamp, they look at struggling moments and that becomes their roadmap. Because again, think about a roadmap. I'm literally trying to tell you what I'm going to build in the next 24 months, for example, but none of us saw ChatGPT coming. And so all of a sudden I have to go undo the roadmap. But if I talk about the struggling moments that I'm trying to go after, all of a sudden I realize that the roadmap is now when I get to that struggling moment, there's multiple ways I can solve it. So instead of just talking about features, it's typically talking about features for the first 90 to 120 days, but after that we just talk about struggling moments because that's the seed for real innovation and basically where new products come from.\n\nLenny (00:09:51):\nTo unpack the framework a little bit more, if you were to come to a founder and tell them, \"Hey, you should be paying attention to struggling moments,\" I feel like all of them will say, \"Yeah, we know that. We do that. We look for pain and we try to solve it,\" so what I'm curious there maybe is just what is maybe the right way to do it?\n\nBob Moesta (00:10:07):\nBut it's not just the pain. See, what we're taught in business school was pain and gain, but the reality is it's the context. It's the fact that I didn't eat lunch before, the fact that I still have a lot of work to do, the fact that I have this podcast going on. It's not that I'm in pain, but it's the context that makes me value this in the moment that much more than something else. And so part of this is it's not just about pain and gain, it's about context and outcomes.\n\n(00:10:34):\nAnd so when you frame it that way, it becomes a vector, a vector of progress or a vector of intention of what they're trying to do. And once we frame that, then we can actually wrap technology around it. And the crazy part is that I was always told or taught if I build the best product, it will sell better. And what I've learned is that actually a kick-ass half is better than a half-ass hole, and that's what Jason talks about. But the reality is like if you look at QuickBooks, QuickBooks has half the features and double the price. And you start to realize that at some point in time it's about meeting customers where they are, not trying to wow them and not trying to convince them. They convince themselves to make the progress.\n\nLenny (00:11:14):\nI'd like to understand this vector piece more because that feels really important. So you were saying that it's not just there's a pain point, solve that, what you're saying is what's even more important is this context around that pain point and things that precede it?\n\nBob Moesta (00:11:27):\nYeah, so the first thing is we don't talk to people who just want to.\n\nLenny (00:11:34):\nFor people listening on the podcast, Bob pulled up a drawing, so you should try to check out the YouTube video of this to see what he's doing.\n\nBob Moesta (00:11:42):\nSo there's some Product A is the old product and there's some Product B, which is the new product. And ultimately people don't randomly do anything. And so the real heart of the method of Jobs to Be Done is understanding the causation of what pushes people to say, \"Today's the day I got to do something different.\" And the push or the context they're in has nothing to do with the new product, it's the only reason why they would leave the old product. And if there's no push, they can't even see your product because we're creatures of habit, right? And so as soon as I have a push, I call that F1, force one, and I have some idea of what's possible, then I create something called F2, which is basically the pull to a new outcome, a new state, a new thing, right? And so at some point in time it's like I have to be in this situation and I have to want this outcome, right?\n\n(00:12:34):\nBut here's the other part is that there's this waterline that there's these other forces and there's two other forces. Every time I show somebody something new, it actually creates anxiety, right? Anxiety of the new, and I call this F3, right? And then the other thing is I have to get them to leave old thing. So I call this habit of the present. And what you start to realize, and I call that F4, is if F1 and F2 are not greater than F3 and F4, they're not going to move, they're not going to do anything. And so ultimately what we're doing is we're framing the market as a system of behavior. And most people say, \"If I just add more features, create more pull, people will buy.\" It's not true. More features create actually anxiety, can it do all those things?\n\n(00:13:24):\nAnd what you start to realize is if I reduce friction, which is the bottom part, I actually don't have to do anything with a product, I just have to make easier. So for example, one of the things I did is I built houses and one of the frictional points that people had in moving was the fact of moving house was basically packing all their stuff up and going somewhere. And so I would literally sell them a condo, they'd go from a 3000 square foot home to a 1500 square foot condo and they'd cancel six weeks later because they didn't know how to get rid of all their stuff, which is a frictional point. So what did I do? I actually raised the price of the condo, included moving in two years of storage as part of the deal with the condo because it's the frictional coefficient and I increased sales over 30%.\n\nLenny (00:14:06):\nI love that.\n\nBob Moesta (00:14:07):\nSo what this is it's really about focusing on the customer. It's about understanding the causation behind it and then using design thinking to actually start to realize, how do we actually enable people to make progress? We don't need to sell them, we need to enable them to buy.\n\n(00:14:24):\nAnd so I wrote a book called Demand Side Sales that basically took the premise of stop trying to sell people and just help them make progress, help them buy. And so the whole book is instead of trying to base the sales process on how we want to sell, we need to actually design the sales process on how they want to buy. And it seems like it's the same thing, but they're actually really, really different things.\n\nLenny (00:14:47):\nIs there an example that can make this even more real of a company or a product?\n\nBob Moesta (00:14:51):\nSo one of the companies I work with a lot lately is a company called Autobooks, they're based here in Detroit. And basically they help banks basically do invoicing through let's say Apple Pay. And so instead of having to use Square or PayPal, you literally can use your bank now to do these things. And so there's two things, they have to sell small business on it, but they also have to sell banks on it. And when we started talking about it, they talked about why do banks want it? And the first thing we did is we found out there's three really different reasons why banks want them.\n\n(00:15:22):\nBut the thing is that where the process looked at is they would talk about the struggling moment, they talk about what was going on and then everything was about getting them to a demo. And once we got them to a demo, we had to close them. Well, it turns out that the buying process literally has different phases in it. There's the first thought, there's something called passive looking where they're problem aware and solution unaware and they have to learn a bunch of things, and then there's active looking where they're both problem and solution aware and they're trying to figure it out and frame a solution, and then there's deciding which is about making trade-offs.\n\n(00:15:53):\nAnd so what we end up doing is when I started to talk to the team about it, what they started to realize is I said, \"Where is the customer in their timeline of buying?\" And they looked at me like, \"Huh?\" I said, \"No, no, you have a timeline of how you want to sell to them and after the demo you try to close, but what if they're actually in passive looking and want a demo to learn more? It's very different than if I'm trying to close.\" And so what we ended up doing is breaking the demo apart, asking people where they were in their buying process. And by doing that we actually then found out a way in which to give them three different demos, one about telling stories and giving them the background about the problem, another one about showing them all the alternatives, and then the last one is about basically giving them choices between ways to move forward, right?\n\n(00:16:37):\nAnd you'd think that it would make the sales process longer, it actually made the sales process almost half and at 4x basically conversion because now we meet them where they are as opposed to where we want them to be.\n\nLenny (00:16:52):\nAnd is that something you find generally in the sales process, there's these three phases that everyone goes through and you got to think about them individually?\n\nBob Moesta (00:16:59):\nYeah, there's actually, I call them six phases. First thought, passive looking, active looking, deciding, first use, and then ongoing use. How do we build the new habit? And so if we don't actually study that part of how do people transform themselves through a struggling moment, we don't know what they want. If I talk to people who want to buy a house, they tell me they want granite and hardwood and they'll make everything these things they want.\n\n(00:17:25):\nBut when you actually talk to people who bought a house, they actually made a lot of trade-offs. Although for example, everybody I would survey before buying a house, I had 93% say they wanted an Energy Star compliant house. It cost 30 grand to make an Energy Star compliant at the time. And the reality is nobody bought it, they all bought the finished basement. And so there's the difference between what they say they want and what they want.\n\n(00:17:48):\nAnd so the method itself is not based on traditional research or market research, asking people what it is. It's actually based on criminal and intelligence interrogation about telling me the story about how you decided today's the day I bought a house or today's the day I went back to school. It's not random. And if it's not random, then we need to actually find it. And that to me is one of the bigger differences, most people build their sales process on probability, \"If I get so many leads in, I'll convert so many to here to so many...\" But the ultimate thing is, how many people are really ready for your product? They have to actually be ready for it. And that's what Jobs to Be Done is really about, is understanding where they are, what's causing it, and how do they make the trade-offs?\n\nLenny (00:18:30):\nSo let's follow that thread of interviewing and talking to your potential customers and customers to understand the jobs to be done. What is the actual process you recommend?\n\nBob Moesta (00:18:39):\nThe first thing we do is we frame a question. And the way I think about it is most people, so the one thing to know about me is I've been building things for over 30 years, I've worked on 3,500 different products and services across many, many industries, but I've had three close head brain injuries before I was seven years old and I can't read and I can't write. And so one of the things for me is that I could not understand the research that I would get from marketing around basically they'd say, \"Hey, I need something that's easy, fast and fun and cheap.\" And I'd be like, \"Okay, what does any of that mean? What is fast? How fast is fast and what's not fast?\" And you start to undo all those things.\n\n(00:19:18):\nAnd so the first thing we do is we start to frame, let's just talk about what causes people to say today's the day they want to go on vacation or today's the day they wanted a new set of windows. And you start to frame around that, and then you go find people who recently purchased and say, \"What in the world happened that says today's the day I need new windows?\" And you start to realize that there's pushes and there's pulls and there's anxieties and there's habits. And so the first thing we do is we try to extract the story from the customer. And it doesn't have to be my product, it could be somebody else's product if I haven't built it yet. It's like, what are people going to fire when they hire me?\n\n(00:19:55):\nAnd so when we get the stories though, then the stories are going to get us the pushes, the pulls, the anxieties and the habits, the trade-offs and what we call the hire and fire criteria. And then what we do is instead of trying to look for themes across all of them, we actually do something, instead of segmenting them, we cluster them, we find the pathways because what you start to realize is it's not one reason why people do it, it's sets of reasons. And those sets actually work together. So the pushes work with the pulls. So when they have these pushes, they want these pulls. And when they don't have these pushes, they don't want those pulls.\n\n(00:20:29):\nAnd so when you start to see the patterns and you start to pull it out, you start to realize that most companies or most products are hired to do 3, 4, 5 different jobs and they're in conflict with each other. One person wants to go faster and one person wants to be more thorough. And so all of a sudden being more thorough means it's slower. If I say we're thorough, the people who want it fast say, \"I don't want this because it's too slow.\" So how do you frame those things out and understand where the conflicts are behind it and think about different products from it?\n\n(00:20:59):\nThat's what Intercom did, right? Intercom realized that people hired it for four very, very different reasons and then instead of building four different products, they literally took their product and turned off the features that were not relevant to the pathway that people wanted to take. So for acquire, they didn't need a whole bunch of these other features and so they actually framed it around basically, how do we help people convert? And that job actually competed with HubSpot.\n\n(00:21:24):\nThere's another one where it was about helping with support, and that one competed with Zendesk. And so they changed the pricing model to basically match who the competition was and to match the progress that people were trying to make because Zendesk was too much and too hard, and HubSpot felt like it was an overkill for where people were. We basically figured out how to actually position ourselves as a good next step between HubSpot adds nothing or between nothing and HubSpot. And that's how they've grown to be valued over 2 billion.\n\nLenny (00:21:56):\nI have a follow-up question, but did you say that you can't read and write?\n\nBob Moesta (00:22:00):\nYeah, can't read and write. So the thing is I cannot read the words that I write and I cannot read... So if somebody reads it to me, I can actually play it back. So I'll listen to audio. But the fact is the way I was taught to read is so that when I look at a paragraph, I see the spaces between the words first, and then I usually see the left-hand edge of the words, so the last three letters. And so my mom taught me to look at the five largest words on the page by circling the longest words on the page. And then I would study those and translate those and then figure out what those five words would have in common. Because for me, the part that's broken in my brain is that I can't look up things fast enough. So by the time I try to look at a word, figure out what it is, get the definition, I've literally forgotten every word before it.\n\nLenny (00:22:53):\nDamn. How are you writing books?\n\nBob Moesta (00:22:55):\nIt's a gift. I'm telling you, it's a gift. It's a gift I'd never wish upon my children. But to be honest, it's given me abilities to see patterns in so many different ways because I can remember the first five words in the first paragraph and the last five words in the last paragraph so I turned through a book three or four times, and I have as good a comprehension as everybody else.\n\nLenny (00:23:14):\nThis is insane. How are you writing books?\n\nBob Moesta (00:23:19):\nIt's really simple, I have a company called Scribe Media, and what we do is first thing we do is we look for what struggling moments do people have? We then look at what are the competitive books wrapped around it? I then basically outline what progress looks like. We then take each chapter and define it as a system and what we have to do in each chapter to help them make the progress along the way. And then we just talk and we talk, we have ten two hour sessions, they get recorded, and then somebody basically takes... So if you listen or read any of my books, it sounds like me talking because it is.\n\nLenny (00:23:56):\nWow.\n\nBob Moesta (00:23:56):\nAnd so I can get a book out in three and a half, four months.\n\nLenny (00:24:00):\nThat's incredible.\n\nBob Moesta (00:24:01):\nAnd so now I'm a teacher, I'm adjunct lecturer at the Kellogg School at Northwestern, and then I guest lecture on the East Coast in kind of different business schools, and then I help Techstars and Y Combinator. So I'm really moving myself into being into, I feel it's time to pass on. I've had some amazing mentors who helped me, and again, I was told to be a baggage handler or a construction worker when I graduated high school, and my mom thought I could do more. And so I met these people who poured their knowledge into me to enable me to do all this stuff so now I'm trying to pay it forward as much as I can. So that's one of the reasons why I do as many podcasts as I can. So again, I appreciate you having me.\n\nLenny (00:24:42):\nYeah, this is a great opportunity to pass it on and so I'm very happy we're doing that. I had no idea about any of this about you, so thank you for sharing that.\n\nBob Moesta (00:24:52):\nIt's been fun. I pinched myself. The other part is I don't know how I got here. One of the things that I've been doing is I've been studying people for the last 10 years around why they switched from one company to another to literally understand the jobs of jobs because employees actually hire companies more than companies hire employees. And so you start to realize the struggling moment is why don't we have enough people? And otherwise I want to leave, but I don't know how to leave. And so I'm in the midst of writing a book around that right now with Michael Horn and Ethan Bernstein.\n\nLenny (00:25:23):\nIs there an insight from that work that you can share about why people leave jobs or join jobs?\n\nBob Moesta (00:25:27):\nSo the number one thing that I would say is almost everybody when you ask them about how they got the job they're in, the number one phrase you get is, \"It was so lucky. I was so lucky, just happened to fall in my lap.\" And then when you actually unpack the story, luck had nothing to do with it. They were prepped, they were ready, there was pushes, there were pulls, there was anxieties, they were able to do it. And you start to realize, and the funny part is that if I talked to somebody who's been through three or four kind of switches, they all can say, \"Yep, I've had that job. Yep, I've had that job. Yep, I've had that.\" And so there's frames around basically understanding what progress are you really trying to make now? Is it, do I need balance? Am I not challenged enough?\n\n(00:26:08):\nAnd you start to frame it, and when you frame it, you start to realize, I'm willing to actually take less money to be around smarter people because I want to be a founder later. And so you start to realize that all of these things where we think we have to pay more money, over 50% of the people who got new jobs didn't get more money. It's a lie. It's about progress. It's about what do they want to learn? What skills do they want to get? At some point it's about money, but it's not always about money.\n\n(00:26:37):\nAnd the other interesting part is when you talk about money, we talk about this notion of unpacking. We'll say, \"Well, why do you need more money?\" It's like, \"Well, I have larger obligations,\" or, \"I want more money because I want more respect.\" And so what you realize is in the hiring and firing criteria, they talk about money, but money actually has a bigger effect than just money. It's about respect or it's about responsibility or it's about their metric of progress. There's a whole bunch of things, but it's not just money. That's the interesting part.\n\nLenny (00:27:09):\nYeah, I've definitely done that myself, there's a status component to your job.\n\nBob Moesta (00:27:14):\nYeah, I want the title, right? Happens all the time.\n\nLenny (00:27:18):\nI want to come back to the discussion we were just having around interviewing people to understand the jobs to be done. And a bunch of people on LinkedIn were trying to understand just tactically what they need to get right in order to get accurate jobs. So I guess, are there just a couple tactics you'd recommend for how to interview people?\n\nBob Moesta (00:27:37):\nLet me give you three tips. The first tip I'd tell you is go read Never Split The Difference by Chris Voss. I started to write a book around basically techniques that I learned back in the eighties and nineties around this, and his book is amazing around it, the whole notion of getting to know. I play things back incorrectly because they're going to say no, and I'm going to say, \"All right, fix it,\" and then they'll talk more. The moment somebody says yes, there's nothing more to say. And so there's a bunch of techniques you have to learn to basically get them talking.\n\n(00:28:09):\nThe second is I only talk to people who have already tried to make the progress, right? So for example, people talk about like, \"Well, you can't apply this to something that's new. It doesn't exist.\" So I worked with a company that was, let's say a fairly large social media company, and at some point in time they found people kind of transacting on their platform, but they didn't know anything about it and they hadn't built anything. And what they ended up doing is we ended up going and studying eBay and Etsy and what caused somebody to say, \"Today's the day I'm going to set up an eBay store or sell something on Craigslist.\" And out of that, we found all the jobs of what people, both sellers were doing and buyers were doing, and now I think it's I think almost a $3 billion marketplace that didn't exist and they learned about it all from the competitors.\n\nLenny (00:28:58):\nSounds like Facebook Marketplace, maybe? No comment?\n\nBob Moesta (00:29:01):\nI didn't say that.\n\nLenny (00:29:03):\nHow many interviews do you recommend people do to get to a confident?\n\nBob Moesta (00:29:07):\nThat's a great controversial question. The interesting part is from a causal mechanism perspective and from a set theory perspective, meaning the sets of pushes, pulls anxieties and habits, it starts to repeat around seven or eight. And I usually do 10, no more than 12. And I would rather do two rounds of 12 interviews than do 24 interviews. I had some really interesting mentors, one of them was Dr. Deming, who's the father of lean and quality systems and like that. And so he would always push me to basically how to do things faster and smaller. And so that's where a lot of it came. And you just realize that people will say, \"Oh, we have to do something statistically significant.\" Well, you do if you're doing it randomly, but if you actually understand the range of your market and you know that 50% of it is above 30 years old and 50% is below 30 years old, I could actually sample in a way that makes me get a good representation without having to actually do 50 interviews. And so we use something called design experiments to help with that.\n\nLenny (00:30:07):\nI love the concrete numbers. And so along those lines, when you're actually asking questions of people, do you have any best practices and ways of phrasing a question to get a response you can trust?\n\nBob Moesta (00:30:18):\nIn a lot of cases, you have to look at it from multiple perspectives. And so the other tip I have is to not have a discussion guide. It drives people crazy because everybody wants to ask the same set of questions, but the problem happens is when you ask the same set of questions, you actually don't follow the ones that actually have the most meaningful information in it, right? And so what happens is, what I say is I use the framework of pushes, pulls, anxieties and habits and say, \"What caused them to do this?\" And everything else is just a conversation of trying to understand their story.\n\n(00:30:53):\nAnd so part of this is being able to ask the questions around why, but you can't ask \"Why, why, why, why why?\" It's like, \"Tell me more about that. Give me an example.\" And in a lot of cases, I usually get them to what I call the edge of language where they have no more language, and what I do is I literally then bracket it, \"So was it more about this or more about that?\" And I know it's neither one of those, and it forces them to talk more, right? It's always trying to get them to know, because the moment I get to... So when I play it back, \"So you did this and this and this and this,\" and say, \"No, that wasn't it.\" And the people who I'm working with are like, \"You know that's not the right answer,\" I'm like, \"I know, but they're going to elaborate on why it's not that.\" And so it's literally being able to reveal kind of the causal mechanisms of why people do what they do.\n\nLenny (00:31:41):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums from modern growth teams, companies like DraftKings, Zapier, ClickUp, Twitch and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your own experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved most about working there was our experimentation platform where I was able to slice and dice data by device types, country, user stage. Eppo, does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytic cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond click through metrics and instead use your north star metrics like activation, retention, subscription and payments. Eppo supports tests on the front end, on the backend, email marketing, even machine learning claims. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, that's geteppo.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:32:48):\nWhen I think about Jobs to Be Done, I've never fully implemented any sort of structured framework, but I find that it's been really useful in my newsletter work and my podcast work, just thinking about what is the job my newsletter is doing for people? For me, it's helping people get better at the craft of building and growing products. And I just think of it, there's these buckets of jobs to be done and then there's this formal, \"Let's just do it for real.\" I guess, one, do you find that to be true? There's the very simple and there's the more official?\n\nBob Moesta (00:33:14):\nSo what I would say is I find a lot of founders, especially really successful founders, like I would say Jason Fried is one of those where he intuitively understood this. He actually thinks this way but didn't have language wrapped around it, right? So I think that it's a very useful framework. I think that the danger you run into is that when you look at the customer through the product, so if I look at the customers through the Snickers bar, then I think of Milky Way as a competitor. But if I look at the customer and say, \"Why did they pick that thing?\" Then I realize that a protein shake and an apple and a sandwich are the competitors not Milky Way.\n\nLenny (00:33:53):\nGot it. So say someone wanted to start going in this direction of Jobs to Be Done, what is the simplest, I don't know, first version, lightweight approach to starting to think this way?\n\nBob Moesta (00:34:04):\nSo there's two things. If I have a product, go find 10 people who recently bought your product, but what I want you do is go talk to them, not about the product, but about why they bought the product, what was going on, what were they hoping for, what were they worried about? What did they have to give up? How did they convince somebody else? Just listen to the story. Start with just getting the story.\n\n(00:34:26):\nBecause there's three levels of information we have to get or three sources of energy that I talk about. So think about it as there's got to be energy in the system for us to do something. And there's what I call functional energy, which is usually time, space, effort, knowledge, right? There's emotional energy, which is how I feel. I want to feel better, I feel frustrated, I feel overlooked. There's emotional aspects to it. And then there's social aspects, how I want others to perceive me or how others perceive me, \"Oh, my boss is going to fire me because he doesn't think I'm doing this fast enough and I feel inadequate.\" So part of his understanding kind of the emotional, social and functional components that are part of that energy source.\n\nLenny (00:35:11):\nGot it.\n\nBob Moesta (00:35:11):\nThe second part is if it's an established product and it's been there a while, I'd actually go and talk to people who churned. Because in churn, what's interesting is when somebody leaves your product, they're still making progress. We think it's bad for us, which it probably is, but in their mind it's like, \"Yeah, this was too hard and complicated,\" or, \"You know what? It didn't do enough for us.\" It allows you to actually understand the struggling moment they had because, again, they were using your product and something happened and some context changed and now they struggle with it, and now they got to go find something else.\n\n(00:35:43):\nNobody wants to change. So that makes this actually the easiest thing to look at is tell me why people change. We just seem to literally not want to go deep enough and we use the lazy word of random and probability as pseudo for knowledge, and it's not knowledge. It's literally just if context is the same, if outcomes is the same, then I can do it. But if I listen to football stats, third down in preseason is very different than third down in playoffs, right? And so giving me a stat about how their third down conversion is across the whole season makes no sense to me because the context is different.\n\nLenny (00:36:25):\nYou brought up this point that people often say they really hate something and it comes across that they're ready to switch and will use something that you've built that's better, but they don't because of that friction you mentioned. What do you look for that might tell you that they're really actually going to use it for real and it's that serious?\n\nBob Moesta (00:36:43):\nThe very first thing I would say is I never trust anybody telling me things they're going to do because they can't assure it, and it usually never happens. It's my experience that says that. And so the thing is, I need to talk to people who did something and tried and though they might've failed, what made them try? So the phrase I have 'Bitchin' ain't switchin'.\" Just because people bitch about something doesn't mean they're going to do anything about it. This is where at Basecamp, we learned the fact that everybody said, \"Oh, if you had Gantt charts, I'm going to leave you if you don't put Gantt charts in or resource allocation,\" and as much as they all say they want it, they're not leaving because of it.\n\n(00:37:23):\nAnd this is the other part, if you follow your best users, they'll take you up to this world that then actually destroys the lower end of the world of why people are there. And so if Basecamp would've added all those things, one of the reasons why people join Basecamp is because it's so dang simple. And if I start to add all these things that make it more complicated, it doesn't work.\n\nLenny (00:37:43):\nAnd so in those conversations, is there something you find that just this is a sign they're actually really serious, or do you just like, \"I'm not going to listen to anything they're saying in this case until we actually build it and they're using it\"?\n\nBob Moesta (00:37:55):\nSo for example, in the first five minutes of an interview, they're going to tell you, \"I bought a new car because I got a deal on it and it was a car I've been dreaming about forever,\" and it's like they have all these things and then when you start to get to, it's like, no, the old car had 280,000 miles on it. You had three large bills in the last four months. The fact is it's making a sound and you've got a long trip coming up, that's why you're getting a car. You're not getting the car because of the deal. And so there's these, I call it the layers of language. And the very first layer is called the pablum layer, where people just, \"How was your day?\" \"Oh, it was good,\" but nobody knows what that means. And if you ask one further question, \"Well, what was good about it?\" They're like, \"Ugh.\"\n\n(00:38:34):\nAnd then you get to the next layer, the next layer is usually the fantasy nightmare layer, \"Oh, it was so good because of this,\" or, \"Oh my God, it was so bad because...\" They exaggerate to one degree or the next. And then what you want to do is actually then pull it back to what actually happened. This is where you've got to be more of an investigator and an interrogator. And the way I would describe it is it's criminal and intelligence interrogation that feels like therapy because most people don't actually know why they bought because they only think about the time they wrote the check, swiped the card. But the reality is like I did an interview with somebody who bought a coat rack, $137 coat rack. It took them 18 months to buy it. And in their mind, they say they bought it in a week, but the reality is the debate about getting it and why they couldn't get it was happening for over 18 months. So this is where you can't believe what they say, you have to do your investigation to get there.\n\nLenny (00:39:32):\nAnd what does that phrase use again for that vector of progress?\n\nBob Moesta (00:39:36):\nThe intention, it's the context that they're in and the outcome. So here's the thing is that most people talk about you want to get to this outcome and people value this outcome, but value is not just the outcome. Value also has where you start. So if I start here and I end here, I'm going to value it this much. But if I start down here... Wait, I've got to get there, start down here, and I go up here, I value it that much more. And so part of it is value is actually part of where they're starting from and where they want to go. And most people say, \"If I just get them up here, they're really going to love it,\" but some people say, \"I just want to get here.\" And so you're overshooting it and they actually want a price discount because you're giving them more than they want.\n\nLenny (00:40:16):\nSo I'm going to go in a different direction. The most liked comment on LinkedIn asking people what question to ask you was by Sharam Krishnan, who's actually on this podcast in the past.\n\nBob Moesta (00:40:27):\nYeah, yeah, yeah. I remember seeing it, I remember hearing it. By the way, I think it's one of the reasons why I reached out because I'm like, \"Okay, we need to clarify this a little.\"\n\nLenny (00:40:37):\nOkay, great. So you saw the brand, he's not what you'd say a fan of Jobs to Be Done.\n\nBob Moesta (00:40:41):\nNo, no.\n\nLenny (00:40:43):\nAnd so here's the question he wanted to ask, \"Is there a case of a startup or a modern technology company or any company that was using Jobs to Be Done to launch a product from zero to one that has had broad adoption?\" That's his challenge.\n\nBob Moesta (00:40:56):\nInside the company or broad adoption that the product that we've developed had broad adoption?\n\nLenny (00:41:01):\nThe latter, yeah, the product has done really well.\n\nBob Moesta (00:41:03):\nI already told you an example. I can't say it, but you can. The thing is, for example, Autobooks is another one that did this, right? They start to realize that the fact is you need to study the struggling moments and it helps you determine what not to build, right? Too many times we just keep adding more and more things to the product. And so in larger organizations it's very difficult because at some point the dominant market research is about hypothesis testing, \"I'm going to go build a hypothesis and go basically then go build a research project to prove or disprove that hypothesis.\"\n\n(00:41:44):\nBut the reality is, Jobs to Be Done research is hypothesis building research. I don't know, that's part of the point is we really don't know. We think we know, but Dr. Taguchi would always tell me there's way more unknown than there is known and never forget it. And so again, what causes people to buy windows is not what we think it is. And so you start to realize that. I think Drucker said it best, he goes, \"What businesses think they're selling is not what customers are buying.\" And to be honest, he said that in 1953, and it's still true today. I just did interviews today where they're like, \"Oh, people are buying for this reason,\" and we did 12 interviews and you started to realize, nope, that's not why they're buying. And they're shocked.\n\nLenny (00:42:30):\nAwesome. Okay, so you didn't say it, but maybe Facebook Marketplace?\n\nBob Moesta (00:42:33):\nSo Autobooks would be one, you're trying from zero to one from nothing, right?\n\nLenny (00:42:41):\nYeah, brand new product is kind of the question there.\n\nBob Moesta (00:42:42):\nYeah, so at Techstars we basically make sure that everybody, they come in, they usually don't have a product to start with, at least in the Chicago and San Francisco offices. We basically have do jobs in the very, very beginning of that. And we have companies like Nutrisense and Havoc Shield, and there's a whole bunch of them that are out there that are growing and going down that pathway. And so to me, it's very, very useful, especially in the zero to one space.\n\n(00:43:08):\nBut the notion is the way that I frame it is, what will people stop using when your product comes out? And that's who you want to go interview. So for the Marketplace thing, it was like, \"Hey, I want them to stop using Craigslist. I want them to stop using eBay. I want them to stop using Etsy.\" If that's the case, what are they doing and how do I do it better than that so I can understand? There are really no new jobs, it's just the fact is we get better at them. And so the hire and fire criteria get better, but the context and outcome, most jobs, I can look back 10 years in the job existed and I can look ahead 20 years and the job's going to exist. It's just the nature of how the technology delivers on it is what gets better.\n\nLenny (00:43:51):\nAwesome. And it sounds like Intercom and Basecamp also are very early Jobs to Be Done adopters?\n\nBob Moesta (00:43:57):\nVery early, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:43:59):\nSo I think with Sherom, something that I read between the lines is he worked at Twitter for many years and I think Twitter attempted at Jobs to Be Done framework, and I don't know if it went well and I think it just caused a lot of people to think this is a terrible framework.\n\nBob Moesta (00:44:10):\nThis is where I think there's different flavors of it. And what I would say is that one flavor is really what I call very supply side driven, where it takes the underlying technology and then looks at it and says, \"All right, what else can we do? Where can we be better? Where are things that are important but we're not satisfying on them?\" And being able to prioritize. And so there's a very systematic approach that's hundreds of steps and very, very prescriptive in nature.\n\n(00:44:38):\nThe method that I have and that I've been using mostly because I've been in the startup world and doing new to the world type stuff is it's very, very qualitative, organic, and it's a combination of a process, practice and skills. So every company actually has its own innovation process based on who they have, who they're serving, the underlying technology. And so, in my opinion, to have a very predictive one process that fits across everybody, I think there are principles, but I don't think there's one process. And so I think that's what they used at Twitter.\n\n(00:45:16):\nThe other thing is that I think Jack was actually a big fan and he worked with Clay on a couple of things, but I don't think they worked on the method part of it, they worked on the thinking part of it. And so it was more about, so one of the most dangerous things you can do is sit in a room and hypothesize what the jobs are because I will guarantee you you're 100% wrong. And so this is what happens, by the way, this is the gift of dyslexia is I'm not an A student and so most A students don't start until they know the answer, most D students start because they don't know the answer. And so you start to realize we're wired very differently to do that. And so I always say that the A students have a disadvantage against the D students and entrepreneurship because we just go start and we learn right that in there. We don't have to hypothesize everything first because we actually don't know how to do that.\n\nLenny (00:46:09):\nSo your advice there is essentially people often get Jobs to Be Done wrong because they just sit around and think about the Jobs to Be Done and aren't actually doing the work to interview and understand?\n\nBob Moesta (00:46:21):\nYeah. They think more about the outcomes and they think about what's the best outcomes we can get for people. And what you start to realize is that there are trade-offs people make. And ultimately there's some irrational piece, some irrational component that makes everything twist around. The irrational component is like, why in the world do people eat Snickers when they're hungry? It's a candy bar. Well, it turns out when you bite it, it masticates into a ball and it sits in your stomach and it absorbs the acid that's causing you to say, \"Hey, I got to eat something.\" And so part of it is the roll of the peanuts and the roll of the nougat is actually to masticate it together. The caramel should be sticking it together versus in a Milky Way, the melting temperature of the caramel is so light that you take a bite, it's liquid, you drink it down, you swallow it like it's a drink, it has nothing to do with food.\n\n(00:47:13):\nAnd so you start to realize that it's connecting the experiences to the context and outcome. It's connecting the supply side with the demand side, but it starts with the demand side first. Struggling moments and opportunities all exist before there's a product.\n\nLenny (00:47:31):\nYou're making me hungry.\n\nBob Moesta (00:47:34):\nI bought a couple, but I didn't use them, but I bought a couple. And I mean, you go deep into it, you start to realize that this is the crazy part, everybody thinks they compete, but if you literally go back to a moment when you picked up a Snickers bar, you were not thinking about a Milky Way. You weren't thinking of half the candy aisle, you were thinking of like, \"Do I want a sandwich, or do I want a Snickers?\" Half the reason why they picked Snickers is it's 300 calories, I can eat it in three bites, it's done, it's not messy, and I can keep working. It's mainlining food.\n\nLenny (00:48:05):\nI don't know if I've ever had a Milky Way to be honest.\n\nBob Moesta (00:48:05):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:48:05):\nSo I don't need that comfort.\n\nBob Moesta (00:48:09):\nThat's the funny part is you go to all the big tech hubs in San Francisco and the Snickers are all empty and the Milky Ways are all full.\n\nLenny (00:48:17):\nYeah, I get that. You mentioned that there's two different approaches or many different approaches to the Jobs to Be Done framework, and this is a question someone actually asked that there's maybe a framework by someone named Tony Ulwick, and then there's your approach, and then maybe Clay Christensen maybe has an approach. So can you just help clarify?\n\nBob Moesta (00:48:34):\nSo Clay and I collaborated on it. So I was lucky enough to have Clay as a mentor for 27 years, I met with him once a quarter for 27 years, and at some point I shared with him the hack of how I was thinking about this and what I was doing, and at some point he said, \"We need to turn it into a theory.\" To me, it was more like my work around because I couldn't read and write, \"Let me go talk to some people, I'll figure it out.\" And ultimately we turned it into a method. So if you look at Competing Against Luck, it was written with Tady Hall and Karen Dillon, Dave Duncan, but I helped on that book for 16 months. Some of the clients in there are my clients. I think Intercom is in that one. So Clay and I are aligned in that. Clay was more about turning it to a theory and I would say I'm more about having it be a method. So his is like a thinking framework and a philosophy and a strategic kind of frame where mine is very tactical about how do we get it and then what do we do with it.\n\n(00:49:31):\nUlwick's comes from a very different perspective, and again, I think it's very valuable, but it comes from the notion of functions and it's more like, what can our product do? What jobs can our product do? As opposed to the way I look at it is basically only people have jobs, products don't have jobs, people have jobs, organizations don't have jobs, people in organizations have jobs because that's the irrational part. And so fundamentally there's that two different views of how do we look at it, but ultimately I would say Clay's approach and my approach are derived from the same dataset where Ulwick's is derived from a different dataset and a different set of experiences.\n\nLenny (00:50:13):\nThat's super interesting, I had no idea about this. And your sense is in the case of Twitter, for example, maybe it's closer to Clay's just think about it approach.\n\nBob Moesta (00:50:20):\nYep, I think that's right, I think that's right. And again, I think Ulwick's is very valuable, especially in some companies where there's lots of risk, there's regulation, there's lots of moving parts, very complicated systems, but at the same time it's so many steps. You have to have a very disciplined organization to follow it.\n\nLenny (00:50:40):\nIf someone wanted to start actually following through on this, which book would you recommend they start with to help them understand how to apply your approach?\n\nBob Moesta (00:50:47):\nI would have them read Demand Side Sales, and it basically is starting from the theory of why do people buy and how do we actually understand how to flip the lens from trying to sell people things to help them buy? And ultimately it has the entire method around it kind of frame for product and for founders.\n\nLenny (00:51:05):\nAwesome. Is Jobs to Be Done ever not the right framework for people to figure out what to build?\n\nBob Moesta (00:51:11):\nOh yeah. So couple places, one is when there's no choice or there's no real choice. So what's interesting is think about is why do you know more about your car insurance than your health insurance, right? And most of it is because your health insurance is given to you by your employer and you only utilize it when you're sick. But the car insurance, you have to pay for it so you have to sit down and decide what are the different trade-offs you're going to make where when you do it for the employer, it's good, better, best. And it literally is like, where am I my life? Have I been sick? There's some basic things, but there's no real choice there.\n\n(00:51:48):\nAnd so you start to realize where there's no real choice or where people want to make the choice obvious, it doesn't work. You have to be able to accept how people see you as opposed to how you want to be seen. So when companies will come to us and say, \"All right, I want you to find these jobs for us,\" like, \"Nope, I can't do it because it doesn't work. I can tell you what the demand side is asking for and then we can see how your product fits to it and what you have to modify to it, but if I try to help you build the case to make the jobs what you think they are, it doesn't work.\"\n\nLenny (00:52:21):\nIn those cases, is there a different framework you recommend or is it just like you don't really have a lot of options?\n\nBob Moesta (00:52:26):\nIn a lot of cases to me, I'd do some ethnography, I'd literally figure out kind of where there's frictional points in the system. I might do some prototyping around kind of different alternatives, but typically it's more about what I would call the little hire or how do they use, for example, the health insurance as opposed to why do they buy the health insurance.\n\n(00:52:48):\nThe other example I could use is chewing gum. If I talk to people about buying a pack of chewing gum, most people can't remember at all when they bought a pack of chewing gum, even if it was in the last week like, \"Uh, I think so.\" But if I asked them when they chewed gum, they can tell me about when they chewed gum. And ultimately that will then imply when they buy gum. If you go to something that it doesn't register, it's so deep of a habit that they don't really know what they're doing, you'll never going to be able to get that information out of them. Again, the habitual stuff is very hard to see the job. It's only when people change do you see, it's like you can reveal the entire iceberg but if I've been using Tide for 20 years and I ask you why do you hire Tide, you just make it up. You have no idea why you Tide. But if you switch from Tide to Gain or Gain to Tide, you can tell me that story very detailed.\n\nLenny (00:53:41):\nThere's a reader who has the really interesting question, Maria Delano is her name. She's wondering, with a framework this well known, you're bound to get people misinterpreting it and repeating inaccurate information about the framework, and she's curious what misconceptions most frustrate you that you just hear again and again about Jobs to Be Done?\n\nBob Moesta (00:53:59):\nThe first thing I want to say is actually, in doing it, I've explicitly made it very accessible because the moment you make it too copywritten, too patented, too whatever, people just move by it. So part of it was being able to make it in the public domain so people could have conversation and try it and do different things with it.\n\n(00:54:21):\nWhat I would say is there's enough people that have used it and have worked with it and have had great success with it that at some point in time, most of the people who are trying it and not using it well, it's obvious. And so it'd be lik, how do you double down into it? I think one of the biggest misconceptions around Jobs to Be Done is this notion that it's pain and gain as opposed to context and outcome. And that I think one of the other ones is it's purely about the outcome and not just about the context and outcome together.\n\n(00:54:51):\nAnd again, I think the biggest mistakes I've seen made is because they do it in a conference room and they don't go talk to people. They don't actually find the contradictions, they don't find the irrational parts. What's really interesting is when you hear somebody's story and it seems irrational, like we'll have people go, \"Oh my God, that's an anomaly. That doesn't happen.\" But what you realize is that the context makes the irrational rational. So the moment you hear a story and you go, \"I can't believe that,\" nine times out of 10 it's because you don't have the rest of the story. And so part of it's being able to understand the rest of that context that would drive somebody say, \"Why would somebody cut their arm off?\" Well, if they're in this situation and this and this and this, there's nobody who would say they want to cut their arm off, but in certain situations you'll do it.\n\n(00:55:37):\nAnd so that's what we're trying to do is find where will people change behavior? Most people are studying the momentum of where people are and what's the momentum of their direction, but the reality is what we're trying to do is study what causes people to change their direction. And that's where innovation happens. Innovation happens when people change.\n\nLenny (00:55:58):\nWhat convinced you to spend your time and life working on Jobs to Be Done and helping people implement this framework and what keeps pulling you back?\n\nBob Moesta (00:56:08):\nThat's a great question. So I think I started out as I just love to build things. My mom would take me, basically we have something around here called Big Trash Day is where they throw out the dishwasher and they throw out the old mini bike and all these different things. And my mom would basically say anything that we could fit in the trunk, we could bring home. And so I've been building things my whole life because I've been just always fascinated with how things work. So that's the first thing.\n\n(00:56:38):\nThe second part is I love to help people. One of the things I realized is I can't build products for myself, and I've done seven startups, but I realized that I have to build for others. And so to me, building for others was where I started product. And then I realized that I'm a method builder and that I really help people innovate. And so I exist to help make the abstract concrete. So that phrase has helped lead me to becoming now a teacher and a professor and writing books is something I never wanted to do because I hated books. Clay convinced me that I had to learn how to speak and I had to write books.\n\n(00:57:18):\nSo here's a really good one is that this is in 1990, so one of the things that happened was when my youngest kid moved out and basically moved out of the house, I had my notebooks from almost 30 years of every project on everything I worked on any company, and this is from one of my mentors, Dr. Taguchi, he said this in 1990 when I was living in Cologne, Germany. He said, \"Write a book.\" So I opened this 30 years later, I'm like, \"Oh, dang it. I got to write a book because he told me to.\" So it's just one of those things where I realized I really like helping people, I like creating methods. I'm very curious, sometimes annoyingly curious, but that's kind of the triad of things that I love to do.\n\nLenny (00:58:06):\nAmazing. Bob, is there anything else you wanted to share or touch on or make sure we cover before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nBob Moesta (00:58:14):\nThere's three big things to take away. One is struggling moments is the key and it's struggling moments that people take action on. And what I would say is they're everywhere. They are freaking everywhere in our lives and there's only certain contexts when all of a sudden we realize we have to do something about it. So study struggling moments because at some point that's where we need the innovation the most. The second thing is think about the progress people are trying to make. What is their standard, not your standard? What is that context? What is that outcome? And the last thing, the way I phrase it is choose what to suck at and figure out the trade-offs that you need to make and make sure that your trade-offs map the trade-offs of the customer. Because nine times out of 10, most products that fail is because they made a trade-off that the customer didn't agree with.\n\nLenny (00:59:06):\nAwesome. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nBob Moesta (00:59:12):\nYeah, I'm ready. Always ready for these.\n\nLenny (00:59:14):\nPerfect. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nBob Moesta (00:59:19):\nShape Up by Ryan Singer, it's phenomenal. The other book I would say is End of Average by Todd Rose. I listen to it every single year. I get something on it every single year. I've been listening to it for probably eight or 10 years. I literally called Todd, I've become friends with Todd. We interact on a regular basis. It's an amazing book.\n\nLenny (00:59:39):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nBob Moesta (00:59:42):\nI love Big Bang. I watch it every... People would say that I'm Sheldon, I think I'm more Leonard, but I can see there's days that I come across as Sheldon, I don't mean to be Sheldon. But I like Oppenheimer. I think any of the science type, I'm not really a science fiction person, but it's more about, I'll say historic documentaries, I love them all because they help me understand the science.\n\nLenny (01:00:10):\nWhat is a favorite interview question you like to ask when you're interviewing people?\n\nBob Moesta (01:00:14):\nWhat are the top three things you struggle with in your business today that if you could solve would fundamentally change the business?\n\nLenny (01:00:22):\nLove it. What is a favorite product you recently discovered that you just really like?\n\nBob Moesta (01:00:28):\nI recently purchased a massage chair, and it's one of those things where I've been getting massages for a while, and as I get older and I'm working out more, I've lost almost 100 pounds. And so I'm to the point where I'm working out more and God, nobody told me I'm going to be cold all the time, I'm sore all the time and I'm hungry all the time. And so it's like, \"Okay, I need a way in which this...\" So I would get a massage every two weeks or so, and now I can get a massage in 20 minutes on demand. And it's pretty freaking amazing.\n\nLenny (01:00:57):\nMan, my wife has wanted one of these and this might be good for her.\n\nBob Moesta (01:00:59):\nOh, I will tell you, it's a life changer. It is one of those things where we'll do interviews and I can go do an interview and a debrief, pop in and do it. And I'm brush as I can be. It's better than an app.\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nIs there a brand you want to throw out that you found to be your favorite?\n\nBob Moesta (01:01:18):\nKyoto is the one that I have.\n\nLenny (01:01:18):\nKyoto.\n\nBob Moesta (01:01:20):\nI got it from Costco. It's fabulous.\n\nLenny (01:01:23):\nOkay, we'll be looking into that. What is something relatively minor you've changed in how a company has implemented Jobs to Be Done that has had a big impact on their ability to do it well?\n\nBob Moesta (01:01:33):\nThere's two. One is Intercom. So the way that Intercom really took off and why it did so well is actually, it was Des Traynor and Eoghan McCabe who were the two founders, they actually studied, they came to one of my workshops in the beginning, but they studied it and they tried to do it, and then we talked about it. But then they brought Matt Hodges and Paul Adams and Sean Townson and the executive team, and they did the interviews. And when they did the interviews, they understood what to do and it literally all went downhill from there. And they knew how to ask the questions.\n\nLenny (01:02:09):\nDownhill in a good way?\n\nBob Moesta (01:02:10):\nThey knew how to do the interviews way. It was kind of amazing. And Paul Adams and Matt Hodge's first day at Intercom was in my office in Detroit. So that to me is one of the key.\n\n(01:02:23):\nThe other is to find a place in a very large organization where a group is struggling, they can't deliver product, they can't move fast enough, they keep getting the wrong insights, they say it's going to be this big, and literally focusing on a very small area and giving them a little space to demonstrate the use of it, and then it will spread with a case study or two. And so most companies, if they start small case studies and sharing it with people both when it works and not works, or starting with the top.\n\nLenny (01:02:56):\nTwo more questions, one is, someone asked me to ask you the dining room table story. Does that ring any sort of bell?\n\nBob Moesta (01:03:01):\nYeah. So one of the things I did is I built houses. So before I built houses, I was running a venture capital, private equity firm. We had about 100 million. I was doing 25 transactions and just traveling too much, I had four children. And so my wife and I kind of had the conversation that I wound it down and I said, \"What am I going to do?\" I wanted to try and find a business I could work in and be part of and own part of so I joined a building company here in Detroit, and we ended up building a thousand homes here in Detroit and had 14 sites. And one of the things we did is we built for downsizers like your parents. And one of the things they constantly told us was, \"Look, we're downsizing. We're not having the holidays. We're done with that. I don't want a dining room table, so we can't even have people over. If we're going to do it, we're going to go somewhere else. I don't want the dining room table.\"\n\n(01:03:50):\nAnd so we made, it's a two bedroom, two and a half bath, first floor laundry, gourmet kitchen, kind of amazing condo. But what we realized is people, if they didn't know where the dining room table was going to go, they weren't going to move. And so it turns out that the dining table was the emotional bank account for their entire life. And so if you weren't going to take it or your sister wasn't going to take it or your brother wasn't going to take it, the reality is they weren't going to give it the Goodwill, it was not going to go in the basement. It might go into the storage unit, but for the most part, people would literally stay where they are until they knew where the dining table's going to go.\n\n(01:04:25):\nSo I did the opposite of what they told me to do, which is I built a place to put the dining room table. You could never eat at it, it was never big enough to actually pull the chairs out of it, but it was still a symbolic of what it was and they would use it for puzzles and that kind of stuff. But I sacrificed the second bedroom suite to basically add that, and it increased sales 22%. So this is a case where you learn, again, that irrational contradiction that says, \"They've said this, but you did that. That doesn't make any sense.\" That's what jobs helps you with, those kinds of really important, small but subtle and important insights.\n\nLenny (01:05:01):\nLast question, you showed me this very cool camera setup you have in one of the views was your heroes on the wall?\n\nBob Moesta (01:05:06):\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny (01:05:07):\nCan you show that and share who those folks are?\n\nBob Moesta (01:05:09):\nYeah, so at the end of the night, I have this philosophy that I have the energy in your body and your brain literally you need to use every ounce of it every day because you wake up the next day with a full bank account and you can't really save it. So every night I paint. And so these are paintings of my mentors and they're above me, but Dr. Deming, Clay, Dr. Taguchi, and Dr. Willie Moore, I wrote about him in a book called Learning to Build, and the five skills that they taught me to enable me to kind of work on so many different things in different areas.\n\n(01:05:45):\nAnd so Deming I met when I was 18, he took me to Japan. I worked for Ford and I was responsible on the front lines to help reduce product development cycle time at Ford from 72 months to 36 months. So that's where I learned a lot of tools and methods and things like that from Toyota. And then I learned Dr. Taguchi's method, which is amazing around designed experiments. Dr. Willie Moore was my first boss at Ford, and she was a PhD in particle physics and she taught me empathetic perspective of how to see things and frame things and really amazing, amazing individual.\n\n(01:06:20):\nAnd then the last one was Clay Christensen, which is I just walked in his office and he had a sign outside his office basically saying anomalies wanted, and I walked in and I said, \"Look, I'm an anomaly. I don't really know if you want anomalies, but I am.\" And we sat down and started talking, and ultimately I asked him, \"What's your research and how can I help?\" He had been there maybe about a year, and it was one of those things where he got kind of somber and it was almost like he had a tear, and I was like, \"What's going on?\" He goes, \"I've been here a year and everybody's asked me for things, but nobody's ever asked to help me, and you're the first person.\" And so that was the beginning of the relationship, and I had four hours a quarter for 27 years with Clay with no agenda, which is kind of amazing.\n\nLenny (01:07:05):\nThat's incredible. What a beautiful way to wrap up our chat, Bob. My job to be done for this interview was to help people understand Jobs to Be Done. I think we accomplished our goal as much as we can in one hour. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe ask you a question?\n\nBob Moesta (01:07:21):\nYeah, LinkedIn is probably the best place, and I post most of the stuff there. And then I have several different companies, but one is called The Rewired Group, and I've had that for about 14 years, and that's a design consultancy agency around helping people build and launch products. And we do everything from Fortune 100 to not-for-profits, to startups and different ways. And then I have something called Laser Ventures where we actually work for equity and we also put money into investments as well. And that's called Laser Ventures with Andrew Glazer. And we have a podcast called The Circuit Breaker, which it's more or less all these different concepts in 20 minute format of me and my partner just riffing around what is the empathetic perspective or what are the forces of progress? Or just small little things that basically help people learn along the way, and it's just long enough for a commute or a walk or something like that.\n\nLenny (01:08:18):\nLast question, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBob Moesta (01:08:20):\nTo be honest, I was so excited for this podcast. I was excited, one, because I'm a fan, but two is to see your post and then get all those responses. I think I said, \"Boy, I think we need more than an hour. This is amazing.\" And so to be honest, posting questions, asking questions, letting the community kind of interact. And what was so interesting is it was people who had questions, but then there were people like Des and Jason who reached out and said, \"Oh, this will be awesome. You'll love this.\" All those kind things.\n\n(01:08:51):\nSo to me, just keep being a community. And what I would say is, as this is posted, just put more questions up there. The hard part for me is actually answering questions in a written form. My request would be is that if we can figure out a format so I can answer them more in a conversation where we almost like a list of things where there might be a follow-up of some sort, but if your listeners could literally help me by being more articulate, that would be great.\n\nLenny (01:09:18):\nOkay. Let's figure out if we can do some way of doing that, that would be amazing.\n\nBob Moesta (01:09:21):\nThat would be great.\n\nLenny (01:09:22):\nBob, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nBob Moesta (01:09:25):\nThanks. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:09:26):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:09:30):\nThank you so much for listening.

I imagine there was a lot of pain and suffering that people don't often hear about.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:07):\nI didn't sleep for more than four hours at a time. I'd wake up every four hours and check the report and see if anyone was attacking the site. They don't tell you about that stuff in the movies.\n\nLenny (00:00:14):\nYou worked 120 hours per week., you had no hobbies.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:17):\nI don't want to take away from the romanticism of it. It's just that most often, we hear those romantic stories from the successes. It's a healthy thing for people to want to throw themselves into something and take that risk, but it is not glamorous at the time.\n\nLenny (00:00:29):\nThe newsfeed. That was one of your early projects at Facebook. People did not want it. They were wrong, clearly.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:00:33):\nNow, newsfeed was an easier case than people suspect. Everyone was outraged at the same time as they immediately doubled their usage of the product.\n\nLenny (00:00:40):\nIn terms of the economic utility, the Venn diagram of Boz, of newsfeed and ads created $1 trillion of value.\n\n(00:00:48):\nToday, my guest is Andrew Bosworth, or Boz, as most people know him. Boz is the chief technology officer of Meta. He joined what was then called Facebook in early 2006 as one of the first engineers, and during his 18-year tenure at Meta, he created some of the most impactful and important products in internet history, including the Facebook newsfeed, which was the first ever algorithmically ranked content feed of any social network, and is basically what people think of as Facebook today.\n\n(00:01:17):\nHe also built the original Facebook mobile ads platform, which he then ran for another four years. He also helped build and scale the Facebook messaging system, the profile, the timeline, Facebook groups, and even the internal engineering boot camp. Most recently, he served as VP of ads and business platform, where he led engineering product, research, analytics, and design. And in 2017, he created the company's AR/VR organization, now called Reality Labs.\n\n(00:01:42):\nThese days, Andrew leads Meta's efforts in AR, VR and mixed reality, along with consumer hardware across Quest, Ray-Ban, Meta smart glasses, and more.\n\n(00:01:52):\nIn our wide-ranging conversation, we touch on so many important lessons and stories, what it was really like in the early days of Facebook, why you should be asking your manager for help more often, why communication is the job. Lessons from Meta's turnaround over the past couple of years, Boz's thoughts on the Apple Vision Pro, a bunch of leadership and career advice, what it was like to build the very first newsfeed, and lessons from that experience, and stories of failure and stories of success, and so much more.\n\n(00:02:22):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes, and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\n(00:02:32):\nWith that, I bring you Andrew Bosworth, a.k.a. Boz, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:04:55):\nThanks for having me. I've been a long-time fan of your program and all the things that you've been putting out, so I'm glad to finally get a chance to join.\n\nLenny (00:05:01):\nSame. I'm really excited to have you here. I have at least a billion questions I want to ask you. But I want to start with a few fun facts that I've found about you, and what if I go through them and then just pick one that stands out, and then tell the story behind it? How does that sound?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:17):\nAll right, sounds good.\n\nLenny (00:05:18):\nOkay. You went to 14 proms.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:22):\nYeah. It's true.\n\nLenny (00:05:22):\nOkay, I'm going to keep going. Okay.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:25):\nWow, that's a strong opener.\n\nLenny (00:05:27):\nThat might be the one. You were a national Taekwondo champion in college. You were Mark Zuckerberg's TA in college in a class on AI, which isn't actually how you landed at Facebook, from my understanding. Harvard was recruiting you to play football for them. You were very active in the 4-H Club, and you raised animals and showed them at county fairs when you were growing up. You once shared a stage with David Copperfield.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:05:52):\nThat's true.\n\nLenny (00:05:52):\nMC Hammer once told you that your outfit was stylish. And president George W. Bush complimented you on your shoes and the shine of your head.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:06:03):\nYeah, these are all true. I want to say, wow. First of all, I got to make sure that people understand, I was a national collegiate champion, in as a green belt, which that's like being the JV champion. Just so everyone's clear on what that is.\n\nLenny (00:06:15):\nW's a W.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:06:16):\nHeavyweight sparring. I'll tell... The prom story is a funny one. It's related to the 4-H story. I was a big-time 4-H'er, National 4-H Hall of Fame, did all this stuff there.\n\n(00:06:29):\nAs a comeup to that, 4-H is a wonderful program, youth program, it's coed program, and I was all over the state, all over the country, doing leadership events and doing these conferences, and doing a lot of public speaking.\n\n(00:06:39):\nAnd almost every 4-H event has a dance. People don't know that. At the end of a conference, at the end of the, literally camp, you'd go camping for a week, at the end there's a dance.\n\n(00:06:49):\nAnd so, as a consequence, the most important thing, if wanted to go to a lot of proms, I was a good dancer. And it turns out, the high-level bit, at least in the 1990s, for girls selecting who they might want to go to prom with was, will he and can he dance? And the answer with me was yes. And combine that with the fact that I knew a bunch of girls who went to different schools, that's the recipe for success right there, if that's the goal that somebody has. Two my junior year and 12 my senior year. I once went to three in one weekend, a Friday, a Saturday, and a Sunday night.\n\nLenny (00:07:21):\nAnother fun fact about you is you were basically the 10th engineer at Facebook, initially, way before it was a clear success story. I imagine there was a lot of pain and suffering and struggle that people don't often hear about those early days. They see a movie like The Social Network. It looks like, \"Oh, that was so much fun. I've got to start a company. It's going to become a trillion-dollar success story.\" I'm curious just what those early days were like. Are there memories that stand out to you?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:07:47):\nYeah, there's a bit of a joke in the 10th thing, which is me and five other guys all joined at the same time, and there was nine engineers before us. We joined the same day, so we're all the 10th engineer. So, somewhere between 10 and 16, depending on how you want to do the numeration on that.\n\n(00:07:59):\nI've written about this in my blog, and I tell this story a lot, which is it was fun, and there was tremendous camaraderie and memories that were formed, but they were formed in a kind of forge of really intense times.\n\n(00:08:13):\nAt that time, almost all of us lived within one mile of the office. We ate most of our meals together because we were working, not to say we weren't also friends, but because we were working, it's like, oh cool, you just roll into a meal and roll back into work.\n\n(00:08:26):\nAnd there's little things that you don't appreciate, which is like there was nobody to help you. There was no expert. And so, it wasn't like, \"Hey, I'm struggling with this one tricky problem. Who should I talk to?\" It's like, nobody. You should talk to yourself and figure this out. Or it's like, \"Oh, man. My servers are out of capacity.\" It's like, \"Cool. You should go to Fry's Electronics, you should buy a bunch of components, you should build a new server, and then you should run it. Maybe drive into the colo, rack it, and then get back and run it.\"\n\n(00:08:52):\nPeople really undervalue the fact that when you go to work, even a moderate mid-size corporation today, especially with the tremendous growth of startups supporting startups, things like payroll and finance and IT and HR, these things are professionally handled in many cases.\n\n(00:09:10):\nThat was just not the case in the early 2000s. It was just you, and your personal car, and whatever you wanted to do with your time.\n\n(00:09:18):\nSo, I don't want to take away from the romanticism of it, it's just that it's most often we hear those romantic stories from the successes. We so rarely hear somebody who went through really sacrificing a lot of my 20s from any kind of social or outgoing, fun environment.\n\n(00:09:37):\nIt paid off for me, so no one feels bad for me, nor should they. But there are other people who do the exact same thing, maybe they worked harder, maybe they were smarter, maybe they did better, and it didn't play out for them. And it's a big sacrifice.\n\n(00:09:48):\nAnd so, I love the enthusiasm for startups, I love startup culture. I think it's a healthy thing for people to want to throw themselves into something and take that risk. But it is not glamorous at the time. In retrospect, it's like, \"Oh, it can be...\" We have a little halo around it. But at the time, it doesn't feel glamorous.\n\nLenny (00:10:06):\nYeah. In this post you mentioned, you said that you worked 120 hours per week.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:10:10):\nYou had no hobbies, and you gained a lot of weight.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:15):\nYeah. We drank a lot to make up for it, so I gained a lot of... And you weren't eating healthy. It was crazy.\n\n(00:10:22):\nI think I've told this before. There was a time where one of the first things I built was an anti-spam, kind of anti-scraping defense mechanism. But we didn't have any ops support. There was no 24/7 online support.\n\n(00:10:35):\nSo, I built this tool. I had to wake up every four hours. For about two years, I didn't sleep for more than four hours at a time. I had to wake up every four hours and check the report, and to see if anyone was attacking the site. And if they were, I was up, and I had to go battle back. And if they weren't, cool, I'd go back to sleep. But that's the thing, they don't tell you about that stuff in the movies.\n\nLenny (00:10:55):\nThat's almost worse than having a kid, a newborn.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:10:59):\nAnd nobody asked me to do it. Nobody even asked me to do the anti-spam, anti-scraping stuff. I just thought it was a problem, and I went and did that, and that was the solution I come with. If I was a better engineer, maybe I'd have solved a better problem.\n\nLenny (00:11:11):\nSo, maybe just to close out that thread, when you talk to founders, what advice do you give them along these lines?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:11:18):\nI want to be cautious about this, because what I tell founders... The first thing I tell founders is that I've never been a founder, and I want to recognize the difference. I joined January 9th, 2006. That's almost two years after Mark started the company. I wasn't involved with fundraising, I didn't have to do any of that side of the things, and I didn't even have to deal with the board or the business side of things. I really was lucky, in a way, to have joined when I did.\n\n(00:11:42):\nBut the first thing I tell founders is like, \"You should take my advice with a grain of salt. I have not actually been in your shoes.\"\n\n(00:11:47):\nIf I can compliment you, really, one of the things I like about your program is, there's a whole system of professionals in our industry. And when I grew up in technology in the valley, you always heard about the ACM, right? The Association of Computing Machinery. You heard of these legendary professional organizations that supported people in our fields.\n\n(00:12:09):\nAnd by the nature of the rapid pace of change in the technology, and the nature of the engagement of those institutions, even academics, even academia broadly, kind of are out of touch. The tools that you got from those places weren't useful in our field.\n\n(00:12:23):\nSo, I do think the mentorship that we give each other has been a critical and sustaining resource. There is, today, now, resources like your podcasts and your newsletter that are actually really designed to help people who are professionals in our industry in a way that is almost kind of missing for 15, 20 years, and I love to see that. Because if you're an up-and-coming [inaudible 00:12:45], literally you used to have to know somebody and ask them a question.\n\n(00:12:48):\nAnd so, a lot of times what I'm helping founders with, I can help them with the strategy, I can help them think through the technology choices, I can help through business, I can think through the management, the organization structure. But I also try to be very clear, there's a bunch of stuff that I just was never exposed to.\n\n(00:13:00):\nSo, even as we just talk about how tough it was for the average engineer joining Facebook in 2006, man, it was even tougher for Mark Zuckerberg in 2004, probably. And that's a story that's been told, I'm sure, but still. So, I think these are both... It's almost all scale and variant. No matter how far you dial back, the challenges are interesting and are worth talking about.\n\nLenny (00:13:22):\nOne of maybe your most popular posts is this quote that you share about the advice you often give. What you say is, \"The advice I find I have to give more frequently than any other in my career, as a manager, a board member, an advisor and a friend, is for people to more directly leverage their leaders.\" Can you talk about that and what that means, and what that looks like?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:13:40):\nIt's such a normal and natural healthy thing. And by the way, we do it in our personal relationships. Like I said in the post, we want to do it ourselves. We want to do it ourselves to prove to everyone that we can do it ourselves.\n\n(00:13:52):\nAnd we think in our heads, \"If I ask for help, haven't I already given up that goal? Haven't I just admitted defeat on one of my top level goals, which is to demonstrate that I can do it myself?\"\n\n(00:14:04):\nBut what so often we forget is, more often than not, your job is not to do it yourself. Your job is to get it done, is to have the thing done, done well, done right, done competently. And a lot of times, the tools that you need to do that live with your manager, with your partner, with your advisor, with your mentor. That's where they live.\n\n(00:14:25):\nSo, how many times as a manager have I gone through, and somebody's told them, \"Here's the job.\" They're like, \"I got it.\" They go off, they come back, it's done, it's wrong. And I'm not blaming them for it being wrong. They didn't check in with me. They misunderstood. We miscommunicated. I'll take the L on that. That's no problem.\n\n(00:14:42):\nBut here we are, six months later, it's not done right because they misunderstood the brief. We miscommunicated with the brief.\n\n(00:14:49):\nOr they come back, and it took a year. And I'm like, \"Why did this take a year instead of six months?\" And they're like, \"Oh, man. I had all these things I had to deal with.\" Where, if they had emailed me, I could have bulldozed that stuff. I could have cleared the path. I could have said, \" Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry about that. This is the thing.\" And then we'd have been done six months sooner, and they would've been less frustrated. And so, light touches.\n\n(00:15:09):\nNow, I do think as a manager we also have a job to say, \"Hey, that's kind of the work, so you got to kind of go figure that out.\" And one of my things I always tell my managers, one of the most powerful things we do is refuse to rule. Someone will bring me a thing. A lot of times we feel obligated to weigh in and help. I'll be like, \"Nope, but look, I think you've got it. I think the challenges you're facing are the right challenges. I think you're approaching it in the right way. Just do your best there.\" And that's what it is. And so, there is a responsibility as well for those of us who are leaders, mentors, advisors, board members to do that.\n\n(00:15:39):\nBut, by the way, we do this... Personal relationships. You're with your partner, and you're trying to do something the right way, but you're not talking to them about it. You're just taking a huge risk there, and for very little reward. They're not going to be mad if you ask them, like, \"Hey, is this how you wanted it done? I don't know.\"\n\n(00:15:56):\nAnd so, I do think it's kind of funny how much we build these castles in our mind, these little silos that keep us from engaging the structures that are built around us, that are designed to help us succeed. I saw this great quote, actually just yesterday. I saw Patrick Stewart, who is one of my favorite actors of all time, and whose characters I love, and he talked about people going on casting calls. And this is a brutal thing for actors, right? You're going on 30, 40 things, you're getting rejected. It's tough. Everyone's kind of heard about this. And he said, \"No one wants you to succeed more than the person you are auditioning for, because they want you to be awesome. Because as soon as you are awesome, they're done. They want you to be amazing.\"\n\n(00:16:37):\nThat's like your manager. Nobody wants you to be more awesome than your manager does, because when you're amazing, your manager, his life gets easier, her life gets easier. So, I just think that's the mentality we get into is like, \"No, no, no. They're testing me.\" They're not. They are rooting for you. I promise you that.\n\nLenny (00:16:53):\nI love that advice. I imagine the reason people don't do this, as you said, is they don't want their managers to think they don't know what they're doing, or they can't solve it. Do you have any advice and guidance for when it makes sense to go reach out and ask?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:17:06):\nOne of the things I think, for people who are timid about this especially, is I think you can put a framing around it that's really easy for your manager to engage with. You can say, \"Hey, I'm making progress on this. This is what I'm blocked on, this is the current program.\" And I'll even say, \"Hey, if this all looks good to you, no response required. If there is something here that you want me to do better, different, that you think you could help with, let me know.\"\n\n(00:17:32):\nI love a typed, five-, 10-sentence email, \"No response required. Here's where things are.\" Even if everything is going really well, I'm like, cool, this person understands the urgency, they understand the assignment, and they're giving me a little heartbeat, a little ping back.\n\n(00:17:53):\nAnd then also, if two weeks later, let's say the blocking issue is bad, then you say, \"Hey, I am sorry, but I do actually need your help now. I'm actually blocked on this thing.\" I have the context. I have a mental model of you toiling away on the right thing, on the thing I asked you to do over there. Even then, when you're blocked, you can make my life super easy. Like, \"Hey, what I'd love for you to do, if you could send an email to this person, here's a draft with this thought, that would help.\"\n\n(00:18:23):\nOr it's like, here are specific questions framed up. \"I think this is what you want. Is this right? Yes or no? If no, okay, we'll come back and we'll spend more time. If yes, we're all good.\" So now, not only am I up to speed, I have a mental model, I'm engaged. Also, you've made it super cheap for me to help you. And people are always surprised. People who work for me are always surprised when I tell them how big a part of my job is doing these little types of things.\n\n(00:18:53):\nIt's a little spinning plates at my scale. I've got 10,000 or 15,000 employees, depending on how you want to count different things. And so, you're just like, every now and then I got to get a whole new plate, a whole new rod, and just really put the effort into it. But for the most part, I'm just trying to touch everything and keep the momentum going. And so, if something falls, and somebody didn't tell me that \"Hey, we're losing rotational velocity here. We're losing momentum.\" Oh, I'm bummed. I'm like, \"Ah, now that plate fell. I got to start a whole new thing over here now.\"\n\n(00:19:22):\nSo, I think people underestimate. They think of my job differently than my job actually... My job is actually tons of little touches.\n\nLenny (00:19:29):\nSo, I think a key takeaway here is, one, index more towards asking your manager and leaders for help. And I love this way of framing it of, it doesn't always need to be like, \"Here's what I need from you.\" It's, \"Here's what's happening. Here's things that might be blocking me. Here's questions I have. Here's things that are going on.\"\n\n(00:19:44):\nThis is actually similar to something I found really powerful that I'll share real quickly, this idea of a state of... I call it the State of Lenny email. And I sent this email to my manager every week. The State of Lenny. It's kind of like State of the Union. And it's, \"Here's my current priorities, here's what's on my mind broadly, and then here's blockers that I need your help with.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:20:02):\nWe actually used to have a format for that we called HPMs. Highlight, people, me. And every manager at Facebook from like 2008 to like 2014 would send to their manager, or even their leadership group. I mean, at one point when I was running what we called comm apps, I just sent it to Zuck and the whole leadership group.\n\n(00:20:24):\nIt's like, what's the highlights include? And it highlights [inaudible 00:20:27] flow. What's the big ticket things you need to know? Where are people? Like is somebody in trouble? Is somebody at risk? Is somebody doing really amazing work that needs a shout-out? And then me, how are you personally doing? HPMs, we called them.\n\n(00:20:39):\nActually, it's funny. I hadn't thought about that in a long time. But yeah, no, I think this kind of thing can work. And look, every manager is different, so even at the Meta level, by the way, is another success. I think what people do is they want to treat every manager the same, and that's not going to work because every manager is different.\n\n(00:20:54):\nBut every manager, you can ask, \"How do you like to get updates?\" You can ask them when you first start working with them. Like, \"Hey, what's your cadence? How do you like to stay informed?\" And so, for me, I do regular one-on-ones. As the org's has gotten bigger, those have gotten more distant, so people have replaced those with more written things.\n\n(00:21:11):\nBut no manager will get pissed at you if you're like, \"How do you like to get information about me?\" That's a totally reasonable thing to ask.\n\nLenny (00:21:18):\nI love the specific idea you shared of just drafting the email to say the other team leader, \"Here's what I need you to tell them. That would really unblock this thing.\" And that's such a cool idea.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:21:27):\nBy the way, I always put my own... I don't take that copy paste it. I'm always looking at that and be like, \"Okay, I understand.\" A lot of it is actually not about what you want the other person to hear, it's about the voice, the tone.\n\n(00:21:41):\nIt includes a lot of history. I don't know. Have you been going back and forth with them for 12 rounds, and this is going to feel to them like I'm really coming over the top? Or is this like, \"Hey, first time you're hearing about this, my bad. Here's what we're doing. Need your help.\"\n\n(00:21:54):\nSo, a lot of that isn't even about making my life easy because I want to copy paste. A lot of it is, actually, there's a rich set of information in how you tone and how you draft that note that's going to help me land it correctly and not feel like I'm just out of band, heavy coming in.\n\nLenny (00:22:11):\nThis touches on something that I often hear is very core to the way Meta works, which is transparency. Anyone can ask Zuck questions at the Q&A's. People are encouraged to post constantly internally of what they're thinking, what they're working on. All the data is shared publicly. Which often leads to leaks, which I hear you hate, and that is a pet peeve of yours.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:22:32):\nJust feels like a violation of the team trust. Just feels like... I grew up with playing sports, right? I was football, soccer, track. And you just can't imagine one of your guys calling out the play to the other team. Can you imagine what you would do in that case? \"You're off the team. I'm sorry, you can't be here.\" Anyways, sorry. Carry on.\n\nLenny (00:22:48):\nYeah, and there's so many more people, it's hard to find. Who is this? So, with this downside as an example, and I imagine there's other downsides also takes a lot of work, and it puts people on the spot a lot of times, what have you seen as benefits and why is that such a big part of Meta's way of working?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:23:05):\nYeah. This kind of comes back to, I think, the principle that really good, talented people, you want to leverage them fully. You really want to make sure that they are fully leveraged. And so, anytime they have the wrong information, or they don't have the information, you've now blocked one of the economically most valuable things that your company possesses, which is this person's time, attention, talent. Not only that, you've also made them more frustrated, and now they are more likely to leave.\n\n(00:23:35):\nIf the lifeblood of any company are the people inside of it who collectively commit to some kind of a goal and a mission and work together, then you want to maximize that potential. And creating this really open information ecosystem is one of the ways that we do that. So often, great, phenomenal work that has happened at our company has not come from this one top-down mandate, but has come from people understanding not just what we're trying to accomplish top down, but also having way more information at their disposal to be able to act on it.\n\n(00:24:16):\nPeople talk about top-down or bottoms-up culture, and it's a bit of a myth, in my opinion. If you've ever met Mark Zuckerberg, it's not a bottoms-up thing. The ideas that we're pursuing are Mark Zuckerberg's ideas, first and foremost. That's not to say that he's not open to new ones, and of course he is, and that's a form of bottom-up, people can bring ideas to him and he internalizes them and acts them or not. But when he brings things top-down, he's not micromanaging, he's in the details. I'll be careful on that.\n\n(00:24:44):\nBut he does create the space for you to bring back three or four versions of the thing that he's talking about, and then he shapes it from there. And you can't do that if there's... If you don't have degrees of freedom, sure, but also if you don't have the information. Otherwise, if you don't have the information available, what we're trying to accomplish, why we're trying to do it, what the infrastructure is like, what the availability is like, what the performance is going to be like, well, you just are stuck. You're just going to have to follow the script. That's very boring for high-talent, high-creativity, high-engaged people.\n\n(00:25:15):\nNow, it does come at a tremendous price. You have to get really good at managing information on the incoming. Most people at most companies consume all the information that's given to them, but the information itself is carefully managed. They're getting all the information they're intended to get.\n\n(00:25:32):\nWe've turned that on its head, and it sounds great, but it's not free. Even somebody senior coming from outside of the company to the company, one of the things I have to coach them on is, how do you find signal amongst all the noise?\n\n(00:25:45):\nYou have to have a system for managing your information. You have to have a system for triaging the incoming, getting rid of a bunch of stuff that is on the wrong channel, or it doesn't matter to you, figuring out what's the... groups that you want to be a part of, but you consume only when you choose to and-\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:26:00):\n... groups that you want to be a part of but you consume only when you choose to. And where are the things where you're getting push notice? Like that's the real time thing, and that takes some time.\n\nLenny (00:26:08):\nThis point you made about bottom up versus top down is really interesting, because, when I think of Meta, I think it's a very bottom up culture. I hear everyone comes up with their ideas, runs experiments, is very encouraged to just try stuff, and it's really interesting to hear that. And it makes a lot of sense that most of the big ideas actually do come from the top.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:26:26):\nIt's of these mythology things. I don't think it's the wrong... As a contract, it's more bottoms up than many other companies, because you do have these degrees of freedom within the construct. But make no mistake, like Mark or me or Chris Cox or Javi, they have very strong opinions about what we should be doing as a company, and your bottoms up-ness works within that framework. But it is true that you can ask Mark any question, and he's going to answer it. Same with me, same with Chris, same with Javi and also that we certainly take inspiration from the discussion that we have with employees. So I don't know, it's just not as black and white as people tend to paint it.\n\nLenny (00:27:02):\nI think one of the biggest lessons here is making it at least feel like you have a lot of say, even though a company is very, \"Here's the big strategic [inaudible 00:27:10],\" you're very good at making people feel like they can have an impact and a say.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:27:14):\nAnd can I tell you, the most important thing is just giving people clear guidelines so they know where they... Like, \"Where do they have space and where do they have no space?\" One of the things that we go in these reviews with Mark or my team with me I'm sure, and I'm like, \"For this part of the UI, it is going to... Like, I will draw it for you. It's going to be like this.\" And this other part. I'm like, \"Cool, that's important, too. I don't have a clear vision of it. Why don't you do it?\" So there's just really clear guardrails of like, \"Okay, where are we just on assignment? And where do we have more flexibility?\"\n\nLenny (00:27:45):\nIs there an example of that that comes to mind where you were just very in the details and drawing the screen?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:27:51):\nOver the course of time, there's been quite a few examples. I think early on, when we were working on News Feed, mark was absolutely whiteboarding every single pixel that the team had to put on the front end. On the back end, he was like, \"Make it rank, have some ranking.\" So I felt like I was lucky there. I was just like, \"Cool, I'm off to the races on some ranking stuff.\" And Chris Cox and all these other guys are having to really pixel-match these things. But it's not always that way by the way. So now fast-forward and we're talking about ranking, it's not like Mark is always hands-off on that. When we got into modernizing our ranking systems, which we've done over the last five years, Mark was heavily involved and like, \" Hey, what's the mix shift and how are you weighing different things?\"\n\n(00:28:33):\nAnd so it can go both ways. For me personally, I've gotten really involved in some relatively esoteric things. I was really adamant, for example, that hand tracking and mixed reality make it into the headset. Let's just say that there weren't any supporters in the team. Obviously we had a hand tracking team, which is phenomenal, mixed reality team, but there was a lot of people who were like... They did not feel those features were going to be critical for this to become a mainstream device. I always believed that they were for ease of use and for... So I just really forced the issue and didn't give anyone any room and held really high standards for the performance benchmarks we were going to hit on the hand tracking. And teams told me it was impossible. And it wasn't. It did great.\n\nLenny (00:29:11):\nThis touches on something that comes up a lot on this podcast. And there's this debate between how in-the-weeds founders and execs should be, whether they delegate, empower, versus, \"No, we're just going to do it this way. I'm going to be very involved in every mock.\" And there's always this up and down that happens where it's like, \"Okay, cool, we're going to let people run and do their thing,\" and then things start to not work as well often. And then, \"We're going to take back control.\" You have just a perspective on when it makes sense to go deep, how founders execs should think about that?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:29:41):\nSuch a useless answer for founders, it depends on the weeds. There are some weeds that really matter and there's some weeds that really just don't, and I should say, that doesn't mean they don't matter at all. You have to do them, but they aren't the hinge upon which success or failure will happen. Yeah, there's people I really respect, Brian Chesky's been on and said, \"Look, the Airbnb is going to work only on the things that I can work on. It's that's the extent of what it's going to do.\" And that's a super extreme form of it. I have a lot of respect for him and how they're working things. I think that if you have great super talented people that you can trust who can own bigger pieces, that's one option. If there are ways to structure it so that you can check in effectively and make sure that it's on track, that's another way to structure it.\n\n(00:30:27):\nAnd there probably is still work happening at Airbnb, that has to happen, finance and accounting and HR, that Brian isn't personally managing. So there are clearly non-technical areas that we do. Or legal. There are areas that we do trust that this is happening at. And so I think a lot of founders regret delegating too much, from my conversations. And I totally get that. Or they delegated something critical that really turned out to be the most important thing. For me, the judgment is like, \"How do you, most important, determine what is what matters the most?\" And so Mark, we joke inside of Meta, to this day, we call it the eye of Sauron. When Mark has determined that the thing that you're working on is the most important thing, there is no detail too small for him to notice.\n\n(00:31:17):\nHe will be in a review, and in the same review. We'll be like, \"Strategically, I think we're off course. And also, this one pixel is definitely wrong. You have to fix that.\" That's a big range. Frankly, I'll be a little bit self-congratulatory, I pride myself on being able to do the same. And I think people who work with me often comment that the style of leadership that we have, and I think Chris Cox is the same, is where it's like we will go where hide a low on the things that matter a ton. And there's a bunch of other things that certainly matter. We're glad we're doing them, but either they have pretty clear roadmaps, pretty clear examples in the industry, or it's like that's a feature that you have to have but isn't going to determine success or failure. So getting it into rough shape and then iterating on it is fine. And so I think it really does depend on the weeds, how deep you want to get.\n\nLenny (00:32:08):\nIt's so funny, I use exactly that same metaphor, the eye of Sauron, when I talk about working on things that Airbnb that matter a lot to Brian. And my advice to people is, \"You don't want to be in that eye of Sauron for too long in your career, because you're just going to burn out if you're working on the most important thing all the time, but want to be close. You don't want to be in the Shire, but you want to be around the [inaudible 00:32:26].\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:32:26):\nThat's right. They're both... So I worked for years in ads. From 2012 to 2017, I ran ads in a business platform, this big ads group, and it was an area where certainly it was very important, but Mark had so many other things going on with the transition to mobile, he did kind of delegate it to me. And it was awesome, and it was so cool to have that kind of trust from him. And also, you're constantly terrified, because like, \"Mark does not know. What if this is all...\" My leads would be worried, because they just hadn't had a review with Mark in a while. And it's like, yeah, you suffer in the intensity of the gaze of Sauron. You also suffer in the shadow of its absence. There's no perfect place to be.\n\nLenny (00:33:09):\nThat's hilarious. I'm trying to think of the part of Middle Earth that is a metaphor for that.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:33:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:33:15):\nOkay, so you talked about the News Feed, which was one of your very earliest projects at Facebook. Here's a couple fun facts I know about the News Feed. One is that it was the very first algorithmic News Feed of its kind of any social network and maybe of any sort of product like this. And two, it was the very first AI code that was written at Facebook to rank the actual News Feed. So there were a lot of firsts, and clearly this became a huge deal. The News Feed is essentially what people think of when they think of Facebook now, but it was super controversial when it came out. People were very against this. They did not want to be sharing this much information with people, or so they thought, and then they realized eventually, \"Oh, this is actually exactly what I want.\" What did you learn from going through that experience of building something that people initially reject and then later realize that they actually do want this and this is exactly what they're waiting for?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:34:08):\nThis is a story that you tell a lot actually through your interviews, which is just like, \"You have to have conviction in what you're building.\" You're choosing your customers as much as your customers are choosing you, is one way I think about it sometimes, and one mistake that you do see sometimes startups make is they get an early cohort of users whose needs actually take them kind of orthogonal to a larger market. And so they become kind of held hostage by their earliest customers now. So time and time again, we've had a vision for what we thought this should look like, and it wasn't the thing we were delivering right now. And so people who were using the thing we currently had were not sure that that change was what they wanted. But we had a confidence that over time they would, and we're not always right, but in these cases we were right. Now News Feed was an easier case than people suspect, because everyone was outraged at the same time as they immediately doubled their usage of the product.\n\n(00:35:05):\nSo we had a few advantages there, which was, it was literally like everyone was like, \"I hate this so much.\" And they would refresh, refresh, refresh. And so we were like, Okay, wait, there's cognitive dissonance here between what the stated preferences and what the revealed preferences are in the economic sense. So News Feed was a little easier than people suspect, to us, to stick with. But people sometimes misunderstand that. They think, \"Oh, the lesson is don't listen to your customers. Not at all.\" And we certainly care a tremendous amount. And even with News Feed, we did actually screw some things up. I kind of always make this joke that it's almost like... You know when you're at the party and music's loud, you're talking to somebody and the music cuts out right when you're saying something at a super high volume, and so everyone in the party hears the last thing you said?\n\n(00:35:42):\nNow you were saying it in a public place, so it wasn't like it was a private comment, but you also didn't mean to broadcast it at that volume. We kind of did that to the entire user base. We took what had been wall posts, which sure, anybody could have gone to that profile and seen and then put it kind of on blast, on Main, as the kids say these days, \"Put it on Main,\" and someone's like, \"Ah.\" So we did that. I don't want to say it like... We did screw things up. It wasn't like, \"Oh, this is a clause execution.\" So another thing to know is like, \"When did you screw something small up, and when did you do something big up?\" When is the thing itself wrong, versus when were the details wrong? That is an art. That is a real art, and you don't always have user data to determine it like we did.\n\n(00:36:25):\nAnd so a lot of that is, \"Do you have a clear vision and intuition for what you expected to happen?\" And then what happened instead and can you diagnose the delta there? So in the News Feed case, we made a bunch of little mistakes. The thing itself was right, and I really am quite proud of the work we did there. Me and Chris Cox at the most core probably in the engineering side, which you saw as the PM, there was no ranked feeds before that. We did have some AI that I built before for the anti-spam, anti... things, but it was pretty rudimentary, but it was probably the first consumer AI that was in a website of that kind around content. And we built the most efficient monetizing surface in history outside of Search, I think. [inaudible 00:37:04] for those who are curious, I don't use monetization because I think money's the most important thing. I do think it suggests the economic power you've created, which I do think correlates very strongly with human utility. Although obviously I respect that some people may disagree.\n\nLenny (00:37:17):\nIn terms of the economic utility, the Venn diagram of Boz, of News Feed and ads, create $1 trillion dollars of value.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:24):\nIt's not-\n\nLenny (00:37:24):\nWell done.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:25):\nIt's not nothing, not nothing.\n\nLenny (00:37:27):\n[inaudible 00:37:27].\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:27):\nWe're proud of that work.\n\nLenny (00:37:28):\nYou have this quote in one of your posts about the News Feed where you said, \"It consumed me more fully than anything in life had ever consumed me. It opened up to me the truth that when you're passionate about something, you do better work, you do smarter work and you're, in order of magnitude, more productive.\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:37:43):\nThere's no substitute for it. One thing I've learned about myself since that post actually is just the degree to which I am somebody who is inclined to be passionate about things. And it's a gift that I'm lucky to have, and I understand that's not every person. And so actually the ads thing is a good example. When Mark told me to go work on ads, I was like, \" No, I don't want to. I don't think I have a passion for that.\" I had this idea of myself. I had a very strong identity of myself as this AI infrastructure product guy, and I was working in this space and nope, I was wrong. I just am a guy who gets excited about things. Once I get into ads, it's like, \"Oh, this is fascinating. It's a three-sided marketplace, and there's all these different...\" It felt like I was playing chess times in terms of the moves with the other players in the industry, and I was super pumped about that.\n\n(00:38:26):\nAnd then when he wanted me to work on hardware, I was like, \"No, I'm not. I'm a software guy. I'm a software guy, Mark.\" And now, I love this work. That's such a fascinating space that I've learned so much. So I do think that's right. I do think what I find something I'm passionate about that's good. What I have learned since then is to give myself a space to understand if I can get passionate about it. Now, there are parts of jobs that I've had before where I just never found the passion, and after six months I just have to move on. Literally it's like I'll either quit, get fired, I'm doing bad work, I don't care about the work. And so I do have a self-awareness. It's not that I can get passionate about anything, but I do have a pretty broad palette, it turns out.\n\nLenny (00:39:01):\nI think that's a really interesting career lesson of, \"Don't assume you won't be excited about something that may come up.\" Is there anything there that you'd share with folks of just like, \"Explore it, give it six months, see if you can get excited about it?\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:39:14):\nAbsolutely. So I have a very unusual career arc in some ways, which is I really almost changed jobs every six months for a long time. I was working on this integrity stuff with News Feed in the background. Then I was working on News Feed for about a year. Then I worked on site speed and infrastructure and detecting SAVs and issues. And then I worked on Bootcamp, and then I worked on messaging and groups. I had this really funny thing. I was kind of joking it was like, for those who are old enough to remember Karate Kid, I felt like I was painting a lot of fences, waxing a lot of cars, and at the end I knew karate. I was like at the end, at the end I had the payoff, because I'd gone through and I'd met a lot of people and I'd worked in these different areas and I understood different dynamics. Well, other people who joined in my cohort were getting promoted, but they were in a single track. They just stayed in one place and they got promoted, whereas I kept moving around. And it probably at some point early in my career felt like I was moving more slowly relative to my peers. And then when I finally turned the corner, really with the ads appointment, which I did for five years, I went vertical. I just like my career went vertical. And since then I've kind of been on that trajectory. And so advice I most often give people, for me at least, the lesson that I take from this, is I just was willing to learn aggressively. I would move because I wasn't learning enough. I was bored, and so I wasn't learning enough new stuff. And what was cool about finally getting to the ads job, and likewise in the job I'm in now, is those jobs, I learned a ton for five years. I'd never stopped learning in those jobs. You will occasionally find those jobs where they're super deep and you can just keep learning.\n\n(00:40:50):\nMeanwhile, a lot of my friends whose careers were on a better trajectory [inaudible 00:40:55] then earlier, they literally got bored of what they were doing, but they didn't have any place to jump to. There wasn't some other... They'd become domain specialists in a domain that they'd kind of exhausted for themselves. And maybe they'd even stuck around longer than they wanted to because it was comfortable or because the company wanted them to. And it ended up kind of being a hindrance to them in the middle of their career. And so for me, it's like, \"Jump into new things, give it six months. If it's not the thing, no problem. You just built a ton of new skills that's going to come in handy, I promise you that. Keep going.\" And likewise, when you do make that jump early career, optimize for learning, optimize for... Think about a compound interest. It's like the first 10 years of compound interest don't look that impressive. It's like after 10 years it starts to look good.\n\nLenny (00:41:43):\nI love that advice. It's similar advice I always give of, \"Variety of experience often ends up being the most valuable thing you build over time,\" just trying to bunch of stuff, doing some internal tools, maybe working on customer support, I don't know, trust and safety, user-facing products, infrastructure. I'm thinking from a PM's perspective, maybe an engineers, and other functions. One question along those lines. So we talked about the eye of Sauron and working on the most important thing at the company. Do you have any advice on how much of your career you should be working in that center?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:42:12):\nYeah, listen, [inaudible 00:42:12] being equal, I think there's two really good places to be. I think one is carrying a lot of water in areas that the company's not paying attention to but you are important. And it needs to be a lot. You got to own that stuff and really move mountains over there, because I promise you, as an executive, when there's a huge dam holding up the floodwaters, you respect the heck out of the person who is holding that dam up. You're like, \"You keep doing that, Atlas, that is good work over there.\" The second-best place to be, or maybe equally, is on the most important thing. And on the most important thing, that's where you get to the advice that Eric Schmidt gave Sheryl Sandberg, which is like, \"Hey, it's a rocket ship. Get on. Don't ask what seat I'm in. Just get on.\"\n\n(00:42:59):\nIf it's the most important thing, you're going to get a smaller piece. Everyone wants to be there. Get the piece. If it's the most important thing, get the piece that you can crush, kill, do a great job at and grow from, because you're going to get a ton of visibility, you're going to get a ton of experience. You're going to see what it looks like in the fire, in the fire, and that is invaluable. You will use that everywhere. And so I say that. That's at project selection time, but now I'll be cautious. Understand, projects that start in the fire, hopefully, are forged in some manner of metal that cools and is no longer in the fire, like God willing. And likewise, things like dams that are holding up floodwaters have a tendency to crack or break or floods overcome [inaudible 00:43:42]. So I think you do want to be at selection time in one of those two places, but then you also... You're going to stick with the ride.\n\n(00:43:50):\nAnd again, to my point, if you're not engaged, if you aren't doing great work, if you don't love it, then move on. If you've exhausted it, you used to love it, but you don't anymore, move on. If you still love it and you're engaged, great. That's cool. That's a great thing. You deserve to go from the forge to the dam and back over time. You don't have to always just keep jumping onto the latest fire. I tried to do that once, after the ad [inaudible 00:44:14]. Actually, so I spent six months and we built the first mobile ad product in 2012 and kind of saved the IPO, which had gotten pretty grim [inaudible 00:44:23]-\n\nLenny (00:44:23):\nYeah, I remember that.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:44:24):\n... that point. And I told Mark, I was like, \"This is so fun. Maybe you can just keep doing this, just putting me on the biggest fire every six months.\" And he turns to me, he said, \"Buzz, that's not a real job.\"\n\n(00:44:32):\nHe's like, \"I need you to stay here and usher this forward,\" which I did for the next four and a half years. And it was amazing. It was amazing. And again, I do give him such... It's funny, I'm going to get a hard time in this. One of our biggest critics as well as being one of his biggest fans. I have both those jobs, but today we're talking about stuff that I think Mark really demonstrates really well. And he did a great job of pushing me in my career to different places where I didn't think I could succeed. And he saw the opportunity that made it happen.\n\nLenny (00:45:01):\nWhat have you learned about that, giving Mark negative criticism, anything that he accepts? What do you learned about that?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:45:08):\nMark's voracious for all information and all points of view. One of the things that's pretty interesting, I talked earlier about how much, as a founder, I think especially, you have to have tremendous conviction. You just have to have a tremendous degree of confidence. And I think Mark is somebody who is maybe the strongest willpower of a person I've ever met, just in a pure willpower sense. One thing that's interesting about Mark is you'll give him feedback, he listens. He's a kind person to work for, so you'll give him feedback, and he'll listen. Truly. He'll most often tell you that you're wrong, why you're wrong. That's just like most often. And what will happen is... It's uncanny. It's like over the course of the next week or two, you'll just see shifts. And I don't think he's doing it...\n\n(00:45:55):\nI've always joked that the information gets to him. So much information every day gets him. And then at night, he re-compiles the whole world with all that information and comes back. And by the way, this is not just true about product work. In my head, I was thinking about product stuff where he was like, \"Hey, I think this product is doing this wrong.\" He's like, \"No, no, that's why it's not that way.\" And the product will start to shift. Also to give him feedback just on his own presence in a meeting or delivery, he'll be like, \"Oh, well here's why I did it that way.\" And then a couple weeks later, you'll get in a similar situation, and he will moderate how he shows up. So I actually find him somebody who's really satisfying to give him feedback. It really works. It's very effective, but you do have to take the long view on it. And he will have a... The things he did, he didn't do an accident. He will have a reason why he did them the way he did them.\n\nLenny (00:46:39):\nIt's a great example of strong opinions, loosely held.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:46:42):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nLenny (00:46:44):\nIt also makes me think, I think you used the compiler analogy. I'm thinking the model training. He's retrained his model overnight.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:46:50):\nYeah, that's right. It's funny. One of the things that's so funny about Mark is if you give him some feedback in the morning, the next six meetings he has, whether it's about that product or not, he'll ask people what they think of that feedback. He won't attribute. He's just like, \"Hey, what do you think about this in this product? And so you'll be in a meeting with him and you'll see him doing it. He'll come to the meeting with you about some other topic. He'll be like, \"Hey boss, what do you think about this product and this idea?\" And so he will, over the course of the day, take that little note and kind of pressure test it, and he loves to triangulate. Where are all the points of view on this that maybe you didn't see? So he really values a broad perspective on each thing that's being discussed, which is really fun.\n\nLenny (00:47:29):\nTrying to get more training data for his model. I get it.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:32):\nYou can't get me to call Mark an LLM. That's not fair. That's [inaudible 00:47:35].\n\nLenny (00:47:35):\nWe could all hope to be as smart as Mark. As you were talking, I noticed your tattoos, and it reminded me that you've got at least two tattoos that I'm aware of.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:35):\nOh, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:45):\nOne is of California, which I completely understand. California is a very special place, but you have this other tattoo that is just the words Veritas. Can you talk about what that's about and why that's important to you?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:47:58):\nThe funny thing about tattoos in general is I came out of high school, I was like... I don't know if there was an archetype for me, but I didn't drink until I was 21. I was a very rule-following person. I was like, \"Why are you going to get a tattoo, affect your body? \"Why would you dye your hair? Just let it be what it was.\" And some of this was I think I was somebody who was privileged and had a great deal of self-confidence in who I was and what I wanted to be, and that was fine. But in some ways I was also weirdly judgey about other people in a way that's kind of off- brain for me, certainly today it would be, but at the time, getting a tattoo is a big deal for me. I was like, \"Oh, this is just the vehicle for my life and you can do whatever you want with it. And it's not like a... It's something that you possess, and if you feel like if you want to decorate it, you can decorate it.\n\n(00:48:47):\nAnd so getting a tattoo was a big deal to me actually, and I completely shifted my mindset of how I thought about my body and how I thought about people's body and their presence and their time, maybe to some degree, even an understanding of mortality. Like, \"Hey, can't take it with you. It's all going to go...\" When you're 18, you think you're going to live forever, and by the time you're 22, a grizzled 22-year-old veteran, you're like, \"Ah, tattoo that bad boy up. It's all going down.\" And so yeah, that's why I got the Veritas tattoo, which is Latin for truth, which is... I will say it's a little cheesy, because it's also Harvard's motto. But I got it in a monotype font. This is the programmer's font here.\n\n(00:49:28):\nThe other thing that's interesting to me about tattoos was it's also part of a generational shift. We grew up in a time when tattoos were really seen by adults as gangs or bikers or sailors or certain types. Now my understanding, I saw a stat recently that more people in my generation have tattoos than don't have tattoos. And so I think we also just culturally shifted positions in a way that... I find richness of self-expression wonderful. I really think it's great. And so I'm here for all of it.\n\nLenny (00:49:56):\nMy assumption from what you're describing is, this idea of truth is very important to the way you think and work.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:50:01):\nMy reputation does precede me on this point, I'm afraid, which is... I think when I was young, I saw being honest... And I was wrong by the way. I saw being honest as kind of a get out of jail free card. You could say whatever you wanted as long as you're being honest. That's just not the case at all. I've written about this before, but by far my biggest professional regrets were me not being kind. And I used to think... I wrote this note a while back called Be Kind, where being nice, that's like patronizing, or telling somebody things that are half-truths or just getting by. And I'm against that. But being kind isn't that. Being kind is like, \"Hey, how can I deliver this feedback in a way that is actually productive and helpful, in a way that is going to help them and not cause them just to feel bad and helpless?\n\n(00:50:50):\nAnd I think I did that wrong a lot as a kid, as a young man. And so being honest is still a big part of my personality. No one would ever accuse me of being dishonest who knows me. And I think people understand and respect that I'm pretty direct, and if I have concerns or issues, I'm going to bring them up. I'm just much better at bringing them up now and expressing a true care and belief. I wouldn't bring it up if I didn't think we could do better, if I didn't think we could fix it, if I didn't believe in this situation. And so being honest is still a huge part of my identity, and I think that's something I'm very proud of. But I will say the contextualization of how I'm honest has changed immensely since I got this tattoo.\n\nLenny (00:51:29):\nThat seems reasonable. This touches a little bit on something I definitely wanted to talk about, which is one of your most classic pieces, and this is the way I first learned about you, is a piece that is called Communication is the Job.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:51:40):\nYep.\n\nLenny (00:51:41):\nI know many people have read this, many people haven't. I'd love for you to just talk about what this means and why this is important, why this is something that you wanted to share.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:51:49):\nYeah, it's one of the things that, especially if you aspire to be a leader... And leadership isn't management, and leadership isn't being the only person responsible, it's not even always the same as accountability. But if you want to have an impact...\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:52:00):\nIt's not even always the same as accountability, but if you want to have an impact on the world around you, it is exclusively done through the creation of artifacts or verbalizations that affect other humans. That is all there is. That's all there is if you want to have an impact, if you want to create some kind of a lasting change. And it could be in your little relationship, it could be in your team, it could be in your company, it could be in the world. It is down to communication. And so often you hear people saying, \"Oh yeah, I wrote that up a year ago.\" It's like, \"Yeah, but you did a bad job of writing it up a year ago, or we would've not wasted a year not doing it.\"\n\n(00:52:47):\nPeople always think that's, \"Oh, I had that idea,\" and that's means anything. It means nothing. It means absolutely nothing. Or it's like, \"Oh, I wrote this post.\" Well, you didn't break through with it. That's on you. It's not on the audience. People want to blame the audience. Well, the audience is just there. I mentioned this even earlier, and I hope people caught it, when I said, \"Hey,\" I give somebody a piece of work and they come back six months later and they have done the wrong thing, I'll take the L. I will take the L on it. It's not great for them. They'll be pissed they wasted their time, but like I said, that's my responsibility. I did not communicate clearly what I wanted, what the expectations were.\n\n(00:53:25):\nCould they have also helped themselves? Sure, they could have, and that's a thing that takes all sides. We should work on this problem for both angles. I have another post called Listening is the Job, which is the other side of this. But communication is the job is, I really believe... Actually, it's the relationship to this idea that came out of the US Marines and the SEALs of extreme ownership, which is... So whenever thing goes wrong, I ask myself, \"What could I have done differently in terms of how I communicated things for this to have gone better?\" Could I have set priorities better? Could I have set expectations better? Did I need to have a better metric that I pointed the team at? Did I put the wrong people on it?\n\n(00:54:04):\nBy the way, the thing I talk about is org charts are communication devices. They don't exist. There's not a physical string between you and your manager. They're just communication tools that are supposed to give people a rough sense of how things are organized and where to go with who. And so all these things are communication. Silence is communication, me not reaching out to you to check on you, to check on your project. We talked about the [inaudible 00:54:29] earlier. What does that mean? That means trust. That means responsibility. The absence of check-ins has meaning. You cannot not communicate. You are always communicating something with your face, with your clothes, with your body. What are you communicating?\n\n(00:54:45):\nI'll give you a funny example, which I hope we get to put in the podcast, because if you're watching this on video, you will have noticed that my camera cannot stop adjusting light. It's just constantly too dark or too bright. I'm trying a new camera. I'm a nerdy guy. I try a lot of camera gear, I try a lot of microphone gear. I love to have all the latest gadgets and gizmos, so I'm trying something new. It's not working. And in my head I'm like, what is this communicating about me? People are going to think that I don't care or that I'm not competent.\n\n(00:55:15):\nThat's what I'm talking about. And now, I felt compelled to explain it in the podcast so that I can communicate clearly that that's not the case. I really just think so much of what I try to do in my professional life is understand the mental model of other people. Where are they right now? And I mean specific people, like my managers or my key technical leaders, and I mean general people like teams, and I mean broadly just the average human. Where are they at in this conversation? And how can I craft my language, my presence, my persona, everything to usher them from where they are to where I want to get them?\n\n(00:55:52):\nAnd that requires me to have a very clear idea of where I want to get them, have to have a clear idea of where they are. And I want to tell you, it's not as much work as it sounds like. I think no one would accuse me of having this big fabricated persona. It's not that. But it is having tremendous empathy for where people are starting. That was the lead for me. All the rest of it, all the rest of how I show up in meetings trying to smile more, because I'm like a big scary guy, those things are little things that you work on and they become second nature and they're easy. The hard thing is just having the empathy for your audience and being, \"Where are they? Where are they starting?\" And when you miss taking responsibility for that, extreme responsibility for that.\n\nLenny (00:56:31):\nThere's so much good advice in that. There's so many threads I want to follow, but let's just follow this last one of trying to understand how someone is best communicated to. Is there an example to make that a little more real for people of just what you've done to, \"Oh, here's how I'm going to communicate with this person?\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:56:46):\nI'll give you a couple. One is multimodality. There's an old saying, repetition never spoiled the prayer. And I think most experienced communicators, whether they be writers, whether they be public speakers, talk about the importance of reiterating a point several times and in several different ways to make sure that people have a chance to internalize it. You want to use it, you want to say it directly, you want to use metaphor. And so for me, I will give an all-hands and then write a post with the content of the all-hands, because different people are going to respond differently to these modalities and are going to absorb information at different rates on these different modalities. That's a trivial one.\n\n(00:57:23):\nAnother one that I think of all the time is making sure that you address people's fears and concerns. People will not listen to you if they think you don't know what's going on. And so, one of my favorite things to do when we're talking about some kind of issue is right up top and say, \"Hey, let me be clear. This is the issue we're having. I know we're having it. I know what matters.\" And then I'll say the same thing that I would've said, but they would've literally ignored me, because how can they trust my conclusions if they don't accept the premise? You know what I'm saying? I think there's a whole piece there. Obviously when you're in person, it's a lot easier because you're reading facial expressions. Even on this, I'm reading you nodding on that. I'm like, \"Okay, he's with me.\" And then I throw in a, \"You know what I mean?\" Whereas if you give me a cocked head, I then bring a second example to try to drive the point home. But you build yourself up. Most people are going to realistically start in their careers trying to influence one or two people. That's where you start. One or two people. That's who you got to communicate with. Your manager, one teammate, that's who you got. And then you build up and build up and build up a skillset to do it at a larger and larger scale.\n\nLenny (00:58:36):\nI love so much of this advice. I think it's also helpful for relationships. \"Here's what you're upset about.\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:58:42):\nTotally, a hundred percent.\n\nLenny (00:58:43):\n\"Here's what I think we can do.\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:58:46):\nAgain, the work that I've had so graciously supported to do on myself at Meta with great mentors, Sheryl Sandberg, Mark Zuckerberg, a bunch of others and coaches absolutely made me a better partner and husband, and my wife. And then by the way, vice versa. Having kids and getting deep in the literature around raising children. Congratulations to you, by the way. Getting deep in that literature made me a better manager. Absolutely made me a better manager in terms of thinking about how people are managing their emotions and how to engage with them in those times.\n\nLenny (00:59:16):\nAmazing. We need a second edition of this Boz's Parenting Advice.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:59:19):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:59:20):\nAnd relationship advice.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:59:21):\nIt's all the good stuff. No bad kids, Lansbury, it's good inside, Dr. Becky. It's all-\n\nLenny (00:59:28):\nI like Dr. Becky.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (00:59:28):\nI really think that the modern parenting canon is really rich.\n\nLenny (00:59:33):\nAmazing, so much good content.

You mentioned this gadget and these cameras you like to play with. Let's talk about the Vision Pro and VR headsets. Have you tried the Vision Pro? Thoughts?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:00:57):\nActually, Mark and I tried it together and I want to say, first of all, when the headset came out, we breathed a little sigh of relief because the stuff inside of it didn't represent a fundamental breakthrough. Everything inside of it was something that we probably could have gone and done, with the exception of Apple silicon, which is a marvel, but it's worth nothing. Apple Silicon is like a 2X marvel when doing things like scaling display resolution is unfortunately a quadratic proposition, and so a 2X linear scaling advantage doesn't buy you as much as you might expect when you're trying to scale resolution. And so that was step one. But we still assumed at that price point, with their legendary attention to detail and polish, they probably produced a great product. And the line that I said actually my own podcast with Matthew Ball a week ago was, \"Look, I was prepared to come to market and say we have the best value headset. If you want an outstanding, best possible headset for the money, we've got it. It's the Quest 3.\"\n\n(01:01:55):\nAnd I was so thrilled when I tried the AVP next to Mark, we were like, \"No, we think we have the actual best headset.\" Now, we're not saying it's the best at all things. If you're sitting still and watching a movie a high-res movie, Apple Vision Pro is really great. It's really great. The resolution shines. The way they've tuned the pass-through shines if you're stationary and looking straight ahead. And they've done some really nice things with the UI. It's one of these things that we do get annoyed about, a mile aside, we get a little bit annoyed about as product people.\n\n(01:02:31):\nI know that this happens to all of us. It happens to Apple, happens to Google, happens to us. We have a bunch of internal things we've been playing with, which will at some point ship and we will be accused of having stolen them when we actually did not steal them. If you want, you can go see my Quora answer on the history of the like button where this happened previously, where we had built the like button internally before it was launched elsewhere. Anyways, it's a whole thing. This happens in our industry a lot, and I really shouldn't care as much. It's a little bit of my ego peeking through, which I should control and tamp down, if I'm being responsible.\n\n(01:03:03):\nThe beautiful UI polishes, they did a tremendous job with eye tracking. One of the things that's interesting about the eye tracking is, to do it the way they've done it, that's why you have to have the prescription insert, so it doesn't support your glasses. You have to get prescription inserts. They're expensive. And they can shoot the cameras that track your eyes through the lens as well as the light around it. Ours go from the side on the Quest Pro, and that allows you to wear corrective lenses.\n\n(01:03:27):\nAnd so different choices like that have trade-offs, but it's still cool. It's great that they got that in there. At the same time, our hand tracking is better. Obviously, the app library we knew was going to be better. That's not totally fair to them. They've just launched and they have small volume still, but I just find the comfort... The thing that really got me the most, the field of view is really small on the Apple Vision Pro. And some people are characterizing it incorrectly on the internet. They're doing a characterization up close to the lens. Once you factor in the eye relief, the distance between where the lenses are and your eyeball is, their field of view gets pretty narrow for almost all faces relative to ours, which I find distracting.\n\n(01:03:59):\nTheir displays are much dimmer than ours, and I find the motion blur really distracting when I'm in mixed reality use cases. And as I mentioned earlier in the podcast, I'm a huge mixed reality buff. I'm a huge fan of that potential for exactly the same reason that they are, by the way, which I think hands and mixed reality make it feel much more accessible to more people. I'm pretty glad we have the controller in our set though, because it really expands what you can do. And we don't just operate our computers with just one thing. We have a keyboard, we have a mouse, we do multiple modalities all the time. I really feel like the comfort, the lack of persistence and motion blur in our pass-through, the brightness of our displays, I was like, \"Oh man, if you gave me one to take, I would take Quest 3.\"\n\n(01:04:40):\nNow, people have rightly said, \"That's pretty biased.\" Of course it is. Go get your own opinion. But what kills me is most people haven't done that. They have not tried the Quest 3. That's what kills me the most. If you go and try Quest 3, ask yourself if you'd rather have seven of those, one for you and six of your best friends, or one Apple Vision Pro. I'm sure the answer isn't Quest 3 for every person. There are people for whom there are use cases that really fit their life, the Apple Vision Pro, I'm cool with it.\n\n(01:05:05):\nBut people don't even know that the Quest 3, you can do Remote Desktop. You can do it both through an app called Remote Desktop, which is very popular, or you can go into workrooms and you can have three monitors surrounding you streamed from your machine. I think some of this is just people have not even done the work. They haven't even tried it. I welcome all of you who think I'm biased to prove one way or the other what you think, but don't do it without putting the Quest 3 on and giving it through its paces, because it's a pretty great device. And you can do a lot with $3,000 extra dollars.\n\n(01:05:38):\nHow did they get away with that, by the way? We launched a headset that was $1,299 and people lost their minds about it. They're like, \"Ah, $3,500, it's fine. This is fine. No one cares.\" I don't know. Fairness is too much to ask, and I don't care about that. Apple has earned the great brand that they've built. They truly have. I think it's tremendous. I certainly celebrate a large number of Apple product. I'm a huge fan of their work. I'm a huge fan of what they do. That's probably why I expected more from the AVP.\n\nLenny (01:06:06):\nWell, I'll show you my favorite AR device, which is these Ray-Bans. I actually bought them.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:06:13):\nHere, I'll put them on it. Here, what I'm going to do is I'm going to record. I didn't tell you I was going to do this. I'm going to record this as we're talking. Look at this.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:20):\nI like that. They look so good on you too. This is a good fit.\n\nLenny (01:06:23):\nMy mother-in-law's like, \"You look so sophisticated. You look really smart with these on.\" And we bought these actually to film our kids, or our kid, instead of having Cameron's face. And it's been awesome.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:34):\nIt's really the best. It is so hard to look at a phone screen and have the real thing be in between you. No, the glass is the way to do it.\n\nLenny (01:06:43):\nLook at this, my new look. I'm just going to have glasses on all the time.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:06:46):\nWe got to get you the multimodal. I've been playing with that since December, where you can use the camera to ask a Meta AI assistant about things. It's really good. I was in a ski village recently with my family and I had them on. I'm just like, \"Hey, take a look. Tell what you see.\" And I had found a sign and it gave me directions. \"Hey, the bathrooms are down those stairs to the right. Do you want food? It's over to the right.\" It couldn't tell what village I was in, but it was like, \"You're in a ski village somewhere. Here's the amenities.\" And I was like, \"Wow.\" There's something real magical here.\n\nLenny (01:07:18):\nI feel like I need this for my podcasting interview so I could just have a little voice tell me questions to be asking and where I'm at.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:07:25):\nRight, totally. Yeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:26):\nHow helpful would that be?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:07:27):\nOkay, I'm going to cheat on this one and say, obviously we've been talking for a while, but playing with glasses that have full AR capabilities, and we've got one that has rumored to be coming internally soon, so heavily rumored in fact that you might even say it's almost been confirmed. And what's been really fun is being able to play with these time machines, really, in terms of what they are. It's amazing technology. People were giving us speeches, big company-wide speeches, and had all their notes on the glasses. And they could control the slides just using a gesture.\n\nLenny (01:08:05):\nOh my God.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:08:07):\nThere's exciting things afoot. The future's looking pretty bright.\n\nLenny (01:08:10):\nSomething that I wanted to touch on, which is when Mark put out this whole video of, \"Here's what I think of Apple Vision Pro versus the Quest,\" a lot of people are just like, \"Oh man, because he's putting out this video, he must be so afraid of what's happening and it's not the right move.\" What went into thinking? Was there strategic thinking there? Was it just him, \"Here's what I think?\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:08:29):\nThis guy does [inaudible 01:08:30] about the modern era. Everyone's in their Meta head about everything. Everything's a four-dimensional chess. That was just what Mark thought of the thing. That's what he thought about it. I think he wanted to make sure people remembered, hey, Quest 3 is literally a better device, and people haven't even tried it.\n\n(01:08:46):\nAnd so we're not always playing four-dimensional chess over here. Sometimes we're just like, \"Here's a thing that I believe is true. I'm going to say it out loud with my mouth.\" That's what he did. It's not that hard. When I do it, everyone expects it because of my persona or brand or whatever the thing is. I guess people are surprised when a CEO does it. All right, I get that. That's cool. There's other sets of societal expectations there.\n\n(01:09:08):\nAnd we're all familiar with Apple putting the Welcome IBM ad in the New York Times, and then Slack doing the same thing with Microsoft and the Ballmer iPhone comments. None of those were true discussions of the technical merits of a product. Those were all just big, rally the troops gestures. This is not that. Mark is deep. He's an expert in this stuff. I'm an expert in this stuff. I feel great about our choices.\n\n(01:09:39):\nBy the way, when I've used it, I could get myself completely into the head of the person who designed it. I can tell you from using it what instructions they were given, that team was given. I can tell you what they were optimizing for. I can tell you what constraints they were under. By all the choices they made, I can tell you all those things and I understand it coheres in that way. We made different choices. It shouldn't surprise anyone. We like our choices better. We could have made those choices. We didn't make those choices. We made these other choices.\n\n(01:10:06):\nAnd so for me, the weight, the wire, which just always brushes against my ear, the pocketable thing, I get it. That's not what I would've done, and I know that because I had the chance to do it and I chose not to. I don't know. I don't know why people are surprised. This wasn't some big, savvy strategic move. This was just, Mark's got a chance to use it. He's like, \"Oh man, I think we should tell people what the real story is here.\" And we did.\n\nLenny (01:10:34):\nI love that insight. And I know a lot of people watching are like, \"Oh, shit, he's right. Wow. I didn't think of it that way.\" And so I think it had a lot of that impact.\n\n(01:10:41):\nI want to zoom out a little bit and talk about Meta's journey over the past couple years. It feels like there is a huge downturn in public perception of Meta and the stock price, and then over the past couple of years there's been a huge turnaround. And it feels like there's always a lot to learn from these periods. Just as an example of the stock price, I was just looking at it, it was down to $80-ish, and now today it's $487.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:11:06):\nI'm curious just what you've learned from going through that downturn and turnaround. And I know it's still in progress, but just what have you learned from that journey?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:16):\nYeah. Well, there's a lot to take away, I got to tell you. I think we had the largest single day stock drop in history, followed 18 months later by this largest single day gain in stock market history.\n\nLenny (01:11:27):\nOh my God.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:11:27):\nAs the legendary Lou Holtz said, \" You're never as good as they say you are when you're winning, and you're never as bad as they say you are when you're losing.\" Mark has always brought that quote out to guide us internally to try to insulate ourselves a little bit from the vagaries of external opinion. And that's not just true with stock prices. That's true with media and press. It's true across a lot of things.\n\n(01:11:53):\nOne of the things I told my team, and I still have to repeat it to them, is, \"One of the things that's hard to remember when you're in it is that you know more than the critics do. You know more than the analysts in the marketplace do. You know more than the media does. You know more than the podcasters do. You know more than the Twitter does. You know more about what's real and substantial of value about our company than they do. That doesn't mean ignore them, because they have a different perspective and you need to understand it. Even if the totality is less than what you know, it may contain parts that you do not know.\" I'm a huge fan, I read the criticism of everything, and I read it very carefully, looking out for confirmation bias, looking out for things that I might be inclined to resist but are maybe true. I invite all critique, but I also don't accept the critique blindly. I don't just say, \"Yes, this is obviously true.\"\n\n(01:12:55):\nGell-Mann Amnesia is a great concept for everyone to understand. Gell-Mann Amnesia is this property where you'll read a newspaper article, let's say newspaper, why not, about a thing about which you are an expert, and you'll be baffled because here is an article that is not just wrong, it's inverted causality. Michael Crichton, I'll steal Michael Crichton's quote on this, \"It's a wet sidewalks make rain story.\" And you'll be like, \"What a terrible, bizarre story.\"\n\n(01:13:22):\nAnd then you will turn the page of the newspaper and it will be another article about a topic about which you know nothing, and you will read it as if it is the gospel truth. You'll figure it's, \"Oh, no, look at this information about this foreign situation.\" Like I said, perfectly true. We should be smarter than that. And so does that mean you don't read the thing? No, you read it. You just read everything with that perspective of, \"Wait a second, this is another point of view. And how do I integrate that into a whole perspective that I can have and be informed about?\"\n\n(01:13:55):\nThe first, the macro thing is taking the long view, realizing that when you're in the dumps, it's not as bad as you think, when you're at the top, it's not as good as you think. It's somewhere in between at all times. The second thing is communication is the job. We really did not communicate effectively, I think, with the market around our future investments. And listen, we've had two 10-year long huge investment areas. One has been AI, one has been reality labs. And AI's looking pretty good today. I can't think we can all agree with Lama 2, with Fair, the breakthroughs that we've had.\n\n(01:14:33):\nPeople don't notice that Fair, our AI research lab, is the second most cited research lab in AI behind Google. We've been doing this work. We didn't come here casually. We've been doing it, and so that's looking pretty good. I don't think we did enough to explain those best to people. Previously, the core business was going strong enough and they were willing to ignore them. And with the old Warren Buffett quote, \"It's only when the tide goes out, we see who's not wearing swimming trunks.\" And so when the tide went out, when you have the Ukraine war and an interest rate hike and recessions, now everyone's scrambling for that incremental dollar and they're like, \"Go get rid of this stuff.\"\n\n(01:15:15):\nAnd we had to tell the company, \"You don't want to work at a company that, when times are tough, kills all future growth and just shores up in the core business.\" That's a company that's just committing itself to dying at some point, a little later than expected, but dying at some point. You want to work at a company that has a balanced portfolio of investments, which we had. We didn't explain that well, and so we spent that time explaining that to the market, to the press, to everybody.\n\n(01:15:38):\nAnd now, I think as people understand the size of it and the scope of it, and of course it helps that the core business has overcome its challenges there from ATT and the other kinds of stuff, it's looking pretty good. I do think one part is, as an internal person, really moderating your attachment to the external narratives and swings, that's super important. And you do that based on understanding your own expertise. And the second part is understanding why is there a delta. What is there? And grab that. It's usually communication.\n\nLenny (01:16:10):\nThere's also a big flattening of the org. This was something a lot of people talked about, where managers became ICs. Is there anything more there that you've learned of just how to adjust the org to be more efficient?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:16:22):\nOf course, and I should have included that in the first section. I was a bit eager to wrap it up elegantly in the two. But you're right.\n\nLenny (01:16:27):\nI appreciate it.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:16:29):\nWe made significant shifts in how we operated the business, which was super painful. And listen, this goes back to the boom times of COVID, when it looked like there was a real lasting secular shift in things like e-commerce and in working remotely and these tool sits, which are exactly what we build, and it's primed us. And so we built up a huge workforce to pursue those opportunities. We still believe in those opportunities, but they're back on their original timeline. And actually, literally, if you look at a bunch of graphs that we have internally, it's literally the COVID boom and then, not bust really, but as it receded, everything's back on its original trajectory.\n\n(01:17:16):\nWe didn't lose ground or lose time, but the pull forward didn't happen. Well, that means your economics don't make any sense anymore. Now, you made a bunch of investments that are going to yield too distant in the future, and getting there faster isn't going to help you and you're carrying a much extra cost. That sucks, man. It sucks. And we don't feel great about it. We really don't. It's a business, it's awful, and it happens.\n\n(01:17:41):\nI do think one thing that was interesting about that time was, for those of us who grew up and saw the .com boom firsthand, I was born and raised in the valley, so that was all around me when I was graduating high school and going to college, and then in the 2008 major recession on the housing crash and on the market and all that stuff. Now, let's imagine you graduated college in 2009-\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:18:00):\n... all that stuff. Now let's imagine you graduated college in 2009 and got a job. Well shoot, you're 15 years in your career, you could be a director and you've never seen a downturn. I think we also had, in addition to what was very unfortunately conventional mis-forecasting in the business that caused us to over hire, that we had to correct for. You also had a workforce that was just not at all of a mentality that this could ever happen. This felt like it was an act of God when in fact it's like a cyclical nature of all businesses that this will happen at some time and you hope it doesn't and you wish it didn't, but you have to deal with it. And so I think we have a bit of a tough storm there for the whole industry and we're still feeling it. I think we're still feeling it.\n\n(01:18:45):\nCertainly we're happy at Meta to be beyond that point and we're growing again and executing at a stable rate and feeling really good about that, but quite a few of our other companies in the industry. And it's a very uncertain time for engineers, for PMs, for designers, for everyone and all the support functions around them. I'm super sympathetic for that. I think obviously the mis-forecasting that happened inside of Meta's walls happened everywhere and now that you have, especially with higher interest rates and cash isn't as cheap, runways are tighter. People are just making those pragmatic calls. I think we'll rally back from this. I think this is a normal thing that happens to industries, but it doesn't reduce my sympathy and empathy for those who have been affected by it or who live in fear of it.\n\nLenny (01:19:29):\nI was talking to a friend who works at Meta and I was asking them what it's like to work at Meta and she was just like, \"It's intense, and it used to be more chill. There were people that were coasting here and there,\" and now she's like, \"No, all those people are gone now. It's just only the intense people left and we're working really hard.\" Does that bring up anything?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:19:48):\nYeah. I don't want to comment on people who left. People left Meta for all kinds of different reasons and likewise role elimination happened in many cases because we just decided not to do this work at this point. We were going to do it two years from now and don't need to carry a team to do it. I think it's really hard to generalize because each of these is a specific person with a specific life and a story that is rich and deserves to be told. But I do think that if there was somebody coasting and you as a manager have to make tough calls on who you're bringing in which way you're going to bias my profound suspicion, and again, I don't know your friend who you spoke with, my profound suspicion is that person's probably already working hard. You know what I'm saying? That person's already probably working hard. I don't think we changed how hard any individual worked. I really don't believe that.\n\n(01:20:35):\nI do think there was a selection bias as to what was going to happen, and I think that's probably what you saw play. In fact, if there is a generality that can be found.\n\nLenny (01:20:43):\nMaybe as a last question, I have this segment where I call Failure Corner where I ask people to share a failure of their career and what they learned from that experience. Is there something that comes to mind?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:20:55):\nI've failed tons of times. I've built products that nobody used. I've built technical architectures that didn't scale. I've failed all kinds of times. I don't regret most of those. Almost every one of those I learned from. It was a stop on the path to a better solution or it was a recognition that this thing wasn't going to work ever, which is its own kind of a gift. All the failures that I regret, that I take seriously are personal failures where I affected a person in a way that I'm not proud of, maybe wasn't proud of the time because I wasn't in control of my own emotions or mood. I was feeling fearful, I was feeling scared, and there's a bunch of these one or two that stand out that I don't feel comfortable sharing because the person affected, I think would prefer I didn't share.\n\n(01:21:46):\nI'll share one that was... I think the person's and I are tight now. We have this really silly discussion. I remember it so vividly. In the early days of client server architectures, which Facebook obviously is a website, so you're calling to a server to get the webpage, but then that server is going to call the other servers to gather things and that was one of the major clients of remote procedure calls because newsfeed ranking was all done on this other set of servers that had its own special requirements and special build and how it was put together. And so your main web server would put a call-out over a remote procedure, call to the remote server and get a response back. And we had this really janky RPC system that, I won't say who built it, but it was built and it was just a piece of garbage constantly failing. It was not robust at all. And one of our best engineers, Mark Sleek, built a new one called Thrift. It was a great, really great RPC infrastructure.\n\n(01:22:47):\nAnd one of my best friends, Dave Federman, one of my really good friends and a brilliant engineer, we were talking about how to do the encoding and I was like, \"I want it to be binary encoding.\" I was like, \"You should binary encoding. I want it to be super efficient on the wire,\" because I'm storing these RPCs. They do two jobs for us, one of which is the active RPC, but I also store the RPCs in a log and replay them to do the work that we were doing in newsfeed ranking. That's how it was done back in the day. It was all kind of asynchronous offline and so I wanted to be as tight as possible. My memory bandwidth was very limited and memory was so expensive back then and Dave Federman was like, \"No, no, no, that's short-term thinking Boz, we should be using Linux style descriptors that are plain English language. Then you could look at the log, you can see what it is. It's possible memory bandwidth will get cheaper, but these logs being scrutable to development is going to be a better thing.\" This is nerd bait.\n\n(01:23:42):\nThose of you who have been engineers in this call, this is like Vim EMX. This is nerd bait. This goes deep. This is like a long old thing.\n\nLenny (01:23:51):\nI love it. Keep it coming.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:23:52):\nIt's a room full of engineers at the company and the company's not that big, and so there's probably half the engineers of the company in this room. I was yelling. Literally I'm turning red, I'm sweating. I'm so angry at Dave Federman for countermanding my proposal and I'm the major RPC customer. A couple things. This is so dumb. Mark Sleek just built two encoders. It's not that hard. You pick which encoder you want for your things. That's the easiest solution ever. Second thing is Dave was right, by the way. Within a year, the memory bandwidth definitely didn't matter relative to how inscrutable it was to try to get into these logs. I had to build a ton of extra custom software to parse the logs and understand what what's going on. But also it was a case where my identity was caught up in being right. And for those who don't know, identity threat is just the biggest... Your worst behavior is always going to come out when you think you're under identity threat.\n\n(01:24:51):\nWhen you feel like some core part of how you see yourself is in question, you will react with every ounce of your fiber to defend that conception of yourself because it's so expensive to reconceptualize who you are that you defend yourself. So my identity was being right. [inaudible 01:25:08] on the wrist. And it caused me to take one of my best friends, one of the best engineers I knew, a guy I literally lived with and getting a really embarrassing for me conflict, which everyone was just scratching their head like, \"What is going on with Boz right now?\" I looked like an unhinged crazy person. I remember the room, I remember where I was standing in the room. I remember everything about that moment and I had to go home and be like, \"What the fuck was that? What happened?\" I'm asking myself like, \"What happened there?\" And that was one of the many steps in the journey to recontextualizing what it was was not to be right and what meant to be open-minded and curious and how to engage in this competition.\n\n(01:25:47):\nI was 22. I don't make excuses for it now, but I remember there was a couple other examples like that in things that were less technical and more personal that I won't share, but I remember each of them vividly and those are the real failures for me.\n\nLenny (01:26:01):\nI love how this story is so long ago at this point and it's still stuck with you and such an impact, I think.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:06):\nOh, my god, I'll never forget that. It was embarrassing. And for those, that's the old quote, it's really one of the truest quotes, and I know it's cliche and sometimes cliches are cliches because they're good. It's like, \"People, they don't remember what you said. They just remember how you made them feel.\" That's all anyone remembers is how you made them feel, and I think in that room, I made people feel unsafe, maybe. It was bad.\n\nLenny (01:26:27):\nI like this concept of identity threat. They call this podcast episode identity threat.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:32):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny (01:26:33):\nBoz, we started this episode with a billion questions. I have a billion and one questions now. I wish we could keep going, but I know we have to wrap this up. Is there anything you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:26:46):\nWell, in the off chance that we do end up labeling this episode, identity threat, let me give you what really was... I made a lot of breakthroughs with coaching, learning about the feeling inside of my own body when I was feeling that identity threat and learning techniques and tactics to reduce the likelihood I would feel it and how to deal with it when it happened and how to repair when I did, I went through all that stuff. I would say the greatest lesson I learned would come years later and it was just from observing somebody. Ami Vora who was a legendary, long time came in and worked on our development platform, then worked with me on ads for a long time and then was the PM lead for WhatsApp for a long time. She's since gone on to do even more great things outside the company. Working with her, it was like watching an alien because her and I were so different in our approach and she approached...\n\n(01:27:38):\nShe could have the most profound disagreement with somebody in the world and they would say the thing that she thought was not just wrong, but crazy wrong and she would respond. She would say, \"Fascinating. You have to tell me more about why you think that.\" And I can't do it justice, she meant it from the core of her being. She saw this schism between her and that person and it could have been personal, it could have been professional, it could have been anything. She saw this schism and how they saw the world and how she saw the world and rather than reacting as if it was a threat that somebody saw it differently or rather than reacting afraid that maybe she was wrong and had done things wrong before, she reacted with the most genuine and profound curiosity. I just watched it absolutely tear down walls between points of view. People felt immediately her genuine heartfelt curiosity and would lean in and that would cause them to be open-minded.\n\n(01:28:36):\nAnd if she was right, which by the way she usually was, then they would leave being like, \"Oh, okay, I was wrong about that,\" but she also would change her mind and that was the key. Ever since then, I really have tried to model that. When I have a strong internal clinch, I try to embrace curiosity like, \"Wow, we do not see this thing the same way. That is fascinating. Tell me why you see that.\" And that can be by personal feedback. Someone's like, \"Hey boss, I don't think you talk enough.\" \"Wow, you don't think I talk enough? That is unexpected. I would love to hear more about that because no one's ever said that to me,\" so I wanted to give that to anybody who might recognize this behavior in themselves. There's lots of things that you can do and you should do that work.\n\n(01:29:22):\nThe work of improving yourself is always fruitful and satisfying and it pays off, as we discussed, in every aspect of your life with your family, with your friends, and professionally. This is one that I really thought was so great was just curiosity. Embracing curiosity in those moments of challenge has really completely changed my life and I owe that to Ami Vora.\n\nLenny (01:29:40):\nWow, I love this example. It's basically an example of, \"Yes, and?\", but in a really... no one's going to be like, \"Yes, and?\" It's a really nice way of saying it, \"Just fascinating. Tell me more.\"\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:29:50):\nFascinating. You've got to tell me why, I want to understand it.\n\nLenny (01:29:54):\nI love that. Maybe that'll be the new title, fascinating.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:29:56):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny (01:29:58):\nAnyway, with that, Boz, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:30:03):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:30:04):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:30:09):\nThe Dream Machine, which is a tremendous history of pre-history, really of modern computing ostensibly following the life of J.C.R Licklider, but really it's much broader than that, is a tremendous missing piece of history in my opinion. I think in my discipline, in computer science, we were not properly educated. We learned about Alan Turing and we learned about some of the technical underpinnings of computer science theory, but the modern computer and the path to it is a profound and fascinating one, and it has particular resonance today as J.C.R Licklider's observation was human in the loop computing and I think we are now in human in the loop AI, and I think there's a tremendous resonance there. The second one is Good Inside, which is Dr. Becky's book, and again, I think it's a tremendous parenting book, but more than that, it does contain lessons for how we think about our own emotions and how we manage those, which I find to be useful in any context.\n\nLenny (01:31:00):\nAmazing recommendations. She's also got an online community for people that-\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:03):\nShe has a wonderful online community, she's very engaged in it. And for those parents out there, you're a little early for this Lenny, but you'll get there. Having little scripts that I'm reading on Instagram that when I'm in a moment of tremendous emotional challenge with my children, I have the words handy. They're just top of mind for me. They've been cashed in, right? They're primed, is a big game changer.\n\nLenny (01:31:24):\nThis will be for our parenting episode down the road.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:27):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:31:28):\nIs there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:31:32):\nYeah. This is super conventional, but Mandalorian. One of the things that's been fun about that is really my kids again is we watched it with my kids, so we had a chance to go on the Galactic Star Cruiser. Again, y'all know I am a genuine and true nerd through and through. Huge fan of Scott Trowbridge and his work at Star Wars service lands in Disney and also of that. And so before that we got our kids who were nine and six and watched all the movies together, and then we were watching Mandalorian together as a family, and it's super fun and it's fun to have that kind of lore, a connection. So it's not just the classic kids movies, but there's something more, and I think for them they feel like it's an adult kind of conversation they get to be a part of. I've really enjoyed that. And I think the world of Dave Filoni and John Favreau and the team that's building that universe out.\n\nLenny (01:32:19):\nThis is the way.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:32:19):\nThis is the way.\n\nLenny (01:32:20):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:32:25):\nOne of the most important things that I always ask people is what people who've worked with them would say are their greatest strengths and weaknesses. I like this for a couple of reasons, not least of which is I often do follow up with references and I like to triangulate their awareness of how other people calibrate though. And also how they respond to criticism. Sometimes candidates surprise me. They say, \"Hey, you'll hear this critique a lot from me. I don't think it's fair.\" That can be an okay answer, but they've got to be a pretty robust there. Or it's like, \"Hey, this is something I'm working on, here's what I'm working on.\" But I also like to hear what they think their superpowers are. And too often a lot of attention in interviews is paid to weaknesses, which I care about because I want to know what the downside is. But way more important to me is like, \"What are you awesome at? What is the thing that if I can just hitch a wagon and ride, that's what I want to know. Where's the superpower that you're crushing it at?\"\n\n(01:33:22):\nAnd what's funny is people are pretty rarely give my reference checks. They're not that often accurate about what the critiques are, but they're usually pretty accurate about what their strengths are.\n\nLenny (01:33:31):\nInteresting. I'm also a huge proponent of strengths and not worrying too much about your weaknesses.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:33:36):\nBut asking people to contextualize their performance through the team, that's so important. We do not achieve very much on our own.\n\nLenny (01:33:44):\nCommunication is the job. Amazing. Is there a favorite product that you recently discovered that you love? And Meta products are acceptable answers.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:33:55):\nThe Ray-Ban Meta glasses would be a tempting answer. The multimodal stuff, which I'm going to get in trouble because I've been teasing this for months on social media and it's still a closed beta, and it's like, \"We're growing the beta slowly,\" but it's like, \"People already really badly want it.\" It was probably one of the most magical things I've gotten to try recently. It's not totally fair because it's also not you can buy the Ray-Ban Meta glasses and very soon, I won't say when, but very soon they'll have this capability, but it's more fun to think outside of the box. All right, this is such a... I'm going to get in trouble for this answer because it's a bit of a pretentious one. I'm not a car guy, let me say that right now. I don't like cars. I don't care about cars. I want a car that works and doesn't break. All my cars growing up, had over a hundred thousand miles in them because we only ever had used cars.\n\n(01:34:38):\nThey were constantly breaking down and the power steering would go out while you're driving and you have to [inaudible 01:34:43] the thing and the brakes would go out or you'd throw a rod. I've done it all. I just wanted a car. And so then I drove a Honda Accord that I bought for 10 years and then I drove a Tesla Model S for 10 years. And a Tesla model S had a thing happen to it while it was parked, I will get into that. I get a new car and again, I'm like, \"I want to get an electric car.\" And I was like, \"I'm going to get something nice. I'm going to get something nice. I want to get something nice.\" I'm driving a Mercedes-Benz AMG EQS, and I didn't know cars could be this nice. I grew up driving used cars and whatever, I did not know it was possible. It is the best augmented reality product I think you could buy in the market today.\n\n(01:35:29):\nWith the heads of display, it puts your turn in three-dimensional space. It's got cameras facing your eyes, so it's positioned correctly on this display relative to your eyes, the turn. And so when you come up, it's like you're hitting a little wall, you got to turn before you hit the wall. And I was like, \"Oh my God, I think this car has a great augmented reality.\" Not a car guy, and I'm not trying to flex on this car or whatever it is. I like it a lot. I didn't know they could be that nice, but the thing that I thought was so impressive was they did an amazing job with augmented reality in this car.\n\nLenny (01:35:58):\nWow. Mercedes-Benz, a player in the augmented reality, mixed reality space.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:01):\nBig time. They're out there, they're in the lead.\n\nLenny (01:36:04):\nI sometimes think about having a contest where I give away products people mention in this segment, and now you've blown my budget way out of proportion.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:12):\nRay-Ban Metas, you can afford that.\n\nLenny (01:36:15):\nThat's an amazing, I'm going to have to check that out. I think we're going to increase some sales for Mercedes. Next question. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to think about, share with friends and family, find useful?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:36:27):\nYeah. We have a funny actually how we came about this. The motto my family has, my immediate family, me, my wife and kids is just trust yourself. Just trust yourself. Actually, the reason we have that motto is when we have a house, we have a few nice art pieces and one of them is a Tracy Amen, a famous UK based artist, and she does neon pieces and it says, \"Trust yourself.\" And so it's in our bedroom hallway where me and all the kids and my wife are, it says, trust yourself and every morning the neon lights up and it's trust yourself. And then I had the chance to have a crest made in the UK and my family's English from way back. And so in the crest it says, \"Trust yourself.\" And I always talk to my kids, especially. I really think people, when you're experiencing peer pressure like, \"Who do you trust? Them or yourself? When you're having a lot of self-doubt and uncertainty, you have to trust yourself.\"\n\n(01:37:17):\nI just think so much of the success I've had, I think this is probably true of most people who went to startups and succeeded, was like, \"I just had faith that I was making good decisions.\" I mean, this comes back to the conviction point I made earlier about how you do things like newsfeed or controversial things or how you make big expensive changes, just conviction. You have to believe you, your eyes, ears in an intellect have combined to give you a point of view that has intrinsic value and deserves your respect as opposed to reading that newspaper article about your company and believing it over what your own eyes and ears have told you. That's the motto that we go with.\n\nLenny (01:37:57):\nAnd I think it's also important to say you won't always be right and that's okay.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:37:59):\nTotally. That's right. Trusting yourself also includes taking risks because you trust that you can deal and handle with what happens when the risks don't pay out.\n\nLenny (01:38:07):\nBeautiful. Final question. I know that you're an amateur photographer, maybe semi-pro photographer, a lot of travel photography.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:13):\nAmateur. Amateur, amateur.\n\nLenny (01:38:15):\nAmateur. Okay. You also have this website that I came across that I don't know if people know about it, it's this funny name. I'm not going to mention that. I don't know if you want people...\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:22):\nWarden Shortbow, it's an anagram of my name. Warden Shortbow, an anagram of Andrew Bosworth, wardenshortbow.com. I love photography. I love it. It's a real passion of mine.\n\nLenny (01:38:30):\nSo here's the question. What's your favorite photo that you've taken?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:38:33):\nArt is actually a great place to talk about trusting yourself, by the way. And I know it's cheesy to say it, but I think Rick Rubin's recent interviews on what art is and how people make it is spot on. You have to make it for yourself and you have to love it. And if someone else loves it and it finds broader resonance, that's awesome, but that's not why you do it. And if you start to try to do it for broader resonance, then you're kind of chasing something else. It's media, it's entertainment, but it's not art. It's some other thing. And I say all this to basically tap dance and say, I kind of love a lot of my photos and it's very hard to pick a favorite. The one that is popping to my head, which has more emotional [inaudible 01:39:12] is a picture I took of my son playing in the street and just jumping in a puddle, wearing a rain boot, rain slick kind of a thing. And it's not sharp, it's not in focus. It's a vignette, it's an idea.\n\n(01:39:27):\nAnd I really do think Ansel Adams talked a lot about how the goal of the photographer is to create a capture that expresses to the viewer what it felt like to be there. And people forget that he was a master of the dark room even more so than maybe than the capture, the print. The print was where he did amazing work. And I've had the pleasure to go to his dark room in Big Sur and spend time with his son and watch them do development in that room. And he had elaborate scripts of how he would highlight, dodge and burn different parts of the photograph to get it to have the resonance that he wanted. And he fought for photography to be accepted as an artistic medium, which it wasn't, which I find so resonant in today's AI art conversations where once again, we're trying to gate keep what is art and you just don't get to do that unfortunately.\n\n(01:40:20):\nSo this picture of my son, no one would call it a technical marvel, but as a vignette of it capturing for me personally, but also I think in general for parents, the ephemerality of these tremendously touching, charming human moments that you have with your children, that's the one that comes to mind.\n\nLenny (01:40:39):\nAmazing. We're going to try to find it and link folks to it. And on the point of Rick Rubin, something he says along the same lines is that you think of art as your diary. I am just describing what I find interesting and important and nobody can come to me and say my diary is wrong. It's my diary, this is how I see the world, and that's okay. And that's where the best art comes from is just emboldening to this... there's an awesome video of him saying exactly this that I was recently watching actually. Boz, this was so much fun. I am so thankful we made time for this. I'm looking forward to our parenting and relationships podcast in the future. Joking, not joking. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow what you're up to and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:19):\nSure. I'm @boztank on Instagram and on Threads and also on X, facebook.com/boz. And I also have my own podcast, which is a technical deep dive, so it's pretty different, I would say. It's a technical deep dives to try to go deep on one or two topics each time. That's called Boz to the Future. You can find that on Spotify or iTunes.\n\nLenny (01:41:41):\nBoz to the Future, buy some Quest stuff.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:44):\nGet yourself a Quest 3. Let's be honest. Dude, treat yourself.\n\nLenny (01:41:48):\nThere you go. Or these Ray-Ban sunglasses. I'm a big fan. Boz, again, thank you so much for being here.\n\nAndrew ‘Boz’ Bosworth (01:41:52):\nCheers. Thanks, brother.\n\nLenny (01:41:53):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

His writing about all aspects of the job is some of the best writing out there on the skills of being a PM, and has informed a lot of my thinking on both product management and writing. Brandon is currently a VP of Product at Shopify, where he's been for seven years, and in our conversation, we talk about what it's like to build product at Shopify, what Shopify has learned about being effective working remotely, having done it from day one, the impact of writing on one's career and how to get started, the benefits of becoming a platform PM, the manager track versus the IC track, and a bunch of other stuff. Brandon is a wealth of knowledge on the art of product management, and I'm really excited to bring this episode to you.\n\n(00:46):\nDo you want to reduce friction in your onboarding flow?

Brandon, thank you so much for joining me.\n\nBrandon Chu (03:01):\nHey, Lenny. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (03:03):\nI'm curious. When you were younger, what did you want to be when you grew up?\n\nBrandon Chu (03:06):\nAn astronaut.\n\nLenny (03:07):\nSay more.\n\nBrandon Chu (03:08):\nI've always just had a longing for space. I have a vision in my mind, and I still think I'm going to do this. One day, I'm going to see the whole earth in one view, and it's going to make me feel... This is going to sound weird... But make me feel really small, which I think will make me feel connected. And so, even since I was 16, I've been saving 2,000 dollars a year in a separate account that I just invest into the market, because I calculated that it would cost half a million dollars by the time I was 55, and I think it's going to actually work out timing-wise, because it's like the cost is coming close.\n\nLenny (03:40):\nThis is an amazing story. That's a very PM-y way of approaching it. Just start putting money away.\n\nBrandon Chu (03:44):\nI guess so.\n\nLenny (03:45):\nPlan for going to space, hoping the tech would catch up. This is going to be a great podcast V2 when you're on your way to space.\n\nBrandon Chu (03:51):\nYeah. We'll do it for sure. I'll bring my Starlink up there.\n\nLenny (03:54):\nI just got an email from Starlink that you can now move your Starlink around and get internet as you move.\n\nBrandon Chu (03:58):\nOh, that's amazing. So they're going to have a mount on Teslas and you just plug it into your Tesla and just, yeah.\n\nLenny (04:04):\nExactly. It's all coming together. Okay. So you wanted to be an astronaut, eventually got into product. I love to hear... I like that segue. I got into product initially and then just kind your journey to where you are today, which is VP of Product at Shopify.\n\nBrandon Chu (04:19):\nSo way back in university, I kind of grew up actually in the era where people really wanted to work on Wall Street still. So I actually came up through the finance ranks and stuff like that. And I worked in industry at Kraft Foods of all places for about four years, but how I kind of broke into product management is I got really bored that really quickly. And I started moonlighting and bootstrapping a startup on the side and it was called Tunezy and it helped YouTube musicians at the time, which were blowing up. This is kind of when Justin Bieber was becoming famous by doing webcam cover music and stuff like that. And we helped YouTube musicians monetize their fan bases by offering fan experiences at their tour stops. And so this was really early. This is before YouTube even had a music category. And so my co-founder and I, neither of us were technical, but we were pretty good at pitching.\n\n(05:08):\nAnd so we kind of entered a lot of startup competitions and we got some funding and some office space and we quit our jobs literally the weekend after we won that. And then fast forward three and a half, four years, we never really made a really big company out of it, but we kind of soft landed sold the company. And I'd say that's my first foray because my job as a co-founder there was really to work with engineering and design. And it was through that experience that I learned everything about product and I got a lot more technical too. I was able to do a little bit on the front end. And so from that, after the acquisition and the integration that parlayed that into product management career basically. So I joined a growth stage startup in Canada, in Toronto called FreshBooks, which is still around today.\n\n(05:50):\nThey're a Series D company now. And I kind of learned the chops of product management there because the folks there were X Microsoft 15 years, really technical, process-oriented and framework heavy product management. And I had my just scrappy entrepreneurial experience. So I kind of hardened my PM skills through that over about four years. And then I joined Shopify the week of the IPO actually. So that's almost seven years ago and it was one of the largest companies I ever worked at. I had 500 people even then at least because I'd been in startups prior. So I thought maybe the story's over.- But as I met Tobi through my interview process, I realized that that was definitely not true. And it obviously is not true now.\n\n(06:30):\nSo yeah. I've been seven years there, various PM roles, areas of the product and then eventually really started to build some domain expertise around platform management and developer ecosystems and kind of grew my career there. And through that domain, became product director and then a VP of product. And then in classic Shopify form, I completely threw it all away and started something a little different inside the company 18 months ago. So now I lead what we call product acceleration, which is the team that does all of Shopify's investments and then [inaudible 00:07:02].\n\nLenny (07:02):\nAmazing. So I was looking at your LinkedIn and just hearing this story, especially the Shopify piece, it's a pretty incredible trajectory. And imagine a lot of people listening to this may be like, \"Shit. How do I follow a similar path? How do I do it Brandon did.\" Do you have any advice about what it was that helped you, either habits, skills, behaviors that helped you get to where you're today that maybe newer PMs could learn from?\n\nBrandon Chu (07:26):\nI think what I learned over the arc of my career is that especially when it comes to product management specifically, it's a lot of the hard skills that PMs are known for, so organizational, analytical, good communication, even technical skills. There's sort of table stakes and commodities to be an entry level PM. And to be clear, it's not easy to be a PM. It's not an entry level job. And so that is no knock on that. I'm saying to grow beyond that though, I think domain expertise can take you a little bit further like if you're an amazing payments PM or you have some really nuanced knowledge and whatever, 3D modeling or something like that.\n\n(08:05):\nBut I think ultimately to have the highest trajectory and what certainly was a tailwind for my career was you guys have to lean into those founder skills. And so things like being a great storyteller, how to get the most out of people around you, foster creative and motivated teams and know how to make really, really hard high conviction decisions that actually can't be solved. You got to take a leap of faith and how to do that and bring teams through that type of ambiguity and then how to lead by example and have accountability when you make those choices. So I found that ultimately, those really became the things that were limiters for some careers I observed and then were definitely propelling for a lot of the people that made it to high level of leadership.\n\nLenny (08:47):\nAwesome. And I know you wrote a lot about a lot of these things, which we'll talk about your writing, which I'm a huge fan of and I have been a fan for a long time. But before we get into those, I want to chat a little bit about Shopify and your experience at Shopify and just understanding the product culture at Shopify. As an outsider, Shopify feels like an incredibly strong product culture. And I know a lot of amazing PMs that work there and even outside PMs, just generally amazing people. What would you say are some of the defining characteristics of how teams build product at Shopify maybe that are different from how other companies approach product?\n\nBrandon Chu (09:20):\nShopify has an incredibly strong product culture. Whether it's uniquely different, I can't know for sure, but I would say I'd start with, it's a highly technical company. That's not unique, but it's just something that should be known about Shopify. When I joined, all project management was just in GitHub, just commenting on poll requests and even marketers in order to augment or upload a blog post, you'd have to commit and deploy it. So there was no breaks given for folks that didn't want to touch code and stuff like that. I think it was very much and this all stems from Tobi, a very well renowned developer in the Rails Core community and it all kind of flowed from him.\n\n(09:59):\nAnd so because of that, I think everyone in the company had their hands really deep in the product regardless of what function you are, which brings me the second thing I think is really awesome with Shopify, when it comes to how the product org works, it's that we don't actually put the product org on a pedestal as the only people that can have an opinion about the product or should be listened to when we think about what should be built. There's sort of an understanding of Shopify that everyone at the company from engineers to support, to sales, everyone's responsible for product thinking and it's not just the area for a small group of PMs.\n\n(10:38):\nAnd so that's some of the foundations of it. And again, all stems from Tobi. I'd say the last one is that this comes from the fact that we have Canadian roots. And I say that actually in a way that's almost opposite of the stereotype when it comes to tech anyway. There has been a lot of failed tech companies in Canada and no company that's ever truly been global. And so ambition and a founder mentality has been something that we've architected the culture of the product team around. And so 30 to 40% of the PM team are ex founders either through failed startups or through acquisition.\n\n(11:15):\nAnd this is really important to us for obvious reasons about just versatility and grit and growth mindset but then also we are building a platform for other entrepreneurs, whether they're merchants on our platform or developers to build their own stuff. And so we have a lot of empathy for our customers through that. And so the way this is all kind of coalesced is the one liner job description we give to PMs as they come in is \"Your job is to help teams ship the right thing at the right time in the right way.\" And it really comes down to two main concepts. There's help teams. So it's like servant leadership. You're not necessarily the CEO of the product. You're not dictator. Everyone's responsible for product thinking and you're there to help the team get to ultimately the right thing. And that is what you are accountable for.\n\nLenny (12:00):\nI love that definition. In practice, do you give PMs a little bit more sway over decisions or do you try to keep it completely equal amongst functions?\n\nBrandon Chu (12:10):\nActually, I think it depends on the level. So I think as you go to towards more the junior PMs and the ICs, there is a much bigger emphasis on balanced decision making between all the Kraft's user experience and engineering, of course. And then it's more when you get to director level or above, that's when there is more emphasis put on where the PM wants to lead, because ultimately, it becomes a pure strategic function at that point and that is your only job. Your only job is to say, \"We need to go there and my ass is online for us going there.\" And so that is something I think we matured into. There was obviously lots of tension as we grew of, \"Hey. We used to collaborate, but now you're saying we have to do this thing.\" And it's like, well, actually, the company, the context changed, my role changed and we have to do something and it has to be someone's job to make that choice. So it's a bit of both is the answer.\n\nLenny (13:05):\nAwesome. Spending a little more time on decision making in general at Shopify. Is there kind of a framework or a specific process you guys use to make bigger decisions?\n\nBrandon Chu (13:15):\nWhat we do have is an annual planning cycle basically, we call investment plans and it's for fairly large SWOTs to the organization. I'm talking like 20% chunks of all of Shopify consolidated under a VP here and there to put forward a vision for what that team's going to accomplish that year, whether that is a directional change or even specific outcomes in some cases. And we spend time aligning with both Tobi, the rest of the C level exec team, even sometimes the board on what that is and what headcount may go with that and what not. But that's sort of the main arc of planning. What happens after that is just chaos, all the teams underneath and like I said, one fifth of Shopify may be moving towards one investment plan, that's at this scale almost 2500 people. Right? So they're all now chaotically moving towards those end goals and iterating through ideas good and bad.\n\n(14:15):\nAnd so this is actually where Shopify is a really hard place too, because we do this because we recognize a couple things. One is it's important that we set broad direction, so everyone can put their energy towards the right place. But we also want a place where we're hiring smart people so that they can figure out what to do. And we also know that in software and in tech and in this world, things change so rapidly. So don't even kid yourself that we're going to plan out everything we're going to have to do for the next year to get there. And so we set this directional kind of outcome and vision based kind of north star for where we want to go. Then product directors start to basically shoot their shot and say, \"This is how my group can contribute to those things. Here's what we're going to try to commit to in the next quarter basically.\"\n\n(14:58):\nAnd it's through that almost back and forth, the trust battery thing that I was talking about plays in. Again, they're selling it to their peers, the engineering directors. They're selling it to the VPs. They're selling it to the broad team as well to get momentum behind it and to say, \"You know what? This feels right. Let's start doing that.\" But what's really amazing and also difficult about Shopify though is we're pretty good at never falling into sunk-cost fallacy. So we'll throw it all away anytime if the world changes. Right?\n\n(15:29):\nAnd so that's why it's actually a really tricky place for a lot of folks because there are cases and it's happened to me many times where it's just like you're building three, six months into something and it's just not important anymore or the world changed. And so that's kind of how the sausage gets made. And it really comes down to giving teams the agency, giving product folks at certain levels the responsibility to make a bet, and then having the humility to understand that soccer's hard, the world changes and that we always have to ask ourselves this is the most important thing that we can do right now.\n\nLenny (16:03):\nIt's so important. A lot of companies just want to avoid upsetting people, want to avoid creating chaos. And it's so important to always be rethinking even if it's like we just put a plan together, maybe we should change it because things have changed. And so I'm not surprised Shopify is really good at this.\n\nBrandon Chu (16:20):\nTo give an example, during COVID, this cultural resilience we had to change was so vital because all of a sudden, these grandiose ideas and visions we had for 2020 didn't matter and what mattered was like, \"Oh, shit. Retail businesses are going from a hundred percent to zero.\" It's like 0% revenue overnight. And how do we help a brick and mortar store across the street now do order online and pick up it in store? How do we do that? How do we throw away everything? This is what matters now. Let's try to ship three things in the next month that matter.\" And that's very jarring, I think, unless you have a culture that just understands that can happen any day and it kind of gets excited by those.\n\nLenny (17:02):\nI'd love to actually hear whatever you could share on the COVID period of Shopify and just what folks did to work through that.\n\nBrandon Chu (17:08):\nYeah. Through all the roadmaps, we asked ourselves, \"Hey. Our customers, their livelihoods are at risk right now.\" And this is when no one knew it would actually be a tailwind for e-commerce. Right? We didn't know the severity of COVID. It could have been a really, really bad pandemic from a death rate perspective. So no one's betting like, \"Oh, everyone's going to stay home for two years and everyone's going to buy stuff online.\" Everyone's like, \"Okay. All our customers are going to go to zero, unless we help them figure out how to actually survive through this.\"\n\n(17:40):\nAnd so of course, online only merchants or merchants who were well established online have that infrastructure. There wasn't supply chain issues yet. So they're good. The focus then turned, of course, to all these both hybrid brick and mortar online customers and customers that are only brick and mortar. And so we did all those things. Some restaurants and grocery stores on the platform, how do we help them do exactly that buy online, pick up at the curb? How do we help them launch buy gift cards now at a discount so that basically you can, as a consumer, help these companies stay afloat. If you recall back in 2020, that was a huge thing. Buy gift cards at the restaurant you like, because if you don't, it might not exist.\n\nLenny (18:22):\nI did that a bunch. I remember. Yeah.\n\nBrandon Chu (18:24):\nSo these things exist on Shopify in apps because they were never really mission critical, but now it became really mission critical. So all of a sudden we're trying to gear 500 people towards ship gift cards, which sounds like a really small feature, but it's pretty hard when you have millions of merchants and hundreds of millions of consumers using your platform every day, ship it in two weeks. And so it became war time truly. And yes, Tobi got way more involved, as did Craig Miller, our CPO at the time. And we went down from trying to ship maybe the 40 things that quarter to three and nothing else mattered. And that became the rhythm of the company for almost that entire year.\n\nLenny (19:09):\nWow. How long did that kind of war time period last internally?\n\nBrandon Chu (19:13):\nI'd say the edge came off a little bit I think mid 2021. It wasn't that long ago actually, maybe about a year ago that it started. I would say it never really left war time per se, but everyone sort of adjusted to it. And so many other things were happening because we had offices before and we made the decision very early in the pandemic to say, \"We're never going to have offices again. We're a digital by default company. Hire anywhere in the world, but let's make sure we have really great infrastructure.\" And so there was so many things happening inside the company that just changed. It really changed overnight. Shopify, the experience, the culture of the company changed overnight. And so it's hard to say when it stopped, it just evolved.\n\nLenny (19:58):\nI wanted to actually ask about that and so I'm glad you brought that up. The fact that Shopify's been very remote friendly for a long time, I imagine it's rooted in the fact that it was founded in Ottawa and it's probably hard to hire the scale of people that you're all hiring out of Ottawa. And I imagine there was an advantage to having a lot of that experience working remotely in this new modern world. And I also imagine wasn't easy still, but what I'm curious about is what sorts of things have you learned about working remotely that you can share that other companies can maybe learn from Shopify's experience?\n\nBrandon Chu (20:31):\nFinding enough that in-person still matters. It does. And that doesn't mean we're rolling back at all the fact that we're remote only, but what we've done is we've actually instituted with something we call bursts. So bursts at Shopify are the ability for your team generally maybe once a quarter or whatnot, to just come together to do really high velocity creative work together, to hang out together. And so we've gone pretty far on this where we actually have in-house built web and mobile apps that allow teams to one click, say I have 20 people. We want to do a burst in Laguna Beach and then click the button and then flights get booked, hotels get booked, food is taken care of. No one has to pay any. There's no expenses that go back and forth. The app itself helps you check into those places.\n\n(21:24):\nAnd we have really cool experiences. And in France and Ireland, I'll leave a little bit to the imagination, but it's really cool. So we started allowing kind of that as the world opened up for travel and now teams are doing it all the time. I'm going next week actually to one with our team.\n\nLenny (21:24):\nYou just do a personal burst. I just want to go to The Bahamas first.\n\nBrandon Chu (21:46):\nYou can try. We've done other things too, because you spoke in Bahamas. I actually worked out of the Caribbean for five weeks in March. And because we also had a policy that we instituted that said for 90 days out of the year, you can work in any country you want. And so what we tried to do with a remote only world is we tried to turn all the weaknesses on its head and to say, \"Okay. Well, we can't see each other every day, but let's remember all the ways that sucked from a commute perspective and even when you were together, if you were just working in your desk and never even talking to each other, that wasn't great. So why don't we just optimize for the stuff that was amazing about it and make it super easy and fun?\"\n\n(22:23):\nAnd that's what bursts became. And then, hey, we have amazing infrastructure now. We can work with global teams 24/7/365. Why are we forcing people to stay in a location? The reality is the 98 thing is mostly because of a tax thing, but ultimately, we have the infrastructure that people can just log in from wherever. And so why not lean into.\n\nLenny (22:44):\nYeah. This is really interesting. I love that your answer to how to work remotely better is get together more often, which I hear a lot from companies, but I love that you've built this infrastructure to enable it. I'd love to hear a bit more of how this product works. Is it all in-house? Any advice I guess, for anyone trying to build something like this?\n\nBrandon Chu (23:01):\nI hate saying that it is all in-house because that is not easy, really accessible for midsize or below companies, but basically, you initiate an event called the burst. You can choose what type of thing you're trying to do, whether it's a pure work thing or you want to have a little bit of activity and social aspects of it. There's different locations, depending on how many people are going that are available to you. There's a booking system. If you choose to do something a little more low key and just meet in, let's say a major city, then we actually allow you to access our old offices. So the leases didn't go away. So we had to use these offices for something and these offices have now completely been retrofitted. They're beautiful. And they are amazing. I wouldn't even say co-working spaces. They're just community spaces now that you go in and you can use them and you have everything. There's food there. There used to be there's board rooms and whatever you want to have your little offsite or whatever it may be.\n\n(24:01):\nAnd then there's a rating system after. How is the burst there? There's a whole team that manages the logistics of all these things. So that it's very just like we don't have managers all over the company trying to figure out flight plans and stuff like that. And yeah. It's great. And we also get the data to be able to see, hey, what teams haven't been together in a very long time? And ask the lead, \"Hey. Why is that? Is it because everything's good and people are busy? Maybe something about a baby or something like that and they can't get around.\" Or is it a prompt that, \"Hey, maybe your energy is low as a team, it's time to get together.\" So that's the benefit I think of having built that app and that infrastructure is that we get to really understand how it's actually helping.\n\nLenny (24:42):\nThis episode is brought to you by PostHog. PostHog offers a suite of product analysis tools, including funnels, heat maps, session recording and experimentation all in one easy to use platform.

Is there an API that just books flights or does it just send you to kayak and you book these flights?\n\nBrandon Chu (25:31):\nI don't know the exact answer, but I would imagine. So we also use trip actions inside of Shopify and I'm pretty sure they have an API, so probably we've done something directly with them. So they've handled all the really complex stuff, but we probably use them for the booking action itself.\n\nLenny (25:47):\nOkay. Sweet. This is super interesting. I've never heard of this. I want to transition to talk a little bit about your writing. So your writing is how I originally discovered you. It's on the top, I don't know, 1% of most useful, actionable, interesting writing on the Kraft Food product management. I still refer to it often and share it with people all the time and it says a lot, because it's a little older at this point and you've kind of slowed down the writing. I'm curious when you were in that writing phase, a lot of people want to write, a lot of people know that it's good for many reasons, but a lot of people don't do it. What would you say worked well for you when you were in that period to get you to actually get stuff written and also just create time for writing?\n\nBrandon Chu (26:27):\nYeah. Well, first of all, thank you. That's super generous. I think if you say I'm in the top 1%, then Lenny, you're definitely in the top 0.1 or 0.01% and so kudos to you.\n\nLenny (26:27):\nI aspire to be you.\n\nBrandon Chu (26:41):\nAnd also thank you for being generous saying I've slowed down a bit. The reality is I haven't written anything since 2018. So when I reflect on it, I think I wrote those in a time where I was figuring out a lot of stuff while I was executing. And I wanted to crystallize in my mind some mental models and frameworks that had been forming somewhat intuitively. The funny thing about those posts when I reflect on them and I've rarely reread them, but every once in a while, someone shares an excerpt and I end up kind of rereading and be like, \"Do I even believe this still?\" But when people read them, they think like, \"Oh, they're learning from someone who's figured it out for a while and now they're sharing it later in their career or something.\"\n\n(27:21):\nBut the reality is, and maybe this resonates with you. It's like I figured out everything in those posts at the exact moment I wrote them. It was the writing process itself that actually allowed me to solidify those mental models and those frameworks in my mind. And so I wasn't ahead of the game in any way. It was just I think I really wanted to disambiguate the chaos in my mind about what my job was. And it took me to really interesting places. And I think it was also coupled with two things, which was I had a really good career trajectory at the same time so I could actually observe. I wasn't too mired in being a PM one for five years and then moving. I was moving through things really quickly so I was able to contrast things because it was literally like, \"Oh wait, three months ago, it was that. Now, how do I change?\"\n\n(28:03):\nAnd that, of course, is not just me, but it's also at Shopify I grew so much during that time. Right? We grew seven years ago. I came at just under 500 people. Were over 12,000 people today. And so it was a really formative time for the whole company and definitely myself. And in terms of just writing well and shipping quality posts and stuff like that, I'm sure this resonates with you. You just got to put in the work. You got to put in a lot of hours. I put 40 hours into a post, do it on the weekends or I brain dumped a first draft of it in two hours and drew 38 hours of editing or getting feedback from people or drawing some diagrams that I put in there. But it was that process.\n\n(28:44):\nAnd I think it was such an amazing thing to learn how to do is to just sit and write for five hours and reread the thing and actually also get feedback from people. Don't be so afraid to share raw, early thoughts and for it to not make sense but then when you give to someone objective and they read it, they'll be like, you really learn things about how you put a narrative together in your mind versus how someone actually reacts to it. And so that fearlessness to get a lot of feedback, I think, was something I developed through those years.\n\nLenny (29:14):\nEverything you said 100% resonates with my approach. There's a quote I often think about. It might be Hemingway or might be misattributed to Hemingway that \"I don't know what I think until I've written it down.\" And that's exactly how I feel like it's a forcing function to help you actually figure out something. And that's exactly how I started.\n\nBrandon Chu (29:33):\nAnd it's a release too, because when you write it down, you just kind of release it from your mind. It's not floating around there because I'm scared to lose it or something like that. And you kind of just now you cleared your mind and you can actually think. You build on top of that knowledge into something else.\n\nLenny (29:48):\nThat's exactly how I felt when I first started writing. I just want to get these things out of my head before I forget them partly to help crystallize something that I can actually hold onto that won't fade away.\n\nBrandon Chu (29:57):\nOkay. How many posts have you written now?\n\nLenny (29:59):\nI think probably 300.\n\nBrandon Chu (30:01):\n300. How are you still motivated to, or where do you even find things to write about now?\n\nLenny (30:07):\nSo I have a endless list of things I want to write about. And partly, these ideas come from founders and PMs that are constantly sending me questions that they have. And the way I see it is until nobody has any more questions to ask about starting a company, building a product, driving growth, I'm going to have things to write about.\n\nBrandon Chu (30:27):\nThat's amazing.\n\nLenny (30:28):\nAnd it feels like that's an endless supply. The bigger challenges, it gets harder and harder because the easier stuff is getting knocked out. And so that's the bigger challenges. Things remaining are things that take more time, more research, more digging, things like that. But at this point, yeah, I've been doing it for over three years and still got plenty of ideas.\n\nBrandon Chu (30:48):\n[inaudible 00:30:48].\n\nLenny (30:47):\nAnd there's no better motivator than somebody paying you for your content and [inaudible 00:30:51].\n\nBrandon Chu (30:51):\nWell, it's a symbiotic relationship.Right? All those questions and feedback from your subscribers and whatnot is fodder for the next thing that you're going to give. And I think that's an amazing relationship.\n\nLenny (31:02):\nThat's exactly right. I wanted to ask you, do you think every PM/leader should spend time writing? Who should? Who shouldn't? What are you feeling on that?\n\nBrandon Chu (31:10):\nI think yes. Even if it's not to be publicly shared or whatnot, I think ultimately, especially in a increasingly digital world and increasingly remote world, you've got to be able to articulate yourself. Again, even going back to that process of writing and what it does for how you understand what you're saying, you owe your team, your peers, your stakeholders that level of clarity. So even if you write it and throw away, you've created a clarity in your mind and you can articulate it as such and people deserve that. And I think that if you're going to be a really good PM, you have to have that skill.\n\nLenny (31:45):\nWhat impact have you seen as a result of your writing that you've done?\n\nBrandon Chu (31:49):\nOh, it's honestly been the most important thing I've ever done in my career unbelievably. And it's had probably two really interesting effects. One is that as Shopify grew and when we were going through hyperscale, you probably recognize this from your Airbnb days as well but people are falling from the sky. Every day there's 20 new people showing up and you having been there already, now you got to figure out what all these people are doing and give them all the context and all these types of things. And how do you even teach them the culture and the ways that you work and stuff like this. And so one amazing, and just the context, I'm really old at Shopify now. I'm like 99.1% tenure. So I'm ancient at the company.\n\nLenny (32:30):\nIs there a stat that shows up? Is there a little dashboard?\n\nBrandon Chu (32:32):\nThere is in our little internal wiki thing.\n\nLenny (32:35):\n[inaudible 00:32:35].\n\nBrandon Chu (32:34):\nSo I'm literally ancient in the company. And so one of the amazing effects that the writing had was that people that would join my team already knew how I thought. It was pretty onboarded a lot of the PMs that would join my team because obviously, they're going to look for who their leads is and Google that a bit and they see a posting and be like, \"Is this person legit or not or whatever?\" And so I didn't really even have to onboard many people in so many ways. They kind of knew how I thought about the world. And also, even when I was in Shopify and writing those posts, there's so much noise in Shopify. It's a very chaotic place. There's so many exciting things happening that it is very hard to tell a 200 person PM org, \"Stop. Pay attention to this idea.\"\n\n(33:20):\nSo I actually found that writing externally and getting momentum externally was a better way to influence internally what was happening, to the effect that Tobi would read my post here and there and he'd be like, \"Great post.\" And I'd be like, \"Hey, daddy loves me.\" But no, but seriously, it would help build my trust battery with Tobi because of the way that those posts gain traction and whatnot. So it has had an incredible, incredible impact on my personal career. And also I think it has brought a lot of really great people to Shopify. Literally every week a new PM messages me and says like, \"Hey. I just joined. Your post had a lot of influence on me or whatever. And I'd love to meet up and blah, blah, blah.\" But that has been amazing and it's so rewarding. Another small example, this wasn't in the black box, product management like general cannon or whatever per se, but I was working on the integration product with Facebook Messenger via Shopify.\n\n(34:16):\nAnd as part of our launch, I wrote just to get more, because we're a very small company than them. So we're using any angle we can. So I'm writing on my personal blog about this thing that we launched and David Marcus, who's now leading their blockchain crypto stuff, but he was CEO of PayPal for a while. And then he came in to lead all the Facebook's payment stuff and Messenger. Oh, sorry. Kind of lead Messenger. Anyway, he shared it on his Facebook and on Twitter. And then that blew up and all of a sudden, the CPO of Shopify, Craig or whatever, now starts thinking I'm legit even though... Because someone of his caliber was also sharing these things, about a product that we built and whatnot. So it was just really interesting how these little things had an impact on how people perceive you and thus how much impact and momentum you can create inside a company.\n\nLenny (35:08):\nIf you think about it, say you spend 40 hours on that post, what are or why that is spending a week or two writing something and the impact that could have on your perception within the company on your future career opportunities and even just people joining the company and that are going to work for you. They're like, \"Oh my God, I'm going to work for Brandon Chu. I'm so excited.\"\n\nBrandon Chu (35:28):\nI'd say even if it never got picked up, the ROI is already huge because it just again helps you refine how you talk about the work and the decisions, but that aside, it accelerated my career probably a decade.\n\nLenny (35:41):\nThat's a really good point. You should not be focused on this needs to go viral for this to be worth the time because I find that the more you think about that, the less well it does because that becomes the wrong intent.\n\nBrandon Chu (35:52):\nYeah. Well, to be perfectly transparent about it, it is a factor in why I stopped writing. It had gained so much traction and I had become an exec now at Shopify and I was so busy at them. I was like, \"I don't have the time to make this thing as good as it was. And I'm not even going to put another post out because I don't want to disappoint people.\" That's a real thing. I think you're probably better conditioned with this having written 300 posts now. I think you're a machine, but for me, it was like, I would put one every couple months maximum or something like that. And so when I lost the time, I had kids and all these types of things, it seemed insurmountable to prioritize.\n\nLenny (36:31):\nI wanted to ask, what's your favorite thing that you've written? Which piece is your favorite?\n\nBrandon Chu (36:36):\nI don't know if I have a favorite, but the one that always I'd say has overall had the most traction or just constantly, even to today, people still tweet about or message me, whatever, was the one about making good decisions as a PM. Basically, the short of it is, the first thing it argues is that the most important thing to figure out when you're dealing with any decision is actually figuring out how important that decision is. Since we're faced with hundreds of decisions in any given moment around the product or whatever, and that we're only human and we can only prioritize a few, you got to figure out the importance of them so you can prioritize. And so it talks about things like either decision reversible or not. Does it affect a lot of users in a material way or not, stuff like that, ways to prioritize them basically.\n\n(37:22):\nAnd then it kind of argues that okay, given the fact that we only have limited time and that the most important decisions are so much more important than the other 98, 99 of them, you should basically spend all your time on those very few important decisions. And for all other decisions, you should just literally just go with whatever your gut is or delegate it because you're only human and your gut is going to be right a decent amount of time too. And so just make those fast so that you can keep the team velocity high. You don't ever want to be a blocker, that's the other tension and then spend all your time on these few critical decisions.\n\nLenny (38:00):\nWould you say that's still generally the way you work looking back at that post?\n\nBrandon Chu (38:04):\nYeah. Definitely is still the way I work. I probably do it too much in terms of me doing my job here and there.\n\nLenny (38:09):\nAwesome.\n\nBrandon Chu (38:11):\nIt's like, \"Oh, that isn't important.\" If you take overtime too, you get weathered down about what's actually super dire versus not. And once you've had a few battle scars of things that you thought were going to ruin everything, your career, your reputation, blah, blah, blah, and then actually nothing happened, you just start to raise the bar about what's actually important.\n\nLenny (38:31):\nI love it. We're definitely going to link to that in the description for this episode. Is there a post that you wish you had written or want to write if you have the time?\n\nBrandon Chu (38:39):\nI've been wanting to write literally for three years. It'll probably be really long, but just a huge post about being a platform PM as opposed to product PM. And there's so many interesting differences in the ways that you have to think about prioritization. And I even told a story about it's a big cultural change too, that you have to affect people way beyond your team. Now you have to also work and you have to tell us to work multiparties. So you're building a, let's say a developer platform that they're building apps. Okay. Now there's multiple stakeholders. So the developers building these apps that are going to be consumed by these businesses, these merchants, and these apps also may be presented to end buyers. There's now three constituents and there's all these crazy things around policy, data sharing, just tension between which side gets economically rewarded for doing what. There's a lot of really interesting things.\n\n(39:33):\nAnd so one day I hope to write something about that and that's even on just the pure strategy and kind of economic view of it. But then there's also a super fascinating product design and engineering problems of just like, okay, you have this web app or whatever, and you want apps to exist in it. Well, how are they going to exist in it? Right? Okay. Are you just going to let them put their link in there and then it opens up a new tab into that other product that's kind of lame? That's basically a Facebook comment of a link, or are you going to allow the actual third party product to exist inside of your product and how are you going to do that? Is it going to be an eye frame? Well, that's kind of janky.\n\n(40:11):\nIf it's going to be deeper, then now we're talking about direct data integration. We're talking about maybe your app serving UI on behalf of that app, but then some of the data comes from the third party server and it gets really, really interesting in terms of user experience and whatnot and it's actually quite common in our life that we don't think about it.\n\n(40:29):\nSo when you long press on an app on your iPhone and it has a shortcut list of things you could do quicker. Right? Okay. Say if you long press your email app, it'll probably say create new email as one of them. That's an extension. That's iOS saying, \"Hey, Gmail app. I'm going to give you the ability to actually deep link this experience into your app through our operating system.\" Right? Someone actually had to design that idea, that user experience and we just take it for granted because that's how it works. Right? But there's so many crazy decisions there about, well, if you go too far, you give Google too much control there and they could do some really messed up stuff. Or if you don't go far enough, then it's really just lame. It's not actually powerful. And so it's a really interesting domain.\n\nLenny (41:18):\nI'm glad you touched on this because this is exactly where I wanted to go next.\n\nBrandon Chu (41:21):\nCool.\n\nLenny (41:22):\nI want to chat about the PM career track, but maybe before we get into that, I know you haven't written this post, but for someone that's designing a platform or an ecosystem, is there any kind of just guiding frameworks or rules of thumb that you've come to to help you make some of these decisions that you talked about?\n\nBrandon Chu (41:39):\nI actually say the first thing is as a PM, your psychology has to really change around your own validation. So usually, you can build a product, ship it, customers tell you if it's good or not. The cycles for platform work are five to 10 odd times longer. You're maybe changing something on the infrastructure level, then opening up an API and then doing an alpha period for the API where developers now build on that and test things. And then you move into a beta. And then finally, two years later, some end customer actually uses that app, right, for this. And you're not designing actually the end user's experience. You're designing a canvas for developers to build their own creative ideas on. And it's just a very different type of work. And so I would say that's the first thing psychologically is be prepared for those much longer cycles.\n\n(42:29):\nSurround yourself with people on your teams that find ways to enjoy that process and also find ways to celebrate rewards along the way like we would, not rewards, but celebrate shipping things along the way. When that API went into alpha, there's no press release, but how do you make the team feel amazing about that work? Right? You have to tell the big narrative about this is going to change how merchants actually get different apps in these areas or whatnot. And here's some of the crazy things that we're seeing in the early adoption, et cetera. So that's my main thing on psychology. I'd say in terms of preparing yourself, you really have to think about before you even get into the technical or design execution of any particular platform area, really think about the principles behind the platform that you're building. So an example, and then a contrast with Shopify's, in Amazon's platform, I'm making this up, but I assume that a pretty big important intro principle is that if there's ever a toss up between deciding between the seller and the buyer, the consumer, we're going to decide with the consumer. Right?\n\n(43:40):\nThat's why every time you refund something on Amazon, anytime you got a complaint, send you another one. Right? They made that trade off to be a consumer focused platform and obviously, that's been amazing for them, but you also hear the contrasting stories of sellers that are really pissed off Amazon that have ruined their businesses and whatnot. So not to hate on that, but that's a second order effect of that decision. In Shopify's case, we are here to support entrepreneurs and businesses in making their dreams come true and creating independence. And that is sometimes at the cost of developers on our platform. And so sometimes we may make a data policy change saying, \"Hey. It's more important that the merchant has access to this data across apps. And it's important that actually you push that data back in Shopify so that you don't hold that data back so that this other app can't use it.\"\n\n(44:33):\nAnd now we're sending the same end customer two marketing texts when they've already opted out of marketing texts or something like that. And so this is where you have to understand those principles and the stack rank of the constituents there to be able to make good policy and design choices. And I think it's something that if you're not conscious of early as a platform PM, you will blow up some stuff or there will be some bad instances that come up or you'll get blocked by the CEO or whatever on the day before it launches, which has happened to me.\n\nLenny (45:07):\nOh, no. This sounds like a very hard place to be in an organization, building a platform, building an ecosystem like this. You went into the platform world pretty early when you got to Shopify. And I know a lot of PMs think about, \"Should I go platform? Should I go user facing product?\" Do you have any advice for folks that are trying to decide which path to take? And is it even a one way door? Is it easy to go to a different direction later?\n\nBrandon Chu (45:32):\nThat's a really tough question. I think if you have any particular interest in the types of problems that you solve, I'd give you a little snapshot of the things you think about as a platform PM. If that stuff gets you really interested, then follow that guy. I don't think it's either, or I don't think one is better than the other. I think they're completely different types of problem domains. I don't think it's also a one way door. I'd say even if you do primarily user facing or consumer facing side of the product, you're going to be consuming things on some platform somewhere, whether it's an internal API or a third party or whatnot. So you're going to experience platforms good and bad. Right? And so you'll learn about it. And then alternatively on the platform side, you're going to be designing the canvas and you're going to see what gets built there and you're going to learn what are good and bad bounds of not a single user experience, but a universe of user experiences that are possible.\n\n(46:26):\nIf you create a UI kit or something like that, you're going to see the good and the bad that comes out of that UI kit being given to the third party ecosystem and you'll learn about consumer. And so I also think oscillating between them is an amazing experience too, because there are really long cycles and platform work. And sometimes it's nice to ship and iterate and grow week over week and talk to your users about every single feature that you're shipping every other week. And that's so fun in different ways. And so I think having both is actually the right goal in both experiences.\n\nLenny (47:00):\nTo zoom out a little bit and as a final question, if you could suggest just one thing for PMs to do to help them level up in their career and just do better, what would that be?\n\nBrandon Chu (47:13):\nEveryone has so many different backgrounds, but I'd say overall, based on most PMs that I've met, I'd say, look, it is hard to do when you are a PM somewhere, but do a legitimate side hustle, found a company on the side and learn everything else. Because I think sometimes you're in this silo of your feature, your area or whatnot. And you forget what it means to sell something to a customer, what it means to support a product, what it means to ship something and get destroyed because it doesn't even work or something like that. And so I think it humbles you a bit. It reminds you of how hard it is to build software and how many people it takes to do that well. And especially if you're not in technical, really lean into it and build something simple, learn how to build something simple for yourself, demystify the technology.\n\n(48:03):\nThat experience will take you far. I love telling people that literally don't even know what HTML is or something like that, which I was one of those people that from right now over the weekend, you could build a clone of Twitter using a tutorial on Rails or something like that. You can do it. You may not know everything that's actually happening, right? But you could actually get that deployed and it'll work and it'll blow your mind that you did that. And I think once people break through that wall, when they're nontechnical, I think the momentum builds from there and so the side hustle and then also break technical walls or obscurity is what I would recommend.\n\nLenny (48:43):\nAwesome. I love that advice. It's kind of like a microcosm of create your own little business and do all the things and break out of your little box that you're in. Maybe as a PM, where can folks find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nBrandon Chu (48:55):\nYou can find me online, I guess, on Twitter @BrandonMChu and be useful to me. The simplest answer for me, I guess is I'm a pretty active angel investor. I've invested in 60 companies over the last five, six years. So if you're interested in an occasionally helpful angel investor, then hit me up. We may be a little bit too busy, but really the honest answer, I don't need anything. I think if anyone's listening and they want to help me out, just go help some stranger in the world that needs it. I'd rather you do that. I think I've been so lucky in life that I don't want anything.\n\nLenny (49:28):\nAwesome. Thank you so much, Brandon.\n\nBrandon Chu (49:29):\nThanks, Lenny. It's been a blast.\n\nLenny (49:33):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening. If you enjoy the chat, don't forget to subscribe to the podcast. You could also learn more at lennyspodcast.com.
