When you sign up for Instagram right now, when you sign up for Facebook for many, many years, Facebook knew that it needed to get you to 10 friends in 14 days. If you got your 10 friends in 14 days, you were probably going to use Facebook. So it'd be like, \"Well, we're going to throw every tool we have at our disposal to get you to 10 friends and 14 days.\"\n\n(00:00:23):\nSo if you signed up for Facebook for many, many years, you'll get this little thing called People You May Know. Then you'll have this person who just signed up for Facebook, you go, \"Why I'm seeing this person?\" It's not because you need a friend, because they need a friend. So what Facebook did was it made your experience slightly worse to make that person's experience slightly better. This was performing no job for you, it was trying to perform a job for them.\n\nLenny (00:00:49):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hardware and experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today for the first time ever, I've got two guests, Aarthi Ramamurthy and Sriram Krishnan, both former product managers who between them worked at basically every major tech company including Netflix, Meta, Snap, Twitter, Microsoft, even Clubhouse. Sriram is now a partner at a16z. They're actually married and both individually amazing. Together they host the Aarthi and Sriram Good Time Show, which started on Clubhouse, it's now on YouTube and famously they had Elon Musk on back in the day, which led to Clubhouse's crazy rocket ship growth, which we definitely touch on.\n\n(00:01:32):\nThis episode is definitely the most fun conversation I have had yet on this podcast. We cover all kinds of areas, including this trend of techno optimism, building your network, creating content online and how to go about doing that, becoming a product leader, community building and a hilarious rant at the end about why the Jobs-to-be-Done framework does not work. I had such a good time chatting with these two and I know you'll enjoy this episode. With that, I bring you Aarthi and Sriram after a short word from our select sponsors.\n\n(00:02:02):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company is taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold.\n\n(00:02:37):\nIf you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table beginning. Getting a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Thanks so much for having us, Lenny. This is a bucket list thing because we are on Lenny's Podcast.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:04:27):\nI know. Longtime subscriber, listener and now here. Wow. I don't want to screw this up.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:04:36):\nFirst time caller.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:04:37):\nYeah, first time caller. Yeah, let's not screw this up.\n\nLenny (00:04:39):\nYou guys are hilarious. I appreciate it and feel very flattered. You two are the first duo on this podcast and I couldn't think of a better two people to start this podcast with. I have so much stuff I want to dig into. I think we're going to have a lot of fun, so again, thanks for joining me here.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:04:54):\nIt's awesome. Big fan. Yeah, honestly, this just... I'm excited.\n\nLenny (00:05:00):\nSo I don't know if you remember this, I was thinking about this story, back when you were doing the Good Time Show, you invited me on the Good Time Show and I was thinking, hesitating, like, \"I don't know, that's kind of scary.\" And then the next day, Elon came on and then it just blew up and I was like, \"Shit, I missed my chance.\" And then became really fancy people and I was like, \"I'm not ever going to make it back on there.\" And so I look back at that as like, \"Oh, I hesitated too long. That's a lesson.\"\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:05:22):\nWell, the way you should interpret that is, \"They couldn't get me on, so their backup choice was Elon. I would've been the main event and they were like, 'Well, oh, we couldn't get Lenny, we'll get... No, but seriously, we've been a huge fan and those are just the fun times. We used to do the show obviously on just Clubhouse and now we do the show on YouTube, wherever you can listen to our podcast. And a lot of people remember us for the Elon episode, but I will tell you this, it is often the folks who were working technology, who were not as famous, you're obviously very famous now, but who really connected with the audience. But you know what, that's why we have you back on the show now [inaudible 00:06:02].\n\nLenny (00:05:22):\nThere we go. It all worked out.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:06:01):\nOpening act, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:06:07):\nSpeaking of Elon, I was always curious, how did you actually get him on the show? I remember that was back before he was very vocal in the world and he was hard to learn from and hear from. How did you actually pull that off?\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:06:18):\nWell, I think it's actually similar to how a lot of good things in my career have happened, which is I just had a conversation on the internet. I have this whole thing where I do think a lot of people trying to get ahead in their career, especially in technology, should just write cold emails, cold DMs, notes, put out content, et cetera and that leads to good things.\n\n(00:06:39):\nIn Elon's case actually, what wound up happening was a few years ago, he DMed me out of the blue. At the time, I was working at Twitter and I think he saw something I'd written and wanted something from the company and I think he went through the org chart and he DMed me. And I was like, \"Well, I'd love to help you,\" and he sent me his phone number. And I called him and I was like, \"Is this [inaudible 00:07:00] and we had a conversation and we built up a relationship after that. This was when Clubhouse first came on the scene and I was like, \"Well, who do we get on?\" and Elon hadn't done a lot of press appearances, I think he's done a lot more since then obviously, and I texted him and he was like, \"I'm game,\" and the rest is history.\n\nLenny (00:07:20):\nAmazing. I love that Elon just DMed you. Sriram-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:07:25):\nSlid into his DMs [inaudible 00:07:25].\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:07:26):\nThe crazy part of that story was I had texted him saying, \"You should come on the show,\" and he said, \"Sure,\" and then he tweeted about it. And I will tell you that when Elon tweets about you and well, even maybe more so now, your phone just melts. And then for the entire afternoon, I had hundred thousands of people asking me what's going to happen, the Clubhouse people-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:07:46):\nBut also on Clubhouse, if you open the Clubhouse app that day, there were so many rooms that were trying to collect questions for us and help us prepare. There was so much pressure just scrolling through the hallway and trying to look through, it's like, \"Oh my God, is this real? We are the people that they're talking about here. This is crazy.\" I don't know if you've listened to the actual thing, but it was pretty cool because we got to ask him questions we've always wanted to ask on like, \"When do we get to Mars?\" it was kind of fun. And then after that, again it was this, we got a bunch of people reaching out and being like, \"You should have asked this question. You guys are not professional journalists.\" And we are like, \"No, we're not. What gave it away?\" We are just random two people who are just talking to this guy, so it was really fun.\n\nLenny (00:08:33):\nYeah, I remember that. I remember journalists were like, \"They're not actually asking him hard questions. How dare they have him on, give him a platform to share things without any criticism?\"\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:08:39):\nAnd we were like, \"We are not those people that you think we are, that's just never been our job.\"\n\nLenny (00:08:46):\nYeah. I have so many questions that spiral from this discussion, but I want to ask one quick Clubhouse question. So Aarthi, you worked at Clubhouse for a while. Very tactically, I feel like they're really smart initially with their growth strategy of just getting fancy, smart people in there talking and pontificating. They had Naval and Marc Andreessen and then eventually, you want other people. And that was such a smart way to get people to get in there and want to get in there to listen to them, to engage with them. What's your take on that as just a growth strategy to get a social network bootstrapped? And then just generally, I guess any thoughts on the journey of Clubhouse? It's had a big rise, it's kind of [inaudible 00:09:22].\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:09:21):\nYeah. I mean, all good questions here. I think growth strategy, that's a great way to acquire people right at the top of the funnel. Once you've done this a few times, you kind of see everything as a funnel and you're like, \"Well, are you retaining people? Are you not? Is it top of the funnel impressions or do they stick around?\" So I think having people like Marc Andreessen and people like Naval and they were not doing this out of any... they were really, really interested. When we got invited by Marc and Marc was like, \"Check out... this was way before a16z even invested in it, was like, \"This product is amazing. These folks are doing something really cool, this is going to be the future, it's amazing.\" So it gave them a platform to go speak out and live social audio just made a ton of sense. I will say, Clubhouse, I feel like they get this unfair attention and criticism. It's a what, three-year-old startup?\n\nLenny (00:10:17):\nMm-hmm.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:10:18):\nAnd I've done two startups. The second one I did, three years in, we still sort of were struggling and trying to figure out what we were doing. So I mean, I feel like founders just need some time to breathe in and figure out what to go do. So I'm bullish on Clubhouse, I think they'll figure it out and Paul and Rohan are great founders. They've been doing social stuff for over a decade plus and so they've got to figure it out. And I know that it's like, they get this thing on, \"Oh, they were really hot during the pandemic. Is this a pandemic fad versus not?\" I don't know, it's a product at the end of the day and you're going to have to find product market fit and I think they'll figure it out.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:10:56):\nYeah. The broader question of how do social products acquire the users is super interesting. One of my favorite pieces written on this is Eugene Wei's Status as a Service. Eugene should absolutely be on your podcast someday. It's a 10,000 word piece, which is amazing and highly suggest people read it. But one of the key takeaways from that piece is the idea that when you have a new network, think of it as a new country, you want the high status people and high status mean they're interesting, people want to be where they are in some shape or form because they have money, they're smart, they're cool, they're good-looking, whatever it may be and you want to get them onto your network. And there's exactly an interesting corollary that they're often underserved by other existing platforms. And because if they're already well-served, they wouldn't want to move to you.\n\n(00:11:43):\nAnd Eugene doesn't talk about it, but if I look at say the history of all the three, four large social media companies, you've seen this pattern. For example, they've often each had a breakout set of stars who are unique to the platform. For example, if you look at say Snapchat, you had folks like Kylie Jenner who really broke out first. If you look at Instagram, I would think The Rock, Cristiano Ronaldo, a lot of others are organic to Instagram. But let's say you get to TikTok. One of the things you'll see is a lot of the folks from the Instagram world rarely move to TikTok and there's a couple of reasons. One, they didn't really need to because they were already popular on some of these other existing platforms, but two, TikTok actually took advantage of a different set of skillsets. People who are really good on video, people who could dance, be funny. And so you saw the rise of Charli D'Amelio and Addison and so many others who are different.\n\n(00:12:31):\nSo every single time, I think you need to go after a set of people who are high status who are also underserved. So coming back to Clubhouse, I think one of the interesting things is I think these celebrities are super interesting, but what is more interesting for me is all the homegrown folks. I actually consider us as a part of that, we would not be here doing the show if it wasn't for Clubhouse. There are many folks who had that original launch using the platform, so I think for folks here who are thinking about social platforms, it's interesting about okay, you need interesting people from elsewhere, but you also need homegrown talent. And by the way, you are a perfect example of this phenomenon because you are Substack's homegrown talent and I think you bring a lot of value to Substack. And there are a lot of people with huge newsletters, et cetera, but I think your rise and your popularity is so tied to Substack now and that's actually a great example of all of this.\n\nLenny (00:13:25):\nYeah. It reminds me, the founder of Musical.ly who turned into TikTok has a great story. I think you've heard his talk about this, how the way he thought about it is there's all these successful people on Instagram, that's Europe, and the people you can convince to come to America are not the kings of Europe, but they're the peasants that are like, \"Oh, we have a new opportunity to rise and become a king or a queen.\" And so those are the people you pull in, the people not doing well on another platform that want to do well versus the people already killing it.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:13:53):\nYeah, [inaudible 00:13:53].\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:13:53):\nLenny just called himself the king of Substack right there.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:13:55):\nYes, I know. You're the king, you're the king of Americas.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:13:58):\nI'm just trying to give you clippable moments on video.\n\nLenny (00:14:00):\nI did just find out that I think I have the fourth-largest Substack newsletter on all of Substack which is ridiculous-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:05):\nThat's amazing, wow. That's amazing.\n\nLenny (00:14:05):\nTheir recent number.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:14:08):\nYeah. Number three, number two, number one, Lenny is coming after you, better watch out.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:08):\nTake them out.\n\nLenny (00:14:12):\nYeah. They're up there. So you mentioned the chat with Elon and how you're very tech positive and I think that's something that you two are at the forefront of, is this trend, I don't know if it's called techno-optimism or maybe there's another term for it and I'd love to hear just like why? Because I know that's important to you too, why that's important to you and just what is this movement of techno-optimism-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:14:32):\nLet me take a small stab at it. Look, I think it's also very personal to our context and our upbringing. For us, Sriram and I came from a fairly middle class family in India, this city in India that most people here won't probably know. And we grew up really liking computers but didn't have access to a computer for a longest time. In both our cases, our parents bought us our first computers after saving money for it and it was a hard thing. And when we eventually got onto it and started learning to write code, we met each other online. We're dating ourselves now, but we met on Yahoo Messenger back in the day and we worked on this nerdy coding project, that's how we connected. So technology and computers have given us everything.\n\n(00:15:19):\nOur first jobs were at Microsoft, we built developer tools and platforms. If you were in our shoes, you would feel the same way too. Tech has given us so much. And so for us to come here all the way from India, through multiple cities, we lived in Seattle and then here, the Bay Area, I've started tech companies, it is a bit frustrating to see the other viewpoint because you can see how much it has uplifted people, careers, lives, but also just from what we've been able to work on, what we've seen our friends work on and ship and put out there, it has dramatically moved the needle. And so for us, we are the living testament of tech actually helping us and help us do better, so I don't even see the other viewpoint from like, why wouldn't you be optimistic about technology? I don't get it.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:16:10):\nYeah. I think the personal part was really core. I think there's generally two schools of thought. One school of thought, I would broadly write up as things are getting worse, technology is making things worse and we should all do less, build less. And then the other school of thought, which I think I subscribe to, is technology is not perfect, the impact technology is definitely uneven, but pretty much most of the good things in the world over the last 100, 200 years are responsible for it. And we can have a whole long discussion about the evidence why and we have lots of very fancy sounding intellectual theories as to why, but at the heart of it is what Aarthi said, if it wasn't for tech, we wouldn't be here, we wouldn't be doing this.\n\n(00:16:45):\nI suspect a lot of folks who are listening to this wouldn't be able to listen to it, wouldn't have the opportunities they have or have the opportunities we have. It is a great level up. My dad pretty much had the same job for his entire life, essentially from age 25 till the time he retired and there was really no easy path out for him. And I imagine like, \"Hey, if he was born 40 years later and he had a laptop and an internet connection and could get on GitHub, here are opportunities that would be just impossible, even 30, 40 years ago and that's all from technology.\" So I think that's at the heart of it, it's the best thing we have of getting ahead.\n\nLenny (00:17:21):\nIt's such a refreshing perspective on tech. In traditional media, all you ever hear about is all the problems that tech is causing and all the dangers and how we're all screwed. And so it's like you almost forget that there could be really positive stories about what's happening with tech and it feels like there's a small number of people that are doing this at scale and-\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:17:40):\nOh, yeah. I'll give you one small example. You made a joke about kings from Europe, et cetera. If we just go back 100 years, the piece of hardware that a king or a royalty would use or a rich person would use would be so different from what a peasant would use, but you know what? I suspect the phone that you and I have is probably the same phone that... actually I know it's the same phone that Elon Musk uses, the richest person in the world. I know a lot of folks in India who have very high end Android device, they have access to the same internet. You go to google.com, google.com doesn't know your net worth, it gives you the same results. Chat GPT doesn't know how rich you are. It may not like you, but it doesn't know how rich you are. If you just think of all these constructs, they're were just impossible technology. But anyway, that's a whole other conversation.\n\nLenny (00:18:24):\nYeah, I love that the richest people have the same phone as me and nothing they can do about it. Something else you two are really good at is building a network, building community, building personal brands. I know a lot of people listening are either often told, \"You need to build a audience online, you build a brand, you got to build a network,\" and all these things. So I guess I'd love to know just what advice do you give people that come to you and like, \"Hey, I want to build a personal brand, I want to build the network\"? Just how to go about doing that, what's worked well for you two?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:18:54):\nSriram has way more structured thoughts on this and honestly, he's way better at this than I've ever been. He's basically slowly corrupted me and brought me to the dark side. But what I have come to believe and this differs from what I used to believe is especially if you're working in a big company, you are one of the many thousands of employees in there. Generally what you get told is, \"Hey, just ship really good products, put your head down, go to work. The products will speak for themselves. That's just how it's going to work. Don't do this whole personal branding and all of that stuff. It's such a distraction,\" and that's generally what you're told.\n\n(00:19:34):\nMost of my career I was like, \"Yeah, of course that makes sense, that's kind of what you do.\" But I've come to realize that that is just not true and this might be a controversial opinion, but you have to get out there and build your own brand. You have to figure out what you stand for, what your core values are, what you believe in, what you think you want to do, what your next career trajectory is going to look like. All of that is just up to you. It's not up to the company to figure it out for you, it's not up to anybody else, it's just up to you.\n\n(00:20:05):\nAnd I think building a personal brand is looked down upon so much that people think of it as a dirty word. It's like, \"No, you can't do that.\" \"Oh, look at this person who's branding themselves,\" kind of thing. But I almost see it as what distinguishes you from everybody else and that is not so much saying something that you're not good at or touting yourself more, it's really about highlighting, \"I'm really good at this thing and I want to talk about this thing and I want to do videos about it or write about it or tweet about it.\" Whatever is your forum, you have to put yourself out there.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:20:43):\nI mean this is probably one of the most important things that somebody can do and I spent... no, we spent years slowly climbing the corporate ranks. We were junior product managers, IC product managers, senior product managers, slowly climbed the ranks and ran teams, et cetera. And I spent years just thinking that all I need to do is put my head down, do my job really well and that was it. But then I looked around and I suspect a lot of listeners here probably have the same feeling that some sort of people were getting way more opportunities, some sort of people are way farther ahead even though I was mostly sure that somebody else was doing a better job and I was trying to understand why. And I think building a network, which I'll try and define because I think a lot of people have assumption of what it is, is at the heart of this. So building a network is very simply having relationships with human beings. And let's start off by saying first of all, these have to be authentic, genuine relationships.\n\n(00:21:29):\nOne thing, it drives me crazy when somebody will come and say, \"I'm here to network.\" I'm like, \"I don't know what that word means.\" So all you're trying to do is have authentic, genuine relationship with people and expecting nothing in return, so that's great. And then people are like, \"Oh, well that's awesome, but I'm a senior... for example, I was a senior PM at Microsoft for a bunch of time and then kind of similar at Facebook for a bunch of time, you're like, \"Well, what does it mean? I'm here, I'm going to my meetings, I'm doing my day, its only so many hours.\" I'll be like, \"Well, let's start off with go and meet every single peer that you have you don't directly meet with. Go get coffee with them and ask them, 'Hey.' Have no agenda. Just ask them what's going on in their life, who are they, what their life story is and then who are a couple of interesting people that you should meet with? Go talk to your manager and go talk to their peers.\"\n\n(00:22:14):\nSuper important, by the way, your manager, peer relations are super important. Go have a coffee with them and they'd be like, \"Great, I'm love to meet this person.\" Then when I joined at Facebook, I was notorious for being the person who sent a cold email to every single Facebook leader. And I'd be like, \"Hey, I'm new here, I want to meet. Let's grab coffee,\" and everybody will say as everyone is a new person and always asking the same thing, which I'll be like, I show up, I'll tell them my story, I'll ask for their story. I'll be like, \"What are you folks focused on? How can I help?\" Again, no expectation of anything in return. And then I'll be like, \"Who else should I talk to?\"\n\n(00:22:42):\nYou do this, you do two coffees a week and literally just ask me two hours a week, everyone has two hours a week, it'll start compounding over overtime and time. And then as the years go by, you keep in touch with the people you used to work with you, these folks will go to other places, five years, six years go by, you start in your mid-20s or late 20s and you know hundreds of people all over. And the important thing about this is that it is a resource in so many different places. For example, one, if you ever need help, you're trying to look for a new role or you're trying to be like, \"Hey, I want to hire this person, who knows something about this person?\" or, \"I want a new role. Who's looking for something?\" that network becomes your key resource.\n\n(00:23:21):\nNow what I think a lot of people don't do, it's just simple things. Number one is often people just have a great meeting with a peer and then they will never ever follow up. I'm sure a lot of us have the amazing first introduction email they never followed up, don't do that. I try and make it a point to make sure I always meet them once a year, once every six months. I'll just leave a note, \"Hey, what's up?\" And the other key part is expecting nothing in return. And generally people are very good at reading other people and if you go and being like, \"Hey, I just want to meet you because I want a job or I'm here to network,\" whatever that means, they don't want to meet you. Just go and be very curious about who they are and try and help them. And you'll be surprised wherever you start, within a year, two years, you'll know hundreds of people who you can tap into, so I think that is super powerful. That's just building relationships.\n\n(00:24:05):\nThe other part is brand building. Both Aarthi and I at different points in our career have gotten feedback in our job saying, \"Oh, with Sriram and Aarthi, it's brand build too much, et cetera.\" I have learned that that is terrible feedback and to totally ignore that and if anybody hears anything like that, just totally ignore that. The things that work well for me and a lot of others is putting yourself out there and that can be anything. That can be like you make a presentation internally, you write tweets, you're prolific on GitHub, you make a YouTube video, it doesn't really matter, but put yourself out there because the internet rewards people being out there. And what happens when you put yourself out there? It's a Bat-Signal. It's telling people that, \"Hey, I'm here, this is my body of work,\" and you know what the internet does? It'll send amazing people to you.\n\n(00:24:45):\nYou'd be amazed how often somebody just have a random great Twitter thread with no followers and somebody super interesting will email them and that leads to amazing things happening, it encourages serendipity. So over the years, I wish I had listened less to people who said I should not do this and listened more to the people who said I should do this more.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:25:02):\nI also think, Sriram keeps saying, \"Expect nothing in return,\" I think the other way I see it is this is again an extension of optimism for us. Generally, we think people like to help each other out, that is just in their true nature. It's not meant to be transactional, it's not meant to be, \"If I know them, they will somehow do something for me down the road,\" it's not that. Just the way we are all building communities and are a part of this broader community, the way we work is we all want to help each other and help them be successful. And if that is in your nature, it's hard to not feel like, \"Yeah, of course I want to reach out to them. I want to see what I can do to help them. Maybe something good will happen, we'll collaborate on a project together,\" whatever. The core tenant being don't expect stuff in return, don't do it on a transactional basis, I think is really important.\n\nLenny (00:25:53):\nWhat this reminds me of is Naval has this tweet that proved to be so true, which is don't network, instead create amazing things, create value, do good work and then people will want to network with you. And that's really stuck with me and it saves you from going to network events. Instead just go work hard, do awesome stuff and people are going to want to meet you.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:26:12):\nI mean you will not believe the number of times I've shown up to some meetup or some founder thing or something and then somebody would come up and be like, \"I'm here to network, what's your name?\" And I'm like, \"What? No, you can't do that. Not how that works.\"\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:26:26):\nI actually say I disagree with Naval on this because often, when you're part of a large organization, it's really hard to do great work and get recognized for it. You're part of a team, which is great, but it's not the same as saying having a newsletter by yourself or having a piece of content by yourself. So when I was younger, I'd be like, \"Great, I'm part of a large part-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:26:48):\nI don't know, I mean you guys are saying the same thing, he's just saying create value and put it out there. I don't think it's-\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:26:53):\nYeah, I think the putting it out there part is super interesting. And also I would just say, don't wait to create amazing things. Often just the act of putting yourself out there can just spur amazing things in itself.\n\nLenny (00:27:05):\nYeah. And I think especially early in your career, you're not going to create amazing things immediately, so there's a lot of value to reaching out and meeting people. There's a couple of directions I want to go here. One is, so you gave this, I don't know, just mini masterclass on building a network and networking and things like that. I think what'll get people to rewind and listen to that again is I don't think people realize just how connected you two are. You're at the center of so many micro communities of the most incredible people. I don't know if you talk about this, but you run all these micro communities of incredible people in, I don't know, creator land and investors and product people and all these people and so it actually has worked. You may be the most networked person there is and I don't know if people know that.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:27:47):\nOh, wow. Is that a good thing? I don't know. Is that-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:27:47):\nIt's a good thing.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:27:51):\nIt's a good thing. Okay, I like that, I'll go with that.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:27:53):\nI think the thing that, well at least with Sriram, outside of all of the masterclass stuff which I think he's particularly good at, I think the thing that Sriram, people don't realize about him is he's just inherently incredibly curious about people. He's just really just wants to know what somebody else does, who they are, what their story is. And this is not some like, \"Oh, I'm going to spend 10 minutes letting them talk, I'm going to spend... he often never lets the other person talk, but when he does, he's truly-\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:27:53):\nHold on a second right there.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:28:26):\n... but he is truly curious about who they are, what their story is. By now, we've known each other for 20-ish years and this is every dinner, every event, this is just how he's wired and so you just can't fake that in building out a network. He builds a network by just wanting to know who these people are.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:28:49):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (00:28:50):\nThat's beautiful.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:28:51):\nThe woman I married, ladies and gentlemen, right there. You marry the right person, everything else becomes [inaudible 00:28:56]. I haven't really talked about this before and I'll keep some of this slightly hidden, but I think the heart of it is I'm just curious about people, I'm just dumb about a lot of things. And I don't mean it as this false modesty way, I know a lot of folks are smarter than me. Lenny obviously is so much smarter than me at writing a Substack newsletter, it's just evident, Andrew Huberman is great at... Brian Armstrong great at building a crypto company, all these folks just evident. But what I realized is a lot of folks sometimes just want to be with other amazing peers. And one sort of hack I built over the years, I was like, \"All right, let me just bring interesting people together.\"\n\n(00:29:34):\nSo I bring them in, let's just say various kinds of online communities, they're probably over 100 at this point. And I say, \"Okay. You trust me, you trust me and I make the rules.\" Everyone keeps some level of confidence, everyone is a peer, they're all accomplished in their own way, no one is rude or mean or goes off the rails. So I'm a party host, so I'm like, \"Okay listen, nobody is going to get super crazy over here,\" but I'm also curating. I'm like, \"Well, I need somebody super thoughtful, I need somebody who's a little controversial, I need somebody who's funny, I need somebody who's like the celebrity... I'm trying to put together, engineer the right vibe or the right atmosphere, but digitally, I'm very anti-social in person. And some of these just happen over time. You put together the group of people and they hang out online and over times, you have a very famous CEO becoming best friends with somebody in their early 20s who's just getting started just because they're in the same space together.\n\n(00:30:35):\nSo I love creating those online spaces and I think it's something anybody here listening can do. Just take some of your favorite people, stick them in a WhatsApp group or a Telegram group or a Slack channel... which is by the way, Lenny's Slack, highly, highly recommend it. Lenny is great at that. But yours has hundreds of thousands of people and I think sometimes there's an intimacy from having smaller groups, like 5 people, 10 people like a shared space and then kick it off. And you'll be amazed of after a year or two, of how much intimacy and how much connection where sometimes people open up about losing their jobs or having a divorce or something really personal and intense just because of the shared trust. And I think there's something very heartwarming and fulfilling about being able to facilitate some of that.\n\nLenny (00:31:22):\nI want to dig into that a little bit more. You've built these incredible communities and you talked about a couple, and Aarthi, I know you also built Facebook's early community products and Clubhouse. Obviously if you had to pick one or two things you got to get right with a new community that you're just forming, what do you think those two things are or one or two things?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:31:38):\nFind the niche, start really small and find the niche. I think oftentimes I've seen other startup founders and I invest and advise in a lot of early stage companies. I went through Y Combinator, so I go back to YC as much as I can and go help out folks. But oftentimes I'll see people starting companies or founders coming in and being like, \"I'm going to build this product that is going to cater to this community. I'm going to build this world's largest community off this kind of thing,\" and it almost starts at this super scaled version and then they set themselves up for failure.\n\n(00:32:14):\nYou're almost better off doing these small, niche, non-scalable things to go find these oddball set of people who are doing this, who are really interested in this one thing and kind of scale from there and grow from there. And I think that's one big thing that when you're starting to build a community, don't start to build this super scaled community. Start with few people who are passionate about a particular problem and want to get together kind of thing. Start there. Two, I think people, and this might be a controversial thing, but I often think people don't think through monetization. If you're a community builder early on, start thinking about, if you're truly focused on this as a business, how would you actually make money off of it?\n\n(00:32:55):\nOftentimes they hit some sort of scale and be like, \"Crap, now what do I do? And then they're try all these options, they will have some churn and then they're like, \"Oh no, but I thought this was a very sticky community.\" I'm like, \"Yes, but it's not as sticky as this particular price tag.\" And so you have to start thinking through, if we hit a particular velocity, what is that going to look like? What are the things that I'm going to unlock. And think through monetization a little bit ahead of time before it comes in and becomes a crutch rather than a weapon that you can go leverage.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:33:24):\nBut I want to say, Aarthi is kind of the creator of Facebook Stars and of so much of the thinking there and I can see her go super deep on this. Of course on everything she said, I have a slightly different framework. First of all, I really don't like the word community because the word community, the word networking, the word platform is a little abstract and it can mean a lot of things. And I like to think of things like a dinner party or church or things that seem more tangible and people know, \"Okay, I know exactly what that is.\" So when I think of a community or starting one, I think first of all, it's a party. And you're first starting off, you're like, \"All right, what is a vibe?\"\n\n(00:33:57):\nFor example and this is also true for every social media platform where if you can be a crazy, people are dancing on bars, having a great time, getting really drunk party or you can have a really formal dinner where everyone is seated, there is plates with name tags and there's a clinking of glasses and you have to dress up. And they're both fine, they're both fun in their own way, but you need to tell people, as the host, which one it is. And by the way, I think one of the things that Twitter didn't get right in the original days which some of the other apps did, it never told people what kind of party it was. It like, \"Are we going to Michelin star restaurant where sit down or it's a sports bar after the Super Bowl and you can go crazy?\" And if you don't do that, people make up their own rules. That's number one.\n\n(00:34:37):\nThe second part is as the host, you have to curate the original set of people and you need a mix, this is super important. I think sometimes people do this thing where they either optimize for \"interesting famous people\" or they get the most talkative lot of people. And I actually read a bunch of books on hosting great dinner parties, I actually have some interesting suggestions there and it'll say like, \"Well, you need a mix.\" For example, in any organization, let's say you're the VP that everyone knows about, but that VP doesn't have the time to maybe participate on a WhatsApp channel or a Slack channel and chit-chat all the time or show up for everything. And then maybe you need the really boisterous young BD exec who's out and about and meeting everybody. You need that person, you need somebody who's quiet and thoughtful. You need to merge different kinds of energy and that's almost an alchemy and that's more art than science. You have to start there.\n\n(00:35:27):\nThird I think is as the host, you have to have a sixth sense of how is a community feeling at any given point in time? Are two people dominating the conversation? That person hasn't said anything in a while. One of the things I like to when somebody joins a group or one of these places, I try and get them into a question which they will feel happy about because you know what happens the very first time you walk into a party? You look around, you're like, \"I don't know anybody here. Oh gosh, okay. I know this one person and I'm going to go talk to them,\" and you just feel nervous. I'm trying to break that. For example, if you walk in a place and you didn't know anybody, Lenny is actually very good at being social, but I'd be like, \"Hey. Lenny has one of the most popular things on Substack and he just wrote [inaudible 00:36:04]. I'm just giving you an opening, you to feel comfortable and that's another part.\n\n(00:36:08):\nThe third part I love is rituals and religions do a great job of this, which is do something every month. There's a little group I hosted some of my friends and during all of COVID, we did a Zoom meeting every Tuesday evening. And that was a ritual, it had nothing, it's just Zoom meeting with a bunch of friends, people can share-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:36:23):\nAnd people would just bring their glass of wine or bring their kids in and there's no structured agenda. But people started looking forward to it through the pandemic and stuff and we would be like, \"Oh my God, it's Tuesday. You know this evening, we are going to go do this thing.\" And it was a really great way to go build that community and I totally agree with that.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:36:43):\nYeah, well Lenny has done an amazing job on it on his Slack, I see it.\n\nLenny (00:36:46):\nYou're so sweet.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:36:47):\nThe other interesting tension and challenge is how to grow it because I think there are... Interesting point, a four person dinner, very different from an eight person dinner, very different from a 20 person thing where people hang out, very different from, once you start getting hundreds of thousands, the things you're willing to share, worrying about being judged. So I'm always trying to create more intimate different spaces and that's a whole other topic. So I think if you're trying to start a community though, I would say picking the right people, setting the tone, being really part of it yourself, that's most of it.\n\nLenny (00:37:21):\nAmazing. There's so many little nuggets of advice there. I feel like we could do a whole other episode on just community building strategy. Today's episode is brought to you by LMNT. I just recently discovered the stuff, actually from another podcast and it is such sweet, salty goodness. LMNT is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency.\n\n(00:37:55):\nLMNT is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes, also dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on LMNT to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try LMNT totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is Watermelon Salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer, stay salty.\n\n(00:38:36):\nI want to go back to a topic we touched on that I think is really interesting which is building a brand and putting content out and that kind of thing. I think a lot of times people hear that, like a first-year PM and they're like, \"Yes, I'm going to start tweeting.\" And then it's such cringey useless stuff and nobody needs to hear from them because they haven't done anything. And I guess I'd be curious for your take on, at what point should people start to put things out? How do you know if this is cringey and nobody wants to hear this stuff like, \"Great PM-ship,\" these very cliche things come out. There's like hundreds of Twitter accounts, people are just tweeting these things like, \"All right.\" How do you think about that [inaudible 00:39:14].\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:39:14):\nI actually disagree with you and I actually think everyone should... well disclaimer, I work for firm which has invested in Twitter, but I swear that's not why I'm saying this, people have heard me say this for years-\n\nLenny (00:39:24):\nAnd Substack.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:39:25):\nYup. Everyone should tweet or everyone should post on YouTube or post Instagram and it doesn't matter how young you are. Because I actually disagree with the few things, which actually is a great point which I think a lot of people feel this, one is that you need to have hit a certain bar of accomplishment or interestingness to say something, strongly disagree with that. Second, that things are cringey. I don't think anything is cringey, I strongly disagree with that too. And I think these are both interesting-\n\nLenny (00:39:51):\nAarthi's face is great.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:39:53):\nWait, I feel like Sriram's bar is so low for-\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:39:55):\nDude, no, this is really important because I think what stops a lot of people is, I've had probably 100 plus conversations where somebody who's incredibly accomplished will come to me and they'll be like, \"Hey, I want to get on Twitter, I want write content or I want to Substack or I want to do a podcast.\" I'm like, \"Great.\" They're like, \"But I don't know what to say, I look dumb, I don't want to get judged.\" But I'm like, \"No, you're so accomplished,\" and it is the fear of being judged that so often stops people. So whenever I hear that word cringe, I'm like, \"No, no, no, that's actually fine, you're fine. You'll figure it out,\" and here's why I say that.\n\n(00:40:30):\nNumber one is what the most important thing and even, listen, if you just remember one thing from this whole thing is just get started and do something every single day. And this sounds so basic, like Aarthi and I have is a running joke where it's like it's diet and exercise is what we say. It's like we are talking to people about how do you get healthy and you have the 100 different things you can do or podcasts you can listen to, but most of it's like, \"Well, diet and exercise.\" And with creating content, diet and exercise, you just write a piece of content every single day because what's going to happen is it builds muscle, it gets you familiar with the medium and you start understanding what works in that medium and what doesn't and you start building reps.\n\n(00:41:08):\nYou know who never works out in my opinion? Is somebody who'll think for weeks, build up an amazing tweetstorm, blog post, newsletter, whatever it may be and then stops because the effort is so high. So I'm like, \"One, do something every single day.\" The second part of it is, I actually think you don't have to talk about what you accomplish, you only have to talk about you. And by the way, this is going to sound very froufrou, but you are the best you out there. So for example-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:41:33):\nWow, okay.\n\nLenny (00:41:36):\n[inaudible 00:41:36].\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:41:36):\n... let's say you are a 21-year-old PM, fresh out of school, first year... by the way, we were all that. I was a 21-year-old PM at one time, Lenny would've been too, lots of others. First you'll see a lot of people who have been through journey and there are others like you. Second is you just talk about your journey, talk about what you're doing, talk about what you're learning. Because what often you're trying to do when you're creating content is to build a relationship with people. So when Charli D'Amelio dances on TikTok, she's not saying she's a professional dancer, she's saying, \"I'm relatable, I'm just like somebody you would be friends with next door, I'm just like you.\" And so then people start connecting with you on that front, if you're authentic and you're doing a good job, and so everybody listening to this should be able to create content.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:42:17):\nOkay, so the only place where I disagree, I think this is all right, but this is a bit like, we are Asian, we have this very Asian parent thinking, there are no participation trophies, so if it is cringey, you should at least acknowledge that it is cringey. I think at the end of the day, you have to persevere, I think I give a lot more words to people who are just persevering and showing up every day, but I do think there should be a level of self-awareness for people where it's like, \"Man, this is not great. I'm not getting any traction. I need to improve on things and keep building on it,\" as opposed to being like, \"I am the best me ever,\" and just keep putting out garbage, don't do that. Improve on stuff because there is such a thing as bad content-\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:43:03):\nI agree with you, but I think when people mean cringey... okay, I'll see this. What people think they say cringey, it's like our peer group thinks that this content is too basic-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:43:11):\nBut everybody has that, whether you say it out loud or not.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:43:15):\nWell, I'll give you a story. So I spent years, I'd be like, \"I'm a PM leader, I run organization, I should write smart PM things. I should write the kinds of things that Lenny writes.\" For example, I'll say that, \"Lenny's Post the other week from Duolingo is... I was so jealous. I was like, \"Man, this is the kind of content... I would be like, \"It's amazing, banger post.\" But the problem was when you start doing that, you start censoring yourself. And I'll say, I've written a lot of posts over the years and I'll try and sound smart, I have a great intellectual framework in some of this work, but you know what my most popular post and tweetstorm of all time is? It is how to write a cold email.\n\n(00:43:48):\nAnd when I wrote that tweetstorm, I was like, \"Man, I'm going to sound so dumb,\" because Lenny doesn't need to know how to write a cold email and neither does the VCs I work with, everyone knows that. But the thing is, what is obvious to you and may seem cringey to your peers is definitely not obvious to a lot of people and they will connect to you, they will relate to you. When somebody says like, \"Well, is it too basic? How do I get started with my job?\" I'm like, \"No, there's a lot of people who this is not obvious to,\" and I'll just put myself out there and what's the worst thing? Somebody thinks you're moron? That's fine. You put some new piece of content out there the next day and they'll fix it or you can just ignore that.\n\nLenny (00:44:23):\nI think there's a lot of really good nuggets here. I think the only area maybe we disagree and we should move on, but this is [inaudible 00:44:29].\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:44:30):\nListen to me, Lenny, come on. Your podcast is too friendly otherwise, let's listen.\n\nLenny (00:44:34):\nMy feeling is I think for helping you do better work kind of content, like entertainment anyone could do no problem, you could be awesome at it, is I feel like you need to do something in your career first before you can start speaking to, \"Here's things I've learned and here's what works and here's what doesn't work.\" I think I wouldn't spend a lot of time sharing all your wisdom before you've done a thing and been successful in some way.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:44:53):\nYeah. I actually think you make a very interesting point, which is I think a lot of people online LARP, live action role-play, as somebody else which is like you trying to project a persona or a career point that you are not at and you know it, we know it, you probably admit you know it-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:45:14):\nAnd also for that kind of content, everyone can tell. I think it just comes off as not authentic. I mean I feel like the universe figures itself out over time, but I do think there is a level of, just because Sriram thinks no content is cringey does not mean people all feel that way. You can't just magically just wipe that out. I feel like everyone just feels that way, whether or not you say it out loud. I do think there is a process of iteration and acknowledging that, \"Yeah, okay, this is bad, but I'm going to put this out there anyway and we'll just keep working on this,\" and coming back to it.\n\n(00:45:46):\nI really appreciate people who would just do that and just keep coming back to it every day and like Rocky style, chip away at things. I really have appreciation for those folks because it's hard. I've realized over time that everyone is deeply feeling as if they're imposters and we talked about this. Imposter syndrome is so real, it is so gut-wrenchingly real that it's not just every one person, it's most people I think. So to be able to overcome that threshold and look at your amazing peers and your seniors and everybody else and then still be able to put yourself out there, I think we have to really appreciate that and help them go iterate and just get better over time.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:46:27):\nYeah, I agree. One tiny story before we wrap on this topic, which is I was talking to somebody who's four or five years into their career as a PM and they'd written this post on LinkedIn which is full of cringey content, by the way. Okay, let me say it, LinkedIn has a lot of cringey PM content-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:46:27):\nWow, look at Sriram.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:46:42):\n... I'm sorry LinkedIn folks. And it was one of the things about how do you set product strategy as an organization and I was like, I called them, I was like, \"Dude, come on. You're four years into your role, nobody believes that you actually are driving this from a place of actually really knowing it. And that is fine if you're learning, but you are trying to project this person you're not.\" But the thing which I was talking to him, I was like, \"I know you've done this amazing deep dive on this other niche topic. You've gone out, you read all the posts, go write about that because you are an expert legitimately in something you think is niche, as opposed to a fake expert on this other thing you want to be.\"\n\n(00:47:17):\nHe went and wrote this follow-up post on something very niche and that went really popular because the truth is, there's not a lot of great content out there, especially great content from people who actually done the thing. You'd be surprised how niche you can be, but if you actually done the work, talk to a people, aggregated some posts, people come seek you out and you don't have to do it. So anyway, so lots of LARPing, lots of cringey LinkedIn content for sure.\n\nLenny (00:47:43):\nJust to close this out, I 100% agree with the idea that people should be just trying stuff, writing, sharing stuff on Twitter, LinkedIn, just get it out of there, don't be afraid because that's how you start down this road. I was going to go in a different direction, but you mentioned imposter syndrome and I'm curious, have you two dealt with imposter syndrome and-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:48:01):\nOh, yeah. We have and I still, I don't know about Sriram. Sriram comes off as so much more confident and has so much gravitas that nobody ever thinks of it, but we both do, we both deeply have imposter syndrome. Every single day, anything we do, we look at ourselves, we are creators, we have this show on YouTube and then we look around at everybody else who have millions of subscribers and followers and everything and we are like, \"Why are we creators? This is not a thing. We should not be doing this stuff. I just think people haven't been honest with us on how much we suck.\" It's like you have these loops in your head and then every once in a while, you'll see a comment being like, \"This was amazing. I just had to stop doing what I was doing to listen to this whole thing. It was so valuable for me.\" And you're like, \"Oh, okay. We are not all the bad. That's, I think, okay.\"\n\n(00:48:48):\nSo we go through this a lot. For the longest time, I had really severe imposter syndrome through school, college, getting into Microsoft. Even after I got through the Microsoft, which we were one of the youngest product managers there, I still was like, \"Oh, someday they're going to figure out that this was all... they'll know the real me and they'll be like, 'Oh man, we made this mistake with her.'\" And it was just such a real crippling thing for me. Even now I feel like maybe it's not 100% true, but I can kind of see the gradients there, so very real thing.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:49:27):\nYeah, it's so true. I have a hack or a technique of how to get over imposter syndrome. But I'll just say, and this is just if folks here feel it, every new job I've been in, I have always felt that I didn't deserve to be there and I mean I genuinely. When I joined Microsoft, I was a young student, I was like, \"I don't know anything. These folks are professional, they've been doing this job for years.\" When I moved to the US I said, \"Look, my accent is super intense, I'm Indian, these folks have been doing this for many years, they have very different lifestyles, I don't know what I'm doing here.\" When I move to Silicon Valley, I got no hired by probably four or five different companies and one of them told me, \"You work for Microsoft so you can't really cut it in Silicon Valley because you're from Seattle,\" which I'll never forget.\n\n(00:50:07):\nAnd I look at the person from LinkedIn from time to time, I'm very typically like, \"Well, I've cut it now,\" and I'm very petty that way. And then of course and then when I start running large organizations, several hundred people or more, I was like, \"I've never done this before.\" I'm in a meeting, everyone is looking to me, \"Do they know that I've not done this before? Because I haven't done this before and can they tell?\" And it's every step of the way. So it just pushes every step of the way and in the beginning, it was quite crippling, but over time, you build things to help you. And I think for those listening, if you feel this way, the thing I've learned to do is you have to retreat to a place where you feel real mastery of. So for example, when I was at Microsoft, I was like, \"Well, I don't speak the language very well, English,\" and I had an accent, et cetera, but I knew that I was the most online developer person out there.\n\n(00:50:57):\nI knew every single online community, I was very plugged into open source, so in every meeting when the topic would come to, \"Hey, what is happening with Ruby on Rails?\" I was like, \"I know this better than everybody else,\" and I learned to put together a presentation. Because then you start with the base of something that you feel super comfortable in and you build from that. And what you realize when you build from that is you are like, \"Oh, actually you know what? People really respect that and they react to that.\" And I also learned not to do other things. For example, for them for years where I would listen to people from a certain academic background or I'll be like, \"I wish I could do slide decks like they could,\" or, \"I wish I could have these intentional... but I was like, \"That doesn't really matter. You just need to come from a place where you are confident you've done the work.\"\n\n(00:51:39):\nSo if you folks are listening and you feel imposter syndrome, next time you walk into a meeting, just think about, \"Okay, this is a place where I know I spend so many nights and weekends,\" and it can be super tiny, it can be one little button, one customer, but you've done the work, you've had multiple conversations, it is [inaudible 00:51:54]. And you start from there, you talk about that and you build out from that and you will feel comfortable. So I've done that in pretty much every role now and I still catch myself doing-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:52:03):\nYeah, I think for me, when I was a first time founder, I definitely felt that way and there was all this, at that time, which was conventional wisdom. Nobody we knew at that time were founders, it's not our friend circle, they all worked in medium to big companies. My family, nobody has ever been a founder, entrepreneur, it's not a thing. And so when I started this I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm making a mistake.\" But then you read all these people tweeting or writing posts, being like, \"If you're a founder you'll be really good at fundraising. Best founders learn how to... I sucked at fundraising. I was so bad at it. It was just like, \"Oh, you have to be able to tell your story.\"\n\n(00:52:41):\nI tried. I email like 250 founders, took 85 meetings and 50 plus second meetings and then got 30 checks. This was my seed round which took eight months to close or something and I was like, \"Oh my God, I'm so bad at this. I should just give up right now.\" And then I started building this startup and I was like, \"Actually I'm really, really good at understanding customer acquisition and really trying to find creative ways to cheaply acquire customers.\" And I kind of started putting together playbooks on it, what I can go do there and I tried this, I tried this, then I started talking to few for our own investors and I'm like, \"I don't know if your portfolio companies are finding this useful, but I tried these tactics.\" And they were like, \"Oh my God, I'd never heard of that.\"\n\n(00:53:28):\nAnd so I realized that that's the one place I could be really good at and I can grow my business in a really profitable way very quickly. And then investors started talking to me about other companies and all of that stuff and it became a thing and that helped me get more confidence over time. It was like, who cares if I can't do these other things? I can do these few things and this is really, really important to build a sustainable business and I think I can do that. And that for me kind of helped me get over it. It's not anyone telling me, \"Don't worry, you'll be good at it,\" that never helped, it was just I had to do it myself to figure it out.\n\nLenny (00:54:02):\nIt's interesting both of your pieces of advice is find the thing you're actually good at and then just lean into that as much as possible. That's something I learned from an executive coach I worked with once that you have strengths, you have weaknesses, you can accomplish almost all the things you want accomplish through the lens of the strengths without using those weaknesses as much and that really was pretty transformative.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:54:21):\nThat's actually such a profound point and I wish somebody had told me that earlier in my career because early in my career, I would get all this advice like, \"Oh, Sriram is too loud and too boisterous.\" And the thing is, nobody I know has ever become successful by trying to fix their weaknesses, it's just impossible. The only way you succeed is one, you might need to mitigate some of them, especially if they're really, really holding you back. But you have to lean into your strengths, which is a weird thing because I think when we do performance feedback, it's feedback and so much time we are like, \"Well, these are all the good things and then let's talk about the ways you know can improve.\"\n\n(00:54:53):\nIt's almost the flip time and I think if you're doing performance feedback, you'll be like, \"Well, these are things you're really good at, let's make you even much better at that. Let's make you fly faster, run harder, close the deal, write better code.\" Oh yeah, and some people are mad at you for these things. You should watch it and maybe fix some if it's really bad, but that's not what's going to pull you ahead. It's the superpowers that's going to really pull you ahead, so let's focus on that.\n\nLenny (00:55:15):\nYeah. The way I think about that is the weaknesses can't be liabilities, you can't just get on stage and melt and explode, but you don't have to be amazing. As long as you can email really well, write documents really well, communicate in other ways if that's a strength. One last trick while we're on this topic, I was just reading Hunter Walk's blog and he shared a cool trick for imposter syndrome where you just have to ask yourself, \"Am I so good at pretending that people don't see what's actually happening? Am I actually that good to being this imposter? Probably not, the people can tell,\" and it's really unlikely you're actually an imposter.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:55:46):\nAlso, by the way, the reality is and this a cliche is people are just not thinking about you.\n\nLenny (00:55:51):\nRight.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:55:52):\nThat's true. Yeah, you're giving other people too much credit that they're focused on somebody else. Everyone is so busy focusing on themselves and their own insecurities and fear and just living life. And think about ourselves, when was the last time we thought about somebody else and were like, \"That person, probably an imposter\"? We just don't have the time for it.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:55:52):\nYeah, I've been thinking about me this whole time.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:55:52):\nI am not surprised.\n\nLenny (00:56:20):\nYou guys are hilarious. There's something I actually along these lines I was going to ask about. I remember, Sriram, when you were just getting out of the companies you worked at, you made this point that you were an IC and you were in these meetings where people are reviewing your work and they're making decisions and you're the person presenting. And then all of a sudden, you're the person reviewing all their work and making the decisions and no one trained you to be that person where you're like, \"Oh my God, I'm that person they're all looking for for all these answers?\" And I'm curious just how you worked through that and what advice you'd have for people that are maybe going through that transition?\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:56:49):\nYeah, it's a good question. First of all, it's kind of a jarring change because you realize, \"Well, I have power, but I'm also called upon to do a bunch of things,\" because no meeting, let's call it an exec review, let's say and you're the exec they're presenting too. It doesn't really matter what your title is. All of a sudden, you're having to do a bunch of things. You're making decisions, but you're also providing feedback, sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly.\n\n(00:57:10):\nYou might piss off somebody by naming somebody and not naming the other person, you might piss off somebody by not inviting them to the meeting. You might have to feel like, \"Well, I really want to overrule this person, but if I do, they might get mad at me.\" And there are so many different things which you have to keep in your head as well as like, \"Is this the right path for the team, for the company,\" or whatever the situation is and it can be really overwhelming. And I learned a lot of how to do great exec reviews from my time at Facebook, from Zuck and from Andrew Bosworth. Andrew Bosworth, Boz, has some great posts on his site, boz.com, about how to do reviews and-\n\nLenny (00:57:40):\nI'm trying to get him on this podcast by the way.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (00:57:42):\nOh, that sounds good. He's great.\n\nSriram Krishnan (00:57:43):\nHe's great, he's fantastic. Let me know when you have him, I have some questions I want to get you to ask him. But Boz had a few ways of thinking. First of all, let's start with Zuck. Thing I loved about Zuck's exec reviews was that it was clear when you walked into the room that you are talking to one of the most powerful people on the planet. But what he did which not a lot of other people in this position do, is he would tell you what the rules of engagement were for every meeting or [inaudible 00:58:08]. He'd be like, \"Look, I'm going to give you a spectrum of A, how much I care about this topic. Everything from I don't care, I don't know why you're talking to me, do I care kind of care little? I kind of care so I'm happy you're getting this update, do I really want you to do this? But you know what, if you overrule me, that's fine. All the way to I'm the founder, I'm the CEO, just do this.\" But he will make it clear where he stood on the spectrum.\n\n(00:58:27):\nThe second thing he would make clear is why he believed the things he did. For example, the very first time I pitched him on what is the Facebook Audience Network which grew into probably one of the largest ad networks on mobile, he had all these sort of ideas, he was like, \"We shouldn't do an ad network because,\" and he had all these opinions on, \"Well, mobile ads all look terrible, they are spammy, X, Y and Z.\" But he was really good at articulating those to you and also saying, \"Well, if you can prove me wrong on these legs of my logic tree, I will let you overrule me, unless I have a strong opinion.\" So when you walk in a meeting, you're like, \"Well, I know the framework, I know what the dance is, do you convince him?\" Or maybe there's no shot to convince him and that's fine. He's the CEO and that's fine too.\n\n(00:59:10):\nSo I really learnt that it's so important to clarify for your team the framework you're operating in with you. And it's also maybe a clarifying function for yourself as so how do you actually feel about this and why do you feel like that? That's number one. The second part of it is inside a meeting, there's a few things I think you need to do which is clarify what kind of meeting is it. Is it just an update? \"Great. We're just going to get an update? I'm going to listen to you, I'm going to applaud you for a job well done, I'm going to send you on your way.\" Or is it a decision in which case, what are the pros, cons, et cetera? There are some real big failure modes where one kind of meeting slides into another kind of meeting where somebody is like, \"Why are we doing that? Is that a thing?\"\n\n(00:59:46):\nAnd then somebody will start fighting on and people are like, \"Oh gosh, we shouldn't have brought this topic at all.\" And everyone listening to this has probably been to one of those meetings. There's also something else which teams sometimes like to do, which is they'd be like, \"Hey, we have a hard problem. We don't know what to do.\" They're trying to kind of push the responsibility of the [inaudible 01:00:02] from them to you which may be fine, but you should be like, \"Hey, are you saying that you can't make up your mind and you want me to make up your mind for you?\" You want to be very explicit because often I've seen this when there are hard decisions, teams are like, \"The exec feels strongly, we don't want to know what to do,\" and they kind of want to push the accountability to you and here, we watch out for that a lot.\n\n(01:00:25):\nThere are a lot of hygiene things we think are very important. For example, send out a pre-read before, make sure it's the right people in the room, not everybody, but not missing out key people. Make sure you're paying complete attention, make sure everyone gets a chance to talk which by the way, I was really bad at. And those things go a really long way. Oh, and one final thing, have a regular rhythm to those, so you're doing this every month, et cetera. What I hate, I stole this line from Gokul Rajaram, is the phrase, \"Hero meetings.\" All of us have been this which is there's a big thing, there's a big review, it's probably a go/no-go, maybe it's career limiting, maybe it'll get our team funded and everyone is stressed out. You spent two weeks working on a deck and the first 20 minutes of conversation goes totally sideways because the exec thought of something. Every one of us has been one of those. Those are bad.\n\n(01:01:11):\nThe way to fix that is to have a regular check in, so you have meeting every single week and becomes like you're not spending weeks, it a muscle, it's a rhythm of what you do and those are reason. Sorry, I went on a bit of a speech there.\n\nLenny (01:01:21):\nWhat I was thinking about is you two have worked at basically all the big consumer companies and coming back to imposter syndrome briefly, what's the worst product you've built or the biggest failure you've each built and what did you learn?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:01:34):\nOh, man. At a startup, I tried all kinds of things. We kind of grasp at straws and build whatever. And also I think I fell victim to, a lot of startups do this where they'll see some theme that has become a meme with investors and they'll be like, \"I'm going to go build that company. I'm just going to take that technology, adopt it.\" You're kind of start of seeing that with AI now where it's like everything is now an AI company. Of course everyone has incorporated AI part of it is you get it, you kind of want to be in the game and be cool, but if it doesn't really fit with your product hypothesis and thesis and what your customers are asking for, don't fall for that fad.\n\n(01:02:18):\nAnd I did stuff where I totally fell for the fad. I think I had a consumer electronics e-commerce, like a machine learning model where we rent and then recommend the right things to go buy. But then we were like, \"Oh, Uber is doing this whole UberX thing where it was people having their cars and they could do this thing.\" And at that time, I think this whole shared ownership of stuff became such a big thing and I was like, \"Oh, I'm going to do that exact thing where it's like it's less-\n\nLenny (01:02:51):\n[inaudible 01:02:51].\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:02:51):\nAt that time, we were partnering with Best Buy and we were like, \"Well, we should do this other side product,\" which is people's own stuff that they could put up on the site. Total disaster because there is a lot totally different company logistics, everything. You could build it out as a different business, but we had a small team which was heavily focused on this business, was already doing pretty well and then we had to fork all of that effort to go build this other thing which required different skillset, different fulfillment technology and all of that. And so we were like, \"Okay, disaster.\" So we pull the plug on it many months in, but we should have done it a lot sooner.\n\nLenny (01:03:26):\nWhat you learn from that experience other than pulling the plug sooner?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:03:30):\nYeah, don't fall for fads. It's do the thing that your customers are asking for and are willing to pay for. Or not even what your customers are asking for, but if you have something that is working, don't get distracted. It's very easy to be like, \"I'm going to build this five other things and it's all going to accrue value.\" And I literally talked to another founder last week where they're like, \"But I'm building this consumer thing, but I'm also going to do this SDK so I can go partner with these other companies and do this B2B thing.\" And I'm like, \"But you are four people. Why are you doing that? That's crazy.\" \"But imagine catering to 10X the market.\" I'm like, \"Well, but you're going from a consumer payments thing to something like Stripe and that's a very different business, so do you want to go do that and go have that trade-off conversation?\" So that was one big learning. At Netflix, we tried this out, we knew it was an experiment. This was before Netflix was cool like 10, 11 years ago, where [inaudible 01:04:27].\n\nLenny (01:04:27):\nLike DVD place?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:04:28):\nYeah. So my job was to build the streaming player software that goes-\n\nLenny (01:04:34):\nNo big deal.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:04:36):\nYeah. My job was to go partner with Samsung and Sony and Panasonic and build a software, the SDK that goes into TVs and set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. This is before international, Netflix and original content like House of Cards and all of that, but one of the experiments we tried back then was Netflix 3D. Total disaster [inaudible 01:04:57].\n\nLenny (01:04:36):\nLike on 3D TVs? That was another fad issue. Oh, no.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:05:02):\nExactly, yeah. But we had a lot of OEMs who were like, \"3D is going to be really big and you have to go invest in that.\" So I spent months trying to do this left eye, right eye codec and trying to make this whole thing work with these odd glasses, sitting in your living room trying to do 3D content, which is really hard. I think we tried seven movie titles over, imported it over to 3D and they're like, \"I don't think this is such a great experience,\" and we ended up pulling the plug on it. We knew it was an experiment going in, we knew there was a good exit criteria, but it was kind of a failure.\n\nLenny (01:05:35):\nSriram, I bet you're going to have a really good one?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:05:37):\nAll my products were huge successes, so I have nothing.\n\nLenny (01:05:40):\nOkay, [inaudible 01:05:40] other way it's going to go.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:05:41):\nYeah, what are you talking about? No, I'll say part of the very first thing I worked on and it's complicated because I love the team and I think we did some great work, was we work on something called Visual Studio for Devices. And the idea was-\n\nLenny (01:05:52):\nWhat was it? Wishlist for what?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:05:54):\nOh, sorry. Visual Studio for Devices. This was in 2005-\n\nLenny (01:05:58):\nOh, like coding on your phone?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:05:59):\nNo, no.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:05:59):\nWell, coding for your phone. And the idea was this was before iPhone it, this was the era of Windows Mobile Pocket PCs and Windows Mobile smartphones, so-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:06:08):\nMan, the kids listening to this like, \"What's he talking about? What was before iPhone?\"\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:06:14):\nYeah. And this was 2005/2006, so right before the iPhone came out, the two years and we were fresh out of school, both of us worked on this. And there was basically an ID, Visual Studio, and we had an extension where you could write code on a slimmed down version of the .NET Framework and you would run apps on these small phones and these small Pocket PCs. And the team was fantastic, we're all still friends and without that, we wouldn't have our jobs or careers, so that's not the point. The point is we all knew these phones were terrible and slow and awful, but what we were told all the time was, \"Listen, nobody can change this because the carriers control this market. They determined what software goes on a phone, goes on a device, so this entire ecosystem is all about competing with Blackberry.\"\n\n(01:06:53):\nIn fact, the codename for Windows Mobile 5.0 was Crossbow and kind of a little secret which I think is kind of public now, Crossbow was a weed killer, it killed blackberries. And so the whole idea was how do you kind go after the enterprise market Blackberry and work with the carriers? And then in 2007, Steve Jobs comes out and says, \"I have three launches for you, actually it's one thing.\" I remember texting my manager, I was like, \"You have to see this keynote,\" because it was so obvious that this thing was going to change everybody. And everyone in Microsoft was like, \"No, it's the carriers who have all the control. They will never let these devices [inaudible 01:07:32]. But actually, it turns out that's not true.\n\n(01:07:34):\nI learned two lessons from that. One is the market is bigger than all of you. You can work with the amazing team, you can work with the A plus team, A plus company, but if the market shifts, you can't overcome a bad market or a bad space. The second part is at the heart of it, if you feel some product is bad and if you feel like this new thing, it's just better to use and you can just feel it instinctly, you have to follow the instinct. Because I remember being like, \"Yeah, the iPhone is cool, it feels so much better, but okay, maybe they're right, maybe it is the-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:08:04):\nAll these people are so much more senior than us, clearly they've put so much more thought into this, clearly what do I know kind of thing. And you realize that now, I think over, what, we've done product for 15, 16 years now, and we look at it and go, \"We now have these patterns to go match against.\" We know when something is better, when something is working, when something feels like it's intuitive, you follow that intuition now then and not try and fight it and be like, \"But here are all these things where this is not going to get there,\" kind of thing. It just doesn't work that way, the market ultimately wins.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:08:40):\nAnd I think when you're younger, you should really trust your instincts. And instincts can mean, \"I just hear people talking about this other thing a lot,\" or, \"I hear that other company's name come up a lot,\" or, \"I tried this thing and... And you may not have the framework to articulate it and you may not trust your instincts, but there's something there and you should learn to listen to that voice. You're like, \"Why is that? Why are we talking about it? Maybe they're doing better marketing, maybe their CEO is better on Twitter or they have Lenny Rachitsky as an angel investor or they advertise on your podcast,\" there we go. I tried to get a plug in there, Lenny. But you have to listen to your instinct because there's usually something there to follow.\n\nLenny (01:09:22):\nI only have two more questions, one is you mentioned framework. I know you have strong opinions on a very specific framework, Jobs-to-be-Done and I know you're not a fan. What do you want to share about why you don't like Jobs-to-be-Done as a framework?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:09:37):\nAll right, I knew you were going to ask me this and I was thinking how do I be kind of balanced in-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:09:46):\nBombastic?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:09:47):\nNo, balanced and give measured answer and say, \"Well, every framework has good and bad ways and there are good things and bad things,\" and I could probably given one of those answers. No, I actually think the more fun thing to do is I'm going to say I hate Jobs-to-be-Done, I think it's a terrible framework, I think no successful company has ever been built on top of JTBD and if you pick JTBD, you're probably doomed and here's why. Let's go back to the canonical example. And there's nothing Clayton Christensen who was a legend, amazing, the milkshake, what is the idea of being the milkshake? You are a person, you go into a commute and you're like, \"Hey, I'm going to get this milkshake because it's the exact right quantity and save me on my commute.\" But they changed it up and all of a sudden, boom, it was not serving the job and look into the thing that actually it is serving the customer for.\n\n(01:10:39):\nI'll tell you that's not how actual real companies work because in real companies there are so many different parameters. For example, maybe it is really, really hard to go build that milkshake. Maybe there's another person who opens up across the street who builds a better milkshake than you do. Maybe the cup configuration in the car changes, maybe the supply chain for milkshake changes. But in my world, let me make this more concrete, when you work in social media, there are often so many other agents in the system where you can't focus on one person's equation. I'll give you an example. When you sign up for Instagram right now, when you sign up for Facebook for many, many years, Facebook knew that it needed to get you to 10 friends in 14 days.\n\n(01:11:14):\nIf you got your 10 friends in 14 days, you were probably going to use Facebook. So it'd be like, \"Well, we're going to throw every tool we have at our disposal to get you to 10 friends and 14 days.\" So if you signed up for Facebook for many, many years, you'll get this little thing called People You May Know. Then you'll have this person who just signed up for Facebook, you go, \"Why I'm seeing this person?\" It's not because you need a friend, because they need a friend. So what Facebook did was it made your experience slightly worse to make that person's experience slightly better. This was performing no job for you, it was trying to perform a job for them. Was the right trade-off or not? I don't know. We had this problem at Twitter. The single best product launched for the last five years at Twitter was the introduction of the algorithmic ranking and-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:11:53):\nGod, hearsay. Oh my God.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:11:53):\n... and it saved the company and power users hated it. They're like, \"I know how to control my timeline, I know who to follow,\" et cetera, et cetera. It turns out though, this is not built for power users. It was really built for a regular person when they sign up for Twitter to be able to give them a great experience because we knew the power users, they already have. And by the way, TikTok really great example of that. So how do you make the trade-off? Do you pick power users or do you pick a regular person? What is the trade-off between them? Jobs-to-be-Done does not tell you that.\n\n(01:12:22):\nLet me tell you this. If you go order a package from Amazon right now, five years ago or three years ago, you would've gotten an email, it'll tell you what is that package, what is in it and when it's showing up doorstep. Last couple of years, it doesn't, why? Because Amazon doesn't want Google to have that data inside Gmail system. So it is, for very, very valid competitive reasons, made your experience worse because that's the right thing do for a company. So real life and real product is all about these trade-offs and whenever I've seen people trot out JTBD, it's a tell that they actually haven't dealt with a trade-off, where you have to make one person's life slightly worse in one situation for some other interesting dynamic. Okay, I'll stop with my mini speech [inaudible 01:13:02].\n\nLenny (01:13:02):\nThis is my favorite part of the podcast so far. I'm hoping people listen to the end here because this is-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:13:07):\nYeah, I think JTPD, the problem with that is it's just too idealistic. And most frameworks are, but this one just takes it up a notch where it's like it's almost meant for people who are so naive about product building and especially product building at scale. I think it might work for the V1 or just a hypothesis that you're trying to go test out, where it's like, \"What is the core value that we are trying to serve for this user,\" kind of thing. But really V2, V3, it kind of falls apart because you have these super hard trade-offs that you have to make and every company goes through that. So it's almost a little too idealistic in its thinking. I think that's the biggest problem with it.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:13:44):\nYeah, and look, I was being a bit bombastic obviously and it does have some [inaudible 01:13:48].\n\nLenny (01:13:47):\nWe're going to edit this part out. This is [inaudible 01:13:49].\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:13:50):\nYeah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. It's may be useful in some niche case which nobody has ever heard about-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:13:55):\nFor milkshakes.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:13:55):\nRight, for milkshakes. Yeah, if you're starting a milkshake company, go for it. But I'll say, so people have good [inaudible 01:14:01] what is the alternate, would involve not JTBD, how do we actually figure this out? And I think a much better way and I really understand the early Facebook years, which is systems thinking. Think of all the players in the system, think of all of their incentives and how they interact with each other. So in that milkshake example, your car, the person, the competitor across the road, the supply chain, the profit margin of each person, the podcast they have to listen to, what is each person's incentives that you're trying to drive and look at how they all work together.\n\n(01:14:31):\nSo for example, so then when you look at the algorithmic rankings case, sure it kind of deprioritized a certain set of people, but it prioritized the other set of people and you could then have a much more rational discussion about whether that trade-off is worth it. Maybe it is, maybe it's not, but it's a much better discussion that, \"Well, that person wanted milkshake, we're not giving them milkshake,\" what do you do? That doesn't help you at all. And yes, it may be a good tool in ways that I absolutely have not seen so far, but-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:14:55):\nYeah, also the other tool I think I really like is first principles thinking. Everyone throws it out there, it's kind of become this cliche now, but really think about it as if your product didn't exist and if you had to start over from scratch, would you build it the exact same way for these set of customers? How would you think about it? Oftentimes people hyper-focused on competition and what other company is doing. That almost never matters. Other companies are probably looking at you and going, \"What are these guys doing?\" And you have to look at it as all of these systems, as Sriram said, but also really think about it as if you had to do this all over again, how would you do this? Is this the right way or are you just inheriting decisions over time and just trying to make incremental changes and trade-offs and stuff like that? I like that way more than trying to think of it as a job that a customer hires you to go do. It just sounds like really naive.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:15:51):\nIt makes you sound smart, I think. But I'll give you an example. Sorry, I have to-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:15:55):\nStop. You just gave so many examples.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:15:55):\nNo, one last thing.\n\nLenny (01:15:55):\nExamples is good. Let's do one more example.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:16:00):\nOne last example, okay. One of my favorite posts from Lenny in the recent times, I don't know when this episode going to go out, is the Duolingo growth post. I've been sharing it all the time, it's exactly one of the best posts I've seen recently. What is the job that people are hiring Duolingo to go do? Help teach them a new language, right? That sounds about right, some version of that. But if you look at that post, what actually saved the company?\n\n(01:16:21):\nSo they tried dozens of different things, found their North Star metric, the current user retention rate, then they tried leaderboards, realized why leaderboards don't work. Then ultimately, it is streaks that worked up. Tell me how do you use Jobs-to-be-Done to get to a world where, \"Hey, we really going to show these fire emojis and you need to kind of get that fire emoji every day. Because what it's really getting at is the sense of [inaudible 01:16:45] so there is no JTBD brainstorming offsite that'll ever get you there. What I've seen quickly, is almost always when you get a great product breakthrough like that, it comes from one person usually having a product intuition about something, about the psychological thing the product delivers and systems thinking. Those are the only two places I've ever seen it up. Okay, I'll stop now.\n\nLenny (01:17:08):\nNo, that example is amazing. I was going to talk about how I've actually found it a little useful in my life, but I think that's just going to keep us going-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:17:16):\nI was just going to ask you, are you now convinced Lenny, because Sriram has spent 45,000 minutes just trying to tell you why you should not be using JTBD-\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:17:24):\nI'm just going to get canceled by Lenny's audience. Lenny's audience is like, \"This is a reasonable podcast.\" They're like, \"I now hate this guy.\" [inaudible 01:17:30].\n\nLenny (01:17:30):\nIt. I think the JTBD industrial complex is going to come after you.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:17:35):\nIt's all mafia.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:17:36):\nI think if you see a bunch of mass unsubscribes, I just want to say this is not on Lenny, this is on Sriram.\n\nLenny (01:17:41):\n[inaudible 01:17:41] from your podcast.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:17:43):\nYeah, I'm going to get attacked by a bunch of people who are really good at holding offsites and framework thinking.\n\nLenny (01:17:50):\nYeah. I find it useful in specific cases, not as a scaled product development process, I think which you've run into or just the whole company is run by Job-to-be-Done. One paper was like, \"What is the job?\" And you're like, \"The job is to get them to open that up three times more each day.\" Yeah. Okay, I know you guys have to run so I have one more question. I have this saying in my family that whenever we do something well, I'm like, \"We're making it in America,\" because we also immigrated from the Ukraine. And as immigrants, you talked about your story of coming to America and clearly making it. You're both at the center of, I don't know, what's happening in tech, which is also at the center of the world in many ways. I'm curious what advice you would give to immigrants and people that have moved here recently or even a while ago, just how to make it and be successful in the US, especially in tech?\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:18:38):\nSome of it Sriram covered before, it's put yourself out there, don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Oftentimes, for us, it took us a decade plus to feel comfortable doing that because we came in, we look different, we sound different, we have strong accents, the number of times I got told at both startups and before then, \"Oh my God, your accent, it's so difficult, I can't hear you,\" or, \"I don't understand what you're saying.\" I got told before fundraising that nobody will be able to invest in my company because the accent is too strong. You already have these virtual barriers in your own head and then you have people coming and telling you actively that you are different and you can't succeed.\n\n(01:19:24):\nNow if I had to do it all over again, I almost think these differences are what sets us apart and makes us unique. And you can do really interesting things with them because you are going to a place where you are rare and that's, I think, a really good thing. So you should sharpen that rareness and do really interesting things with it, whatever that might be. We have this show called Good Time Show, it's Aarthi and Sriram's Good Time Show and we focus a lot on outsiders being insiders or how you started out as... For us, we are quintessential examples of that where we're outsiders to tech, to Silicon Valley, to being in this world and we kind of \"made it\" to being here. And we often talk about what it takes to do that and whatever your version of being outsider and becoming an insider means. And for us, part of it is not being afraid to put yourself out there, power of cold emails, networking and being really proactive about that. What would you add to that or how do you think about it?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:20:25):\nI think everything Aarthi said, I don't have much to add. I'll just say if you're listening to this and you're immigrant, A, you're in the right place, B, you're listening to this podcast, reading this newsletter which is probably not your day-to-day today job, so you're already doing something right, so you're going to make it. You're already putting yourself out, you're doing the right things, you're going to make it.\n\nLenny (01:20:42):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Two final questions, where can folks find you online, the Good Time Show, when you on Twitter, wherever? And then how can listeners be useful to you too?\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:20:51):\nThey can find us online on JTBD sucks... No, sorry. That's my alt account. Well, we are on pretty much every platform. We are aarthiandsriram.com. That's kind of a home for our podcast, our show, so go subscribe there, but you can find us everywhere. We are on YouTube at again, Aarthi and Sriram, you can find us on Spotify podcast, wherever you get your daily milkshake/podcast and also on Twitter @aarthir and sriramk.\n\nLenny (01:21:24):\nAmazing.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:21:25):\nAnd how can people be useful [inaudible 01:21:26].\n\nLenny (01:21:26):\nYeah.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:21:28):\nI would say, this is going to sound like a cliche, but my job is fantastic in a way where if people are building amazing things, I benefit. Because if you build amazing things, odds are you're going to build a great company and then odds are that I'll have the chance to maybe invest or one of my partners will have the chance to invest and hopefully you make a bunch of money out of it. So just go out there and build things, tell me about the things you're building and also just reach out-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:21:55):\nYeah, just reach out, say hi.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:21:58):\nOkay, let me put it, if you listen to this, send me a DM, send us a DM and send us an email and we will respond and-\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:22:04):\nIf it is JTPD hate, just send it to him, not me. Just keep me out of it. But for everything else, if it's a nice note especially, send it to me, I will read it.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:22:12):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:22:13):\nAll right. I hope you're ready for some DMs, both of you. Thank you again for being here. You've set the bar high for our first duo guest. Thank you again and goodbye everyone.\n\nAarthi Ramamurthy (01:22:24):\nThank you.\n\nSriram Krishnan (01:22:24):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:22:27):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Mental models for building products people love ft. Stewart Butterfield\n\n## Transcript\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:00:00):\nThis is 2014. That was the year that Slack actually launched. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, \"I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public.\"\n\n(00:00:14):\nTo me that was like, \"You should be embarrassed.\" If you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nSlack was famous for being one of the early, consumerized B2B SaaS products.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:00:29):\nAt more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers, and you can put effort into demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nSomething else I heard that you often espouse is friction in a product experience is actually often a good thing?\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:00:52):\nIt became an assumption that it should always be trying to remove friction when the challenge is really comprehension. If your software stops me and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. If people could get over the idea of reducing friction as a number of goal or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something, and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:15):\nYou started two companies, both famously pivoted. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:01:20):\nThe decision is about have you exhausted the possibilities? Creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:36):\nToday, my guest is Stewart Butterfield, a founder and product legend who rarely does podcasts. Stewart founded Flickr and then Slack, which he sold to Salesforce in one of the biggest acquisitions in tech history at the time. There is so much product and leadership wisdom locked away in his head. I feel like our conversation just scratched the surface. We chat about utility curves, something he calls the owner's delusion, a hilarious pattern he sees at companies he calls hyperrealistic work-like activities, what he's learned about product and craft and taste and Parkinson's law, why you need to obsess with not making your users think, the backstory on his legendary we don't sell saddles here memo, and so much more. A huge thank you to Noah Weiss, Chris Cordell, Ali Rael, and Johnny Rogers for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation. This is a really special one and I really hope to have Stewart back to delve even deeper.\n\n(00:02:27):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Head on over to lennysnewsletter.com and click Product Pass. With that, I bring you Stewart Butterfield after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:57):\nHere's a puzzle for you. What do OpenAI, Cursor, Perplexity, Vercel, Plaid and hundreds of other winning companies have in common? The answer is they're all powered by today's sponsor, WorkOS. If you're building software for enterprises, you've probably felt the pain of integrating single sign-on, SCIM, RBAC, audit logs, and other features required by big customers. WorkOS turns those deal blockers into drop-in APIs with a modern developer platform built specifically for B2B SaaS.\n\n(00:03:26):\nWhether you're a seed-stage startup trying to land your first enterprise customer or a unicorn expanding globally, WorkOS is the fastest path to becoming enterprise-ready and unlocking growth. They're essentially Stripe for enterprise features. Visit WorkOS.com to get started or just hit up their Slack support where they have real engineers in there who answer your questions superfast. WorkOS allows you to build like the best with delightful APIs, comprehensive docs, and a smooth developer experience. Go to workos.com to make your app enterprise-ready today.\n\n(00:03:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Metronome. You just launched your new shiny AI product. The new pricing page looks awesome, but behind it, last-minute glue code, messy spreadsheets, and running ad hoc queries to figure out what to bill. Customers get invoices they can't understand. Engineers are chasing billing bugs. Finance can't close the books. With Metronome, you hand it all off to the real-time billing infrastructure that just works. Reliable, flexible, and built to grow with you. Metronome turns raw usage events into accurate invoices, gives customers bills they actually understand and keeps every team in sync in real-time. Whether you're launching usage-based pricing, managing enterprise contracts, or rolling out new AI services, Metronome does the heavy lifting so that you can focus on your product, not your billing. That's why some of the fastest growing companies in the world like OpenAI and Anthropic run their billing on Metronome. Visit metronome.com to learn more. That's metronome.com.\n\n(00:04:59):\nStewart, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:05:02):\nThank you for having me. I'm excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:05):\nI'm even more excited. I'm so honored to have you here. I never told you this, but you've been towards the very top of my wish list of guests I have on this podcast ever since I started this podcast a few years ago, so I'm very excited that we're finally making this happen. I have so many questions for you. My first question is just what the heck are you up to these days? I feel like ever since you left Slack, we haven't heard much from Stewart. I'm curious what you're up to you hopefully or just chilling.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:05:28):\nI'm mostly just chilling. I left Salesforce two and a half years ago and I have a two and a half year old, so she was actually born three days after my last day, so a lot of time with family and it's an enormous privilege to be able to spend time with young kids while they're young. No new company to announce or anything like that. I do get a lot of emails and texts. Basically every three to six weeks there's this cycle because Cal Henderson who's the CTO of Slack and who also, we worked together on Flickr, so have worked together now for 23 years, have been talking about what we want to do next if there is something.\n\n(00:06:10):\nBut honestly, the big challenge has been I think these things are destroying the world and what we're good at is making software. So you find some way to make software that helped people use their phones less often, then that would be a big winner, but haven't come up with anything good. A lot of philanthropic work, nothing to announce there yet, but there's some cool projects that I'm working on, and a lot of just personal creative art projects and supporting other artists and stuff like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:45):\nTo prep for this chat, I talked to so many people that have worked with you over the years to try to figure out what you taught them about building product, building teams, building companies that most stuck with them, that most helped them build amazing products. The first is a concept called utility curves. This came up a bunch across so many people that have worked with you. Talk about what is a utility curve, how you use that to build better products.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:07:08):\nThis is pretty easy because it's a very familiar S-curve where you have, it's flat and it starts arcing up and then there's a really steep part and then it levels off again. And on the horizontal axis, you can think of cost or effort and on the vertical axis, it's value or convenience. It depends exactly what you're talking about, but the idea is the first bit of effort you put into something doesn't result in a huge amount of value. And then there's some magic threshold where it produces an enormous amount of value and then continued investment doesn't really pay off. The most basic example I can think of is let's say you're making a hammer, and on that bottom axis, it's now quality, and if the hammer has a handle that breaks with any impact, then is totally useless. And if you make it a little bit stronger, it's still pretty useless and it's like junk, junk, junk, junk, junk. Okay, good, great. Then it doesn't matter anymore.\n\n(00:08:06):\nIf you're making an app, okay, this app's going to have users and so let's make a user's table and a database, and so far you have generated no value. The reason I felt like this was so important is because we would talk about a feature, and usually features are thought of as a binary. You either have this feature or you don't. The argument I guess was have we just not invested enough in this or have we got all the value or convenience or quality or whatever that we could get out of this? And we had pointed diminishing returns and it just doesn't matter.\n\n(00:08:46):\nI think in many cases, people will add a feature, it's not good enough and so people don't use it or appreciate it, but now you've added some complexity to the app and then people give up or take it back or they try something in testing and they don't get the results they want, and so they decide that this a thing is worth doing. We would try to really investigate and decide whether we were on the first shallow part of the curve, the second shallow part of the curve, or we're just coming up to it. So I think it's a lot easier to understand the value of this when you're talking about a specific app and a specific feature, but I think it was ultimately helpful in getting people to understand whether something was worth it or not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:31):\nSo just to mirror back what I'm hearing, there's this, if you visualize this curve at the bottom, it's like I don't even know what this is. And then up the curve is like, okay, I sort of get it. And then at the top is, okay, I can't live without this now that I understand what this is for, it feels like it's a really a different way of thinking about getting to the aha moment for someone where they see, okay, saved items, I get it, I need to use this constantly. It feels like this works both for a specific feature and also just for Slack, getting people to even understand here's what Slack can do for you. And then now I can't live without Slack. And essentially this is a lens you use to figure out where to spend product resources because if you don't get up that curve to I get it and I can't live without it, nothing else matters. Is that the framework?\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:10:13):\nYeah, and I think then you layer on another concept like the, Bezos used the term divine discontent. The line actually moves because once people are familiar with a piece of software or the way a feature is implemented or something like that, their standards go up, and so there's this competition. And again, this axis can be, utility is the best general term for it, but it could be quality, convenience, speed, it could be any number of things, but as you improve your search capability or as you improve your login experience or your forget password experience or your checkout experience or whatever everyone else is as well. And so there's this continued investment and when forget about thinking about a new feature, you're looking at how the product works overall and usually things get implemented once, and then if they're lucky, they get improved upon periodically. Most things get improved upon very infrequently and some things get improved upon never.\n\n(00:11:22):\nI want to give an example at the absolute extreme because I actually don't know how long this has been, but I try not to criticize other people's software so much because I'm very familiar with the trade-offs and prioritization and how hard it can be and blah, blah, blah, blah. But okay, so most people have the Gmail Calendar app on their phone. I travel a fair bit. I'm mostly in the Eastern Time Zone, sometimes in Mountain Time, sometimes in Pacific, sometimes in English time, and sometimes in Japan, Central Europe. There's maybe 10 time zones, 12 time zones that I would ever choose. When you hit the option to set the time zone on an event in Google Calendar, on the iOS app, it presents all the time zones in the world in alphabetical order. And I mean, there's probably worse orderings, but there's no value in that.\n\n(00:12:24):\nAnd even when you start searching, it still presents them in alphabetical order by country with that turn. So if I'm in California and I'm trying to set the appointment for next week when I'm back in New York and I type in E-A-S-T and I get a bunch of garbage, okay, Eastern, and then the first one is Eastern Australia, New South Wales, and then Eastern Australia, Queensland, and then Eastern Australia, Daylight Savings and Eastern Australia standard time. And then you're like, \"Well, fuck, I can't remember which one is Daylight Savings and which one is standard time?\" I could keep going like this for a while. This is an app that's used by at least hundreds of millions of people, presumably every single Google employee. It's bananas how bad it is. There's so many, there's all these clever things you could do. Like you know me, I'm on the West Coast, first option should be the East Coast and vice versa. But it definitely shouldn't be that every time zone is presented with equal value. I don't a couple hundred time zones. I grew up in Canada. Newfoundland has its own time zone, which is offset by half an hour. The population of Newfoundland has about half a million people. Not that many people go to visit Newfoundland, maybe a million people in all of history so like a million and a half out of 8 billion people. And there's Newfoundland, the same with China time, which is like 25% of the world's population in this.\n\n(00:13:51):\nAnyway, that was a little bit longer than I intended to go on this example, but it's crazy because no one's going to switch to Gmail or to G Suite, Google Calendar from Outlook Exchange because the time zone picker is good, so maybe in some sense it doesn't matter, but at the same time there's a real value in delighting customers and there's an emotional connection that they form or don't form. And in some cases that could be really positive like they would recommend it. And when they switch companies or decide to start their own company, they're going to choose to use this product or advocate for it because of that emotional connection and vice versa.\n\n(00:14:34):\nThey'll also be like, \"I hate this thing that drives me bananas. I really think we should stop using it,\" or advocate for the alternative. And I think people just don't appreciate or come back to those things often enough. And then there's this category of really essential parts of the app again like account creation, sign up, forgot password, things like that, that for most organizations very infrequently get a lot of love and iteration and improvement despite the fact that the quality bar has gone up across the board and continually goes up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):\nLet's go down that rabbit hole a little bit more around delight and craft. Slack was famous for being one of the early, let's say consumerized B2B SaaS products. Slack leaned into delight and experience and craft and a great experience. And you just as a product leader, I'd say are known as very taste forward, very craft oriented leader, which is pretty rare and I think continues to be rare. So there's a few things I want to talk about here. One is taste. I heard at a talk, you gave a talk on taste and you have a really unique perspective on just what taste is, what product taste looks like. Can you share that?\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:15:49):\nThere is a lot of you going back to the utility curves again, people who are obsessed with this one little thing and keep on adding more and more detailed improvements beyond the point where it makes much of a difference. But I guess a couple of things about taste. So one is can you learn to develop it? I think so because the word literally comes from experiencing food and putting stuff in your mouth. And can people become better chefs with training? Yes, absolutely. Undoubtedly, some people have a natural advantage and are born with this ability to make discernments that are difficult for other people to make and stuff like that. But you can definitely practice and you can definitely get better. The second thing I'd say is you can create a real advantage for yourself, for your product, for your company by leaning into it because most people don't have good taste and don't invest. You're probably familiar with, again, Jeff Bezos line, your margin is my opportunity and pretty obvious what he meant by that.\n\n(00:16:54):\nI would tell the story at Slack over and over again. It actually made it part of the new hire welcome. I'm in Vancouver at our Vancouver office and I'm going for a walk with Brandon Velestuk who's our, at the time creative director for product development, I think that was his title. And we're in the Yaletown neighborhood in Vancouver so there's really narrow sidewalks because it used to be a warehouse district and now it's fancy restaurants and nail salons and boutiques and stuff. And as it does in Vancouver, it starts to rain. We don't have umbrellas. We're walking back to the office and most people have umbrellas and we're on these narrow sidewalks with people coming towards us with umbrellas. We noticed how few people would move their umbrella out of the way. And of course, the other person, their umbrella, the pokey bits are exactly at eye level for people walking towards them. We would get forced off the sidewalk or having to duck down or whatever.\n\n(00:17:54):\nIt became a game like we were guessing is this person going to tilt their umbrella out of the way so we can pass or not? And something like one-third of the people would do it. And we had this conversation about it where it's like, okay, I can think of three reasons why people wouldn't do it. One is they have very few avenues in their life to exercise power and this is one of them. And they're just, want to get out there and dominate people and cause suffering. Shouldn't ascribe to malice that which can be ascribed to ignorance so that probably is the explanation for a tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of people.\n\n(00:18:34):\nBut the other two explanations aren't that great either. One is that they see it's happening, they see they're pushing other people off the sidewalk or poking them in the eye or whatever, and they're just like, \"Fuck, that's too bad. I wish there was something I could do about that, but I can't think of anything.\" And the last reason is they just don't notice it all. They're just oblivious to their impact on other people. And they're so in their head, and I can't really think of any other explanations for it besides that.\n\n(00:19:03):\nAnd so we would say it's not like tilting your umbrella is our opportunity. That's not a great rephrase of your margin is my opportunity, but your failure to really be consider it exercise this courtesy and really be empathic about other people's experience is an advantage that you can create a critical advantage. I think that there's many reasons why Slack was successful at the moment. It was successful and we think we had a bunch of really wonderful tailwinds and all of that stuff, but it wouldn't have grown the way it did without those little conveniences which caused people to form an emotional connection because a lot of our growth came from startup A uses Slack, and then someone leaves startup A for startup B, and startup B doesn't use Slack yet. And they would be like, \"Oh my God, you guys, you really, this is so good. We got to try it.\" And the spread was driven by that and people really genuinely advocating for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:07):\nThat is an amazing metaphor. I love that one moment became a value of product craftsmanship at Slack.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:20:14):\nTilt your umbrella was a very common saying on company swag and stuff like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:20):\nIs there an example, I imagine there are many, but from the time of building Slack, especially in the early days where you chose to go big on craftsmanship and experience and delight versus speed where you thought looking back that was a really great idea and worth really core just to success.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:20:37):\nHere's a bunch of little examples. Someone else came up with this idea, and I'm trying to remember who it was, but let's see, maybe Andrea Torres, maybe Ben Brown, something like that who was like, \"Why did we ask people for email address and password if their ownership of the email address was the thing that allowed them to create the account in the first place? Why don't we just ask them for their email address and then send them a link?\"\n\n(00:21:07):\nAnd so when Slack's first version of the mobile app came out, we're like, \"Typing your password on your phone if you have any minimal threshold of password hygiene is a terrible experience.\" Capital H, lowercase Q, six, caret, period. So let's just have them enter the email address. We'll send them a link. The link will automatically open the app and authenticate them. And so there's one, a little example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:33):\nWow. So you guys invented the magic link experience.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:21:36):\nSomeone else invented. I want to be clear that I had seen that idea somewhere else, someone else, a blog post about it or something like that. But we were the first ones, to my knowledge, that really scaled that and made it a standard. There is another one which we really puzzled about in the very early days where people have a long history of using messaging apps from AOL Instant Messenger to SMS to WhatsApp, where their expectation is they get a notification for every message that's received. And in the case of Slack, that doesn't make as much sense because you're a member of many channels and the messages may not be for you, and so that's why we have the @ tagging people. And we certainly didn't invent that, that was Twitter.\n\n(00:22:23):\nBut what we realized was people were signing up for Slack, and it's one engineer on this team inside of this larger organization, inside this larger company, and they would pull in the person next to them and they would say, \"Let's try it out.\"\n\n(00:22:35):\nAnd then they would send a message and then one person would be like, \"I didn't get a notification. This is bullshit.\"\n\n(00:22:43):\nWe reluctantly decided that we had to send notifications for every single message as the default for new accounts. But once you had, I don't remember what the threshold would happen, I think it's once you had received 10 messages, we would pop up this little thing that says, \"Hey, you have our default settings for notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our-\"\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:23:00):\n... For notifications. We don't want Slack to be noisy for you. Would you like to switch to our recommended settings? And then they would just click a link and it would have what should be the default, which is, you only get a notification if it's a DM or someone tags you. But we realized it was worth that investment to get people over the hump. I'll give one more simple one and then one kind of more complex. One, people would just like the, I can't remember if it's called urgent or important, but the flag in Outlook, set the priority of a message for the recipients always got abused inside of every company. As soon as someone does it, everyone's like, \"Okay, I'm going to do that too for my message.\"\n\n(00:23:41):\nAnd so all of your messages have the little flag and it becomes useless. We have @everyone, which causes a notification to be sent to every member of the channel when the message is sent and people would start, someone would find this feature inside of a organization. They would @everyone, everyone would get a notification and then the next person to send a message who was like, \" Well, my thing's more important than Bob's thing. I'm going to also @everyone.\" And it became really obnoxious and people would complain about it, but it was, I don't know, I guess tragedy of the commons. It's not quite exactly the same thing, but it was this real dynamic that happened over and over again.\n\n(00:24:16):\nSo we came up with what was called the shouty rooster, and internally we said, \"Don't be a cock.\" But we didn't obviously say that publicly when you @everyone, a little rooster would pop up and it would have you sound waves coming out of its mouth and being really obnoxious and say, \"Hey, this is going to cause a notification for 147 people in eight different time zones. Are you sure you want to send this message with the @everyone?\" And of course, that worked amazingly and it dropped off. And again, it was really trying to shape people's behavior so that they used, one is not to be very flexible, but we knew that there was ways to use it that would be annoying and difficult for everyone. And so try to shape the communication culture inside the organization to take best advantage on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:02):\nThat feature still exists. I see that rooster all the, no, I don't see it all, well, actually I do @channel, because I run a big Slack, so I see that rooster, that survived.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:25:11):\nYeah. Yeah, that survived and good because it was a trivially easy thing to implement and made a really big difference. But it also taught people how the product worked, because people probably didn't know that @everyone or @channel... Didn't think about the cost, at least.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:31):\nGenius.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:25:32):\nYeah. Here's one more. So we decided we were going to Do Not Disturb as a feature. And we had this, not conundrum, but you're trying to take into account all the different uses of Slack because by the time we implemented this, 2017, there was tens of thousands of paying customers, the organizations, hundreds of probably millions of users, maybe hundreds of thousands of organizations. I don't remember how many. And everyone had set up stuff the way that they liked it, including things like ops alerts going into channels for on-call engineers for some of the biggest systems and apps in the world. And so we couldn't just deploy it right away. We realized that some of the decision-makers, the owners of the organizations were going to have really strong opinions about this. We also realized that some of the end users are going to have strong opinions, and we wanted to figure out a way to balance the concerns and give people appropriate means of control.\n\n(00:26:37):\nSo we came up with this really elaborate system for the rollout, which was, we told everyone, I'm sorry, every Slack administrator that this was coming weeks before it came. And we told them that we were going to set a default for their organization, which I believe was either 7:00 P.M. to 7:00 A.M. in their local time zone, or 8: 00 A.M. to 8:00 P.M., I can't remember which it was, but also that they could override that default, and also that the individual end users could override that system owner default. And finally, that the system owner could, if they changed the default again, would override all of the end user's preferences and then the end users could override them again. And it wasn't to create this dynamic where people were at war, but so that you could change a policy and then people could still customize and stuff like that.\n\n(00:27:32):\nBut this was a much longer and more convoluted process, but it allowed the millions of people who were using Slack to get the feature without creating a bunch of conflict and without people turning it off automatically. And I think critically, with setting a bunch of defaults, because if we didn't set the default, most people wouldn't turn it on at all. If we didn't default you to Do Not Disturb from 8:00 P.M. to 8:00 A.M. you probably, if you're the average person, wouldn't ever do it yourself. So that's another elaborate example where I think that investment made sense because it was a critical feature for a lot of people. And if we hadn't done it that way, I think it would've caused a lot of complaints and conflict and stuff like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:22):\nThose are amazing examples. I very much appreciate that Do Not Disturb feature when you guys launched that. I still remember that coming out. I'm sure a lot of people are very thankful for that.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:28:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:31):\nSomething else I heard that you often espouse, which is counterintuitive to a lot of people is about friction, friction in the product experience. That friction is actually often a good thing. It's a feature, not a bug a lot of times if you use it well. Talk about your experience there.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:28:46):\nYeah. So yes, and there's also another issue around friction, which is it became like a mantra or just kind of an assumption that you should always be trying to remove friction. And in some cases that's true. We would talk about it in Slack. It was hard to market. It was hard to explain what it was if you had never used it before. You could say a messaging app for businesses or whatever, but a critical disadvantage to Slack doing out-of-home advertising, putting up a billboard versus beer or cars is, no one needs to be explained why they would want a car or beer, but everyone will have to explain one day why they want Slack. And so the problem there is comprehension, and this will come up an enormous amount. So now imagine you want to get tickets to the Taylor Swift concert in San Francisco and you go to the Ticketmaster website.\n\n(00:29:43):\nIf you think about both your comprehension, it's perfect to this case. And that translates into the specificity of your intent and the degree of your intent is also kind of maxed out. So look, I really want to get these tickets. I know exactly what they are. They're Taylor Swift tickets for this date at this venue. And so in that scenario, it doesn't really matter if Ticketmaster's website is slow, it doesn't really matter if the payments page errors out, you're going to persist and get through it. So obviously they're better to reduce friction, but in some sense there's not a huge amount of value in doing that. For most creators of products, there are a handful of cases where that really is true for you as well. And they include things like user registration, authentication, checkout flows for e-commerce. I am significantly more likely to buy something if there's Apple Pay or Shop Pay or something like that.\n\n(00:30:44):\nI'm significantly less likely to carry through the purchase of something if I have to manually enter all of the fields of my address one at a time rather than having one of those address pickers. It's crazy, but the issue is my intent isn't always 100%, and the specificity of my intent isn't always 100%. So if your thing is direct to consumer T-shirts and you acquire customers through Instagram ads, all of them know what T-shirts are. It's like, \"This looks like a good T-shirt to me.\" But I'm rarely 100% intent. I might have a very specific intent, but my intent's like 70%. So if you're, the amount of friction is above that, I'm not going to do it. But now, okay, people coming to Slack.com, some friend had mentioned Slack and talked their ear off at some point months ago, and then they saw a news article and then they saw someone's tweet and then they saw an ad on about the website they were visiting and they finally said, \"Okay, I'm going to go to this website.\"\n\n(00:31:46):\nSo their intent is at the absolute minimum threshold, it was before that last event happened, they were below and now they're above, but they're just above. The specificity of their intent like, \"I need to get Taylor Swift concerts for this date at this venue.\" Is also very low, because they're like, \"It's a work thing. I'm not sure it's a spreadsheet or a calendar or exactly what it is.\" So they were coming in at 0.1% over these critical thresholds. What was the challenge? It wasn't friction, because it's not like they were aiming for something and they knew what they were aiming for and they were just trying to get themselves to that point.\n\n(00:32:34):\nWhat we had to worry about was creating comprehension and in two senses, what is this thing? And what am I supposed to do next? And that creation of comprehension in the sense of explaining stuff, that creation of comprehension in the sense of the design of the UI, of the screen, of the page or whatever, and the visual hierarchy and the affordances that are there and the indication of things to interact with and which thing should be the next thing to do and all that stuff, that becomes really critical.\n\n(00:33:09):\nAnd I think very, very few people recognize that. They're like, \"I want to get people who come to my webpage to the sign up form as quickly as possible.\" But if they don't know what they're signing up for and they don't know what it's going to do after, is it going to spam them? They don't know, \"Am I going to have to pay on the next step or what?\" Then they're just going to back out. And this was a lifelong battle because the remove friction orientation is so deep in people. Again, it really makes a difference in those cases where people do have an intent and they do know what they're trying to do is a poor approach when the challenge is really comprehension, and I think the secret is most, 70%, 80% or whatever of a product design is in that comprehension step because people, if they do ever open the preferences tab and look at all the options, rarely have an idea.\n\n(00:34:09):\nAnd if you can't teach them or make it possible for them to discover what the capabilities are, then they're not going to take advantage of them and they're not going to get as much out of it. And I think that the trick is for most of the unique parts of any application, most of the specific things that your app, your product, your software does are areas where the challenge is going to be comprehension inside of friction. It really could be anything Shopify, the purpose of the service for its end users is generally going to be kind to clear. But most people, most first-time store openers don't know that they can get reports or if they know that they can get reports, they don't know what kinds of reports. And if they know what kinds of reports they can get, they don't know how they can tweak them and what the timing should be and which things that are more important to display.\n\n(00:35:03):\nAnd I could go on and on and on and on, and people just don't recognize that. So I want to see if this is still true. I'm just going to open my phone and clock app. And they had the craziest description for alarms. It's a little bit different, but people can look at their own phone. So I have, it says alarms and it says sleep and a vertical bar, wake up and says, no alarm, and a button that says change. And then if you hit it, it says sleep is off. In order to automatically turn on sleep features and edit your schedule, you need to turn sleep on. So obviously sleep was a good name for this thing if you already had a way of getting people to understand it. If you don't, it's ungrammatical and incomprehensible and why would you ever do it? And I got to guess, it's been like this for years, 90 plus percent and maybe 98% of people just do what I do, which is that you just create, \"I want the alarm on and I'm going to set the time for it.\"\n\n(00:36:11):\nAnd I don't know what turning sleep on does, but it's just the lack of comprehension prevents people from getting the value. And I'm sure that there's a bunch of value behind turning sleep on, whatever that means and people spend a lot of time on those features and it integrates with biometrics and your watch or who knows. Again, I still don't know because turning sleep on is like, what does that do? And what is it going to cost me? And what impact it's going to have? Those examples are just to me all over the place. And the reason I don't use most software where there was an actual choice point or the reason I don't use most features where there was a choice point for me is because I didn't understand what they were going to do and I don't give a shit. And if there is one mantra that I would use to replace that it's, Don't Make Me Think, I don't know if you remember that book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:02):\nAbsolutely.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:37:04):\nYeah. And honestly, it's been many more than 10 years since I read it, so I don't even remember all of the examples in the book, but as a mantra that was up there with utility curves because for two reasons. One is it's just like it's expensive to make a decision. You literally burn glucose. There's a metabolic action. There's ATP created in the mitochondria and your neurons and a bunch of stuff is happening and people do get decision fatigue and there is cognitive cost of all these things. But also there's an emotional aspect, which is, if your software stops me a second and asks me to make a decision and I don't really understand it, you make me feel stupid. I'm like, \"I don't understand this.\"\n\n(00:37:50):\nSome people, maybe their orientation is, \"Okay, the software is stupid.\" But I think most people are like, \"Oh, I'm dumb.\" And if you ever talk to people who aren't especially technologically savvy, the canonical example is people who are under 50 talking to their parents about using some piece of software and what they're supposed to do, the parents always feel stupid like they're the ones that are wrong. And so if you're causing people to think, in the best case, it's unnecessary use of their biological resources, and in the worst case you've now made them feel bad, emotionally bad, and they're going to associate that with the product forever. And these are things that are just kind of rolling one into the other.\n\n(00:38:35):\nSo I'm going to keep going with one last thing, because they just kind of come together, which is along with reduced friction, it's like reduce the number of clicks or taps it takes for someone to accomplish something which is almost always exactly the wrong thing. It's the easiest way you could make any action in your app, a single click or tap by just exposing every single possibility on one screen that scrolls for thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of pages. And obviously that's terrible. So why do people think that a little bit of that is good? And here's an example. You open a menu, there's 14 things that people might want to do.\n\n(00:39:22):\nLevel one is group them into like items and put a vertical, sorry, horizontal divider between them so at least people can kind of chunk and see what there is. Step two is present the two or three most common things or the five most common things, whatever and then have some form of other and then you go to a sub menu that has more items and the decision of how to tune that becomes incredibly important. I'm going to pick on Google again just because it is, I feel like I'm Donald Trump here, but I'm going to interrupt myself again with a story. It's-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:57):\nYeah, let's do it.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:39:58):\nAt some conference or event, I don't remember what it was, and this is probably eight years ago and we're in the bar after the sessions ended at this thing. John Collison from Stripe is there and Sundar, CEO of Google is there. And John, sorry, Patrick goes up to Sundar and they can talk about anything. Stripe wasn't the behemoth, it was now at that point, but it was still a significant company, was up and coming. And what does Patrick want to talk to the Sundar about? It's in the Gmail app, the dragging of people. When you reply all to a message, you often want to change the two recipient to CC and move someone from CC to two or something like that. And just how physically the degree of dexterity that's required to do that inside of the Gmail app is very high.\n\n(00:40:56):\nIt still hasn't been fixed, but it really struck me that Patrick could have asked for anything. It could have been any talk, it could have been a partnership. It was so irritating to him that it worked like this, he couldn't quite get over it. So anyway, back to bashing on Google, who in many respects do an incredible job and there's all kinds of amazing stuff they do on blah, blah, blah, but the Gmail actions on an individual email are broken into two very long menu items that are different. And one of them doesn't exist on either menu. There is an unlabeled icon is the only way to do it, and that's to mark something as unread once it's read. I have no idea why some of the actions are in one menu and some of the actions are in another menu. I think it's because some of them have to do with an individual email and some of them have to do with the whole thread, but it doesn't seem very consistent.\n\n(00:41:55):\nEvery possible thing is listed there in one place. And so it becomes incredibly difficult to use because sometimes you have to tap in both menus, read all of the options, and say, \"Okay, I've used the process of elimination and it's not here, so it must be there.\" Uber doesn't work like this anymore, but when I first brought this up to people inside of Slack, there was a moment when the Uber app, when you opened it was just, \"Where would you like to go?\" And other. And other was everything like change your payment method, set your location, anything you could do in Uber. And that was perfect because almost all the time people just wanted to choose where they wanted to go. Sometimes you wanted to change where your pickup was because you weren't there yet or whatever. And that was just like, what could be simpler than, \"I'm going to tell you where I want to go or I'm going to achieve something else.\"?\n\n(00:42:47):\nI really tried to push people to what is the thing that people, or what is the two things or what is maybe three things that people could want to do here and then put everything behind other. And then if it takes them eight clicks or taps to do something, but every single one is trivially easy, that's great. If you reduce that to two clicks or taps, but every part of it is this fraught decision where I'm opening all of the menus and trying to figure out which thing is the right thing, and the more, comparing three things to each other is this difficult four things, it's kind of geometrically more expensive to compare 15 different options all to the other to see if this is the one that you might want. That just becomes impossibly expensive. So to me, those are all really connected. And if people could get over the idea of reducing friction as the [inaudible 00:43:42] or reducing the number of clicks or taps to do something and instead focus on how can I make this simple? How do I prevent people from having to think in order to use my software? How can I make this trivially easy? One last example, because this was really influential for me. So I was going back and forth in Vancouver in San Francisco at the time when we were talking about all this inside of Slack, and I was behind a teenager in line aboard the plane and it was like, we're on the jet way. It took a long time. And I was watching her use Snapchat and it was insane.\n\n(00:44:11):\nShe was tapping at least four times a second, sometimes six or seven times a second. It was like dismissing stories and doing stuff. But there was a fluidity to it because everything was like, do I want to see this again? Do I want to see the next story from this person? Do I want to switch to a different person? Instead, a notification came up, she answered someone's thing, she took a selfie of herself and everything was just like... So she was tapping four times a second for six minutes. I mean, probably there was some breaks in there. And that was the highest and best use of Snapchat for a 15 year old girl in 2016 or whenever that was. And imagine if the goal was to try to make her tap less, how much of an impediment it would've been to the experience that both her and Snapchat wanted to create?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:06):\nIt's so fun to listen to this and the examples you gave of, it gives us a lot of insight into the way your mind works of just constantly unsatisfied with the way other products work with your product. And I think that's core. Patrick is a good example of Stripe. I feel like that's a recurring theme with very successful product leaders is just constantly unsatisfied and unhappy with how things work.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:45:27):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:28):\nI love just even the way you summarize this, just a really good reframing of, instead of obsessing with reducing friction and reducing steps, instead think, how do I reduce the amount of thinking the user has to do? I've never heard of it described as, you have to think about the ATP and glucose being used to actually think, and your goal is to reduce that versus let's just reduce friction, reduce clicks.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:45:52):\nYeah. I think in my more cynical examples, I would say to people, \" Stop what you're doing for a second, close-\"\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:46:01):\nStop what you're doing for a second. Close your eyes, take a couple of deep breaths, and then pretend that you're an actual human being. And open their eyes again, and then look at this thing and see, can you figure out what it's supposed to do or say. Or what action you're supposed to take or what the impact will be if you take that action. There's a whole nother related cycle. But before I get into it, I know that I am verbose. I want to wrap up your last example of people being unsatisfied.\n\n(00:46:31):\nSo here's the quote that I was trying to find. This is 2014, so like that was the year that Slack actually launched officially in February. And this is now near the end of the year. I was interviewed by MIT Technology Review and asked if we were working to improve Slack. I said, \"Oh God, yeah. I try to instill this into the rest of the team, but certainly I feel like what we have right now is just a giant piece of shit. It's just terrible and we should be humiliated that we offer this to the public. Not everyone finds that motivational though.\"\n\n(00:47:06):\nSo I came into the office the next day and people had printed out on like 40 pieces of 8.5 by 11 paper that quote, and pasted it up on the wall. But to me that was like, you should be embarrassed by it. It should be a perpetual desire to improve. You should probably be like, \"Oh, this is great,\" and you could be proud of individual pieces of work. But in the aggregate, if you can't see almost limitless opportunities to improve, then you shouldn't be designing the product, or you shouldn't be in charge of the company, or you shouldn't almost nothing.\n\n(00:47:45):\nAgain, you could reduce it down to a tiny feature is anywhere close to perfect. And if A, that's acknowledged freely inside the organization. And B, people think about continually improving as the goal. And that could be like Six Sigma Toyota, Kaizen, that kind of side of thing. Or it could be that story that... I can't remember his name right now. The guy who started Bridgewater tells about Michael Jordan-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:11):\nRay Dalio.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:48:12):\nYeah, Ray Dalio in his book talks about Michael Jordan learning to ski. Every time he messed up, he wanted the ski instructor to tell him exactly what he was doing wrong. Because to him, every one of those was a gem that he could collect, and he could actually become a good skier. And what he wanted to do was become a good skier. That requires a lot of trust inside the organization.\n\n(00:48:36):\nBut if you can get to the point where like, \"Hey, we are trying to find improvements. We're trying to be critical because you're trying to make this as great as it can possibly be.\" And not always, not with every person, but most of the time with most people, you can get them to the point where that really direct criticism is actually motivational. It is like people are grateful to have the feedback, whether that's coming from their peers inside the company or from end users of the product. Because you realize, oh yeah, that is bad and we should fix it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:10):\nThis episode is brought to you by Lovable. Not only are they the fastest growing company in history, I use it regularly and I could not recommend it more highly.

So if you've been sitting on an idea, now is the time to bring it to life. Get started for free at Lovable.dev. That's lovable.dev. This makes me think about, let's call it a rant that you have about how it takes a lot of work to make anything work at all. That just the default state is not working. Can you just share what you share there.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:50:13):\nYeah. I mean, so this is a lot to do with, and maybe this is more recently, it shows up in politics a lot for me. But by the way, if anyone listening to this can help me find this tweet store from somewhere between 2016 and 2020, I don't have a precise idea. And it was this guy's thread about how hard it was to get a stop sign set up. And I believe it was in response to someone claiming that Bitcoin is going to replace US dollars, something about crypto. And his point was like, here's what happened when we tried to get a stop sign put up on a residential street in my neighborhood. And the literal years it took, and the number of agencies that were involved.\n\n(00:50:58):\nLike the engineering department, traffic planners, the HOA, and... I don't remember all of the organizations because, and I did that I could search better and find this again. Because it was truly a masterpiece of how difficult it is to get a stop sign put up in most places. The message that I hear from most politicians, and unfortunately this works really well, is things should be good. But they're not because someone is doing something bad, which is preventing the goodness.\n\n(00:51:29):\nSo billionaires are making things unaffordable. Or immigrants are taking your jobs. Or lazy freeloaders are sucking off a government tea, and causing us all have to pay more taxes, or something like that. The reality is almost nothing works. It's actually another call. I said in this case, John has a great encapsulation of this and I'm sure you're familiar with it, like that. It ends with the world as a museum of passion projects. Because for anything to get done at all requires not just the resources and effort required to instantiate that thing in the real world, but all of the politicking and the sociology and the convincing.\n\n(00:52:15):\nAnd there's a book called Why Nothing Works Recently, which is like, it's not an... I'm sorry to the author, if they... I doubt they're listening, but just it's not like an amazingly written book. I found it a little bit repetitive, but the content was really incredible, just explaining why it's so hard. And how there's this progressive increase in the number of vetoes that are available for any kind of course of action and how difficult it is... And this shows up in permitting for new construction and stuff like that. But also shows up obviously inside of organizations.\n\n(00:52:55):\nAnd the challenge is that people, A, I think this is evolutionary biological. It's hard for us to understand the world, except by anthropomorphizing it. And so if it didn't rain this year, it's because a God is mad, and probably because we didn't sacrifice enough goats or something last year. It's hard for people to understand just that, wow, weather is incredibly complex and chaotic, and ecosystems and climatology, and all that.\n\n(00:53:27):\nSame thing with the world. Like if I am struggling to pay all of my bills and be able to afford a little bit of luxury in the sense of location or a present for my kids or whatever, it's got to be somebody's fault. There has to be a decision that's made somewhere. And the reality is everything is so complicated. Everything is so multivariate, it's not satisfying. It's a terrible political message.\n\n(00:53:56):\nIt's much easier to say that there is like, oh, we understand why things are bad in the way that you're concerned about. And it's turns out that it's some someone's decision, and because of them it's bad. And so if we got rid of them or were able to overcome their decision, overturn it, and institute our own thing, then things would be good for you. And this really to me shows up inside of those organizations as well. I'll pause there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:25):\nI know kind of along those lines, you're a big believer in something called Parkinson's Law.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:54:31):\nYeah. So the original of that is, I think it's 1956. It's an article in The Economist by Parkinson. And the Maxim is work expands to fill the time available for its completion. And the way that it shows up, this is a little bit subtle. So like one of the things I found, since I don't have a job is there's much less time pressure. And that maxim, like if you want something done, give it to a busy person. The inverse is also true that like, if you're not that busy, wow, basic things take a really long time.\n\n(00:55:09):\nAnd so Parkinson actually starts out with his example of writing and posting a letter. And I don't remember who he used with the first example, but someone who's incredibly busy and has all these things they have to respond to. And then another case like a retired robot who has all the time in the world. It takes her a long time to write the letter. It takes her a long time to put it in the envelope, and then you go to the post office and post it.\n\n(00:55:28):\nBut the real meat of it is, for me later when he talks about the size of the organization, and he uses a bunch of examples. This is again 1950s, and he's British, so he's looking at the Royal Navy. And specifically he's looking at a chart that shows the relationship between the number of capital ships in the Navy, the number of sailors, and the number of administrators. And very familiar graph for people looking at any part of government. Any part of the relationship between the number of administrators at a university and the number of students and faculty, teaching faculty. Where it's like, okay, the number of ships goes like this and the number of sailors is looking right along with it. And the number of administrators goes like this.\n\n(00:56:14):\nAnd the reason this ties into the work expands to fill the time available for its completion is people hire, and they train. And here's the sad truth for anyone running a company is there are exceptions. There's certain types of engineers that are an exception to this. But the overwhelming majority of people you hire want to hire more people who report to them. And it's not because they're evil, and it's not because they're stupid. In fact, they're smart because everyone knows that the number of people who report to you correlates with your career trajectory, the amount of money that you're paid. The amount of authority you have inside the organization and on and on and on.\n\n(00:56:57):\nSo we would hire 27 Royal product managers in Slack who immediately want to hire someone. It's like, what the hell? What would that person do? And they articulate it this way, but essentially it's like, \"Well, that person would do the product management and then I would do strategy.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:11):\nClassic.\n\nStewart Butterfield (00:57:12):\nIt's really, I think the essential thing to understand about this is it's not because people are evil, and it's not because they're stupid. And it's to me, very related to everything is complex. And if maybe this is my butterfly's law, I haven't thought about this way before. But I tweeted this a very, very long time ago like if you... Everything is simple if you have no idea what you're talking about. So the other side of that is like if something seems simple, probably you don't understand it. And there's obvious exceptions to that.\n\n(00:57:53):\nBut for anything that involves a large organization or a lot of human beings, if the problem seems simple, you don't get it. So every budget process, no head of engineering know, head of sales, no CFO, no GC, who's ever going to come back and say, \"Oh, I've actually think next year we can just hire fewer people. Or we're going to keep it flat or we're going to shrink through attrition because we don't need any more people to do what we're doing.\" Not because they're evil, not because they're stupid, but it's almost overpowering impulse inside the organization that often leads to disastrous results. And so there's an...\n\n(00:58:30):\nI'll give one example from Slack's history, and I have tried in the past to disguise this example so that no one feels bad about it but I... Unfortunately, the specifics are so important to the example that it's not disguised and so I'll just reiterate that the people involved aren't stupid or evil. And one example that's from the outside. So the example inside of Slack was we introduced threads, which was the ability to reply to a message inside of a channel. And let's say you, Lenny, post a message. I, Stewart reply to it. You will automatically get a notification. And now Sarah later on replies to the same message. Both you and I, as people who have push in that thread will receive a notification that there's been more activity, and so on. So like every single time anyone replies to it.\n\n(00:59:23):\nSo when the feature first was released or like when we did the final product review before it was released, the input box was pre-populated with at the person before you in the thread. And I was using the feature and I would put the insertion point there, select all delete, and then start writing my message. And even if I wanted to add someone specifically, I almost never wanted to start my sentence with at that, because it just made it hard to reference what they were saying before. So I said, \"Get rid of this because, A, I think most people won't use it. Or if they did want to add someone, they're not going to want to do it at the beginning of the sentence.\n\n(01:00:07):\nAnd by the way, you're teaching them to use the product wrong. Because it's important that everyone understand that every previous poster in this thread will automatically receive a notification unless they've figured it.\"\n\n(01:00:20):\nSo okay, we release it. Six months goes by and suddenly the at thing comes back. And so I messaged someone around the team and I said, \"Hey, there's been a regression. This is super weird. I don't know what happened. But the at thing came back.\" And they said, \"Oh no, this is on purpose. We did a bunch of research.\" And so I was like, \"What?\" And I went through this and it was, if I recall correctly, it wasn't even P-95 certainty on this analysis. But it was something like when we do this, threads are 2.17 messages long, versus 2.14 messages long on average for when we don't do it.\n\n(01:00:59):\nAnd so first of all, why is a longer thread better? Like maybe a shorter thread is better? It can be fewer messages that people have to go back and forth. Also, that's such a tiny difference. Also, again, I don't remember the actual statistical analysis, so I'm not going to claim that it was incorrect. But I'm pretty sure this was outside the bounds of certainty that they can have. But the real thing was, oh my God, so you guys put flags into the product, you A-B tested it. You did the instrumentation. You created tables in the database or whatever we're using to record all of that.\n\n(01:01:39):\nYou wrote queries to pull that. You created charts based on that data. You had meetings to discuss it. And just kind unpacking all of the things that would've had to happen for this to come back. And it's like thousands of person hours at a minimum, because any feature change at that scale of organization, it's involving like a dozen people. Engineering, QA, analytics teams, project managers, user research and stuff like that. The problem with that, so I think it was a bad idea, right? But the problem with that was the difference that you could possibly achieve between having this feature and not having this feature is like this much whatever units you want. The cost of doing the analysis was this much. So it's guaranteed to be a loser.\n\n(01:02:29):\nLike there's just, there's no world in which anyone could imagine putting the at previous respondent in the thread at the beginning of the message could possibly make that much of a difference to the quality of Slack, and how much utility it provides for people and all of that. But you know that to put the feature flags in, to ship new versions of the product, to put the instrumentation in. To have it all the API calls to record every action that people take to do all the analytics, to create the dashboard. To put paste a screenshot of that into a Google Slides presentation. To send the invitations to the meeting, to reschedule the meeting because someone couldn't make it. To have everyone sit down and look at the thing. Like guaranteed loser.\n\n(01:03:14):\nAnd I know that Fareed told you to ask me about this hyper realistic work-like activities. And so here's my grand theory. Hyper realistic work-like activities goes along with this other concept called known valuable work to do. And when I say known, I mean both you know what it is and you know that it's valuable. And the problem with almost every organization at the very beginning, you have an enormous amount of work that you know what to do, and you know that it's going to be valuable. So like starting a business, open a bank account. Because there's almost infinite general value of opening a bank account. You have to do it. It's very simple to do.\n\n(01:04:01):\nAnd so at the very beginning of any startup, they're like, \"I'm creating a user's table, and I'm doing sorting passwords,\" and you're doing all the things that are kind of absolutely necessary. And everyone knows exactly what they are. And so everyone's going to work in the morning and they're like right on. And I have 10 things to do, and every single one of them is something I know how to do. And it's definitely going to be valuable. Time goes on. And the relationship between the supply of work to do and the demand for doing work just starts to change.\n\n(01:04:32):\nMore and more people get hired. Every product manager wants to hire a junior product manager. Every new person, the first person you bring in on the risk and compliance team is like, \"Oh my God, there's so many risks and things we have to be compliant with. We better hire more people on my team to do more risk and compliance work.\" Which probably to some degree is right. But we're going to have more and more of those people and they're going to call meetings with each other.\n\n(01:04:54):\nAnd now suddenly you have all these people with work to do and you've done all the easy obvious stuff. And now your questions are like, \"God, should we do FedRAMP high and make a Slack version? Which is going to require us to have wholly separate physical infrastructure for the hardware that runs the software? And also a whole different operations team, which has only US citizens on it? What is the possible number of dollars that we could make from doing this? And how much complexity is going to be when we want to do updates to the software because we update two totally separate independent systems and rec.\"\n\n(01:05:27):\nIt just gets out of whack, and so people end up... Like if you hire 17 product marketers, you're going to have 17 product marketers worth of demand for work to do. And if you don't have sufficient supply of product marketing work to do, they're just going to do other stuff. Again, very important, not because they're stupid, not because they're evil. But because they're like, I'm a product marketer and I want to be recognized for my work. And my spouse has criticized me because they take, I should have already got promoted in the last cycle, and they really got to demonstrate some wins here and whatever it is.\n\n(01:06:02):\nAnd so people are like calling meetings with their colleagues to preview the deck that they're going to show in the big meeting to get feedback on whether they should improve some of the slides. And that hyper-realistic work-like activity is superficially identical to work. Like we are sitting in a conference room and there's something being projected up there, and we're all talking about it. And that's exactly what work is. Hopefully not all of work for everyone inside of your company. But that's exactly what we do when we're working.\n\n(01:06:34):\nBut this is actually a fake bit of work, and it's so subtle that I'll do it. Our board members will do it. Every executive will do it. And the further you are from having all of the context and all of the information and the decision-making authority and stuff like that, the easier it is to get trapped in this stuff. And people will just perform enormous amounts of hyper-realistic work-like activities, and have no idea that that's what they're doing. And the result of that, I guess, is that if you are a leader, if you're manager, director, an executive, you're the CEO, it's on you to ensure that there is sufficient supply of known valuable work to do. And there almost always is, but it's creating the clarity around that. Creating the alignment. Making sure everyone understands it, but that's what they're supposed to be doing, and then obviously doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:26):\nAmazing. I could listen to Stewart's rants all day. Hyper- realistic work-life activities. We need to coin this-\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:07:34):\nUnfortunately, it doesn't make a good acronym. It's pretty ugly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):\nOkay.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:07:37):\n[inaudible 01:07:37].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:36):\nOkay. [inaudible 01:07:37] it a try. And just to close the loop on that, the solution is the leader recognizing this is happening and stopping it. Telling people why are we spending time on this thing that is not going to get us anywhere?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:07:48):\nYeah. And what you just said probably isn't the best way because that sounds like you're chiding them, and they're dumb. When it's actually your responsibility to make sure that there's sufficient clarity around what the priorities are, and explicitly saying no to things upfront and stuff like that. Rather than merging and say like, \"Hey, you guys are a bunch of idiots wasting your time on this thing that doesn't matter.\" Whose fault is it? It's the manager's fault. It's the VP of whatever's fault. It's the CX, whatever, it's the C... Ultimately, it's the leader of the organization that has the responsibility to make sure that there is sufficient known-valuable work to do. And that's actually harder than it might appear.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:32):\nOkay. Before we run out of time, I want to touch on two other topics. One is, when people think of Stewart Butterfield, I think a lot of people think of, We Don't Sell Saddles Here. Your legendary Medium post that is just, I don't know, it's become a historic piece of literature in the annals of product building and in startups. I haven't heard people ask you much about this recently. So let me just ask a couple of questions. What was the reason you put that out? What was the backstory on writing that memo? Why was it necessary?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:09:01):\nWell, it really was an internal memo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:00):\n... Memo. Why was it necessary?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:09:01):\nWell, it really was an internal memo and there's a bit of a digression. One of the crappy things about Slack is if all your corporate communication is on email, depending on exactly how it works and what system you use, you probably walk away with an archive of everything you said at Company X. If it's Slack, once you're turned off, you lose access to all that history. And so it's kind of like, \"Oh, man. If I had only exported all of my messages before I left, I would have all this stuff,\" but that was absolutely verbatim. I did not change a word of what I said inside the company. Well, I think we were still eight people. Maybe at most 10, but I think it was eight people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:45):\nIt was before Slack launched even.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:09:47):\nYeah, it was before Slack launched. It was when we're doing private beta. And the point of it was to start to instill those ideas as early as possible and really create this alignment inside of that small team so that it could persist to survive as we grew and scaled. Yeah, that was the idea.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:11):\nAnd the gist, just for people that aren't super familiar with it, but we'll link to it, is just it's not enough just to build a great product. You just as much have to put effort into communicating what this does for them, the problem this is solving for them, the outcome this is going to achieve for them. Is that a good way to think about it?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:10:28):\nYeah. And again, comparing it to beer or cars, beer goes back to pre-civilization. Cars were obviously [inaudible 01:10:38], but at some point you had to convince people why they would want a car instead of a horse. For your new AI-based recruiting tool or your calendar app or whatever, there's some reason why you think that people should use yours instead of the thing that they're using now, which might be a wholesale one-for- one replacement, or more often is a change in the way that you're working that has a bunch of other adjacencies and you want to expand into these other categories. You're not just responsible for creating the product, but also, to a certain degree, creating the market.\n\n(01:11:15):\nThere's this book, Positioning, which is an absolute classic. It's very short. I would recommend everyone read it, where the point of it is, from my perspective, it's almost impossible to create a new idea in someone's head. It's much easier to take a couple of existing ideas and put them together. So it's much easier to say it's like Jaws meets Star Wars, or it's Uber for Pets or something like that, than to come up with an actual new idea. But you have to do that because if your thing is different in any significant way from the alternatives, you're not just creating the product. You're creating the market. They're really kind of one and the same.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:56):\nThe reason I wanted to touch on it is I think still people continue to not listen to this advice and continue to over-invest in more features, more products, things like that. Just the specific example of, \"We don't sell saddles here,\" just to quickly communicate this to folks, and correct me if I'm missing anything, is just instead of, \"Hey, look at this amazing saddle we've bought,\" which you want to communicate as, \"Here, go horseback riding. Look at this incredible experience you can have.\" And then they decide, \"Oh, shit. I need to go buy a saddle to do that.\"\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:12:23):\nYeah. And 100%, that aspect of it is not original because I think that's something that marketers have done for a long time, certainly in the marcom and advertising. If you want to sell Harley-Davidson's, there are people who are going to geek out on the engines and stuff like that and the quality of the leather and stuff like that. But when you're selling the motorcycle, you're selling the open road and freedom and the wind in your hair. And if you're Lululemon, you are obviously selling yoga pants, but you're also selling health and aspiration and being the best version of yourself and a bunch of other stuff. Oh my God, I forgot the classic version of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:00):\nThere's the ship ...\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:13:00):\nYou're selling the screwdriver.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:04):\nOh, yeah. The nail.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:13:05):\nYeah, the nail. Anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:07):\nYeah, we missed that one. Well, there's the one I think about is instead of trying to convince men to build a ship, instill a yearning for the sea.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:13:16):\nYes. Exactly. That's something that goes back in history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:21):\nOkay. Let me ask you about pivoting. You are potentially the king of pivots. You started two companies both famously pivoted, both from video games, which is why I asked you about that at the beginning, into very successful companies. I imagine many people come to you for advice on pivoting. Let me just ask when folks come to you asking, \"Should I stick with my idea? Should I pivot?\" what sort of advice do you find most helps them?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:13:43):\nYeah, I mean, I think it's partly an intuition because obviously the decision is about, \"Have you exhausted the possibilities?\" and in the case where we were working on Glitch, this game where we used IRC for internal communication and we added a bunch of IRC which became the Proto Slack. I think Slack had an enormous advantage in the fact that we are working on this for several years without actually explicitly working on it and only doing the minimum number of features that were absolutely guaranteed to be successful in the sense that it was so irritating that we couldn't stand it anymore or such an obvious improvement that we couldn't help but take advantage of it. We still had $ 9 million left and everyone still liked the game and we were all happy working on it, but I think by that point I had exhausted every non-verdiculous long shot idea to make it commercially successful, and so I decided to abandon it.\n\n(01:14:52):\nBut the default advice for anyone in anything is persevere. It's like a kitten hanging off the branch and a poster says, \"Hang in there.\" There's so many stories of, \"So-and-so started out going door-to-door and was rejected by everyone and then suddenly there was Nike,\" or something like that and just, \"If you stick with it long enough, you'll eventually be successful.\" I think you have to really be coldly rational. Some of this shows up in the book Thinking in Bets. Some of it's in Annie Duke's second book, the title of which I'm forgetting right now, but someone will know it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:35):\nYeah, Thinking in Bets, and then what was the second? I forget.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:15:39):\nShe actually uses Glitch and Slack as an example of a smart fold basically. My expected value here has diminished to the point where this alternative looks more attractive. And the reason I say you have to be coldly rational about it is because it's fucking humiliating. I convinced so many and you have to convince so many people to get a company off the ground. You have to go to investors. You have to go to early employees and say, \"You should leave your other job and come work for this because here's the incredible feature we're imagining.\" You have to go to the press and you have to make all these promises and you have users and you've committed things to the users and you've convinced them to give up their time for this thing. And so I think for a lot of people, it feels better to just keep doing it until it dies of suffocation due to lack of capital or something like that. Then just to admit, \"Okay, I was wrong. This didn't work,\" and it's humiliating. It's painful. It's wrenching. It has a bad impact.\n\n(01:16:46):\nWhen we shut down Glitch, there was a lot of people who loved it and would spend all of their free time and couldn't wait to get home from work to go play it more. And that was their community and the community just disappeared, all these people and all these identities that have been created. And obviously, people lost their jobs and people who had moved their families to a different city in order to take this job now weren't going to have a job anymore. So pivots aren't something I take lightly. I think it's very different to be like, \"There's three of us and we started making this app and then we pivoted to a different app.\" That doesn't even really count. If you're six months into something, you're still messing around. You're trying to figure out what it is that you're building. It's not really a pivot. Obviously in this case, it worked out great and there's survivorship bias and that doesn't mean that everyone should pivot all the time. But I think creating the distance so that you can make an intellectual, rational decision about it rather than an emotional decision is essential.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:50):\nI love, also, your piece of advice of just exhaust. Once you've exhausted all the ideas, that's a really good time to see what else is out there.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:17:56):\nYeah, just all the good ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):\nAll the good ideas,\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:18:00):\nAll the realistic. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:03):\nYeah. The point you made about just kind of persevering, I just had Melanie Perkins, CEO of Canva, in the podcast. 100 investors rejected her before somebody finally decided to invest and she just kept pushing.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:18:19):\nYeah. I think that's a slightly different example, right? She eventually believed in the concept of the product and in the vision. It was just trying to figure out the right articulation to get investors who ended up being obviously very, very happy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:31):\nExtremely happy. Oh, geez. Okay. Maybe a final topic depending on how time goes. I want to talk about generosity. I talked to a bunch of people, as I said, that have worked with you and the number one theme that came up again and again and again when I asked them about you and what has stuck most with them is just generosity. So I'm going to read a few examples that I heard from folks that are examples of your generosity over the years.\n\n(01:18:57):\nSo one person shared that he needed a little money before Christmas and he said, \"Stewart literally walked me out of the building, went to the cash machine, handed me $500, told me to go home to my family.\" Other folks shared that, when you talked about Glitch just recently when you had to lay people off, you cried real tears when you were laying people off and then you spent an incredible amount of time helping them find new jobs and extending their severance pay and just taking it extremely, extremely seriously, much more than I think most people feel like CEOs do. Someone else shared that you paid 100% of employees health insurance to give them just fewer things to think about.\n\n(01:19:35):\nWhen you went public, you basically created the best possible situation for employees, no lockup, direct listing. Also, with the structure of the Slack deal, people said that acquisition was very employee friendly. That's employees. There's also just the way you thought about customers. A few examples: You gave free credits to businesses who were struggling to pay the bills during COVID. You released this fair billing, which I think was very innovative at the time, where you stopped charging people for seats they weren't using, even though they signed a deal to charge for those seats. A lot of times, you slipped release schedules because you just wanted to make features better and better for people. And I'll end with this quote: \"Stewart is a leader who takes the responsibility he feels for his employees personally, and to which he extends the most generous circumstances he could muster. That feels worth celebrating.\"\n\n(01:20:25):\nSo first of all, I just want to celebrate you. I think it's really rare and inspiring to meet a leader like that. Clearly, you've had a lot of impact on a lot of people. I don't know exactly the question I want to ask, but I guess in what part is this intentional, just like, \"This is how we win. I'm going to be very generous and help people because I know this will help long-term\"? How much of this is just a [inaudible 01:20:48] and it's just the way you are as a person?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:20:49):\nI think a lot of it is just the way I am as a person and I had wonderful parents who raised me right, but I think there is a little bit of a lesson there and I'm just going to assume people's familiarity with the prisoner's dilemma. The acts of generosity to me are, \"Oh, I am demonstrating that I am going to cooperate as we iterate in this game.\" And if you do that, then people will also cooperate and you both benefit. Whereas if you never really know if the other person is going to defect at the first opportunity, then your best bet is to defect. And so there's a game theoretic aspect, usually in games that are much, much, much more complicated than the prisoner's dilemma.\n\n(01:21:36):\nI think one thing I didn't touch on before, but to me was important enough, is that at more than one company all hands, I made everyone in the company repeat this as a chant. It was, \"In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value that we create for customers.\" And I wanted to be super clear and explicit about that because it should be if anything you're doing feels like a little bit shady, a little bit cheating, a little bit maximizing at the wrong moment or taking advantage of a customer or anything like that, definitely shouldn't do it. Because to me, I mean I think it's literally true, but it's also an ethical way to run a business. And it's not just that the ethics are good. It's like there's advantages for you. You're able to attract a better class of employees. If all your employees are ethical, then it's going to be a better place for everyone to work and you're going to be happier and you're going to have fewer internal problems and all that stuff.\n\n(01:22:48):\nBut I think it really is true that especially in the long run, you can't destroy value for your customers and expect to be successful. You have to actually make their lives better. And you could put effort into pointing it out to them and demonstrating that you have created this value and stuff like that, but there's no substitute for actually having created it. And I think that is incredibly important and that implies a real generosity, whether that's in negotiating terms with an enterprise deal or that's policy decisions. One time that it blew up in our face was our SLA was like, \"For any downtime, you get 100 times your money back.\" Because from my perspective, it's like if we're down for two minutes, it's like pennies. It doesn't really make any difference. If we're down for 10 hours or something like that, then we have bigger problems than paying back people.\n\n(01:23:51):\nFast-forward, we now have hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and we've gone public. And shortly after we go public, we have one of the biggest outages we ever had. I don't remember how long it was, but it was many hours. But by the time we got that scale, 100 times the money back for the third of a day that we were down was $8 million or something like that. It didn't cost us any money because we just gave it to people in the form of credits, but it meant that a bunch of revenue that we had already anticipated for the next quarter wasn't going to show up because people's credits were going to offset what they would've otherwise paid us. And so we definitely changed the terms of service after that because being a public company is a little bit different. But in every other respect, I think they were all really important decisions that were helpful in us becoming successful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:47):\nWas that policy ... It was automatic? You didn't even have to claim it. It was just automatically you get this credit?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:24:52):\nAnd the default is you don't have to pay if you let us know. This was, \"We will automatically, proactively, preemptively without any input from you ...\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:00):\nToo generous.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:01):\n\"Apply this credit to your account, and just send you a message that it happened. And by the way, we will do it on the aggregate for downtime, even if the issue didn't affect you as a customer.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:13):\nWow. Too generous. You found the edge of where you want to be.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:13):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:18):\nWhat was that mantra again that you had the company chant? I think this is a really nice way to end it.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:22):\nIt was, \"In the long run, the measure of our success will be the amount of value we create for customers.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:28):\nIncredible. I'm just trying to picture the entire team at Slack reciting this mantra.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:33):\nIt was hundreds of people. It felt very like, Kim Jong-Un or Stalin or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:38):\nWell, on that note, most people don't know this about you, but your actual name when you were born was not Stewart. It was Dharma.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:46):\nAnd this all makes sense as you learn that.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:25:49):\nYeah. My name is Dharma Jeremy Butterfield, so my parents named me. And when I was 12, I changed it because I just really wanted to be normal and for some reason I thought Stewart was a normal name. And by the way, you'll notice this now that I said it. Any character except for Stuart Little the mouse, anytime you see a character in a movie, a novel, TV show or whatever, there's only the loser Stewart and the asshole Stewart. It's obviously, in the collective consciousness, a terrible name and I shouldn't have chosen it and I regret it. But by the time I realized that, Dharma and Greg had already come out and it would've seemed like I was bandwagon jumping. And people thought it was a girl's name, even though in India it's obviously only a boy's name.\n\n(01:26:32):\nI'm going to add just one last little tidbit because I forgot about this earlier on and I think it helps tie things together, and it's called the owner's delusion. And this is based on something I posted on Twitter. The person who came up with the name later deleted their account and so I have no idea who it was and who to credit for this. But what I had posted was, and this was a long time ago when restaurant websites have gotten better and it doesn't really matter because Google Local was taking over everything, but this is, let's say, 10 years ago.\n\n(01:27:00):\nThere's five things you could possibly want when you go to a restaurant's website and it's their street address, their phone number, the menu, the hours of operation ... Oh my God, I'm forgetting the fifth thing. Oh, and making a reservation, how to make a reservation. And again, this problem has to some extent taken care of it's itself or at least improved, but what you would get was this super slow loading photo, the Ken Burns effect as it [inaudible 01:27:30] ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):\nThe flashed.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:27:30):\nAnd then fading in and then some music starts playing. And then if they show you the phone number, it's not clickable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:38):\nImage.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:27:39):\nIt's not even text that you can copy because yes, it's an image. And they don't have the hours. They don't put the address or whatever and it's just like, \"What?\" For sure, whoever made this website for the restaurant owner and the restaurant owner themselves have definitely been in the position where they went to somebody else's restaurant website because they wanted to get the address or the opening hours or the phone number or whatever. So why does it end up like this and what should we call this?\n\n(01:28:01):\nAnd whoever replied to the tweet, she said, \"We should call it the owner's delusion,\" and I was like, \"Oh my God. That's perfect.\" And I think that is incredibly powerful and what ends up with the result, like Apple naming whatever that feature is called Sleep, which it's too hard to understand what that can possibly mean. And that's why people anticipate, despite the fact that when they get to your website for the first time, their intent is absolutely the minimum number of micro points above the threshold required from them to actually take that action.\n\n(01:28:41):\nYou're like, \"All right. Welcome to my website,\" and there's a bunch of BS and there's a bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense and the buttons are inscrutable. And it's unclear what to do next because I think that my thing is so important and I don't recognize that you are at work and you were late this morning and you have to go to the bathroom and you're just a regular human being who has stuff going on, that you're concerned that your kid is a fuck-up and they're getting in trouble at school and stuff like that. They're not subjects who paid money to go to your play and are sitting in the audience and waiting for that curtain to go out. They're people who are going to bounce in a fraction of a second. And so everyone should always be conscious of the owner's solution.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:27):\nI love that. What's the solution? Is it have other people look at it and give you feedback?\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:29:31):\nYeah, and recognize it. And unfortunately, it's one of those things like Murphy's Law.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:35):\nYeah.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:29:37):\nEven you can go wrong even when you take into account Murphy's Law.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:39):\nThat's right.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:29:41):\nBut if you don't name it and recognize it and discuss it and train yourself to think that way, take a breath, pretend you're a regular person, and then look at this again and see if it makes sense, then you're screwed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:55):\nI love that. I love that you threw this in here. I have a billion other questions I'm going to ask you in part two when we do this someday. Stewart, thank you so much for doing this. Thank you so much for being here.\n\nStewart Butterfield (01:30:04):\nYeah. Thank you for having me, Lenny. I really enjoyed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:07):\nSame here. Bye, everyone.

Because if you have great ideas of what to build but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned. You don't want any of this ... Like people in the organization, they ask mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other. That doesn't work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nToday, my guest is Tamar Yehoshua. Tamar is currently president of product and technology at Glean, one of the most successful enterprise AI companies out there right now. Prior to joining Glean, Tamar was chief product officer at Slack for four years where she led product design and research as the company scaled 10Xed their revenue, went through IPO and then got bought by Salesforce. Tamar also led product and engineering teams at Google, where for many years she was responsible for the Google search experience. She also spent five years at Amazon as director of engineering and vice president at A9.com. She was also a venture partner at IVP and has been on board of directors for ServiceNow, Snyk, RetailMeNot, and Yext. In our conversation, we get into all kinds of juicy advice, including why companies don't have to be run well to win, why you don't need a career plan, the two habits she credits most for helping her succeed throughout her career, what she learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield and Marc Benioff, how to build stronger cross-functional relationships and a bunch of advice on AI including how it will likely change your jobs, examples of how she and her colleagues are already using AI to be more productive in their work and what she's learned about building AI-based products that are non-deterministic and can be very unpredictable.\n\n(00:01:51):\nThis episode is for anyone looking to level up as a leader and get a better sense of how AI will change your job.

With that, I bring you Tamar Yehoshua.\n\n(00:02:12):\nTamar, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:02:15):\nThank you so much for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:17):\nI've had so many people recommend you coming on this podcast. I'm really happy that we're finally doing this. I want to start with a question that I've started to ask people who have had extraordinarily successful careers, which you've had. So let me ask you, what are one or two specific skills or mindsets or habits that you think most contributed to your success during the course of your career that you think might be helpful to people who are trying to figure out how to accelerate their career or just be more successful in their career?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:02:47):\nOne of the things that I think is overlooked is do a really good job at whatever your job is at that point. People have a tendency ... Especially product managers are very ambitious and they want to get to the next level and they're always eyeing the next job, but you're not going to get the next job unless you do really well at the job that you're in. Knock it out of the park. However simple, however easy it may be to you, do a great job. And in tech jobs, there's table stakes. There's table stakes of you need to be technical, you need to know the latest technology, you need to understand your product, the product you're working on. No matter what your role is. You have to understand it deeply. You need to understand metrics. So especially product managers have a wide breadth of things that they need to understand. So those are a given. You need to do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:40):\nThis episode is brought to you by Explo, a game changer for customer facing analytics and data reporting. Are your users craving more dashboards, reports and analytics within your product? Are you tired of trying to build it yourself?

So after you've done a great job at everything and you understand the core skills that you need, another thing you really need to know is understanding people and motivations. And when you're building products, you have to understand why does somebody want to use your product? What problem are they solving? Why do they want to click on that button? What's going to make them feel good when they click on it? What's going to give them delight and what's also going to make them feel bad and frustrated and what do they not want to do? So you need to understand motivations in people for building products and for building teams and organizations. So just like why does somebody want to click on a button, why does somebody want to join your team? Why do they want to work hard? What are they trying to accomplish? What's the goal for their career?\n\n(00:06:54):\nSo you have to be able to read people, ask lots of questions to understand them. And I'll say one thing that really helped me, this is a strange segue, but my father was a psychiatrist and when I was growing up, we would have family occasions, go to events, whatever, and afterwards in the car ride back, he would always give his perspective of analyzing what happened at the event. What this person was thinking. Why did they say this? And then he would quiz me of, \"Why do you think they did that?\" And it was really interesting because it taught me to see the whole room. To see how people react. Like Lenny, if you say something and somebody else is there, look at the other person. What's their face saying? You can understand so much if you're paying attention. So I think when you want to build for people and lead organizations, it is about the people and understanding them and motivating them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:58):\nI love this advice. I feel like we could do a whole podcast on just this topic. So on this last point about understanding people, is there an example of this in either a product you built of just like, \"Oh, here's something I noticed about someone using Slack or Google or Amazon that changed the way I think about building this specific feature.\"?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:08:17):\nOne of the things that I caution product managers about is that you don't want to be too overly reliant on metrics and you want to also have an intuition. You want product managers who understand intuitively their customers and their product and sometimes you'll make decisions because you just know it's the right thing to do because it feels right and it usually is right if you understand your product well enough. How do you get good at it? Ask a lot of questions. Don't assume you know. Marc Benioff would always say, \"Have a beginner's mind. Go in assuming that you know nothing and listen to your customers, listen to the people.\" Because I also see this as you're building a feature and you think it's the best thing. Because of course everyone's going to want it because you worked on it and you're going to put it front and center in the interface where everybody's going to see it. Well, no, you got to earn that right. And that is another thing that people do is they want the thing they worked on to be right there, but it might not be the most important thing that a person needs at that point. So have perspective. Have perspective of what your users are actually trying to achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:33):\nGoing back to your first point about doing a great job at the job you have, I imagine some people hear this and the advice is do a great job at the job you're already doing, and they may feel like they are, and there's other reasons they aren't being promoted. Is there an example from your career or a story you could tell of just like to clarify what doing a great job look like where it's not just like I hit my goals. It's like, here's what it looks like. Here's how you actually get ahead.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:10:00):\nAre you helping the business move forward? So it's not about I achieve what I was asked to do, but did you build something that people actually used? It's not about just launching something and did you do the right thing for the company? And that is different. It's a different mindset. Did you enable the entire organization to be more productive despite you? I remember very early in my career I was working as an engineer and I was offered a job to manage a team that was across different programs. I took a vacation, I came back and I said, \"I don't think this team should exist.\" It was my first management job and I wanted to be a manager. And I said, \"Here's why I don't think that this team should exist. It's not the right thing for the company. It's not going to be productive.\" And my manager was so stunned. He was like, \"Wait. You're saying no?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, because here's how you should organize it.\" And then he's like, \"You're right, and I'll find you something else,\" and he did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:15):\nIf I were to put this into one word, it's impact. Drive impact.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:11:18):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:19):\nAmazing. Okay. Going in a different direction, we were chatting before we started recording this and something that you shared with me, and some people may be really surprised to hear this, but I completely agree with this take, is that you don't need to be a well-run business to win. I've seen this myself. I'd love to hear your insights here and especially where you notice this. What parts of your career noticed this to be true?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:11:45):\nI love working at well-run companies. It's more fun, your people are happier. I like running a well-run team, so I aspire to have a very well run team and to work at a well run company. But what I've seen is when a company isn't well run like IT isn't working, marketing is broken, there are not enough people in HR, there's a lot of turnover. All of these things I've seen that they're not correlated to the company being successful. So I can think of a couple examples right now of companies I know ... Not Glean, where I'm working today. Where there's high executive turnover. Where people get yelled at. There are lots of people fired. There's reorgs all the time. People I talk to are super unhappy, but the numbers are amazing. They're growing like crazy. And the opposite sit is also true. I can think of one company I know really well, amazing, CEO, well run, well oiled machine, everything. Hired good executives and they flat lined.\n\n(00:12:51):\nSo you just see it. You see it over and over again and people get very upset about these things that aren't working. And one of the things that I try and do is give a perspective of what matters and what doesn't. And it might even be to the sales team because you get all these requests for features all the time. If you did every single one, it would be impossible. Even if you did, 80, 90% of them won't matter for the success of the company. But then there are some that really matter. So what are the things that really matter? We always talk about product market fit. Nobody really knows what product market fit is. Everybody has a different explanation, but it means people want to use your product. That they're clamoring for it. So you've built something that people value and that people value and that solves a problem for them, but that's also not good enough. You need to build a great product, but you also have to have distribution and you need to have a sales team that works. And you have to have enough money in the bank to get there. So those are probably the things that are the most important. I might be missing something.\n\n(00:13:58):\nAnd then within each of those, there's the things that really mattered and there's so many features that we built at Slack that were the most important features ever that failed and nobody used so it clearly didn't have an impact. And you can see that in retrospect, but I think after being at multiple different big companies and small companies, I have that perspective of let's just make sure that we do the right things and don't get too worked up about all the things that are broken because every startup has so many things that are broken.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:29):\nSo I think a really interesting insight here is that if you're working at a company that is just chaotic and it feels like we don't know what we're doing, I don't know how this thing is running, I don't know how this will continue to be successful, your experience is it ... Is it that most of the successful companies you've been at are just chaotic internally and aren't incredibly run and that's normal, that's very typical?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:14:51):\nUntil they get to a certain scale. Now, once you reach a certain scale and you've already conquered the market, then you need to be well run. Then you bring in professional managers and things are about the cost and executing and getting all the ... Once you get to over 5,000 people or 10,000 people, you got to have things that ... Then you're a growth engine. You have to know what phase you're in and what's important at that phase. So it isn't that at every phase, chaos is okay, and also some chaos is okay and some chaos is not okay. If you're changing your strategy all the time and you're changing your direction and you're changing projects on people all the time so that they can't actually achieve anything ... So this is again, so you can't simplify it that some chaos is okay and some isn't. And also some chaos is right for you as a person. There are some really great companies I would never work at because they don't fit me. They're not a company I would enjoy going to work in the morning or they're not aligned with what I'm good at. So just because a company is doing well, if the chaos is chaos and something that's going to make you upset and unhappy don't work there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:11):\nIs there a correlation there? Just like companies that have strong product market fit, things are just breaking as they're going through hyper growth? Just thoughts on why this is the case.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:16:21):\nA lot of it is that because if you are in hyper growth, you've got customers coming at a really fast pace, you're growing your company really quickly and the number of employees and it's just really hard to keep up. Because things in the infrastructure break, things in the communication breakdown. You've got at any given point 50% of the company has been there less than six months. But you have to grow really fast because once you hit product market fit, if you don't, then your growth will stop. So if you're suddenly growing, especially if you're an enterprise company, you have to have salespeople, if you're a consumer company or systems have to keep running as you scale. And look at companies like MySpace, well, they died because their product got too slow. And so some companies have initial product market fit and then they don't keep up. So I do think a lot of it is it's very hard to grow that fast. And so things really do start breaking, but then once you get all the right leadership in place, processes in place, then it starts to get better. So it goes through ups and downs in level of chaos.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:28):\nThere's one takeaway here that product market fit solves a lot of problems. Strong product market fit.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:17:33):\nWell, no product market fit is a death sentence. I would say it more like that. If you built a product that people aren't really excited to use, then you don't have a company because it's very hard to do that unless you have distribution machine and then you catch up over time. But we will not name companies like that. So there are other ways of doing it, but yeah, that is the most important thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:00):\nYeah. I will say during my experience at Airbnb, I absolutely saw this. It was just nonstop chaos. And I always felt like, well, how is this continuing to operate and succeed? Things are just out of control. Everything's changing every six months. I don't know what's happening here. And I think a lesson here is just that's normal for a hyper growth business that has strong product market fit. But again, not a good excuse to just allow chaos. And it's not like chaos means success, right?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:18:30):\nAnd it's not a good excuse to not have an organization that's functioning. You should still strive to have an organization that's functioning and keep people happy and motivated and all that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:39):\nGreat. Okay. Another maybe contrarian opinion that you hold along the career track is that you don't need to plan your career. I also 100% agree with this. I had no plan for my career. I never knew where the hell I was going to go. I never had this vision of here's what I want to do. I just followed things that were pulling me and things that seemed interesting. I love that you also tell people this. I'd love to hear your insights here. Especially for someone that's either struggling with their career or just stressed. They don't have a plan or their plan's not working the way they wanted it to.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:19:12):\nReally recently I was talking to somebody in their twenties who was asking me for career advice. Should I be a product manager, et cetera. And I'm trying to put together my five-year plan and I said, \"I never had a five-year plan.\" So to be clear, some people need that. That's the kind of people they are. They want the planning. I said, \"It's great if you want that, but I never had it.\" And the person I was talking to just relaxed and they're like, \"Oh my God, that's so great to hear because I have no idea what I want to do in five years.\" I'm like, \"I still have no idea what I want to do in five years. I've never had an idea what I want to do in five years.\" Early in your career you have a lot more angst about it because the forks in the road are more significant because they can go, do I go get an MBA or do I go work for somebody? Do I be a product manager or an engineer? And those really take you in very different paths.\n\n(00:20:09):\nAnd I meet a lot of kids in their ... I shouldn't call them kids. My kids are my kids' friends. But a lot of people who are younger in their career who are struggling with this a little bit. So what I believe, and I've always believed is that you follow people. You learn the most from people. I don't look for domains. Some people have a domain, like I'm super interested in climate or whatever and they really want to work in that area and that's fine so maybe within that area. But you follow people who are the best at what they do. So it's not good enough to follow somebody who you like. You want to follow somebody who's either the best product thinker or the best engineer or the best salesperson. And so that you will learn the skill of how to be the best at that.\n\n(00:21:01):\nSo you follow people where you're going to learn the most. And a way to do that also is you look at where the great people are going. So you want to go to companies where there's also a nexus of great people because they together will do great things. And even if the company fails or succeeds, but not as much as you'd like, you still have those connections. Everybody talks about the PayPal Mafia and how they've gone on to do things. I was super lucky to be at Google for so many years and I spent a lot of time with Googlers that I met and that are all working in different companies now because you build those relationships by working together. So if you follow people and where you're going to learn the most and you go step by step, I think that's a great way of progressing in your career.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:53):\nThat's such tactical advice. And I've seen this work for a lot of people that just go where their favorite former employees work. And not favorite to your point, but the people that they most respect and have been most impressed by. And I think it's such an easy thing to do. It's a really easy heuristic for understanding where to go. There's something Marc Andreessen once shared that I'm reminded of when you say this. There's a term for this, I forget the actual term, but there's certain companies have this gravitational pull where they are acquiring all the best talent. They're currently the gravity in the space and everyone awesome is going there. And you have to, as a company, know you're one of those companies or you're the opposite. You're losing all the people and they're all going to this other company. I guess any thoughts on that?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:22:43):\nYeah. And it's really bad when you don't have a gravitational pull. It's super hard. I would say that one thing that if you're a manager, I always advise managers, go somewhere where you can recruit. I got a piece of advice from a friend that I thought was amazing advice as a leader. She said to me, \"Take a job where if you hire people, it's going to make their careers.\" I was like, \"Whoa.\" Because I was getting offers for some turnaround jobs. And if you think you can turn around, great. But if you're going to hire the best people, you want to make sure that it's going to be a good place for them and that they're going to learn and they're going to grow. And so you want to do right by them. And you really earnestly want to say you can make your career by coming here.\n\n(00:23:36):\nAnd I thought that gave such a higher bar for every job I was looking at as a leader that I thought it was just amazing advice. And then on the flip side, on the negative side, some people are putting too much emphasis on where will I get a big financial return? And I've found that financial returns are the hardest to predict. You know who's good. You know who you want to work with. You can predict where you're going to learn. Because even if a company fails, you learn a lot. But predicting financial success is so hard because you don't know what's going to happen with the market, with the world, with crypto, and Meta AI. And people who do that and say ... I had one person say, \"I took this job because I'm a mercenary. They just paid me a ton.\" Did not work out for him. And I feel really bad when people do that, but I think that it's a dangerous thing to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nI imagine some people hearing this advice are going to feel like, \"I'm not going to get a job at OpenAI or Glean or other awesome companies that everyone wants to go work at.\" Any advice to those folks?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:24:52):\nThere's lots of good companies and there's lots of smart people. You don't have to be at the top brand. And if you go somewhere where you're going to learn and it's going to get you there. I made mistakes. I went to some companies, multiple companies that failed or stopped growing and didn't do well or didn't have all the right people. Careers you don't make every step is to the right place. You remember in what you cited, all the companies I went to that did well, you left out all the ones that I went to that didn't do well. And so then people will assume that every time I made a job change, it was to a company that did well. No. That was not the case. So if you focus on that learning bit, you will get there. And there are lots of paths. There isn't just the OpenAI or Glean or Anthropic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:42):\nAwesome. And again, I love how tactical this is. If someone is trying to figure out where to go work if they're unhappy in their current job or don't have a job right now is just make a list of the people you most respect that are the best at the thing they do, see where they work and there's your list of companies to potentially go after. There's a lot of benefits to this as you shared. It's not just helping you pick the place to work, it's the network. It'll level you up. Is there anything else along those lines that is helpful for people to think about why this is a really good strategy?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:26:10):\nSkills can't be taken away. A company can fail, but if you learn a skill, you will always have that skill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):\nI love that. And I've totally seen this to work, so I really love that you're focusing on this advice. You've mentioned places you've worked and folks you've worked with. You worked with folks like Jeff Bezos, Stewart Butterfield, some of the top product thinkers, leaders in the world. So let me just ask, what's one thing you learned from Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:26:37):\nProbably can't narrow it down to one, but I'll talk about Bezos first. I was very lucky to join Amazon early when I still ... I had quarterly meetings with Jeff Bezos. And this was before AWS launched, so it was before Amazon was known in the Valley. This is another example. I went there because I went to work for Udi Manbe who started A9 and he was talking to me one night trying to recruit me and he spent two hours on the phone with me telling me how amazing Jeff Bezos was. And this was before there were any books on him. And that really convinced me to go there. So there's a lot written on Bezos. Read his shareholder letters, read the books about him, read Colin Bryar's Working Backwards. The Everything Box I think it's called or The Everything Store.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):\nThe Everything Store. Yeah.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:27:27):\nThere's so many good books and there's so much to learn about how he works. So I won't try and cover those things. The things that stood out to me from the meetings I had with him were a couple of things. One, a lot of people have written about these six pagers, so he doesn't believe in PowerPoint. You write a six pager about ... It's like studying for the final exam is writing these six pagers. So you go into the meeting and there's the people around the table, his executive team and him. First he does not speak until everybody around the table speaks. So he goes around to all his leads and said, \"What do you think? What do you think? What do you think?\" And I'm sitting there like, \"I don't care what anyone think. I just want to hear what Bezos thinks.\" But he wants to make sure that it's a team effort and that he's listening to what everybody in his organization thinks.\n\n(00:28:17):\nAnd he always spoke last. He is by far the smartest person I've ever met in my life. I've worked with a lot of smart people. But his ability to go deep in any domain and nail the core issue, and remember. We would've quarterly meetings and from quarter to quarter he would remember things that he had talked about before and then he would go into the architecture of search and why are you doing it this way or that way? And you're just blown away that he knows that. For me, the biggest takeaway from those meetings was his consistency, which is he had principles that it made it easier for you to operate in his company because you knew what he cared about because he always had these principles. Everything had to be customer driven, everything had to be relevant for the customer.\n\n(00:29:12):\nHe hated icons. That was just the thing. You had to write what they were because people couldn't figure out what they are. So anytime you showed an icon, he would get annoyed. But you would go in and after a couple of meetings you're like, \"Okay. I know what he's going to ask about. I know how he's thinking and I know what his principles are.\" And I think that consistency enables you to operate a large organization more effectively. And then there's one other thing that I really remember was one of the few really small meetings I was in with him and we were presenting working on a new product, and I was like, \"Our competitors have 10 times as many people as we do on this.\" And he looks at me and he said, \"That is your advantage.\" And then he goes into his talk about how it's a hill and it takes seven years to build a product. You can't look at it in the near term. You have to be in it for the long term. You can be sure I never went in and said, \"I need a lot more resources.\" So that was Bezos.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:14):\nAwesome.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:30:17):\nStewart. Again, I went to Slack because I wanted to work with Stewart Butterfield. I think he is the best product thinker in the Valley. He's not working in product right now. He's taking time off. But he's got this combination of long-term thinking and in the details. So in 2014, he wrote a master plan for Slack, which was build a product people love, build a network. That's Slack Connect. Build a platform that makes all of your other SaaS products more valuable. That's Slack Platform. And then do some magic AI stuff. Magic AI stuff took a lot longer, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:54):\nThat was part of his plan early on is magic AI stuff.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:30:55):\nIt literally was. There was a grid with four boxes in 2014 and it never changed. That was his master plan and what we worked on each year changed. But somebody recently asked me, \"You guys did Slack Connect much later?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, but it was always part of the plan.\" It was always part of his vision. So he saw forward in the vision, but he also was very much into the details. And I think the thing that I learned from him the most was the power of prototyping. And that even though he was such a great product thinker, he would always say, \"I can't tell you if this is going to work. I have to feel it. I have to try it. And a mock-up doesn't tell you what it's going to feel like.\" And he would push people to do prototypes, not incremental of just to get a feature out, but really to think. Very soon after I started, we launched ... I hired a design lead, Ethan Eismannn, and he led a redesign of the new information architecture for Slack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:59):\nI worked with Ethan at Airbnb.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:32:00):\nOh yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:01):\nHe was head of design for the search experience and the search team.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:32:04):\nYeah. Ethan is awesome. And he came in and his first task was to work with Stewart on this redesign. And Stewart came in and said, \"I want you to take everything in the interface and put it behind one button.\" And everyone's like, \"That's never going to work.\" And he's like, \"Do it. Just do it.\" And so we had our prototypers ... We had also engineers, front-end engineers who were really good at prototyping, literally took everything in the interface and put it behind one button and he said, \"This is how you're going to see what you really need in the interface.\" So we were never going to ship that, but it was the beginning of the redesign.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:43):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The most successful people that I know surround themselves with incredible peers. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career and your life. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. Having a group of trusted and amazing peers was key to my career growth. And this is the Sidebar ethos, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers on your own. Sidebar is a platform for senior tech professionals, director to C-level to advance in their career. Members are matched into peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, all running on Sidebar's technology Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your career journey.\n\n(00:33:35):\nIf you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth. Sidebar is the missing piece to catalyze your career. 93% of members say Sidebar helped them achieve a significant positive change in their career. Check them out at sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:33:52):\nAs a product leader, how do you think about just the time it takes to create a prototype in something like this? As a pm I'm just like a lot of times we don't have time to build this whole prototype. We got to ship stuff, we got to hit these calls, we got experiments to run, we'll just build it and see how it goes. How do you think about making time for something like that?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:34:08):\nIf you're doing it right, it'll be faster and you need to have an engineering infrastructure that enables prototyping. So some engineering infrastructures are too heavy and they don't actually enable prototyping. We had a problem with our mobile apps that it was too hard to prototype and we actually redesigned our mobile apps until we got to the point where it was easier because our desktop app was pretty easy to prototype. But you have to have a layer of abstraction that enables you to do that, and you have to have engineers who have a prototyping mindset, and if you build multiple things and you have this mindset as I'm willing to throw it away, you write code that is never going to make it to production so you can just crank it out much faster and then you can see what works and then you build the production code. Until you actually get to your end goal of something working faster.\n\n(00:35:02):\nBut you need the engineering team to have the same mindset. The product and engineering have to work together and design because design is just in it. Sometimes you can get design engineers who are doing the prototyping. So your first prototypes are like Figma prototypes, and then you get prototypes on real data. When I was at Google, one of our teams, a front-end team, I remember we hired a bunch of prototypers and our head of front-end engineering said to me one day, this is my secret weapon. This is how we move faster. So I do think it's a mindset shift and a tech stack shift.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:39):\nWe're going to talk about AI later, but it's also getting easier to build prototypes with AI. There's this video recently that went around on Twitter where an eight-year-old girl was building an app and in like 45 minutes, she built a chatbot using this product called Cursor. So I think that'll unlock a lot of great product on opportunities and just accelerate this sort of work. I asked about Jeff Bezos and Stewart Butterfield. I'm curious if there's another leader you've worked with that maybe is less known that you also learned a ton from that might be worth talking about.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:36:12):\nI think that there are people who are really, really good at what they do. So Marc Benioff is an amazing marketeer. His marketing mind ... After the acquisition, I got the opportunity to onstage with him at Dreamforce for ... Because Slack was a new shiny thing so of course Slack was going to be in the keynote. And so I was in the Benioff's keynote two years in a row. And so I watched how he approaches his keynote and the whole thing around Dreamforce. Dreamforce is incredible at the impact that it has on the ecosystem. And so I think that as a product, people don't think of him as much, but as his marketing abilities are amazing what he's done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:07):\nI've written posts about how various companies got started in Salesforce history. Always comes to mind where they go to conferences where's there's no software mascot walking around. And I remember they did something around one of their competitors where they just created some real controversy around someone.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:37:22):\nWell, they went into their competitor's conference and stood outside their competitor's conference.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):\nMm-hmm. Right. That's what it was.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:37:29):\nThis is in the Beyond Software. This is in his book that he wrote about the early phases of Salesforce. And it takes his guts. He pushes the envelope.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:40):\nI love that. It's a really good point that people don't think of Marc Benioff as a marketer. And that's interesting that that's maybe the main thing you took away from him is just the power of marketing and the skill.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:37:49):\nHe approaches his marketing presentations like a product person approaches their building their product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:58):\nAmazing. Okay. Speaking of former colleagues, I asked one of your former colleagues, his name is Fuzzy Khos. He's now the CTO of Notion. You worked with him, I believe at Slack.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:37:59):\nAnd at Google.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:10):\nAnd at Google. Wow. Okay. So I asked him what to ask you, and he said that you're amazing at building strong cross-functional relationships, especially with engineers. I know you used to be an engineer, so I get where that skill come from. What can you teach people about building stronger cross-functional relationships, especially PMs to build better relationships with their engineers, designers, other folks on their team?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:38:34):\nProbably the most important thing that a product leader does because if you have great ideas of what to build, but you can't get them built, then you go nowhere. So one, make sure somewhere where you have a good engineering partner. So Henderson was the co-founder and CTO of Slack, and I couldn't have asked for a better engineering partner. He's just awesome. And that has to be part of your evaluation criteria that you meet and value your engineering partner before you join or you know that it's not the right one and the organization is willing to make a change. So that can happen too. You can go in and understand that something has to change, but that is a very, very important thing of what you're doing and what you're assessing when you go in. And then I think what's really important is that you're aligned. You understand your roles and responsibilities and where you're going to divide and conquer and where you're going to be aligned.\n\n(00:39:29):\nYou don't want any of this ... People in the organization, they asked Mom, they asked dad and they got different opinions and playing one against the other, that doesn't work. So one, you have to know that you're not going to do that. So if somebody would ask me something that it was in Cal's domain, I'd be like, \"Did you talk to Cal?\" I would never try and go around him. So we were very clear on, you're going to drive this, I'm going to drive this. And if it was unclear, we'd talk and we would say, \"Okay. Who's going to take this one?\" And we would do all our reviews together. And so all of the OKR reviews, we had weekly exec reviews, we had the updates on our OKRs, so we did them all together, but I knew here's the things that he was going to ask the questions on and dig deep. And then when I was, he would take a back seat, but of course we could ask questions in each other things, but I knew that he was taking ownership and he knew what I was taking ownership of.\n\n(00:40:24):\nBut I think the bottom line was respect. Is that you have to respect and trust that they actually will follow up on what they say they will. In Cal and Fuzzy were amazing at that. I would go to Fuzzy and be like, \"Hey, we need more mobile engineers because this one product is not going to ship.\" And he's like, \"I'm on it. Got it.\" And that was all I needed to do. And obviously if he couldn't do it, he'd come back to me and, \"Hey, there's going to be a problem.\" But it was like just things got done. That's the best part of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:56):\nYou talked about being aligned, which I love and I fully have seen that power of that of you and your engine manager, design manager being aligned on ... And you tell me if I'm wrong, but specifically on what goals you're trying to achieve, what success looks like, things like that. Are there any tactics you found to create that alignment? And also if there's anything else you want to add to the point I just made about what it is you're specifically aligned on, that'd be great.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:41:19):\nOne, you got to spend a lot of time together. There isn't a way around that. And you have to document things and make sure that you've talked it through. And if you don't agree with something and you're not sure it's a priority, you have to speak up and you can't just be like, \"Okay, whatever.\", and then go to somebody in your team and be like, \"Oh God, that that CTO, why did he make this decision?\" That just doesn't work. So I'm a very direct person. So if I don't think that something is the right priority or is working, I will be very clear. We had different forms, so I'll be very tactical here on the forms that Cal and I had together.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:56):\nPerfect.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:42:00):\nWe used OKRs to drive our processes and we would have the teams present OKRs to us. When the team got too large, it got to be too much time to go through every team's OKR review so we had a Slack channel for each team, their OKRs, a planning channel for each one. And people would post a doc and then a Slack video of going through the major points. And we had a time limit of how long they were allowed to be. And they would say, \"Here's our OKRs, here's the things that you would pay attention to.\" And then Cal and I would do a marathon and we would watch them all together. And-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:36):\nIn a room sitting there watching them together?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:42:38):\nCorrect. And then we would say, \"Do we have any follow-up questions?\" And we put in channel our follow-up questions to the team. And sometimes there'd be five to 10 teams that we would then have a follow-up meeting with. We would say that this is a really high priority project or there are a lot of questions that we have, and then we would do a meeting but we were always doing those meetings together. So that was the OKR reviews of getting the alignment. And by asking the questions, we could then ... By it just being us, we could dig into the team. And we each had a chief of staff, so it was the two of us plus our two chiefs of staff, and which they also did a divide and conquer and they worked really well together. They were both long time Slack employees. So for years they had ... One had been an engineering director and one had been a TPM. And then every Monday we had a Monday meeting where we reviewed the progress on the top OKRs and red, yellow, green and don't talk through the green ones, only talk through the red ones and what are the issues. And again, both there. And then we had a weekly meeting with the four of us where we would just go through any issues in the organization, what's going on, what's not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:50):\nAnd the four of us is you, the CTO, the chiefs of staff.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:43:54):\nYep. And sometimes we would invite people. Like there's an issue with QA, so we'd have the QA leader come in and present to us. But we tried to limit the number of meetings with teams. So it'd be like the Monday meeting was the big meeting that you had to be there and you had to be able to talk to your project and that was it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:13):\nThere's so much awesomeness here. I love the idea of this Async share your plan in a video instead of meetings with everyone in real time. And you could just do a lot of the stuff Async.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:44:22):\nWe iterated every quarter, just like you iterate on a product. So every quarter we would say did the OKR planning work or not, and then we would adjust. So we got to the point where at one point we added up all the hours of OKR reviews and all the people in them and it was some insane number, like 300 and something and we're like, \"This has gotten out of hand.\" So then we're like, \"We have to do something drastic.\" And that's when we moved them to Async. It was also right after Slack Clips launched.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:51):\nGot it. That's the video feature. Very cool. Then I know you launched huddles, right? Slack Huddles? Did you use that as a part of this or eventually you just get people into a little huddle asynchronously and talk-\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:45:01):\nSometimes. Absolutely. We would be in the reviews and we would huddle with somebody to ask a quick question. We use Huddled all the time. I still do. I love Huddles.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:09):\nI love it. One crazy thing about Slack is people in Slack don't actually use email internally. It's like all in Slack. It's like the actual vision of Slack working within Slack.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:45:18):\nNo email unless you're dealing with somebody external. And no, it's mostly Slack Connect anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:24):\nAnyway. Wow, that's amazing. Okay. I have one more question around product stuff and then I want to talk about AI. So I was reading your newsletter on Substack, which we'll link to and you share this really interesting insight that I've experienced myself that I'll quote you here. One of the mistakes that I see a lot of product managers make is they over index on people who are going to be unhappy with the products they're launching. And basically your advice is not to worry so much about making users unhappy, which I think is counterintuitive to some people. Can you just talk about this lesson and I'd love to hear what product you launched that made people unhappy that you realized, oh, maybe we don't need to worry about this as much.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:46:04):\nI saw it more when you unlaunch things, you take things away there's always some set of users that are using a feature that nobody else does, and then you take it away and they're super unhappy, but there are more people you're going to make happy. So a product manager gets caught in this trap of the vocal minority and the number of people using your product ... Depends on what phase. Are you a Google? Are you Slack? Are you a Glean? But the number of people using your product today is usually unless you're a Google far smaller than the number of people who are going to be using your product tomorrow. So design it for the bigger number of people who are going to be using it tomorrow. If you have to redo the UI and the Who Moved My Cheese, people will be unhappy, but all the new people are going to be like, \"This is so much easier.\" Then do it and deal with the people who are unhappy.\n\n(00:47:02):\nBut the trick is you have to be respectful and you have to be transparent and you have to explain. You have to go to people and say, \"This is why we made this change.\" And you have to be authentic. You can't be dismissive and you can't have marketing speak. You have to really say, \"Here's for real why.\" And you have to listen to your audience. You don't want to alienate your early users because most people ... If you made a good decision on why you moved this or why we stopped using Slack calls and moved to Huddles and you have to do it over time and give people choice and then give them enough time to move. So you have to do it in the right way. But if people feel heard, it makes a difference.\n\n(00:47:50):\nI have an example that's not a product example, but I think is a really good one. It's a leadership example. So when I was at Google, there was always a controversy about something, but there was a controversy about ... It was Blogger or something. I can't even remember what it was. It was like we made a change. We were like 50,000 people at the time. There was an engineer in my team, an IT engineer that was super unhappy about the change. And I knew Rachel Whetstone, she was in charge of all of PR and global policy at Google. So huge job. And I emailed Rachel and I'm like, \"Hey, do you have an FAQ or something that can help me? Because I don't know why you made this change and that I can help explain to the engineer in my team.\"\n\n(00:48:33):\nShe did not respond to my email. She picked up the phone and she called him. I had no idea she did this. She just called this IT engineer and she listened to him and she heard why he was upset and she explained her reasoning. He was so blown away that she called him that he completely changed his opinion and then he told everyone else in the org. And so it had this effect. And I learned a lot from watching her do that. She never even told me she did it later. She just did it. You just act. You're authentic. You listen to people and you're transparent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:12):\nIt's so funny. This reminds me of a parenting book I'm reading right now that a former guest recommended called Listen. And the core thesis of the book is when your kids are acting up or they're getting off track, so much of what they need is a sense that you're connected to them, a connection which is rooted in you listening to them. And so all-\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:49:34):\nMy favorite parenting book ... I don't know if this is the same one or a different one, it's How to Talk so Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kids Will Talk. Maybe it's the new name of that book, but it's so good and it's so true in everything and also in products. So whether you're in a forum and explaining to customers, whether you're enterprise customers, you're explaining, you're hearing them out, people want to understand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:58):\nAmazing. There's so many applications of just the power of listening. Okay. Well, not quite a segue, but let's talk about AI. You're at the epicenter of AI now with Glean. How do you anticipate AI will change our jobs and product? What do you think people may be aren't recognizing it, realizing it? What have you seen?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:50:21):\nI'm going to give you a little bit of my history with AI to get to that point. When AI was a completely different technology stack ... I have a master's in AI. So I started working in AI when ... It's evolved so much. And then of course at Google using it for auto complete and search. It's transformed so many times. But then with this last transformation of GenAI ... And that's what brought me to Glean of seeing this, meeting lots of AI companies and like, \"Wow. This is really going to transform how we work.\" And it's just fascinating seeing these products. I was one of those people like, \"Oh yeah, it's going to be so far away.\" Until I saw GPT3. And I think AI, we are underestimating how much it's going to change how we work. It's not going to be sudden from today to tomorrow because people haven't figured it out yet. They haven't figured out how exactly to leverage it. But the people who have are going to be so far ahead. They're going to be far ahead of everyone else because they're going to be working faster, they're going to be working better.\n\n(00:51:33):\nAnd in five to 10 years, I think the lines between product managers and engineers and designers are going to blur because AI will enable product managers to build prototypes, to build designs. Designers to build a pro like Figma already has their Figma AI. You can press a button and you can get your initial prototype working. You've got all the co-pilots. So they're not quite there. You still, like with Copilot or with Cursor, you need to be an experienced engineer to know when it's getting it wrong, but they're going to keep getting better. I think people have to be careful about not getting left behind, but their jobs aren't going to go away. They're just going to change. I'm of the believer that we're just going to have a lot more software. But I talked to engineers and to PMs saying, \"Yeah, I tried that. It doesn't really work.\" And then go back to how I worked before. And that's a dangerous spot to be in I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:34):\nFor people that get anxiety hearing this where they're feeling they're going to be left behind and like, \"Oh my God, I don't know enough time to do this or I don't know what I'm doing here.\" Do you have any advice for what's something someone can do to not fall behind?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:52:48):\nUse the products. This is what good PMs should do period. Always be using new products. It's not a unique thing for AI. When mobile came out, PMs needed to be using mobile apps all the time to try them out, see what the UIs are, see what's working and what isn't. And the same goes even more for AI. Use ChatGPT. If your organization has Glean, use Glean. Use Claude. Try them all. Try them and see what they do. I was talking to a product manager I know who is more forward-thinking and loves playing with new products and he had this use case that blew me away. So he said ... And this was a couple of months ago, so before ... It was right when Gemini had expanded the context window. So his product had a Discord channel and he took the transcript from the Discord channel, which was huge. And he fed it into Gemini the entire channel and then used it to ask questions. Like what is the sentiment of my product? What is the most requested feature? What are the things people are unhappy with? This never would've occurred to me. It's like, that is so smart. And he's like, \"It was like a goldmine.\" Do you know how long it would've taken him to read? And he just wouldn't have done it.\n\n(00:54:06):\nSo think about for the argument, oh, I'm too busy. Well, if you use these products it's going to be a leverage on your time. So you get a lot of articles sent to you, summarize them, use AI to summarize the articles. We use Gong at Glean to record all our sales calls. We have a Glean app that will read all the Gong transcripts, put them in a spreadsheet in a certain format of who the AE is, etc. And then summarize all the top requested features from all the Gong calls. And it took a while to get it right. At first the summarization, the prompt wasn't good enough and would give us features that our salespeople would recommend and didn't distinguish that this was actually the customer. So you have to tweak it. It's not going to work out of the box. But then we got it to the point where it worked and these things really save time and you have to use your creative juices as a PM to figure out how it can help you and have patience to iterate and keep trying because the models that we have today can do a lot already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:22):\nYeah. I love your example of the PM and what they did with the Discord channel. Is there anything else along those lines that either you've done to leverage some AI tool to be more productive or folks in your team have done to be more productive youth, either your product leaders or other folks?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:55:38):\nSo many examples. So one that I did really recently is I wrote a prompt in Glean to help me get the status of features. And we have a Launch Cal, and you can look at Launch Cal it'll say a date. But then is it really the date? What are the outstanding issues? So it will look at our Launch Cal and it will see if there are any open year tickets, what the Slack conversations are and the customers who are beta testing it, bring all these together to tell me, okay, launch date is this according to Launch Cal, but here are all the open issues and here are the open conversations that people are talking about. So then it can give me the confidence level of the future looking. So I can run the prompt, just put in the name of the feature. So I don't have to read all of these channels.\n\n(00:56:28):\nSo this is a prompt that I built two weeks ago because we're advancing our prompting capabilities. And so I was testing it out and I was like, \"Ooh, I could do this.\" So that's another example and engineers are using it for automating part of the incident management of I got an incident, how do I see were their previous incidents that were similar to it, where they're not. And so these are the type of things you can look at to help you. But the simplest, simplest is there's so much news. Let me just paste in all of these things and summarize them. As a product manager at Gleam, here are all the latest news. What do I have to care about? What's impacting me and potentially competitive to any of the products that I have?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:22):\nAnd putting that into say Claude or ChatGPT you're saying.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:57:25):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:26):\nYeah. I think that beginning of the prompt is something a lot of people don't know is the power of just giving it a role like you are a product manager at Gleam. From that perspective, give me this summary versus just summarize this and that ends up being really powerful right.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:57:42):\nA hundred percent. And you can compare what is Claude's PR saying that ... They just launched Claude Enterprise. How is Claude Enterprise different from OpenAI Enterprise? Again, you can do it yourself, but these micro improvements in your productivity help. For my newsletter, I interviewed Claire Vo who came out with ChatPRD. And so product managers are using is. We're just starting to evaluate it internally, so I haven't personally used it yet, but it's super cool and you can use ChatGPT to do a PRD. And ChatPRD, it's more templatized and more frameworks of how to do that. And again, these things are going to keep getting better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:33):\nClaire's been on the podcast, she's going to be speaking at the Lenny and Friends Summit coming up October 24th.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:58:37):\nOh, cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:38):\nYeah. A crazy stat she shared. She's making six figures off this product that she builds on the weekends ChatPRD.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:58:45):\nSo cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:45):\nIncredible.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (00:58:46):\nBut it also shows what you can build with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:49):\nRight. It's just her. I think she just recently hired some engineers to help because she has three kids CTO at LaunchDarkly and just is building this on the side making a hundred thousand plus dollars. Incredible. I want to add a couple of things here. So one is for folks looking for ideas for how to use AI tooling for their PM job. There's a couple of posts I've written that I'll link to in the show notes just to put that out there of just a bunch of PM sharing, here's what I've done with these various tools. Another thought I'd love to get your take on. There's a lot of fear that the PM job be replaced by AI. And I've recently realized that it's the opposite. I think the PM role is the best positioned to thrive in the world of AI because if you just think about you have a tool that can just build a thing for you, just like you're staring at this blank thing that can build anything for you, which function would you think would have the best chance of asking it of what to build and how to articulate what to build best?\n\n(00:59:47):\nTo me, it's clearly Product People. They're best at figuring out what to build, what matters most, where the impact's going to be what customers need. Not to say other functions don't also have the skills, but I feel like of all functions, PMs have the most of that specific skill. I'd love to get your take on that.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:00:01):\nThat. I think that AI, the one thing it's not good at is being creative. So if you're a PM who's doing the grout work, it's going to take your job away. But if you're a PM who actually is strategic and can pull the pieces together and be creative and think how you do something that it's going to differentiate. Because it's not going to give you that leak. It'll say, here's what customers are asking for, here are the problems today, but you have to figure out how to solve it. So in some ways it might weed out the good from the bad PMs. Because there are a significant number of PMs who are more just execution. And I think that part of the job hopefully will be lowered because I hope a lot more of the execution will be able to automate updating Jira and all these things that just take time and creating even little Launch Cals, which PMs have to do manually now. So hopefully a lot of that work goes away and then people can be more creative. And I think designers and PMs are going to blend because the best designers I've worked with are product thinkers and a lot of really good PMs can also design. It depends on what kind of product you're PMing for. So I agree with the caveat that it will become harder to be a great PM.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:20):\nWait, say more about that. It'll be harder to be a great PM because many PMs are doing things that are mostly project management and that's the stuff that-\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:01:30):\nYeah. Let me rephrase. It's not going to be harder to be a great PM, but to be a PM, the not so good PMs jobs will go away. The great PMs will still have great jobs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:40):\nYeah. I totally hear you. So in a sense there might be fewer. You might need fewer PMs, but I think that applies in theory to every function. Fewer engineers. Fewer designers.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:01:49):\nI don't think you'll need fewer. I think you'll be able to do more things. Think about every company. Our head of sales came to me the other day, \"You need to hire more engineers because we just have so many things we need to build.\" I'm like, \"When have you ever worked in a company where you thought that you didn't need more engineers?\" You always want people to build more stuff. So I don't think you're going to need fewer. I think you're just going to get so much more done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:16):\nA lot of people are building AI into their product. Glean is obviously an example which integrates LLMs, which innately are non-deterministic and hard to know if they're going to provide anything good. Sometimes something really dumb comes out. Do you have any advice on working with these very complicated systems that don't necessarily ... You can't control and building them into your products? Anything you've learned that might be helpful?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:02:41):\nMy first week at Glean was eye-opening in learning some of these things. But let me first just explain what Glean does for people who may not know. So Glean was started as enterprise search. Glean reads content of all your SaaS apps. So it reads the content from Microsoft, Google, Slack, Salesforce, Jira, like any SaaS tool that you use, it indexes it and enables you to search. So it started as just enterprise search and using AI. So it was an AI search using BERT models and using vector embeddings in 2019. Because the early engineers at Glean came from Google and Google created BERT to enhance search. And so it was obvious that they would be using ML techniques for search. Then GPT3 came along and added a natural language interface, a chat interface. You can ask the question in actual language and get an answer, and it basically is a knowledge graph of your organization. So you can ask any question. Think of ChatGPT for your enterprise. Ask any question about your enterprise.\n\n(01:03:45):\nSo people understand search because they understand Google and you put in a query and then you refine it. But chat interfaces, people still don't really know how to use. If you look at the stats from ChatGPT, from what I understand, the retention is fairly low. People use it, they play with it, and then they don't get back to it because it's not in their workflow and they have a hard time figuring out what they can and can't do for it. When I got to Glean the first week I met with the assistant quality team and one of the biggest issues they have is people trying to use Glean for things that there's no way it could know. Like what should my top priority be next week when we don't even know what your priorities are. But then there's golden cases that are just amazing.\n\n(01:04:44):\nThe example of refining queries and searched years for people to understand how to do. And it took a lot of features of auto complete and refinements at the bottom of the page. So we need to build in those things, guardrails to help with the change. To help suggest, oh, Lenny, here's what you could do. Here's a prompt to find out the status of your feature that Tamar built. So how do you give people guardrails so that they understand what is going to work and what isn't going to work? Because this whole, I don't know what I can ask. And then on top of that, the non-deterministic. An enterprise CIO will go use ChatGPT on the weekends, but they come to work and they expect their software to be deterministic. So how do you help educate users about that?\n\n(01:05:34):\nAnd then the other thing I'll say about using LLMs is the industry is transforming so rapidly that you need to make sure that your product gets better as the LLMs get better. And that too many people are building things to make up and compensate for the LLMs that all that work is going to go away. So it's okay to do it to understand that it's going to go away, but that can't be your differentiator. You have to understand that your differentiator is something that will continue to be there as the LLMs get better and smarter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):\nAnd as part of that, because the LLMs get so much smarter, everyone else will become awesome. And to keep up, you need something that is actually outside of the LLM that continues to differentiate you and is better than what other people are doing.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:06:24):\nWell, yeah. That your whole product gets better as the LLMs get better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):\nThat makes sense.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:06:30):\nIt's a frame of a of mind of how you approach the value add you're having.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:37):\nAwesome. Tamar, to close out our conversation, is there anything else that we did not cover that you think is important to share or you think might be helpful to leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:06:51):\nI in my decades of working in tech, have never been working in an environment that's moving so quickly and it's really exciting. It's super energizing and it's also scary. But you have to change how you're working. You have to change how you're working so that you can keep up because it's going to be an interesting decade ahead with all these new tools that are coming out. And staying ahead will be hard, but it's also, there's so much I think richness and opportunity here. So I advise people to get in the thick of it and try it out because you'll be surprised at how many products we can build.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:37):\nI love that. I can't help but drill in one level deeper. Is there anything you found to help you stay ahead and help you stay aware of what's happening? Are there newsletters you find useful? Chat, podcasts that just help you keep up to date on where things are going? Is it like a person you look to like, \"Hey, what's new?\"\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:07:56):\nThere are definitely AI newsletters that I look at. There's AI podcasts that I listen to. I now have a commute, so in some ways that's good because I get to keep up on the AI podcasts. So I just try and listen. I'm trying to build some prompts for myself to make it easier to say ... Take in ... I haven't perfected this, but the ChatGPT voice mode where you can load it. Somebody who I just hired it at Glean was saying he does this. He loads up stuff before his commute and then he'll be like summarize these articles and then he can ask questions to it. So I need to up my game there. But I definitely have a list of Ben's Bites and The Neuron. Those are good summaries and I like Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast. I listen to Cognitive Revolution. There's too many of them right now, but I pick and choose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nAwesome. Okay. We'll link to those ones you just mentioned in the show notes. We'll have Gil and Sarah Guo's podcast, it's called No Priors. I was actually just listening to it on the way here. Sarah is going to also be at Lenny's and Friends Summit. She's going to be moderating a panel between Kevin Weil and Mikey Krieger who are the CPOs of Anthropic and Open AI. So there we go. Another quick plug for lennyandfriendssummit.com. I think it's lennyssummit.com.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:09:15):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:17):\nWith that Tamar we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:09:21):\nI am ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:23):\nOkay, let's do this. First question, what are two or three books that you have recommended most to other people?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:09:29):\nSo one book was recommended to me by Shashir, the CEO of Cota. When I started at Slack, he recommended the book Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard by Chip and Dan Heath. And it's such a good book. And it's about how do you set a path for people to follow. It's the whole elephant and the rider. So setting the path but yet motivating people to go down the path. And I read it. We had an all hands about ... I don't even remember the topic. It was something that we were like all up in arms about that we had to do. And I had just read the book and after the all hands I went up to store it and I'm like, \"You did that all wrong. You need to read this book. That is not how to get people motivated.\" And he read the book and he's like, \"You're right.\" So it just changes how you think in organizations to affect change. So that's on the organizational leadership. And one book I really liked was a Team of Rivals. It's a book about Lincoln and putting together his cabinet during the Civil War. One, I just learned a lot about the Civil War that I didn't really know. And it's about, again, a book about leadership and it is fascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):\nI don't think anyone's recommended either of these. So love them. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:11:00):\nI don't know if you like British murder mysteries.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:06):\nI don't know either.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:11:07):\nIt's a niche thing, but there's a guy named Anthony Horowitz and the latest series he did was called Magpie Murders. And it's just an intricate story so I enjoyed it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:20):\nVery niche but amazing. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:11:26):\nWell, I'm going to give two. One is tech and one is non-tech. So non-tech I really like dark chocolate.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):\nActually just like a dark chocolate bar.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:11:38):\nA really good dark chocolate that's simple. Like no frills, none of this. Just dark chocolate. And I discovered this chocolate called Bisou chocolate. It's a guy in Oakland who makes it himself. Super niche. He was selling at the farmer's market. And it's just like if you want like a simple play, no nuts, no anything just-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):\nNo sea salt.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:12:03):\nGreat pride in the beans he resources them from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:05):\nWow. It's called Bisou with a B?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:12:08):\nYeah. Bisou as in Kiss in French. And then on the tech side, the honest answer is Glean. I was listening to your podcast with Nikita who said that people over 22 don't use new products except at work. And that stuck with me. The new products I usually use are at work and I use Glean 10, 15 times a day. I use it so much and it changed the way I onboarded. It changed the way I work. Even the simplest questions, you don't bother people, you don't interrupt people on Slack. You're like, \"What's the latest status with this deal? What's the last time we talked to them?\" I meet somebody at a conference and I can quickly say, \"Have we ever talked to this company before?\" And I can just get an answer. Or without asking an engineer, \"Where's the latest design doc?\" It has really transformed how I work. So I know it's cheating in that it's the product I work on, but it's the actual honest answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:10):\nAnd for folks that haven't heard of Glean, it's one of the most successful B2B AI companies out there. It's like a very large successful business and company that if you haven't checked it out, you should definitely check it out.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:13:24):\nAs our investors say, it's one of the AI companies that's actually making money.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:29):\nVery few of those. Awesome. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, repeat yourself, share with friends or family and work or in life?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:13:41):\nI have one that my father told me when I was being really indecisive about what college to go to. He was really bored of the conversation and he said, \"There are no right decisions. You make a decision right.\" And it is so true. Because you never know what's going to happen in life. You just have to commit to whatever you're doing and have no regrets about it. You can't be like, \"Oh,\" 10 years later, \"what if I had taken that job over there?\" It's like you make your success based on how you approach the decisions that you've made.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:18):\nSo if you feel regret about something, this is a good one to pull out of just I will make this the best I can make it, and that's all the best I can do.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:14:27):\nYou can move forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:29):\nMove forward. I love that. Last question, I know you're a parent. I'm a new parent. I have a 14-month old at this point. Is there a piece of parenting advice that you learned early on that you think might be helpful to me or folks that are new parents or something you've just learned yourself that you think might be helpful?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:14:46):\n14 months. I think the best parenting book I read besides the How to Talk So Your Kids Will Listen & How to Listen so Your Kid Will Talk is, I think it's called Healthy Sleep Habits, Happy Baby. We are much happier when we sleep well. We perform better at work when we sleep well. Children need to sleep. So making sure that they sleep well. And sometimes that's like, I did the whole sleep training, cry until you fall asleep and my kids still speak to me. So it was okay. That is the basic things. Make sure that their basic needs are met and then as they grow up, share your life with them. So a piece of advice I was given was analogous to Talk so your Kids Will Listen is when they had come home from school. You can't just say, \"How was your day?\" Say, \"You know what? I did a podcast with this person and it was super interesting because they talked about this or that.\" Or, \"I'm massively screwed up and I should have asked them this or that.\" And they'll be like, \"Oh my God, I was at school today and this is what happened.\" If you share your life with them, they will share their life with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:02):\nSuch good advice. I really appreciate it. Tamar, thank you so much for being here. You're awesome. We got through so much great stuff. Everything I was hoping we get through. Two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to read up on more stuff that you share and just follow you online and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:16:19):\nFind me on LinkedIn and I have a subject called Practical Intelligence where I've been interviewing practitioners who are working with AI. It was my way of learning. I started when I was a VC. Trying to continue doing it. And how can I be helpful if you are a customer of Glean, I'd love to know what you think, what works and what does more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:40):\nWhat's the best way to share that with you? Is it like messaging on LinkedIn, subscribe to Substack?\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:16:45):\nMessage on LinkedIn, or comment on your-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:49):\nOn [inaudible 01:16:50]. Yeah.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:16:51):\nYeah. Those would probably be the two ways.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:53):\nAwesome. Tamar, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTamar Yehoshua (01:16:56):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:57):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:17:01):\nThank you so much for listening.

I worked on HipChat and Stride, and more recently I started Jira Product Discovery.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:09):\nWhy is it so hard to start new products, go zero to one within large companies?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:00:13):\nThe company has a tendency to over-invest. Startups have the benefit of starving, and so you need to create scarcity. What we try to do is remind everyone things are going to fail, let's not drag the rest of the company into it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:24):\nSounds like one of the biggest lessons is super silo sort of team.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:00:28):\nI needed the rest of the company to go away so we could get the autonomy to test the things that we needed, but it's not going to scale. That is not going to respect all design guidelines.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nThe biggest challenge I think a lot of companies have is just, it's been six months, no one wants this, we're going to kill it. How do you protect that?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:00:41):\nBe very clear about what we're testing, doing that with data, doing that with personal customer stories, give people a sense of velocity and speed. No one wants to fuck with a high-speed train.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:54):\nToday, my guest is Tanguy Crusson. This is a really unique and important episode because we get into something you don't hear much on podcasts like this, the real talk challenges of trying to innovate and build zero to one at a large company like Atlassian. Tanguy has been at Atlassian for over 10 years and has worked on a bunch of internal big bets, some that have worked and some that have not, including products like HipChat, which I was a huge fan of back in the day, also a product called Status Page, and most recently Jira Product Discovery, which is one of the fastest growing products in Atlassian history that Tanguy led from idea to launch. We go through each of these stories, and Tanguy shares what went wrong, what went right, and everything that he's learned about creating space for innovation within a larger org, including how they structured their internal incubation program called Point A.\n\n(00:01:45):\nThere's a ton of gold in this episode and a bunch of really interesting stories, which is part of the reason that it went this long. It's the longest episode I've done yet. If you're looking to create change in your organization and foster more innovation, this episode will be worth your time.

With that, I bring you Tanguy Crusson.\n\n(00:02:13):\nTanguy, thank you so much for being here, and welcome to the podcast.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:02:21):\nThank you very much for welcoming me here, Lenny. I'm actually super proud to be on this podcast. I've been a huge fan. Whenever I get the chance, I listen to you when I drive somewhere so yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:31):\nWhat we're going to be talking about in this episode is we're going to be talking about building new products and going zero to one within larger companies, and in particular, the pain and the challenges that come along with that, but also the lessons that you've learned from doing this many times and seeing it done many times. You've seen a lot of this happening at Atlassian, you've been there for over 10 years at this point, and Atlassian has, I don't know, over a dozen different product lines at this point, something like that. I know a lot of people come to you asking for advice on how to build zero to one within a large company. So let me just start with a general question of just could you just share a bit about your history of building zero to one and just seeing zero to one happening within Atlassian?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:03:14):\nYeah, so like you said, I've been in the product management team at Atlassian for roughly 10 years now, and I've been working mainly on bootstrapping new things. Initially, I joined to start the cloud developer ecosystem so developers can build apps on top of the Atlassian platform and sell them on the Atlassian marketplace. I worked on HipChat and Stride. HipChat was well-known, Stride less so. We were trying to win the enterprise communications market before Slack and Microsoft Teams came about. I did lead a business case to invest more in IT operations, got nowhere with it than we acquired Statuspage, Opsgenie, and something I tried to do with didn't quite get off the ground. More recently I started Jira Project Discovery, which was part of our internal incubator for two to three years, and came out of the incubator and generally available a year ago.\n\n(00:04:13):\nMy track record at Atlassian has been 50/50 at best. Jira Project Discovery is actually my first, what I would call big success here. That one worked, but it was hard and all the ones that I worked on before were really hard to, and that's the kind of stuff that really bothered me for a super long time. The good thing is working on a product for product managers, I got to talk to a lot of product managers and across all sorts of industries in the past three to four years, and I realize that 50/50 is actually not that bad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:46):\nAwesome, and I know there's going to be a lot of real talk in this conversation. I'm excited to share and hear all these stories.\n\n(00:04:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Vercel, Webflow, and Loom.\n\n(00:06:16):\nWorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grain authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, SCIM, or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to 1 million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(00:07:04):\nJust broadly, why is it so hard in your experience to start new products go zero to one within large companies? What have you seen are the biggest challenges and hurdles generally?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:07:14):\nYeah, so on the opportunity side, so Atlassian, 300,000 customers. We play in a whole bunch of different markets, everything in the collaboration space. We have a lot of markets that we play in, which means that we've got a lot of competitors. But basically when we look at the areas we could go in, there's an endless list of areas that we could go in, play and have a decent chance to win. Much harder to do if you're a startup. The breadth that we've got makes it easier to try find areas where we could expand into. We're not starving like a smaller company, so we can actually afford to try to play somewhere, to do some bets, to have some of them fail and some of them succeed, so that's amazing. Now our customers, I said 300,000. The thing that I admire the most about the Atlassian business model is it's very broad. It's across small and medium-sized companies. We have startups using our products, and we've got also enterprises and very large enterprises using the same products, which means that there's a lot of areas where we could find a niche and go after it and expand progressively into all these areas so there's a massive distribution potential that comes with that. When I worked on Jira Product Discovery, I didn't start with, okay, I'm going to need to start finding product managers and it's going to be how to find them. No, they were already all using Jira. Atlassian is a company that has a relatively deep organization hierarchy but relatively flat decision making. So it's more like a, imagine a network of key decision makers across the organization. It doesn't really matter the job title or whether you are a manager of people or not. The decisions are made by people who drive change.\n\n(00:09:02):\nSo there's a lot of empowerment that comes from that, but also it's a mix of top-down, bottom-up happiness I'd say. And so it can feel really chaotic at first, but once you know how to navigate it, it's actually pretty easy to try to go after something that you care about. And of course, we're a big company, so there's lots of ways we can get help. Corporate development, research analysts that we can talk to whenever we want to explore something, thousands of customers that I just have to put something in the addressable community group and get hundreds of people applying to talk to me from one day to the next. So that's amazing, any startup would want that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:45):\nThis sounds like how can anything not work when you launch a new product? You have 300,000 potential customers to launch it to. You have all the resources to build it. It sounds like decision making is efficient relatively, it's flat. You have all these different customer segments that use all these different version product lines of Atlassian. It's just like all of the opportunity possible to launch new products and still, many things do not work out, so I think this is a really important point and I think many big companies are in this. We have so much opportunity. Everything we're going to build is going to, it's going to grow like crazy because we have everything we need, but still it doesn't work out. And that's why I think we're going to talk about, it's going to be so important.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:10:27):\nIt's going to be a little bit of therapy for me. Hopefully some people out there could go, \"Okay, it's not just me having a hard time.\" It can happen in companies like Atlassian too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:38):\nAmazing.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:10:38):\nSo yeah, let's talk about the challenges.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):\nLet's do it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:10:41):\nYeah, for that. So you want to start a new thing. This thing is going to take time, and you need to be able to have that time for the time it takes until you can prove whether there is a thing or not. The thing inside Atlassian is that the path for success is super high for a new bet. If you come in and you create a product and it's got 100 customers, it's going to look cute. Remember, we serve startups and enterprises, we have self-service and sales, we've got all these motions that are in place for our bigger products. A $100 million business is a good start basically. In most companies out there, $100 million business is a home run. For us, it's not like that. We're trying to build businesses that grow really big and keep growing big over time.\n\n(00:11:36):\nNow, evaluating success can look very different between early stage and established products. For a long time at Atlassian, we were treating everything a little bit equally in that the metrics success for the same. For example, things like monthly active users is the way that you, for a long time we looked at you go, is that product being successful on it? And what if you are building an \"internal startup,\" your monthly active user number should look very low for quite some time up until you know that your product is ready to serve the vast majority of the customers that you want to put it in front of, so that they don't just look at it and go, \"It's not ready for me.\"\n\n(00:12:20):\nThey're going to try it and then they're going to churn and it's going to take forever to claim them back, so that makes it pretty challenging to try and start new things unless we've got the right metrics and processes and everything internally that can give room and breathing space for the bets to succeed internally. And for many years, we were not there. We started getting there more recently with the start of Point A, which was our internal incubator program, which is one of my latest that was successful. The ones before didn't have that, and I really struggled from that, and I see many companies struggling with that exact aspect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:58):\nAmazing. Let's dive into an actual story. There's three that I want to talk about. There's HipChat, which you mentioned. There's Status Page and then there's the product you're working on now, Jira Product Discovery. So with HipChat, funny story, I loved HipChat. I was a huge user of HipChat at my startup back in the day. I can never forget the billboard that you all put out promoting HipChat where there's this little stick figure meme guy and it just said, \"Why use HipChat?\" And I thought that was the funniest thing, and the product was so delightful. There's just all these little emojis in there, and the idea with HipChat for Atlassian was basically to become the Slack killer, that was the vision.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:13:39):\nYou just killed me. We were way before Slack.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:43):\nOkay, so first mover advantage, amazing product.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:13:47):\nIt works, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:47):\nAnd it was an acquisition for Atlassian.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:13:48):\nIt was an acquisition.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:50):\nAwesome. So let's talk about what went wrong with HipChat. What did you learn?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:13:53):\nAll know Atlassian as company, as the tool that could almost have a, okay. [inaudible 00:13:57].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):\nYeah, this is the therapy. The therapy session begins.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:14:03):\nYeah, it's going to start right there. Me and everyone else from the HipChat team I can tell you. Okay, so yes, HipChat was an acquisition, team of 20 people or so. It was Slack before Slack was there. Great traction and lot of, it was a darling with startups. It was a new way to collaborate back then. There were a few of these smaller apps that were trying to do this thing. I remember actually joining Atlassian. Before that, I was working with financial services, banks and stuff like that, and we were big meeting to talk about stuff, or going to someone's desk to talk about stuff. I joined this company where my colleagues who sit on the same floor as me and on the same table, we talk over the computer via chat. I often felt weird at first looking over my shoulder to the person I'm currently talking to and we're having an argument, but we're doing it over text. Anyway, it might seem a bit cute to the people who had been born in the Slack world, but it was a major change back then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:03):\nYeah, I remember that. I remember that, I was in the same office with my team and we're using HipChat to chat and it felt strange. Now it's completely normal.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:15:10):\nIt's just normal, and Hipchat was one of the first to move there. Slack came out of nowhere. Company actually initially was focused more on gaming and they really took the market by storm. The growth numbers were dizzying when we're looking at them. And so at some point, Hipchat was left relatively alone for a while inside Atlassian. You're doing something good, so keep going after it. But with Slack, we now had to try to go bigger, so we started this thing called HipChat Go Big, the team, they recruited-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:44):\nThat was the name of the project? HipChat Go Big?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:15:46):\nYeah, HipChat Go Big. And then it was HipChat Next Gen, there was a few different. Anyway, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:51):\nVery clear. HipChat Go Big, I love it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:15:55):\nGo big. But it was really a go big, lots of new developers, lots of new product managers, designers, the full company behind this product kind of thing. We tried to grow it very aggressively for a product that did not change that fast before it had reached good product market fit already, hundreds of thousands of users on a daily basis, and all of a sudden that you get a lot of people who want to make changes to it, to compete against this new threat. The platform is not so ready for so many people to work on it. And so we got to the inevitable, okay, it's too much tech, we can't do much about it so we made the decision to rewrite it. There's lots of literature around there around should you do rewrite? Should you not do rewrite? You ask me now, I tell you never. Trust me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:44):\nThat's what most of the advice is, never do a rewrite, and people still do it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:16:46):\nNever do a rewrite, and there's good reasons for that. But basically we did that and out of it came up actually a new product called Stride, which was initially \"HipChat next gen.\" The problem is that the product was great, but by the time we were done, Slack was just miles ahead of us. At that point, Microsoft launched Teams. I don't know if you remember this moment where Slack put an ad in the, I think it was The New York Times, copying the Apple versus Microsoft thing from ages before going, \"Welcome to the game, welcome to the party, we'll welcome you competitors,\" and stuff like that and Slack got pretty much destroyed by Teams. We started coming because it was like Microsoft distribution advantage. Everyone in Office is going to get it. They're giving it for free as part of Office, it was unbundled I think a few months ago.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):\nWhich is ironic because in theory, Atlassian also has that same advantage, right? You have all these products, you could bundle it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:17:46):\nWe are going to talk about that actually in a minute.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:50):\nOkay, great.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:17:51):\nBecause that was what helped us, how we thought we would win, and it was how I think we lost.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:59):\nAmazing. Let's get in.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:18:00):\nSo anyway, this all happened, and in the end we executed the market. We sold HipChat and Stride to Slack and basically exited the enterprise communications market.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:10):\nJust to double down that, but you sold that to Slack and now Salesforce basically, that's the word ended. I don't know if people know that.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:18:19):\nYeah, actually, it was noticed by the market in that as soon as we did that, our stock price went up. I think it was $60 back then and it went up to 70. I mean, that really sucked for us, the team working on it. First, no one tells you, but failure, everyone tells you failure is great because you learn so many things, but failure to start with really sucks. None of us here were really happy about this on the team because we had spent years, on my part, it was three years, but the people who were before that on HipChat was longer than that. Obsessing over it, obsessing over every detail, every customer conversation, every solution, should we rewrite, should we this, should we do that?\n\n(00:19:07):\nSo many intense conversations, and from one day to the next, it didn't matter anymore. We had worked on something and that's it, that's the end. I'm sure many startups have been through that before. For me it was the first time it felt that personal, and the market the next day went, \"Oh, you're stopping doing what you're doing? Awesome. Yes, 10 more dollars to your stock price.\" So yeah, there's a personal side to all the stories. For us, there was a bit like the seven stages of grief after we shut down HipChat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:38):\nHow long was that period of mourning and stages for you and the team?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:19:42):\nIt lasted a few months. I was not part of the decision making team for shutting down HipChat. I was one of the product managers on the team leading one of the three pillars. I got brought in, I think it was a month or two, a month before it was announced for the team to go, \"Hey, Tanguy, by the way, just so you know, HipChat is no more, and now your mission is to find a new mission for the team after that.\"\n\n(00:20:11):\nWe basically spend the next two, three months trying to make sure that the squads were created to fully own what they do there, to make sure that they're the ones talking to the customers, they're the other ones trying to come up with strategies, trying to come up with solutions and everything in that area. As long as it was people interacting with Atlassian products on other surfaces, everything was fair game, and so there was a lot of ups and downs and everything. I think it took about two, three months before we got back to a new rhythm. And some people, when we talk about it, were still scarred by it basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:49):\nWhat are some lessons from that experience?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:20:51):\nYeah, so the main one that I personally got from this, and it's back to the hypothesis that you talked about, which we have all these successful products, we can expand into this one which is, and I quote it, but it's just myself, don't eat your own bullshit, which is a mix of two things. We've got a company value that says open company, no bullshit. So we need to be able to talk about the things like they are, and we don't try to make things sound smarter than they are. We don't try to hide the truth, we go after that truth, and we don't hide stuff from each other. We share with everyone, we are open by default. So that's one of the values and we do a lot of dogfooding, so eat your own dog food. We do test our own software a lot.\n\n(00:21:36):\nI've noticed that sometimes there are things that we do while we tend to believe stuff because it's worked for us before, and we have this assumption that it's going to keep working for us forever. The founders keep telling us what took us here won't take us there. That's a thing we keep hearing over and over again. But it's very easy for teams when they see success of something to think that it's successful because of X, but X is not validated. That's where we go back to the topic we've got today, which is why is doing this in a successful company harder sometimes. Well, Atlassian was successful with the playbook, and the playbook was we've got people in developers or tech or IT. They choose Atlassian apps, they love them. They start to recommend them to people in the business, and we start to see adoption, bottom-up adoption across the company before people decide to standardize on Atlassian.\n\n(00:22:43):\nWe made the bet that we can apply this playbook to this market, which is basically we can, from people to use Jira, introduce HipChat, and then people will go into HipChat first in tech teams, and then it will expand into business teams, and it'll go world to world basically from that. The thing is we didn't, in my opinion, do enough to validate that assumption early enough. We did a lot of work, a lot of work even on other things, even when faced with signals that this might not work. I do remember talking with a lot of customers who were like, \"Well, we've got, the IT is on HipChat, but the business prefer Slack.\" And then we started to see those businesses choosing Slack, which is the, initially it was like the developers try things and they like it and then everyone starts to adopt. In that case, the Slack managed to create a very strong fund base in roles that were not tech and IT.\n\n(00:23:48):\nIt was the moment where the consumerization of apps, that trend was starting to get really high. Slack really rode that and they focused everything in their experience to catch that. They gamified onboarding, they focused a lot more on the look and feel. They try to make it pleasant, modern, functional to use. There's a lot of stuff that we learned since then from what they did, we had missed that part. The part that I took personally from that is that there's a lot of assumptions in what made us successful, it doesn't mean that it's going to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:23):\nJust I understand what you're saying, which is really interesting that Atlassian was really successful selling basically to the buyer within the org, the IT team because they had everything they needed. They checked all the checkboxes, but it turned out in the Slack case, it was the users that ended up having the most influence over what tool they'd opted.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:24:42):\nI'd actually phrase it more as both were going after the users. Atlassian was going after the users in tech teams, Slack was going after the users in business teams. And in both cases, what happened was a bottom-up adoption. The people on the other side, the business would prefer Slack, the developers, they prefer the HipChat. We did a lot of work in the streams I was working on. We're integrating with every developer tooling out there to make sure that every tool that they use goes into HipChat and from HipChat back to those tools. And basically, they can do a lot of work by seeing an activity stream in HipChat. Business? Eh, not so excited by this. Emojis, a lot of other things that may at some point I remember we were thinking those things were trivial. No, they were not trivial. It was just a different approach for using the tool by a different set of users that we did not talk enough to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:36):\nSo is the lesson here, don't underestimate the challenge you'll have convincing a new segment to buy your thing. You may think they're close or similar, but they're probably not.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:25:46):\nYeah, that's one of them. The other one is what took you here is not going to take you there. And so go back and try to explain why you are successful today, and then if you think you can use the same thing on the next thing, find ways to validate it, find ways to test it. Don't just go and build on those assumptions. That's the main thing I got out of this ordeal basically for the stuff I did after.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:15):\nHow would you do that? How would you go about and test it? Is it use research? Is it the PMs talking to potential users? What would you have done there?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:26:22):\nFor example, when we started Jira for the Discovery, which is, so maybe I should introduce this for a second. It's a product for product managers, which is mainly used for prioritization and roadmap. People use Jira to plan and track work when it's committed. We wanted to create a space before that so people debate priorities with everyone that should be involved in that prioritization process, whether it be the developers, designers, so people in the product team or people outside of it, customer success, salespeople, support, leadership and so on and so forth. When we started, that we thought, okay, the product managers are already in Jira. You know what? We can reach them. So we create the tool, and then we'll distribute it from Jira. We could have gone down the path of building that and then started to start to distribute it.\n\n(00:27:15):\nInstead, we did things like before we brought a single line of code, put an ad inside a Jira newsletter going, \"Hey, we've got this thing for product managers coming up.\" And then we had a website that before we had any line of code written that said, \"Hey, product managers, your job is hard. We want to help, put your name here if you want to join us on the journey,\" that kind of thing. And that's when we saw, I think it was in two weeks, we got more than 3000 signups to that waitlist. We're like, \"Okay, cool. Validation of demand.\" We are talking to people who are interested and we can reach them. That's one examples of the things that I tried later, just to make sure that we validate the hypothesis that we've got much earlier on in the game basically, and not once it's too late.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:06):\nAwesome. That's an awesome, very tactical example.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:28:09):\nYeah, most of those are, none of what I'm going to talk about today is revolutionary. A lot of it is just trying to apply, asking the right question at the right time, and trying to go by whatever means to answer it really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:22):\nAny other lessons from the HipChat experience before we shift to a different product?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:28:26):\nI've got two, I'm going to do them quickly. The first one is competitive myopia, don't fall for it. At some point, the Slack was really gaining round and gaining round and capturing more of the mindshare. And everyone on Twitter was always loving them. Even when they had outrages, they were getting congratulated. I was like, \"This is working mad.\" But the love was so strong, and the way we tended to revert back is to our functional side of the brain going, okay, we just need this one more feature. We just need this one more feature, we just need this one more feature. And we ended up reacting to whatever.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:29:00):\n... more feature. We just need this one more feature. And we ended up reacting to whatever the competitor was doing, which I think is really, really bad because that's when we lost basically what made HipChat successful so far, which is to serve some users really well. And instead we ended up fast following based on what the competitor was doing, which is super bad because your competitor, if you think of what they do as an iceberg, the top side, what comes out of the water is what they've shipped in terms of features, but it's based on all this stuff that they've built in terms of research and understanding of their customer base and everything else. And so you're just seeing the manifestation of what they were thinking maybe a year ago, based on what they're shipping now. But we got there.\n\n(00:29:44):\nAnd now whenever I work, I tend to try and ignore competition other than watching every three months or so, seeing what came out, if there's anything we should be worried about, afraid of, stuff like that. But really just try to disconnect all the creative process and the research process from what competitors do, because you can't compare. The market is huge. There are hundreds of thousands of companies out there. Not everyone has the same needs. We serve a particular set of segments. We would do better learning from them to then expand to the others than watching what competition is doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:21):\nAnd this is advice you give to your teams, just ignore the competition, maybe pay attention at big announcements and things like that?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:30:26):\nWe always see in the Slack Channels team sharing, okay, they just did this with AI, they just did that. So it keeps coming up, and so we often have discussions to go back, to okay, let's watch again the user interviews that we did over the past three weeks. Let's watch them all together now and remember who we are building this for. So there's a lot of trying to anchor back on what we know and how, basically building our own journey on it. And I think it's much richer for everyone to be involved.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:58):\nI love that. So you're finding that when there's a big announcement and everyone's like, \"Oh my God, look what Slack's doing,\" or \"Look what this company's doing.\" It's like, \"Okay, now let's spend a little time reminding ourselves what our customers have been asking us to do and let's watch a couple of user interviews.\"\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:31:11):\nAnd even when there is something that competitors do that is right, remember, we're playing the long run and we don't always need to be first and shinier. We need to make sure that people have a problem, we solve this problem. They tell us, we solve this problem for them. They are delighted when we solve these problems for them. And so that's the stuff we should be obsessing about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:32):\nI love that. And you said you had one more lesson from this experience.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:31:37):\nYeah, the last one, startups have the benefit of starving. Right? We're a big company, we can throw a lot of resources at something that we're excited about. So this notion of we rebuild the HipChat, was coupled with we rebuild the HipChat and we'll do this on a new platform, which is microservices and everything that we built can be reused across all the other products. So the chat text box that you've got, it's an editor that can be open full screen and it's a Confluence editor with everything that you can do there. It's built as a platform component, which is amazing when the platform is there when you start building the product. Where it's really difficult is when you try to do the two at the same time. So I think that part, if I were to work on HipChat again and say I was leading that thing, that's the part I would go, okay, we need to win the problem space first, and if the platform is there, let's use it. If it's not there, we'll hack it, test it, iterate on it with customers, and then whatever is good there, let's platformize it later.\n\n(00:32:44):\nBut that's where you see what makes us super powerful as a bigger company, can also slow us down and make us focus on the wrong assumptions. So in that case, I think we thought we will win. Interestingly, I think we were convinced that we had a great shot at this market. And at the same time we thought that we could tackle the rewrite and we could tackle the platformization. All these things were necessary, but all of them at the same time was probably a bit too much to bite. Now I'm saying that, but today the editor you see in Confluence started with what we did in HipChat back then. So I would say that in terms of code, purely in terms of code, 70% of what we wrote for HipChat is probably still in the Atlassian platform today. But for a new bet, local Optima, that was really bad.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:37):\nYeah. Just thinking about the fact that Atlassian could have had this $30 billion business if this worked out, and I could see why people would be frustrated that it didn't work out. So thank you for sharing that story. Let's talk about Statuspage, another journey that you were a part of, that also didn't quite work out the way folks had hoped. Our therapy session continues. Talk about what that product was and what happened there.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:34:04):\nYeah, so this one is actually a success story, but became a success story after I was gone [inaudible 00:34:08]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):\nOkay.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:34:10):\nThat's more like a story of big companies can play the long run and for you individually inside that process, it might look like a loss and you might feel like you're going nowhere, yet the company stays on the opportunity for long enough to make it happen. So what we're going to talk about here are my own challenges working through it for something that ended up being very successful in the end, but I felt as a failure personally back then. So Statuspage at some point... So Jira is used by developers, right? And back then, I think it was back in 2016 or even before that, 2015, everyone was moving to the cloud, everyone was adopting DevOps, you build it, you run it. So basically developers would implement the software and then they would put it to production. And after they put it to production, they don't throw it over the wall to operations people. It's the same developers who operate the software in production. They go on call, yada yada.\n\n(00:35:12):\nSo back then I did market research to see whether Atlassian should play there, whether we had a crack at going after all the jobs around IT operations. So Jira was basically Jira software to build software. Could we have Jira for operations? So for operating this software. And so I did market research, found a few companies that were doing super interesting things there, like [inaudible 00:35:37], Opsgenie, New Relic. BigPanda was a small startup doing lots of cool stuff there, and Statuspage. Now I discovered Statuspage and found their offering super interesting, in that Atlassian is not an operations... We don't really build super deep operations tooling, what we focus on a lot is the collaborative aspects around everything. And when I was watching teams in incidents, I realized that there's a lot of chicken without a head syndrome, headless chicken, people running around like bunch of headless chicken.\n\n(00:36:14):\nShit hits the fan, and then what you see is teams just scrambling and everything gets mixed up all together in trying to fix the problem straight away, but at the same time questioning what happened, arguing over why we got there. Your boss is pinging you to go, \"Hey, what's going on? I've been hearing that the app is down. We're losing money.\" Customers are emailing you and asking you what's going... Your support channels get blown up. Sales people are worried because their customers are calling them. So basically, it ends up being a super stressful experience for everyone.\n\n(00:36:48):\nAnd what Statuspage was offering is something seemingly super simple, which is, well, what you should have is a status page for your services and you tell your customers about it and you can subscribe to your status page. Over there, you've got your services, and for those services you can publish an incident whenever there is one, and your customers will be notified, which means that they're not going to get in touch with support because they know you're on it. It's going to build trust with them because basically you are open in your communication with them. They're more likely to empathize with your position and be supportive as opposed to, \"Oh, that stuff is done again.\" So there was just so many benefits of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:31):\nI'm going to share a quick story while you're on this topic.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:37:34):\nYeah, of course.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:35):\nFunny enough, a decade ago, I used to work at a website performance monitoring company and I started a blog called Transparent Uptime. And my whole blog was about the power of being transparent about being down, telling people the status of things are broken right now, here's when things are going to return. It was a whole thing I was really obsessed with, and I was deep into this space. So when I saw Statuspage back in the day and Atlassian working, I was like, \"I love this.\" And I actually chatted with the founders a bit, because they were fans of that work I was doing back in the day. Completely unrelated to anything else I've done in my life. But I was really passionate about this very strange topic and I love that companies are embracing it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:38:21):\nI really loved diving deep into it for a few years, it's an amazing topic. And so anyway, there's so many fascinating things about this particular domain, but back then... So find Statuspage and we invited a few of those companies to work with us for a week to go, hey, so we're at Atlassian, we're basically the collaboration hub for everything that happens for developing teams. What would an experience look like that puts everything together and where [inaudible 00:38:48] could actually help you get the right information to the right team so they can act on it?\n\n(00:38:52):\nAnd so we did a week of hackathon in San Francisco all together. So people from New Relic, Statuspage and a few other companies. And out of that came really interesting concepts and there was really something there and I was like, \"Okay, I should start to work on a business case for Atlassian for basically IT tool/operations.\" Now, big companies like Atlassian, we've got money. So in every strategy that we've got, we've got cash in the bank, we always look at should we build, should we buy, should we partner? Acquisitions can be really powerful to accelerate you. We've got quite a few success stories there. Can't remember how many we did, but Trello is one of the good examples of that, for example. So we decided to buy Statuspage and I was running the integration of the Statuspage business inside the Atlassian business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:49):\nThanks for sharing all that context. What are some of the things that you learned from going through this experience? It sounds like basically it was really painful when you were a part of it and then it ended up being really successful. What are some lessons from the pain?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:40:02):\nMy learnings from it were on the acquisition side. So big company, we've got cash, we can buy a company, it will make us go faster, is not always the case. In my case, there were quite a few things that were not as easy as I would've thought. The first one is the culture shock of a startup that joins your company. So imagine you're a startup, you've got, I don't know, 20, 30 staff or something and things are going well, and you are in full control of your destiny. And then a company buys you to accelerate you, but then you stop owning all the decisions. So the CEO, maybe you become a product person. The person who was running GTM but was also doing a bunch of product stuff, and was also doing a bunch of maybe engineering stuff, all of a sudden is just working in marketing.\n\n(00:40:52):\nThere are decisions that are made above your head. For example, portfolio fit, which should be part of your product, which is things that should be used from the platform that we've got. So there's a lot of decisions that we're able to make on the day-to-day basis, that start to escape you. Big companies look much further out in the future. So Atlassian would look at the long game. And so I remember with Statuspage when they first joined, we asked about the roadmaps and they were like, well, for the next three months we're working on that and for the following three months we're thinking about potentially X, Y or Z. And so when we're like, \"Okay, so what's the three-year plan?\" They're like, \"What do you mean the three-year plan? I don't know, we'll survive, I guess.\" Which is what startups do. And they were very penciled ideas about the future, but not to the extent of what a big company would expect. And so that's a really big culture shock.\n\n(00:41:53):\nAnd what you end up with as well, and that's for companies who are looking to get acquired out there or buying other companies, before, you had a startup and everyone was one team, depending on how the buying company is organized, you might land with silos from within your team. So the way Atlassian is organized is like many Atlassian companies, we've got a product organization, we've got an engineering organization, we've got a marketing organization, design organization, and they each roll up to a different leader which may then roll up to the same person, but still by and large different organizations that are then assembled into squads and those squads operate together. But there are rituals that are part of the squad and there are rituals that ladder up to where you are in terms of craft. So I do remember how daunting it was for the Statuspage team when they joined, to understand how to navigate that.\n\n(00:42:47):\nIf I want to hire a new designer, I'm not talking to the Statuspage CEO anymore, I need to talk to the head of design for this area, which has pretty much nothing to do with the Statuspage business up until the acquisition. So that is the things that people told me when I started working on the integration, which is, hey, remember, you don't know yet, but integrations are mostly about people. They're not about technology as much or product vision. All of that stuff is the easy stuff. The hard part is the people. And I didn't quite understand at first and then I really got it by the end of it.\n\n(00:43:27):\nBecause what we tell those companies is we can accelerate by buying, but in reality they are going to be faced with more internal processes around how they manage staff, performance reviews, this concept of engineering allocation, revenue forecasts, OKRs, long-term roadmaps, all that stuff comes in very new to them. So one part of the company top-down says, we bought you because you are successful, keep doing what you're doing. While many other teams without meaning to, basically end up constantly interacting so that the right processes are followed, so that the right things are done.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:03):\nThat's a really interesting point, that one group is keep doing what you're doing. We're going to leave you alone, you're the experts. And then other people that are on the ground actually building it are like, \"Hey, build with this component. Hey, we need this process, we need this document.\"\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:44:15):\nAnd it's the things that you used to be able to focus 90% of your time working on your product, and all of a sudden all of that stuff may seem parasitical but comes in and interrupts you all the time. And often the new joiners, they don't know that they basically are not only being acquired, they've been hired by the company. So they basically are joining a different company with different sets of rituals, with a different culture. All of that is very different, basically. It's not going to be the same for every acquisition. Like I said, we had some acquisitions that were great. Statuspage ended up being a huge success inside Atlassian, but when I was there, I basically worked through the difficult parts of it, where I was like, \"It's not as simple as people may think.\" So one warning, if you're planning to do acquisitions, make sure you factor all of that in and think about the integration plans to compensate for these aspects. So you don't expect the business to join and keep running at exactly the same pace, because going to be a big slowdown before it accelerates again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:17):\nSo maybe as a last question here, is just say you were to do an acquisition again and I don't know if you've gone through more, what's one thing you would change? What's one thing you'd recommend of let's make sure to do this thing very differently?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:45:27):\nOne aspect that I'm going to talk about to then go there, but one aspect we didn't talk about which is we bought a product, how does that product fit with the rest? And so we had different types of acquisitions that we did. One is we buy the company and we keep the product running and then we try to integrate it with our tech stack. And then the other acquisition is we buy the company and then we kind of rebuild on our platform, or we buy with this huge synergy with our platform. And so we call that the frankenstack, otherwise. Which is, you get one tech stack here, one tech stack there and they can't quite talk to each other, identity is different, integrating is different. And so it looks like a patchwork of products and that's not what our customers want from us.\n\n(00:46:09):\nSo the next time I try personally, I would treat it like hiring over treating it like buying business only. So there would be a huge component which is to both educate and tease out what it means to actually hire the team inside the company. At the same time I'm saying that because I don't want to do a big one. The next one I want to do is relatively small. Find a company that has amazing product that we can bring in as a tech-in, shut down the product, rebuild it on our platform and so it's basically the equivalent of an acqui-hire, because basically what we'll be buying is the acceleration of our roadmap.\n\n(00:46:51):\nWe could try and form a team to do what they did, but they've been successful so they know what they're doing. We could probably get there one year faster. What does that mean for our revenue at the scale of Atlassian, if we can enter a market one year earlier? It's probably going to pay the acquisition back on its own. So my learnings from it were basically that it needs to be treated like hiring and what I would like to do next time is more doing it like that, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:24):\nWhat about in the case of HipChat, where it feels like it was a mistake to rebuild a thing. Is there for this kind of startup, don't rebuild for this kind of startup? Start again. Do you have a thought of how you separate those two?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:47:36):\nThere's actually a big difference. There's a big difference. Which is in one case what you try to do is.... So when you rebuild, you've got a successful business, you've got hundreds of thousands of customers, for example, and you're trying to rebuild the same thing or a different thing, but for the same customers that have got expectations about your current product. In the other one is you buy a company that's got some traction, not too much, so you can shut down the business and then rebuild on your platform to reach your customer base. So it's not the same as trying to rebuild the plane mid flight, it's delaying takeoff. It's like, \"Yeah, we did a trial run, the plane landed. Okay, cool. Switch to another plane, takeoff again.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:17):\nGot it. I love that. Any other key insights and lessons from this experience before we get to your product discovery?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:48:25):\nOne last one and then I'm going to stop with the therapy session, thank you very much for offering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:30):\nNo, no, we got to keep it going. I got to rack up the bill on this therapy session.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:48:35):\nWhich is, remember I mentioned I was working on a business case for... Basically going bigger in IT operations. And so there was as Statuspage as part of it, but there was a lot of stuff that I wanted to be able to do inside Jira and a whole bunch of other products to basically go big in that area, IT operations, before Jira service management, which is a very successful product we've got around that. Before it was really entering that part of the market. Everyone was excited. It was before we had an incubator internally. And so I was trying to pitch it like let's build a new product that's centered around that thing. It's on Jira and it integrates with these tools that we discussed and we can put in Statuspage there and that's actually how we could accelerate them as well, and so on and so forth. Everyone was excited, thought it made sense, lots of encouragement. I pitched it to every level of the organization from business leaders, to the CTO that we had at the time, to the CEOs. No one said no, no one said yes. For months.\n\n(00:49:44):\nFor months, I was in this limbo of, I think everyone's excited about this, everyone wants this to happen, but it's not happening. And so I remember talking with my boss at the time going, what's going on? When do I stop pushing? Because at some point I'm sure I'm going to start pissing people off. And he was like, \"Well, basically when you lose the passion for it. Keep going up until you feel like it's not worth pushing anymore.\" And I remember looking at this advice and going, wow, that was not helpful at all, based on the situation that I was in. But basically at some point I basically gave up. What happens though, and I understood that after because the company ended up going there just a year later, was that I misread the appetite and sense of urgency around that topic and the fact that Atlassian being Atlassian, we invest in so many markets, we have many opportunities like this that sit on a shelf.\n\n(00:50:45):\nSomeone did the analysis, someone created a business case, that thing makes sense. There may not be a trigger for the why now. So we need a very strong trigger for why now to go after it. And I did not do a good enough job at articulating this. Why now? Why do we have to do this now versus in a year's time, in two years time? And the next team that came in afterwards did a much better job at that. But for me, that was a great learning, which is great work can get parked and [inaudible 00:51:20]. And yeah, that's just what happens, which is because we have so many opportunities and there's many companies out there that are probably faced with that, doesn't mean that we have to go after all of them. But it does make sense to explore them, and then decide when to pull the trigger, and that rationale for the sense of urgency needs to be there. It needs to be beautiful to the business days.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:42):\nThis reminds me of my chat with Mihika, who does similar work at Figma where she works a lot of zero to one stuff. And she described it as your job is to keep the flame alive and help it spread throughout the entire business if you're trying to get everyone on board with a new idea. And I like this very tactical piece of advice you're sharing here of how to do that, is make it clear why this is.... I think of it as why is it perishable? Why is this opportunity perishable? Why is it going to disappear if we don't act on it now? And you could think of it as why do we have to do this now? It's not just like \"This is a huge opportunity.\" But we also need to do it right now to give people motivation.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:52:15):\nYeah, that was a huge learning for me. I wasted months on it, but like with every failure, learnings came out of it in the painful way. So product managers are often biased towards action, or at least that's my case. I want to go and do stuff and build stuff, and try stuff with customers. And so being idle, waiting for a confirmation is not a great spot to be, but sometimes you need to recognize when you're there and it's good to step back.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:40):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda and I mean that literally.

Coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:54:09):\nLet's try to summarize some of the biggest lessons so far that you've shared before we get to product discovery. So a few things I noted here, just how to be successful, building zero to one at a large company. One is be very clear, are the users you're going to be building this new product to actually the same users you're already selling to? And it may feel like they are close enough, but in the case of HipChat, you learned maybe not, and it's a lot harder than you expected.\n\n(00:54:33):\nTwo is be careful when you rewrite. In some cases, shut it down, rewrite it immediately, accelerate this new idea internally. In other cases and you shared, and so you could rewind if you want to get the actual details of when it makes sense to go one or the other. Sometimes doesn't make sense to rewrite, just keep what you're doing and focus on the user problems and don't slow down. Another tip I wrote down is ignore the competition. Don't be obsessed with what they're doing. Focus on what your users are asking you for. And then this idea of paying attention to the why now, that's a really good one. Just like when you're trying to make a case, make it clear why it has to happen now. Is there anything else that comes to mind as I try to summarize some of the advice so far?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:55:12):\nNo, that seems like a good one. The main one I'm getting also out of this, is if you try to start new things, it's going to be coming from your drive and your passion, and that's what pushes stuff forward. So don't give up. Because I try really hard before getting to one that worked. So I guess that's probably a testament for it's possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:36):\nAnd a testament to your grit and desire to make something work. So on that note, let's talk about your product discovery. I know this is a success at this point. I know there was also a lot of pain that went into this and things that didn't work. So I'd love to hear both sides of it, just like what was hard about getting this off the ground and then also just what worked, what allowed you to make this work? So start wherever you want to start.\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:56:00):\nYeah, cool. So let's start with the good stuff before we go back into therapy. Some of the good stuff here is Atlassian at that point had recognized we are innovating in our big successful products all by doing acquisitions, we have to correct that and start building new products ourselves as well. And so there was a huge push from the founders to go, \"Hey, we need to restart that.\" Out of it came Point A, which was an internal incubator program that was meant to fix that. And the way they framed it was that innovation is like a muscle. Unless you exercise it, it becomes weak, and what we have to do now is to work on it again. And so out of that thing, Point A and Jira Product Discovery was one of the... I think it was one of the 100 pitches that went through that innovation program. There were 100 pitches and out of it came out three products that basically went through all the different stages of it. And so it started with Jira Product Discovery was actually made possible because of that and because we're inside Atlassian. So we started with a lot of, I could take time to focus on this stuff with nothing else to do it. It was a full-time job, because of this incubator. I was able to form a team easier because there was budget allocated. I was able to form a team that was not worried about losing their job because the program was made so that technically speaking, you would borrow people from other departments. If that thing doesn't work out, they go back to your department. So there's no fear of losing your job, basically.\n\n(00:57:34):\nWe were able to tap into all the research that was done by our research and insights team internally. We were able to have the corporate development team working with us. I met with probably 20 companies that played in things around product management before forming a view that, hey, maybe we should play there. And all those teams are willing to talk to us because Atlassian is a big player in this market. And so there's always the opportunity of integrating, being bought, partnering that can...\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:58:00):\nThe opportunity of integrating, being bought, partnering, that kind of stuff. I was able to meet with analysts to say, \"Hey, so what do you think about the product management market?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:11):\nThis was all part of the Point A structure?\n\nTanguy Crusson (00:58:14):\nSo the Point A structure, not all of it was formalized in Point A, remember Point A back then was created alongside the first bets that went through it, and ours was one bet as part of that. So we forged the path for all the ones that came afterwards. But basically, it gave us the crags to go in and ask for help from everyone, and everyone knew it was important. Because everyone knew the company priorities and the new products were top company priority. And so Atlassian, playing the long game, had decided that it was okay to invest in these bets and to reassess them into every three to six months to understand whether we should put more chips in it.\n\n(00:58:52):\nAnd so the psychological safety of everyone's job was safe, coupled with access to all the resources from the company. That part was just invaluable to the success of what JPD is today.\n\n(00:59:03):\nSo to give you a bit of context, Jira Product Discovery started four years ago with some research. I was alone back then, and then we were three. The first line of code was written three years before we launched officially, as generally available. Which means that for three years we were dogfooding alpha or beta and able to do that with the full support of the company. So when I mention the long game, I mean it. It's something that's very hard to get in most companies out there.\n\n(00:59:36):\nAnd when people ask me about how to stop incubators, it's like think about it with when you're going to get your dollars back and forget about it for a while. What you need to see is how the teams are answering the right questions that they ask along the way, and seeing whether you are still excited about the bets as they do that.\n\n(00:59:57):\nAnyway, so we launched a year ago. Fast-forward to today, we've got 8,000 customers, amazing CSAT, great traction. It's one of the fastest growing products in Atlassian history, which is great. So what was hard though, the first one was reminding everyone that failure is the most likely outcome. And I will die on that hill to explain to people when they want to stop things internally, frame it like that, remind everyone. There's a [inaudible 01:00:28] 70% chance, [inaudible 01:00:30] completely pulled out of thin air that whatever you're working on is not going to exist in six months.\n\n(01:00:35):\nWe're trying to launch a new product, enter a new market. Our goal is to get to $100 million businesses. So there's not that many of them out there. We have tried and we have failed. And a few of them are Atlassian. And so remember that, and it's super important to remember that because otherwise the company has a tendency to over invest, not the company top-down, parts of the company have the tendency to come and try to help.\n\n(01:01:07):\nSo for example, \"Here, we want to build this.\" \"Oh, if you want we could change this service to be able to XYZ for you.\" \"No, we are a bet, which is seven people. Let's not drag the rest of the company into it. The appetite that the company has right now is these seven people. We'll see what we can do with these seven people,\" was what I was telling everyone.\n\n(01:01:26):\nThe reason I was saying that is that, otherwise, yes, you get the help, but the help always comes with condition and the condition is usually things slow down. So what we try to do is remind everyone, things are going to fail, so that we could basically buy the opportunity to hack shit together that is not going to scale, that is not going to respect our design guidelines, that is not going to fit with the JIRA target architecture. But we're going to test this with customers and see if the concepts make sense, if the prototypes make sense, whether they get value out of those before we tell you, \"Hey, you know what? That thing is a thing and by the way, now we're a proper business. We should build that thing into the platform.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:08):\nThis is really interesting because it's counterintuitive to think that you should position your new bets as, this is most likely going to fail. This is just the thing we're trying, don't worry, don't commit too much this yet, don't worry about giving us all these resources. Why do you think that's so important? Because I don't think most companies position new incubations that way. Why do you think that's so effective and more effective?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:02:29):\nYeah. So the thing that we're trying to do when starting new products is to basically emulate a startup in an environment that is not hungry, is not starving. And so you need to create scarcity. What I wanted with my team is to make sure that they feel the urgency. That thing needs to move. I also needed the rest of the company to go away, so we could get the autonomy to test the things that we needed to know whether this thing is even going to work or not.\n\n(01:02:57):\nWe could not go into a planning session for the next six months to negotiate something with a platform service so we can build a feature to then test with users. I said, \"Now, we're rebuilding this component and we're testing this with customers next week. It's not perfect. It's not perfect.\" And so that helped us a lot, but otherwise there's always this tendency of the process that works for everything else is going to work for this and we do need to keep reminding them, \"Hey, we might not exist in six months. Do you really care that much about this process right now? The product might not exist anymore.\" The process goes away usually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:29):\nSo it's basically a trick to keep everyone else within the org away and not worry about what you're building? Because you just tell them, \"Don't worry, this is not going to work out. We're just going to try this thing just to see.\" So it's not for your team to feel like, \"This is probably not going to work out.\" I imagine the team is like, \"Oh, we got to make this work. It's such a good idea.\" It's more as a trick to keep the org from swallowing you up and pushing you around?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:03:52):\nSo there's a part of that, but there's also really a need from... We need to respect Atlassian's dollars here, and if we don't know whether this thing is going to work... I do not want to drag a team of 50 people into this. I want to know that this thing is worth the investment of a team of 50 people. So it's a bit of both, actually. Now, it's of course, easier said than done. And so that's where, again, Point A helped. We had four stages called Wonder, Explore, Make and Impact, where in the first stage it was all about proving that there was a problem area we could go into, there was a market.\n\n(01:04:27):\nWe could answer very clearly, articulate why Atlassian should move there. We could articulate why now that stuff that [inaudible 01:04:35] struggled with before, and have enough data to validate all those claims. Explore was about exploring solutions, which doesn't mean build it and throw it out there and see what sticks. It's about if you get a bunch of customers raising a problem, can you get them to play back to the solution, [inaudible 01:04:53] address that problem?\n\n(01:04:54):\nAnd so in the case of Jira Product Discovery, because we were not building, we didn't need any new technology, it was mainly new UX and new workflows, we basically validated a lot of that with Figma in dozens of Zooms. But it's basically coming back saying, \"Here's how those companies are framing it. Here's their problems, here's how this thing would be solving it for them.\"\n\n(01:05:18):\nSo that's part of Explore, which is validating that it's worth investing in in terms of solution. We don't only have the right problem, we've got the right solutions. Then Make is about making it happen in stages, starting with an alpha, then a beta, and then going out there. And Impact is that stuff is actually ready to go [inaudible 01:05:37]. And now let's see the impact it has on Atlassian's business and keep monitoring it from there.\n\n(01:05:42):\nAnd it turns into a real business from that point onwards. But everyone at Atlassian knew these four stages, Wonder, Explore, Make, Impact. Whenever we were talking with teams, we were telling them we're currently in Explore. And we started doing that with the full bet itself. Then we started doing that to talk about the different features that we were working on or problem areas we were going after. Which means that now every time we go into conversation with other teams and we'll mention, \"We're in Wonder,\" or, \"We're in Explore,\" they know what to expect. When we go to someone in the leadership team and we say, \"We want to go from Explore to Make,\" they know they're going to [inaudible 01:06:22] because they need developers now.\n\n(01:06:23):\nSo all that vocabulary and clear expectations set for every stage of the process really helped us to facilitate all the conversations that we had with everyone in the organization. And really protected us again from all those, basically, teams that felt like they had to chime in. Now, we're in Explore, we don't have anything ready that's been validated. Let's not have opinions about how the architecture is done before we have validated that customers want something.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:52):\nThis is super cool. I feel like we could do a whole podcast just on the structure of Point A and how you all do this. But just one question, what does the gate look like when you move from Explore to Make, Make to Impact? Is there a group of people that sit in a room and decide thumbs up, thumbs down? How does that decision work?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:07:08):\nSo we basically write a six pager that looks at all the different aspects of all the questions that we're going to answer. And then we are in a meeting with the Point A stakeholders and the founders of Atlassian. And everyone reads that page for about 15 minutes and then question, answers, comments, and [inaudible 01:07:31] of that, by the end of this meeting, we know whether we are clear to go to the next stage.\n\n(01:07:35):\nWe got booted back one time when we were like, \"Hey, we're ready to go anywhere from alpha to beta as part of Make.\" And they're like, \"No, you're not.\" And I was like, \"No, we're not.\" And so we stayed and we basically got more time than what was initially allocated to us. But basically, the founders and the leadership of Point A as well as heads from the different lines of businesses at Atlassian were participating in those sessions, which-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:01):\nThat is super cool.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:08:02):\nBasically, visibility all the way up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:05):\nAnd they might also just decide, \"Let's kill this thing, it's not working,\" at one of these meetings.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:08:10):\nSo it might be, \"Let's kill this thing,\" which happened to a number of bets that we did, or it might be, \"Let's roll this thing into something else.\" So for example, our new whiteboards product. I say product, whiteboards feature part of Confluence initially came out of Point A. And was eventually rolled into Confluence instead because [inaudible 01:08:32] made more sense there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:33):\nThat's so interesting. So you said there's 100 projects that went through Point A. So there's this funnel. Is there a meeting for all 100 of these that the founders go to for all these incubations or did they come join later down the funnel?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:08:46):\nNot the full 100 of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:47):\nOkay, good.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:08:50):\nAnd I'm saying 100, it's over a few different quarters of teams coming in and [inaudible 01:08:53], but not for the initial stage of entering Point A.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:50):\nI see.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:08:58):\nIt's usually when they've been accepted.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:01):\nI interrupted you and took us on a tangent, you were sharing essentially the things that went well and how this all came together.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:09:08):\nSo failure as the most likely outcome. It's the one thing I would stand behind in everything because I've seen before what happens when we get too complacent with it's going to work. Lessons from the previous things I was talking about. So this one really key. Second one, this one is much harder, which is if you're starting something like this, your teams will need to break a lot of rules that are established. But they need to be able to do that without breaking the trust of everyone in the organization.\n\n(01:09:39):\nThe rules were created to support the business at the stage where it was successful, and it just so happens that they might not work for new bets. So the trick here for me has been to... The way I pictured it is, I've got a bunch of chips. Since I joined my class, I've been accumulating chips and those chips are-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:03):\nLike social capital.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:10:04):\nYeah. It's like trust I've built with the founders, with the different business leaders, with succeeding on stuff or failing and explaining why and trying to do better next time. And all that stuff gave me, like you said capital. I've got these chips and I decided on this bet, \"You know what, I'm going to go all in.\" So I always said, \"If it works, it works. If it doesn't work, I'm probably out of here, but I'm going to go all in.\"\n\n(01:10:27):\nSo if I see something that's not going to work, I'm going to say it. We're not going to do it. And so I knew I was going to put myself in tough conversations because people are here to protect things that need to be protected. They just don't make sense for the stuff I was working on. So one example, breaking rules without breaking trust where it was tricky.\n\n(01:10:48):\nWe have a lot of rules in a company like Atlassian, and this is how it works in engineering. I mean, engineers are the biggest part of our workforce. Basically, shit gets done because engineers work on it. And what I needed was to be able to hire the right team, only principal levels, people who have a lot of internal credits so that they can commit to any team's repo, no questions asked. People who are not looking for the next promotion, but they want to make a splash. And when that's not possible, I wanted to be able to hire contractors to fill in the gaps and stuff like that. And I was like, \"A lot of the rules that I need to be able to break is basically in engineering.\" So I decided not to have an engineering leader in the team, and to do it myself.\n\n(01:11:36):\nSo I was the product leader and the engineering leader. I was technical enough to be able to have these conversations, but mainly I was just working with amazing engineers who just could self-drive themselves. So they were able to make changes in areas that were not owned by them. They were able to do changes that do not respect any of our standards. They were able to hack their way around rebuilding services and whatnot. We are now not in the position where we need to do stuff like that, but at that time I needed to take a position like that so we could actually go and move fast with basically the equivalent of being a startup inside Atlassian.\n\n(01:12:13):\nThat's not comfortable to do stuff like that. And I would not recommend that in many environments. Atlassian was very forgiving throughout the whole thing. It doesn't mean that I didn't [inaudible 01:12:27] on that.\n\n(01:12:28):\nThat was not simple. For example, one of the rules is, at that time we didn't want to have a footprint in Europe back then for more engineering teams. It's different today, but back then it was like that. I was like, \"Shit. I'm based in France, I'm trying to start this stuff. I don't want to move to the US or move back to Australia just for this right now.\" So I hired contractors, lots of contractors when we started, or not lots because we're not a big team, but contractors to build this stuff.\n\n(01:12:57):\nAnd again, contractors, they don't fall into the same rules as the rest of engineering staff. So basically, all the rules around you need to contribute to... For example, the engineering team could say, \"[inaudible 01:13:10] to the next, leadership could say, \"You need to invest 15% of your time in reliability.\"\n\n(01:13:15):\nAnd for us it's like, \"We're not there yet. We don't even have a prototype out.\" Yeah. But that's the company rule, all right. Again, no engineering manager and contractors, boom, none of these rules applied. So it was people who were looking at it from the outside who were like, \"Wow, dude, are you sure you're okay with all this?\" And it felt super uncomfortable, but we have the support of leadership from it. It's just a tough transition for Atlassian from the, \"We only invest in the big ones for acquisitions,\" to \"Let's invest in [inaudible 01:13:46].\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:45):\nThis is a crazy story you're telling me. So you're leading this team, you hired a team of contractors to build this product. You're in a whole different country from the rest of Atlassian, basically. And the whole idea here was just to do stuff that wouldn't be necessarily allowed at Atlassian. They wouldn't let you work this way. And you found that to make the thing you needed to make, the thing that you were betting your career on, it sounded like, you're just going to be this pirate working on this thing in France and it worked out?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:14:18):\nSo the Point A emoji and Atlassian is a [inaudible 01:14:24]. I was not the only one. There were quite a few of us working on new bets, basically operating like that. Each questioning different rules. The end goal was not to question the rules, the end goal was to get to the stuff that we needed to do, which is we just need to clean this space, to work with users to test prototypes up until it works and progressively get to, as I said, a product that's going to be enough to launch. So we never intended to break the rules, which is the things that we were going to choose the ones that were going to work to support us on this mission and say no to the others.\n\n(01:14:58):\nYou mentioned Europe. At the time, a lot of other Point A founders were struggling with the fact that they were operating from their mothership in Sydney because they're still with everyone else. You were talking about doing all this stuff, but remember that we've got this OKR thing, we've got this vision for GR that we're building, you need to participate in all this. And so I was in Europe going, \"Fine, schedule it at your time.\"\n\n(01:15:28):\nAnd I think a lot of teams were like, \"We don't care enough about this test. They're telling us it's not going to exist in six months. I don't care enough about this to stay up late or wake up super early every day to disagree with them.\" And so there was a lot of the early success that we had in being able to move super fast that came from being so far, that people just did not engage to stop us.\n\n(01:15:58):\nAnd that's why we were initially the group with the fastest speed. Then it was possible to institutionalize those things into Point A to then make it possible to do it from within Atlassian. But at first, we just needed to blaze our way through. So that's what we did.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:16):\nSo it sounds like one of the biggest lessons and things that work well for something like this is a super silo sort of team, as much as you can disconnect from the core business and let them just do what you think you need to do?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:16:30):\nYou've interviewed Megan on the show before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:30):\nYeah.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:16:33):\nAnd I listened again to the way she pitched Point A, and yes, that's exactly what came out of what she was saying. Which is, we gave the space for those teams to be able to do this with a lot of autonomy. And that was the outcome of all that work, basically, which is the program was then set up so new teams could do it and fitting within the mothership, basically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):\nAnd I think people hear that, like yeah, okay, of course. [inaudible 01:16:59] incubations, silo, separate, they do their own thing. People hear and they try to do that, but I imagine it's not actually what they need to do. And what I'm hearing is you went to a pretty far extreme of making that happen, not basically breaking the rules to allow for a silo to actually exist. And I love that. What else was key to the success of making this work out?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:17:22):\nSo the one that I'm most passionate about is how we work with customers is very different in a super early stage bet versus to what you do in a very established product like Jira. So the first part is, how can we innovate in a way that doesn't fuck up existing customers? Jira, 120,000 customers, Atlassian, 300,000 customers. We can't just go in there, start experimenting, breaking a whole bunch of shit that millions of people experience and go, \"What are you doing, Atlassian?\" So what we needed is to create this area where we could experiment that's away from Jira while being inside Jira.\n\n(01:18:06):\nThat part was a bit tough. It's possible to do. In fact, I came across an article from Ben Weiss. No, sorry, Noah Weiss, it's from many years ago now. Where he was basically talking about innovating in a successful material product and talked about three stages of incubate, iterate, integrate. And as part of that he gave the examples of Instagram, Twitter, and Foursquare. Where basically he was explaining, at the beginning, for example, Instagram was a feed that was chronological. And then the team started to experiment with a popular tab that was on the side that was not integrated into the core of the product that everyone uses.\n\n(01:18:47):\nThey iterated on that for a while. That became the explore tab and then the explore tab became the main feed. The feed is not chronological anymore, it's based on your interests. And that part really resonated with me where I was like, \"You know what? We're going to try to apply that to Jira, which is we're going to build it in Jira, but we're going to extract ourselves from a lot of the core components of the core base to rebuild the UX that would work for the audience we're going after.\"\n\n(01:19:17):\nOur audience is product managers. They have no patience for spinners, things need to be visual. They need to be able to quickly move things around to visualize the potential options they've got on their roadmaps and stuff like that. It needs to be snappy, it needs to get out of the way, but also something that they can feel proud to present to their stakeholders to have discussions around that.\n\n(01:19:39):\nIt can be bogged down into the details. It can go to very, very deep [inaudible 01:19:43]. It needs to be an area, a space where you feel like you can breathe and have creative conversations. And Jira's UI was not exactly known for that. And in fact, most of the product managers I talked to were like, \"I don't want to do this in Jira. It's too strict, there's too many workflows, it's owned by IT,\" yada, yada. And so we said, \"That's fine. We're going to experiment with an experience that's going to be detached from Jira still on the same platform.\"\n\n(01:20:09):\nAnd that's what we did, basically. And so this concept of incubate by working on something on the site, iterate until you've got it right and then integrate it back into the main product is something I would definitely do again. We're currently in the middle of the integration phase for Jira product discovery.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:28):\nSo the lesson there is don't force yourself to be a part of the broader product, initially. First, figure out what it could be if it's its own thing, and then eventually you can integrate?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:20:40):\nIt depends who you're doing it for and the programs that they've got. Don't feel limited by your platform to answer the core things that are necessary for your product to work, basically. So if the platform is good enough for us, if the UX was good enough for the product managers, we would not have done that. And we would've had a hard time justifying it, but because it was not, we basically gave ourselves the stamp to be able to do it. So still in don't fuck existing customers, something I read from a site, from Reforge that talk about the Safety Funnel.\n\n(01:21:16):\nSo they have this thing where the typical growth funnel goes from acquisition all the way to revenue and there's a whole bunch of different stages in between. Your goal is to maximize the number of people who go through this funnel successfully.\n\n(01:21:29):\nAnd I was trying to explain to people what we were trying to do with Jira Product Discovery, and I was struggling to put a name on it. And it was we're going to work with a few, small number of customers up until it's right for them and then we're going to expose it to progressively more people. And I know it's very common sense, but that's basically what we decided to do instead of the Atlassian way, which was more, \"Hey, we measure our success based on...\" For example, at that time, I think it was still before all those projects, \"... monthly active users.\" If that was a measure of success, we would've been pushed very quickly to go and expose it to as many people as we could. We didn't want to do that because if they would have a bad experience, it would've been very hard to claim them back afterwards.\n\n(01:22:11):\nSo someone in Reforge put the name on Safety Funnel. So the Safety Funnel is amazing. People don't understand that. You basically put a hard stop and you limit the number of people who had bad experiences. And you do that for a while, up until you can prove it's amazing and then you invite more people. So we did a lot of that. So we basically created that pocket away from Jira to reimagine what Jira could be for product managers. And we only exposed that to a very small number of customers at first. So that's don't fuck existing customers' first principle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:45):\nAnd the reason that's important, just to put a point there, is the business will start to get upset if you're making many customers upset.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:22:53):\nThat would've been it if we had triggered an incident that brought down Jira for millions of users. And first time might have been okay. I mean, by the third time we would've been asked to pack up and go home, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:05):\nGot it. So the advice there is just limit how many people get exposed to your very early product, even if it's going to hurt your numbers. You don't want to cause people to be like, \"What the hell are you doing over there, man? [inaudible 01:23:17].\"\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:23:16):\nSo [inaudible 01:23:17] your numbers is now the interesting one. So how do you frame success and how do you define metrics when your goal is basically to work with a small number of customers for a super long time? So that's what I ended up defining for this, is based on a term that was used at Atlassian that I tried to formalize it into something that everyone could refer to, which is the Lighthouse Users Program. And so the principle for it is it's a program, so it's an official thing. We have hundreds of thousands of customers at Atlassian, but we would only build the experience for a small number of them. And so there are stages to it.\n\n(01:23:56):\nThe first stage is we work with 10 and we prove that the problems that they had are the things that we solved and where we spend most of the time for the first 10 Lighthouse Users is to explain why they are the Lighthouse Users.\n\n(01:24:13):\nEverything that explains why we believe they are a proxy for every customer that we serve afterwards. We then have this stage from 10 to 100 where we recruit more customers, but we're still not in the fully self-service, don't need a lot of onboarding stuff. We're still testing out the value, but we're testing the different variations in the scenarios that people face to make sure that the core solution that we've got can cater for those. So there's a lot of different options and different security needs. There's a lot of subtleties that you catch between 10 and 100.\n\n(01:24:44):\nThen we get to a stage where we're like, \"You know what? It's good. It solves people's problems, but it's not self-service. We just need to explain stuff. We need to work with people on Slack. We need to work with them and answer a lot of support tickets or do a lot of Zoom calls to explain stuff.\"\n\n(01:24:58):\nNow we need to get from 100 to 1,000, and by getting there we basically need to solve all of that and after that we graduate. So basically by detailing that and explaining all the success criteria in between, it helps to define success in that in the make phase, we've got 10, 100, 1,000, and then people can understand exactly where we're at there, and the types of questions we're trying to answer. In the 10, we're answering every question with a user, snippet of a video call with them, either talking about their problem and solution but showing the product and how they solve with it.\n\n(01:25:34):\nThat's how we wanted our stakeholders to view it, which is it's very qualitative, but have it felt from the user's perspective. It's different when we go from 10 to 100, from 100 to 1,000, but for each of those there's a playbook for how you go from one to the other. That helped us because we could then clean the space to do the right thing and we will not ask to hit, for example, a multi-active user's number or number of customers' number or percentage of users who use this number. Because it's very qualitative still when we're at that stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:09):\nThat is super cool and super interesting. And it's along the lines of the gates. It aligns with, at each gate, here's how many users we're looking for. Basically, it sets expectations for what success is, keeps you from having to scale things too early. It's such a cool idea. And you call it Lighthouse Users, like the Lighthouse Users Program?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:26:25):\nLighthouse Users, and there's two sides to it. We just talked about the stakeholder facing side. The one I love is the team facing side of this, which is I've seen a lot of teams, Atlassian and other companies as the products grow, you tend to leverage a lot more user research, formal user research or CSAT service. And the way I call it, it's hiding behind research and not being close enough to the ground with customers. And what I want to do in the teams I work with is to create a direct feedback loop with customers, but not like someone gives you feedback and you do it. We talk...\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:27:00):\n... with customers, but not like someone gives you feedback and you do it. We talk to those customers, we build stuff for them. So there's something I've seen which is climate change. It's a thing. Everyone knows it's a thing. We all read reports about it. We're all like ... Every time we read an IPCC report we're like, \"Shit.\" Do we change anything? Not enough.\n\n(01:27:23):\nWhat makes people want to change and actually gives them a trigger to change? I've seen is a lot more empathizing with individual people's experience. If I know someone that's impacted by climate change, it's going to make me relate a lot more strongly to the concept of climate change and want to change myself. Sorry for the power note here. I'm-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:48):\nNo, that's such a good example. Such a good way of making that point very clear of just the power of talking to a small number of users versus thinking that the more data you have, looking at data, CSAT scores, NPS retention will tell you what you need.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:28:02):\nSo what we do with that is we recruit 10 people and we put these people in front of the whole team, not just the PMs, PM, designer, engineering. We meet on Zoom, we chat, we work with the same ones over months to build a product. They are with us on Slack. We have regular things.\n\n(01:28:20):\nWhat we've seen, what I've seen going fast is that the engineers would go into a planning meeting and the PM would say, \"So we should work on X,\" and the engineer will go, \"Wait a minute. We've had a talk with this customer and they struggle with this so I think we should work on that instead and fix that part of the experience,\" and so on and so forth.\n\n(01:28:35):\nSo all of a sudden you're not talking about a product manager, you're talking about a product team with product engineers. So there was this thing at Atlassian where we called some engineers were more like system engineers, some were more product engineers.\n\n(01:28:49):\nIn my opinion everyone can be a product engineer. They just need to be exposed to the right user context. The right user context, what is it? It's 10 customers you know by name, you know their context, you know their problems. You can empathize with it. This empathy makes you want to act to change your product to solve their problem and you get really huge pride coming back out of it. \n\n(01:29:11):\nIt can seem counterintuitive in a company like Atlassian. 300,000 customers, right? We should build for them. Well, you can't, right? We're limited in our ability to make changes that will work for the vast majority so might as well embrace that. Embrace that we are indeed biased, that we are indeed reacting based on feelings, like wanting to help or not wanting to help or reacting strongly to what you've seen, but we are embracing that to try and build the best product possible. I've actually seen that the outcome is, so far on this product it's worked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:51):\nIf you actually think about this from the perspective of how would a startup approach this? This is exactly how a company that's just starting out would approach it. So it makes tons of sense to think of it this way. It's just people don't actually do this. It's hard to do.\n\n(01:30:04):\nThis is a segue to a question I wanted to ask. So it took probably a long time for you to show real success, real progress, real like, \"This is going to work.\" First of all how long was that period of just like, \"This is probably not going to work too. Oh wow, maybe this is going to work\"? And along the same lines, how does Atlassian slash ... What have you learned about how to protect this, Pixar people call it an ugly baby? When an idea is new they call this an ugly baby. People don't want it. It's just like, \"Get rid of this thing.\"\n\n(01:30:36):\nMan, that sounds mean to say, but that's the way they talk about it. That's the term in creativity.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:30:44):\nThat's a good one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:46):\nHow do you protect that because that's the biggest challenge I think a lot of companies have is just like, \"It's been six months. No one wants this. We're going to kill it.\" How do you protect it? So how long did it take for it to show success and what have you learned about how to protect?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:30:58):\nYeah. So basically, internal comms is everything there. The way I saw my job as, a large part as being very clear on where we were, on what we were learning on, how fast we were learning, how fast we were moving. Being super honest every step of the way, not try to make shit up and try to make it bigger than it is, more successful than it is.\n\n(01:31:18):\nOn the contrary, be very clear about what we're testing, where we're testing it. Doing that with data, doing that with personal customer stories because we all can constantly relate to the heart and to the mind. So that's what I always try to weave into comms that I then send weekly.\n\n(01:31:36):\nSo we've got this product internally called Atlas, which have a project on Atlas. People can subscribe to this project and then weekly you send a tweet-sized update about your project. I was using that as a platform to communicate internally about this product and there were actually hundreds of people who ended up subscribing to this thing.\n\n(01:31:54):\nEvery week when we were at the stage where we were trying to get the first version out to customers it was a weekly demo of the product and everything that we built. Show the momentum as much as possible. I was even saving features for one week to the next just to ... When I knew we were going to be on vacation, for example, just to have something to show this train that keeps moving, it keeps moving. You don't want to get in front of it.\n\n(01:32:17):\nBut then what I needed to do is to balance that out with all the customer side of things. So when we started to put it in front of customers then it was snippets from customer conversations. No one is going to read a research report that takes 30 minutes to read. Everyone is happy to watch a three-minute snippet with four customers talking about something. So I was using that a lot every week by posting those out there and then sharing them widely on Slack to go, \"This is what we learned. This is what this customer is facing in terms of problem with Jira. This is how we're solving it. This is them talking about it,\" that kind of stuff.\n\n(01:32:48):\nSo I was publishing that there and then sending that everywhere on Slack. Those kinds of things are what give people a sense of velocity and speed, and no one wants to fuck with a high-speed train. You don't get in front of it. That doesn't help and you're going to look bad by doing that. So basically that ended up buying us the time that we needed to get out of this, I don't know how you call it, the ugly baby phase.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:13):\nAn ugly baby phase.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:33:16):\nSo basically it helped us get out of this phase where we don't have anything to show for yet because what we're showing is based on the learnings we're trying to get and we're trying to do that with, \"Here's some numbers, here's some demos, here's some user snippets.\" Doing that every week because people can consume bite-sized content every week. They just struggle with the stuff where you come in three, four months later and go, \"This is what we have to show for.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:43):\nRight. How long was that period before it got out of this ugly baby phase for you? When did people start to get like, \"Oh wow, this might work\"?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:33:49):\nHonestly, we had something dogfooding within two months, in the hands of the first lighthouse user within five months. We iterated on the alpha for maybe six months. We then entered a beta that lasted close to a year.\n\n(01:34:06):\nSo I think at every step of the way people could see us going somewhere, and I think initially they judged, not the outcome. They judged the team a lot more than the outcome.\n\n(01:34:22):\nSo there's all this talk of founder market fit and I think really that's what you need to be teasing out, which is, is it the right thing, going after the right problems? Then if they can answer yes in ways that you haven't thought about asking consistently week over week, it's enough. I think that's where we were up until the stage where we were able to give something to customers, but the first lighthouse user was five months in. So it didn't even matter whether it looked good or not because people could see, \"Okay, that's what ... Oh, there's something there,\" right?\n\n(01:34:51):\nSo I'm not sure if there's one precise moment where it happened. However, there was this one moment where we were like, \"Okay, that's it. We're ready to go GA.\" One of the founders, Mike went, \"No, you're not. That thing is ugly. I do not want to look at it. It needs to level up with the rest of the Atlassian design standards. Our customers have expectations from us on that front. Your stuff is functional, but it's way too early.\"\n\n(01:35:19):\nSo we went and fixed it. Took us two, three months and then we were okay to go. But yeah, no, because we had point A, because we had this expectation set that it would take a while to get there and because we were able to show progress every week, we basically didn't really feel that moment where we don't know what to do with this because it's too early.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:42):\nThis design improvement phase, what I'm visualizing is you're this pirate that is invited to a nice dinner and you have to start cleaning up. You have to start looking good and become inter-society. It makes a lot of sense. \n\n(01:35:54):\nAlso, what you're describing makes me think again of this concept of, it's your job to keep the flame alive and help it spread within the organization. So you have this idea and you're just like, keep momentum going, keep the flame growing by sharing constant updates, sharing progress, make it very easy to consume with little snippets and videos. So there's a lot of great advice here.\n\n(01:36:13):\nSo timeline-wise, interestingly what I'm hearing is it basically took a year from idea to alpha, something like that. Is that roughly right?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:36:21):\nJust like seven months ... No, five months to first alpha1 customer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:26):\nOkay.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:36:27):\nWe stayed in alpha for six months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:30):\nOkay, got it. So through alpha about a year total. Many people are hearing this. On the one hand it would be like, \"Of course, Atlassian has all these resources. They're going to spend a year on this idea that who knows is going to work out. It's so easy for them.\"\n\n(01:36:43):\nI imagine there was much pain and suffering and challenge along the way that happened that makes it not so easy. Is there something you could share by just the struggle to actually make this real just as a way to wrap up conversation, go back to therapy if there's anything you want to share?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:36:58):\nYeah. Basically, it's pretty much what we talked about earlier with lots of processes that were not changed yet because we're at the very beginning of point A, and people still wanting us to chime in on the things that were important for their part of the organization where we would play a part later if we become successful.\n\n(01:37:19):\nSo none of that stuff was just solved once and for all. It was just a constant process to play with that, but I think we managed to get out of these things pretty gracefully in the end and I think we gained some level of admiration for some teams from that and some found it a bit ... It's always interesting to see someone breaking the rules and getting away with it. I think it inspired some of the other founders to try and do that, which was pretty cool to see.\n\n(01:37:46):\nIt's actually something I'd love to see more, hearing back from the customers I've been talking to about this in their company, rather than feel suffocated by the current processes and they don't feel like they can break the chains. So I'm hoping it inspires a few more teams to give it a go, really.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:38:09):\nThere's clearly more I want to learn about point A and how other companies do this incubation stuff. So this is a really good inspiration to dig deeper into those sorts of programs.\n\n(01:38:18):\nWe've covered a lot of ground. We've talked about things that have worked and haven't worked, all kinds of therapy and pain, but also things that help you succeed and build amazing products. Is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:38:32):\nYeah. I would try to balance the point I just gave, which is it's hard so someone has to try. Always feel like you can push. I'd like to balance that a bit with be careful for yourself as well and make sure that you're doing this in an environment that's ready to welcome it.\n\n(01:38:54):\nSo as I mentioned, I worked at Atlassian now for the past 10 years. Before that I used to work in banks, in heavily regulated industries, in a whole bunch of different areas where that kind of stuff was not okay. I could have tried to push, it would have not gone well at all. \n\n(01:39:15):\nSo I think I'm deeply convinced by the fact that we don't need so much top-down leadership. What we need is a lot of autonomous leaders, regardless of their position within the org, able to push for change, fighting for the right things, but you need to do that in an environment that's safe for you to do so. If it's not, I think it's okay to consider alternatives.\n\n(01:39:37):\nSo in other words, don't feel like you're trapped. Right? You only have one work life. Do it in places where you really believe you can do amazing work and surrounded by people that you're excited to work with. Otherwise, I've been there before where it's possible to become cynical by the weight of the things that are not possible and ending up doubting your own ability to do stuff really. So it's a bit of a balance of push for the right things, but also watch after yourself and if the environment is not right, it's okay to change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:09):\nThis is a really hot topic and common question in product management and I imagine other functions in product of just how much can actually change as an IC at a company. I hear all this advice about making change, changing culture, incubating stuff, innovating. How much can you actually make an impact versus, \"Nothing's going to change. I should go work somewhere else\"? Do you have any advice there? It sounds like basically you're saying there's oftentimes you have no impact on how the business and culture's going to work and you probably should go find a company like Atlassian that does learn how to incubate and innovate and think differently.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:40:44):\nYeah. This one is a ... I'm not sure how to answer that really because I've worked with, consulted, worked for close to 50 companies. Atlassian is the first company I joined where I was at home from day one, challenged in the right way, but fuck, I can really choose my battles and go after them. Things are hard, but it's okay.\n\n(01:41:09):\nSo I joined Atlassian. [inaudible 01:41:13] found the trampoline like that, but yeah, I would just go, not settle for status quo because you cannot be the only sane person in a room. At some point you will go insane. The environment will permeate on you. You are not this entity that is absolutely permeable to everything that happens around you. Everything around you will affect you and will change you as a person. I really believe that.\n\n(01:41:36):\nSo you need to surround yourself with people and environments that can help bring out the best in you, otherwise you can turn bad. I myself have been cynical in the past working in environments that were cynical and I then decided it's not me. I do not want it to be me. It was me back then. I do not want it to be me.\n\n(01:41:55):\nSo yeah, that's my only advice, which is have the courage to ask yourselves those questions because otherwise it might change you in ways you don't want to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:07):\nAmazing advice. Really important advice. With that we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:42:15):\nI am, looking forward to it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:17):\nAll right, here we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:42:23):\nYeah, the first one was a book that was recommended to me by Scott Farquhar, founder of Atlassian co-founder. Who: A Method for Hiring is basically a book about how to do the thing that I for a while was really bad at, which is try to interview to understand who's going to be a good person, not a good person to join your team.\n\n(01:42:44):\nSecond one, so that's one book about work. Two other books that are not about work. Highly recommend reading Hakim's Odyssey. It's the story of a Syrian refugee moving out of Syria, trying to move into Europe. We hear a lot of these stats and numbers about people trying to cross the Med Sea or basically become refugees in other countries and it's very easy to look at it complacently up until you meet a personal story. This personal story of Hakim that was told very beautifully by this illustrator is well worth a read on that front.\n\n(01:43:19):\nThe last one is a book that I'm not sure has been translated from French. It's called Vivre avec la Terre, To Live with the Earth and it's about how we could build a different agricultural system to the one that we have today that might have better ways to feed us into the future that doesn't require large monoculture of vegetables that may not be as sustainable.\n\n(01:43:47):\nThey managed to create a really efficient structure on very small parcels of land with a lot of species working together to control and not need the use of any pesticides and stuff like that. They've been always surrounded by teams of researchers from the, I think it's called the Inria. It's one of the French research centers, have got really amazing results, but I don't think many know that this stuff exists and that it could actually be used out there and I think that's a shame.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:14):\nI think it's the first book that sounds recommended that's only in a different language, but may not be translated.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:44:20):\nIt might be translated. I hope it is. It's pretty thick though and it's very technical. So I've read the principles bit and I would get lost in all the technical aspects of growing food, to be honest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:26):\nOkay, love it. So let's ask you your favorite interview question. What's your favorite interview question?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:44:32):\nYeah. So I struggled a lot with interviewing and I've read all the standard interview questions there is out there and I've heard them in your podcast as well. There is one that came from this book that Scott Farquhar also told me was working really well for him is when people describe an experience, you ask them the name of the person that they worked with back then. And you ask them, \"So when I call this person after our call, what do you think they're going to say about that?\"\n\n(01:45:02):\nApparently this does something and I've seen it happen where people are unable to project and invent on the spot something from the lens of another person talking about them. So they might be able to talk about, \"I did this, I did that, I did that. So when I talk ... \"Who was your boss? My boss was ... So when I ask this person, what do you think they're going to say?\" It's like, \"Ah, well actually, I was only leading a part of it and maybe you shouldn't call them because XYZ.\"\n\n(01:45:33):\nThat part makes people all of a sudden go out of this scripted version they give of themselves and become more real for a second. You get a bit of the authenticity coming out, which often is very hard to get to for me in interview questions. I've seen it happen. I find that very funny to do now because people get really uneasy for a second and then you get to something real.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45:57):\nThat is genius. Makes so much sense. Makes me wonder how I can integrate this tip into my podcast interviews. Really good tip. Next question, do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:46:08):\nYeah, it's got nothing with tech, nothing to do with tech. I'm kite surfing a lot at the moment and I came across hydrofoils, which is basically these things where there's an airplane underneath you on a mast which is connected to a board. You're on the board with your kite and you basically just fly over the water.\n\n(01:46:32):\nThat invention is just brilliant. It's relatively easy to learn and I can spend basically, parts of my weekend flying over water in as much as a breeze of wind because there's absolutely zero friction between the board and the water. So that's, technically speaking I think is genius the way they created that and inspiring themselves from airplanes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):\nIs that the thing that Zuck was riding with his sunscreen with the flag or is that something else? I don't know if you saw that photo. Don't worry about it.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:47:00):\nNo, I didn't see that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:01):\nI like that you say it's relatively easy to learn even though there's a kite on you pulling you in the water on this thing that's above the water. I don't know if I believe you.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:47:11):\nYeah. I mean, there's sports and crafts that are difficult to learn. This one you can get comfortable in 18 months to two years, which is really, really short. It could be a sport that you would have done before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:24):\nJust a couple of years. Okay. I like your bar for ... I'm going to ask a question along these lines, but before we get there, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful in work or in life, maybe share with friends and family?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:47:37):\nI've got two, one for work and one for everything in life. The one for work is initially a quote from Obama. I can't remember the exact quote. I'm going to paraphrase, but let's keep it about the work. So there's going to be moments in your career where you don't feel valued and you wonder, \"Am I doing the right thing? Am I being recognized? Am I valued? Am I at the right place?\" Whenever that happens, a lot of parasitic thoughts may come in. You may face imposter syndrome and stuff like that. Happens to me super regularly. \n\n(01:48:09):\nWhenever that happens, what I do is I remind myself, \"Keep it about the work,\" because as long as you make it about the work there's always work to be done and there's always a path that emerges from that work. It's a bit of the same of this, you've got this thing in yoga where once you're committed good things will happen. Well, that's exactly what I've seen and that's helped me every time. I reread this quote whenever I'm in these moments of turmoil around me.\n\n(01:48:37):\nNow when I face those moments I also remind myself of the other one, which I invented, but I don't think I'm the only one who has invented that one, which is, \"Remember that in 100 years we'll all be dead and forgotten. So don't take yourself too seriously. You're not that important. You're probably not that important, as important as you think for the people that you are arguing with.\"\n\n(01:49:01):\nThat's also the beauty in all things, which is it has an end. In the end it probably doesn't matter so might as well give it your best shot. That's what the existentialists back in France many generations ago were talking about. This point is close to Albert Camus' thesis, right? \"If it doesn't make sense might as well go for it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:24):\nReally good points, really good lessons, really good mottos. Final question, you were ranked number four worldwide in a form of free diving. First of all, can you briefly describe what is free diving and then can you share one thing that might surprise someone about the sport and the skill?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:49:43):\nYeah. So yes, that's my claim to fame. I was ranked number four in basically, the distance you can swim in a swimming pool without fins with 167 meters, which is 550 feet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:49:57):\nAnd underwater?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:49:59):\nUnderwater breaststroke. I went further with the monofin, the thing you see back there, but breaststroke was one meter away from the French record and ranking number four worldwide that year. The one I'm most proud of is I actually went to 300 feet underwater deep, came back in one piece and I really enjoyed the whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:20):\n300 feet. That's like-\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:50:23):\n92 meters.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:50:25):\nOh, geez. I'm trying to imagine what that is like compared to a Statue of Liberty or something like that, but I'll look that up later.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:50:38):\nI look at buildings one. Buildings can be as little as 20, 30 meters and can go super higher, but 90 meters is pretty high, yeah. Last time I looked at a building like that, I can't remember which one it was, but it's pretty high. So it's take one breath, go down, touch the bottom plate on the rope and then come back up.\n\n(01:50:54):\nOne thing that may surprise people with this is that everyone is much more gifted at it than they think. So I used to give courses on the weekend for free diving and most people when I ask them, \"Hey, how long do you think you can be underwater?\" And they tell me something like 30 seconds, maybe a minute. \"How deep you think can you go? Ah, maybe five meters.\"\n\n(01:51:15):\nAt the end of the weekend most people were able to hold their breath for two to three minutes and to go to 20 meters deep. So it's one of those things where it looks absolutely impressive and crazy and amazing and in fact we're naturally gifted to it. There's a lot of physiological changes that happen when we dive that make it possible, but I think it's fascinating how little we know about our bodies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:51:38):\nI'm looking up what is 300 feet compared to real-life objects on perplexity. So what is 300 feet compared to real-life objects? Here we go, 300 feet. The length of a football field. Okay, yeah. I should have realized that. Close to the length of a Boeing 737.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:52:00):\nYeah. You need to look at it this way to get some perspective. \n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:01):\nYeah, and a football field-\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:52:01):\nYou go underwater in that-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:10):\n... Jesus Christ. Oh, my God. But I love your advice that people can do much better at the skill than they think.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:52:14):\nYeah. Everyone from kids to adults are really amazing at it actually.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:52:20):\nTanguy, we've covered so much ground. I think this is going to help a lot of people that are trying to get better at free diving, but also at building zero to one within large companies. I am so thankful that you made time for this and that you shared some into this real talk and as you called it, therapy.\n\n(01:52:37):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, maybe follow up on some of the stuff you talked about and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:52:44):\nYeah, so you can find me on LinkedIn if you know how to ... You don't need to know how to pronounce my name. You just need to know how to write it. I'm not super active on social media to be honest. I'm very much in the trenches building this product so I don't do much in terms of networking to be fair, but if you are using this product for example, and you have ideas for how we can improve it for you or you'd like to share some stories about how that's helped you or how it's not helping you, I'd love to connect because I spend a large part of my days talking to users, responding to support tickets and stuff like that. So, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:20):\nAmazing. Tanguy, thank you so much for being here.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:53:24):\nThank you, Lenny. Honestly, it's been amazing and I hope some of my gibberish is useful to people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:31):\nDefinitely not gibberish. I think it's going to help a lot of people. With that, I'll let you go. Bye, everyone.\n\nTanguy Crusson (01:53:37):\nBye-bye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:53:39):\nThank you so much for listening.

I'm the CEO of Late Checkout, an agency, a studio, a fund where we build some of the most popular internet communities. I'm also an advisor to Reddit.\n\nSahil Bloom (00:14):\nI'm Sahil Bloom. I'm an investor, creator, entrepreneur, writer. I also gave up a grand slam on ESPN in 2012, and I am still waiting for it to land. What is The Room Where it Happens? The Room Where it Happens is the place where the insights are generated. This is the place where the conversations happen, where ideas are batted around, debated, fought over. This is where things actually get created, where you start to have those seeds that are planted and where things are really built. That is the room. It's traditionally been closed. We're opening the door to it. We want you to be here with us as that happens.\n\nGreg Isenberg (00:52):\nIt's a place where we could have honest conversations about how hard startups are, what's interesting to us, how we can collaborate, how we can build businesses together and what the next big thing is. That's what The Room Where it Happens is.\n\nSahil Bloom (01:09):\nIf this podcast were available five years ago for me, I think I would've meaningfully accelerated the trajectory of my own life and my career. And part of that would've been the insights generated. The things I learned from actually listening to people. But the biggest part of it would've been the people I met. The relationships I built with other community members with the hosts, with the guests. That is what is the force multiplier for your career, those networks, how that compounds over time, just as well as any financial investment. That is what I would've gotten out of it.\n\nGreg Isenberg (01:39):\nI probably would've met my co-founder. I probably would've met my early teammates. I probably would've found community. I would be 25 times more informed and 50 times more wealthy. That would've just supercharged my career.\n\nSahil Bloom (01:58):\nGreg and I met in The Room Where it Happens. We met through the confluence of a bunch of chance events. We were in a group text thread together with a handful of friends and became as close as we are today because of that. It was The Room Where it Happens. All of these ideas were being generated and that was what sparked us, originally, to start thinking about this and thinking about how we could scale this so that more of you could be a part of what we had experienced and what we had benefited from.\n\nGreg Isenberg (02:27):\nThe moment that changed my mind about business and opportunity was the first time I ever went to Silicon Valley. I was reading up about all these entrepreneurs, all these investors on places like TechCrunch. And I landed and I expected them to be incredibly great, so much different from you and I. And I started having conversations with them and I realized they weren't smarter than us. They might have had better connections, more money, gone to better schools, but that was it. That was when I realized I could do anything.\n\nSahil Bloom (03:03):\nSo a moment that changed my mind about all of this, about business, opportunity, everything, I got invited by a mentor to go to a fundraiser event. I was 24. I was fresh out of school, very green. And I went to this event. There were all these amazing people there, really impressive people that I was, frankly, quite intimidated by. And I was in these conversations with them and just very quickly realized that there was nothing different about them versus me, but they were in these rooms constantly. They were around different, interesting people. They were having these conversations and that was what was making them different. They were able to generate these insights because they were in these room. And that was the moment I realized I had to just find a way to be in those rooms.\n\nGreg Isenberg (03:49):\nThe gap between what people think business is and what actually happens is what Scott Belsky calls the messy middle. Think of The Social Network, the movie. Mark Zuckerberg starts Facebook and then all of a sudden it's massive. It's this romantic idea that people have about startups and entrepreneurship. In reality, the messy middle, the time in between starting and the outcome is 99% of the process of business and startups and entrepreneurship. And I actually find that messy middle to be the most amount of fun. It's when you rise up, it's when you fall down, it's when you zig and it's when you zag.\n\nSahil Bloom (04:35):\nSo in my mind, the biggest gap between what people think business is versus what it really is, is that aspect of just crawling through the river of shit that exists between where you start and where you finish. It's like The Shawshank Redemption. You got to just go through that period. And to me, that's getting up every day and just getting punched in the gut over and over and over again, and being willing to get up and continue to push through and continue to work with your team, solicit feedback, work with others and just get through it. But that willingness to get punched in the face, to get knocked down and to get back up, no one talks about that. Everyone talks about the successes. You love the glamor you love when someone rings the bell at the New York Stock Exchange, when they IPO, they're billionaire, it's great.\n\n(05:23):\nNo one talks about that middle time when you're just getting punched over and over and over again. What frustrates me most about the current state of podcasts is just that it's one sided. It all ends as soon as you finish the conversation during the interview. It's an interview, you talk to someone, you ask them questions and then it ends and that's it. That's all you get from them. And they might have said something amazing that intrigued you, that sparked your interest. You want to follow up, you want to dig deeper, but that's it. That's all you get and it's over. And so when I think about the opportunity that exists, it's changing that. Fundamentally flipping it on its head, making it a conversation, following up, digging deeper, going further with all the insights. That's how we take this entire thing to a whole new level.\n\nGreg Isenberg (06:08):\nI believe the current state of podcasting sucks. A few people have microphones and it's just not fair. What if you allowed a bunch of people to have microphones so they could connect, so they can collaborate so that they can build community. And that's what we're trying to do with The Room Where it Happens. Yes, we're in the room and we have some microphones, but we're also inviting you in. We want you to ask questions. We want to collaborate with you. We want to build businesses with you. And that's why I wanted to create a new, more modern way of podcasting. What am I most excited about with this show and community?\n\nSahil Bloom (06:46):\nIt has to be seeing the amazing things that come out of this community. It has to be seeing all of you going off and having these great experiences, having new insights that come from it, starting new things, failing, succeeding, all of that. And what it's going to create out in the world is what I'm most excited about. We get to sit here, have conversations. We get to hang out with friends, talk to some amazing guests, but the thing that's going to be best is when we see you take that and run with it 100 times over to create something much bigger than what we are doing here.\n\nGreg Isenberg (07:20):\nWatching where you are today and where you're going to be tomorrow and where you're going to be a week from now, a month, a year, 10 years. We're in this for the long game. And what excites me about... I mean, the reason why I got into community was because I love seeing people progress, advance, do big things. And I know that being a part of The Room Where it Happens, good things will happen to you.\n\nSahil Bloom (07:47):\nSo how are we going to ensure this is different than everything else out there? Two ways. Number one, alcohol. We're going to get everyone really drunk with us and it's going to be fun and we're going to get them loose. Because they're not going to be having the same conversation they're having on to every single other podcast, because they're going to be sitting there drinking with us and it's going to be fun. So that's number one. Number two, we want to learn from you. We want to get better at this. We're in it for the long game. This isn't one episode, this isn't one season. We're going to be doing it. So when you're hearing things, if you want us to improve on stuff, if you have ideas, episodes, be a part of it with us, tell us, message us. You're in the Discord, be there with us, help us improve as we grow, and we'll make sure that it is the best thing that we can possibly create.\n\nGreg Isenberg (08:28):\nAnd you're going to keep us on us. You're going to be in our Discord. You're going to be in our community. And if anything feels not authentic, not great, we're in this together, and we want to make this as authentic as possible."
