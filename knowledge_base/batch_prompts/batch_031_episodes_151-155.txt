There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead\n\nLenny (00:00:22):\nOver his 14-year career at Google.

Your writing has had so much influence on so many people, including myself. If nothing else, you've led to many donuts being purchased by tech companies over the years. So thanks for being here.\n\nKen Norton (00:02:58):\nThank you and thanks for having me. The feeling's mutual. Obviously a big fan of your work and all the things you've done for the community and this podcast, which has been fantastic. So humbled and excited to be here. Yes, I do think that I'm at least maybe partially responsible for at least a lot of consumption of donuts over these years.\n\nLenny (00:03:18):\nAre you tired of people asking you about donuts?\n\nKen Norton (00:03:21):\nI'll never get tired of it. Well, back when we met with people in person, people would bring me donuts, and I never got tired of it, nor did any of the people that I worked with who got to eat those donuts get tired of it. So, no, no, I'll never get tired of donuts.\n\nLenny (00:03:37):\nSomeone on Twitter asked what's a digital equivalent of bringing the donuts now that we're in a remote world. Do you have any advice on that?\n\nKen Norton (00:03:45):\nThat's a great question. I'm not even sure if the physical equivalent of donuts is donuts. I mean when I came up with that, I think it was really to be a metaphor around being a servant leader, bringing whatever needs to be done, filling the white space, filling the gaps, whatever needed to happen. So it doesn't always have to be donuts.\n\n(00:04:07):\nI did put that question out to some of the readers in my newsletter a while ago, maybe earlier in the pandemic, and got a lot of really interesting ideas. Maybe that was at a place where people had a little bit more patience for happy hours over Zoom and stuff like that. Maybe that patient set is worn out. The idea that I love the most was actual donuts. There was a PM who got DoorDash codes and found the best local donut place for each of the people on the team and basically sent them a code and said, \"Click here and order the donuts to come to your house whenever you want them.\" So maybe at least partially the digital equivalent of donuts might be actual donuts.\n\nLenny (00:04:40):\nDecentralized donuts.\n\nKen Norton (00:04:42):\nDecentralized donuts, on the blockchain.\n\nLenny (00:04:46):\nOh boy, let's not go there.\n\nKen Norton (00:04:48):\nI don't know what that is.\n\nLenny (00:04:50):\nSo I was perusing your career path ahead of this chat. You had this pretty wild career. You were an engineer initially, and then you were CTO at a part of NBC. Then you're a founder. Then you spent 14 years at Google working on products that folks may have heard of, like Google Docs and Google Calendar and Google Maps. You've also done a bunch of writing. Then more recently, you've become a full-time executive coach focusing on product people.\n\n(00:05:17):\nI have so many questions I'd love to ask you about your career and learnings along the way, and the writing. But I'd actually like to spend most of our time talking about the coaching and things that you've learned through that experience. And so, I have a couple questions just off the bat. What does an executive coach actually do? What kinds of things are you helping people with? What does a session look like? Then, two, just how did you decide you wanted to be a coach full time after leaving Google?\n\nKen Norton (00:05:40):\nYeah, that's a great question. I think coaching does mean a lot of different things. I mean it depends on who you talk to. It is a little bit of who you are, your style, your approach. Some people are calling themselves coaches, doing more mentoring, more advice. Other people are maybe more like me, more peer coaching.\n\n(00:06:01):\nTo me, I see executive coaching as a partnership or creative partnership. It's all about helping my client reach their goals, their potential, whatever that means to them. So an important thing about coaching is the definition of success does belong to the client. I don't have an agenda. I don't have a set of things I'm trying to share, teach, learn. It really is fundamentally up to them, which means every client is completely different. They have different sense of where they want to go. Different barriers that might be standing in their way.\n\n(00:06:35):\nMy coaching practice, I coach the whole person. So there is no restriction on what we might talk on, what we might work on together. It's not limited to product. It's not even limited to work or even leadership. It's wherever they want to go, whatever change, transformation means to them.\n\n(00:06:52):\nAs coaches, we bring a bunch of tools to the conversation. The most important ones, honestly, are probably listening and curiosity, intuition, open-mindedness, really there to help challenge them to see things in different ways, help them tap into their imagination, figure out when there might be underlying beliefs, help them connect dots that need to be connected, help them disconnect things that feel connected. There's a lot of exploration to it.\n\n(00:07:20):\nIt's very jazz-like. My love of jazz has been shared before, but there is an improvisation to it. What coaching is really powerful is you may not necessarily know where you're going when you start and you follow wherever there is meaning and change for that individual, wherever is they want to go.\n\n(00:07:38):\nThe question around what brought me into it was actually interesting. I, honestly working with my own executive coach, started to figure out what it is that mattered to me, what I liked, what my values were, what my purpose was, started to unpack that I love deeply connecting with people and I love helping people change and grow.\n\n(00:08:01):\nThe moments when I had the opportunity to do that as a manager, as a product leader were the most fulfilling parts of my career. And so, I started to unpack that and figure out what would it look like if that was what I did.\n\n(00:08:15):\nThe other part of the journey was, for several years at Google, I worked at GV. It's Google Ventures, Google's venture capital arm. I had the opportunity to work with founders and product leaders in the portfolio. I started to simultaneously recognize the shortcomings of giving advice, because it seemed like, well, I can meet with these folks, I could tell them what I did, I could tell them what Google did, and that'll answer all their questions.\n\n(00:08:41):\nYou start to realize advice is not as powerful as you might think it is. It's a little bit like cotton candy. Doesn't have a lot of nutrition. You get a nice sugar high. You feel great, both sides feel happy, but then a couple weeks later, a couple months later, nothing's really changed.\n\n(00:08:57):\nThat's because it doesn't often confront the real problem. It often isn't relevant. Like what worked for us at Google may not have worked anywhere else. It may not even have worked at Google for all I know. I feel like there were years at Google where all we were doing was making things worse by showing up and we should just all have gone sat on a beach somewhere, and the company would've grown even faster. So who knows?\n\n(00:09:20):\nI mean so it was these just twin pillars of wanting to figure out where I could do what I like the most, and then also recognizing that where growth comes from is less around advice and telling people what to do and more about helping them figure out their own path, their own way. Then that ultimately you brought me into, hey, I want to do this full time, and that's what I've been doing ever since.\n\nLenny (00:09:46):\nWhen do you find people come to you to get advice and coaching? What kind of clients do you find you end up working with?\n\nKen Norton (00:09:53):\nThat's a great question. Generally speaking, I work with senior product leaders, however you want to define that. Typically, these are chief product officers, VPs of product at startups, largely director level and above at bigger tech companies, some CEOs, other C-level execs in there. I think really anyone that considers themselves in a product leadership role.\n\n(00:10:15):\nOften they come to me because there's a career milestone or a crossroads, and it could be that they now find themselves in the position of being a CPO for the first time. Maybe there's a new industry change, or they've gone from a big company to a startup and a have this sense of what got me here isn't going to get me there. That's oftentimes when they reach out for coaching.\n\n(00:10:41):\nI think my clients are also very introspective and surrounded by great mentors and advisors and have all sorts of people in their life who can help them, but are realizing that a lot of the work is going to be internal work that's going to get them to the next level. And so, this transformation is going to be just as much what I need to do as who I am. That's often when people come to me.\n\nLenny (00:11:08):\nYou said that the way you coach is about the whole person. I'm curious ... I don't know if there's an answer to this, but when people come to get help and coaching, how much of their blocks, I guess, are rooted in their regular life versus skills, technical skills, and more like the PME, product leadership side, if that makes sense?\n\nKen Norton (00:11:31):\nYeah, I think ... Well, let me maybe try to illustrate this with an example from my life right now. Indulge me, I'm going to go a little bit left field here, but I promise [inaudible 00:11:45].\n\nLenny (00:11:45):\nLet's do it.\n\nKen Norton (00:11:46):\nSo we are teaching our 16-year-old son how to drive. So he just got his driver's permit. Do you remember when you learned how to drive, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:11:56):\nI do. Yup.\n\nKen Norton (00:11:58):\nYeah. Yeah. So it's scary. I don't know if you know how your parents might have felt, but-\n\nLenny (00:12:04):\nNope, [inaudible 00:12:06].\n\nKen Norton (00:12:06):\n... [inaudible 00:12:06] on the other side of it. It's a whole new journey. Look, he's a smart kid. He's going to do great. But it helped me actually think back to when I learned how to drive. Actually, what I think is maybe a little bit more important here is before you learn to drive. And so, if you think about it as a ... When you're a kid, cars just go places. You get strapped in and you just wait and you get impatient. Then eventually you go somewhere. You're not even consciously aware of the concept of driving. Just cars just happen and you're not even aware of it.\n\n(00:12:41):\nAs you get a little bit older, you start to become curious. You start to figure out, oh, that wheel has something to do with it. You turn the wheel. Maybe you start to understand there's pedals. But it also just seems really simple. Just like you get in the car and you drive it and you go somewhere. Maybe as you get older, you end up maybe even being a little bit of a smart Alec about how easy it looks and you start talking to your parents about, like, \"It doesn't look hard. I can do this.\"\n\n(00:13:07):\nNow suddenly you're behind the wheel of the car. This is what my son is doing. Wow. Is it different than you thought it was going to be? Is it way more complicated? You have to remember check your mirrors. You've got to look before you turn. You didn't even know what that sign meant. You didn't know what those stripes meant. It is just overloading with complication and your internal mindset for confronting this challenge is not going to suit you the way you used to approach the world.\n\n(00:13:44):\nMaybe to put it in product leadership, product terms, everyone around you has got some real pithy advice about the things you're forgetting to do. It's like, \"Hey, don't forget to check your mirror.\" Everyone's got a framework. It's like, \"Ah, do you know about the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?\" \"Wait, what's the 10:00 and 2:00 framework?\" \"Oh, you just put your left hand on the 10:00, your right hand on the 2:00. That's the only thing you're missing. Here's a great medium post about that.\" Then you're like, \"This is a problem is I have not adapted to the complexity of the world around me.\"\n\n(00:14:19):\nAnd so, there is this sense that what is interesting about driving is the world hasn't gotten any more complex. Driving's always been driving. But now your place in the world has shifted such that the internal meaning-making and self-complexity that is required requires a complete reboot of the internal operating system in order to allow you to thrive there.\n\n(00:14:41):\nAnd so, when you talk about this question of how much of this is skills, how much of this is tactics, how much of this is learning versus how much is internal growth, the answer is it's both, but the shift that is required is very much around how your inner self can make meaning and respond to the demands of the world around you so that you can succeed and thrive in this mindset shift that happens.\n\n(00:15:09):\nThe skills matter, but by this point, you're beyond the place where you've learned the skills. There's mastering the skills, but there is this sense of what developmental psychologists call self-complexity, the ability to respond and adapt to that.\n\n(00:15:24):\nAnd so, I think we go through a lot of those shifts in our career. The driving example is simple. Actually, probably too simple, because the world is actually getting more complex for those of us that work in product. I mean every day something changes. It forces us to respond and adapt. So there aren't even rules of the road in product.\n\n(00:15:42):\nBut I think this is what we're talking about, this question of the internal operating system I develop my ability to restructure it such that I can succeed given the demands that have been placed upon me.\n\nLenny (00:15:57):\nWhat an amazing analogy. Totally hits home in a good and bad way. It's a really good segue to something I wanted to chat about, something that we talked about before the recording, which is what you're finding to be one of the bigger unlocks for your clients. It's also a concept that you've been spending a lot of time refining and you're finding is helping people shift, and specifically shift their leadership mindset. And so, I'd love to just hear you talk through your thinking there.\n\nKen Norton (00:16:24):\nYeah, it does sort lead into this. Maybe another analogy that might work for your listeners, if you think about product management, your career arc and where you are challenged from a mindset perspective, in some ways it does feel like the early part of your career. You're learning to play a video game. Hopefully there's a tutorial. Your first job is learning the ropes, somebody's teaching you. You maybe have managers that are giving you simple little missions that you can succeed at and if you fail, the consequences aren't bad.\n\n(00:17:03):\nIt does feel like a little bit ... And I felt this way, and I talked to a lot of people earlier in their career. It does feel like you're trying to learn the rules of the game, trying to figure out the physics. You want to run up the score.\n\n(00:17:15):\nYou get better at playing the game. You fail, but you start to develop some confidence that when you fail, you'll learn from it. You'll get better. You get really good at the game. You get promoted, you get rewarded, you unlock new levels, teach other people how to play the game. You start to feel really awesome about yourself.\n\n(00:17:32):\nBut then suddenly you're put in a place where you realize that the rules of the game aren't so black and white. Maybe there's a long delay now between when you get to see what you did and the score of it. Things start to behave in unexpected ways. The physics start to get weird. You're on a level where you're floating. I don't know what the right metaphor is here.\n\n(00:17:52):\nBut you start to recognize that there's been this huge change. The most frightening part about it is you look around and everyone is looking at you like you're the designer of the game, and you thought you were playing. That's often what it feels like when you move into a leadership role, to come back to this sense of what got me here is not going to get me there.\n\n(00:18:17):\nI work with a lot of leaders and sometimes that's come with a pretty significant cost, this juxtaposition, maybe your happiness, your health, your marriage. There's been this existential crisis of I don't know if I love this anymore. Maybe it leads to burnout. Maybe it's not even that dire. It's just a sense of, well, I'm looking around and I need to be something. I need to unlock something else to continue on this path. There is a sense of stuckness that comes from that.\n\n(00:18:45):\nWhat I've come to realize is this is the precipice of, I think, this pretty fundamental concept in leadership. I'm not the originator of this, so this has come up again and again and again. It's not new. It's going to sound familiar. It's like the flood myth from Gilgamesh showing up in all this oral histories of the world. It's not new.\n\n(00:19:10):\nConscious Leadership Group, an organization that I'm big fan of, they call it above the line versus below the line. Brene Brown calls it daring versus armored leadership, sage versus warrior. Even in the world of sports, there's playing to win versus playing not to lose. It's this concept that's come up again and again. Leadership Circle calls it creative versus reactive, and that's the term I'm going to use. I like that.\n\n(00:19:35):\nHere's the distinction. Very simple. Are you responding to the world from a place of fear, where you see problems and threats, you want to be right, you want to be liked, you're defensive as an inward approach, or are you responding to the world from a place of openness, possibility, curiosity, passion, growth, purpose? Very simple concept. Pretty much everyone understands what I mean. It makes sense.\n\n(00:20:11):\nEveryone also then immediately says a couple of different things. \"That sounds amazing. I'd rather have that,\" or, \"Here are moments when I've felt that,\" but that's usually followed up by a couple of questions. \"I don't know if that works. It doesn't sound very effective. Is it possible?\" Then how do you that?\n\n(00:20:38):\nThe effective part is actually a question we can answer, which is, yes, it is more effective. Bob Anderson, Bill Adams are two management scientists who've written extensively, done a whole bunch of research, and they have looked at every possible dimension you can imagine of success, both leadership capability, they've looked at revenue, brand, profitability, everything, and it's shown, yes, this creative form of leadership is in every possible way positively correlated with success and reactive leadership is negatively correlated. So, yes, it works yet.\n\n(00:21:17):\nYet, according to their research, some 75% of leaders are primarily operating reactively. So most leaders are operating from a place of fear, reacting, seeing problems, and threats. That's because that other question of how do you do it is such a hard one to answer. It's not an easy thing that you flip the switch of. It goes back to this notion of redesigning that internal operating system, so how you confront the world, what underlying belief systems and assumptions you have that are causing you to operate from that place.\n\nLenny (00:21:55):\nCan I ask you a quick question? Just to clarify the two sides, what's a sign that you're in the reactive side of things? I think one thing you said is you're worrying a lot about how people think about you and make sure that they like you. Is there anything else that's going to tell a listener, \"Oh, maybe I'm falling into this trap\"?\n\nKen Norton (00:22:13):\nYeah, you've nailed it, which is that fear, like operating from a place of anxiety. There are different ways, depending on our mindsets, our approaches. I like the word postures because it seems to click different ways that we retreat into this reactive mode. Fear and anxiety is the way. That's how you know. You're just like, \"Ugh, I'm below the line.\" I'm just like I'm seeing problems. I'm seeing threats.\n\n(00:22:43):\nOur brains are hardwired to do that, so it's not like that's wrong. These are brains that learn to do that, I don't know, on the tundra being chased by wild animals. So this is our normal way of being. There might be different desires and needs that force you to operate that way. We think there's really three of these postures.\n\n(00:23:11):\nAnybody is probably more than one of them, so this is not pathologizing. This isn't putting you in a box. But probably one of these will resonate more than the others. Wanting to be approved, wanting to be loved, wanting other people to like you. This was me in my early part of my career.\n\nLenny (00:23:28):\nSame.\n\nKen Norton (00:23:29):\nYeah. So you're kind of like the heart type. It's sometimes called move toward other people. A lot of that came from my environment. I was coming up with product management. No one necessarily knew what the job even was. I had no authority and most people could just ignore me if they wanted to. And so, I had to meet other people's expectations, please them, want to be accepted by them, seek their approval. It was this what we call a complying approach.\n\n(00:23:58):\nHere, this is why this is so vexing is it actually worked really well. It was pretty effective. Other people liked working with me. I listened to them and I considered everyone's needs and made sure everyone felt heard. But there came a point where I gave away so much power that it was hurting me when it came to purpose and execution and decisiveness.\n\n(00:24:22):\nAnd so, again, these aren't bad. There's usually underlying tendencies that are very good. It just starts to have a cost as you become more senior. It's like the gears start to grind to a halt a little bit.\n\n(00:24:35):\nAnother way is more of a needing to be right head type, protecting one's own ideas, sometimes called a move away from type, distance, arrogance, criticism, retreating into your own ideas and head. Then the other will not be a surprise, is the more controlling, my way or the highway, autocratic will move against wanting to win, wanting to be number one, wanting to excel, wanting dominance, wanting control, this would be another tendency.\n\n(00:25:10):\nOften one of those feels natural to you and another one feels just so incredibly distasteful that you can't imagine possibly operating that way. This goes into the underlying beliefs part. If you had told me early in my career, when you saw me being passive and people-pleasing like that, \"You've just got to stop caring what other people think, Ken. You've got to be more pushy.\"\n\n(00:25:41):\nPeople did say that to me. That was pretty common probably in my performance review. It was very common. Even people who worked for me were like, \"You need to push back.\" My only archetype for doing that was the autocratic, controlling type. I was like, \"I don't want to be like that. That guy's a jerk. That's a fascist. I don't want to be a fascist. I do care about other people.\"\n\n(00:26:04):\nAnd so, many of our examples and archetypes are these equally ineffective reactive ways of being. And so, no wonder I didn't want to be like that, because that's also not very effective either. But there was a sense for me of redefining ... This is where coaching is powerful is this what are the underlying assumptions and beliefs that you have that are causing you to fall back on some of these fundamental ways of operating and not let go of them?\n\n(00:26:35):\nBecause the answer for me wasn't stop caring about other people. I wasn't going to do that. That's a value of mine. It's part of who I am. But take the caring about other people, the empathy, the connection, and direct it in a more creative way where you're operating now from a place of purpose and vision and not reacting and protecting and defending and wanting to be.\n\n(00:26:56):\nFor me, the key to that was letting go of needing to be liked and redefining it as an admiration that takes place over time. So rather than I want to leave this room with everyone liking me, I started to realize I want to be the type of leader where, a decade later, people say, \"I would work with that guy again in a heartbeat.\" That was part of the unlock for me.\n\n(00:27:25):\nAgain, I care about other people. That's a natural gift that underlines it. But it's a redefinition of how that serves me, if that makes sense.\n\nLenny (00:27:34):\nSay someone's in that first bucket ... And I was definitely in that first bucket. I still want people to like me and I still probably have flaws there. But say you're a PM and you're like, \"Oh, man. That's exactly how I am acting right now.\" It sounds like is the core of it just a mindset shift, going from I need people to like me to what you just talked about of, okay, I'm going to shift to I just want them to respect me over time? Is that the core of it? I know it's probably not that easy, but how should someone behave during that bucket right now?\n\nKen Norton (00:28:03):\nYeah. It sounds easy, right? This is part of what's hard about this, is it always sounds easy when you describe it, having gone through the journey. It's sort of like talk to somebody on the summit of Mount Everest and they'll be like, \"Yeah. Well, I could just climb this mountain. That's how I got here.\" You're like, \"Okay, wait, that's not that easy.\" Again, it is very individualized.\n\n(00:28:21):\nI think there's an appreciation that you have to understand what is holding you back. This is a lot of the work that I'll do with my clients is what is those underlying expectations? What are these underlying beliefs?\n\n(00:28:40):\nI Believe that my style was incompatible with being the leader. I would've said I can't be a CEO because I'm not tough enough. I'm not strong enough. I'm not commanding enough. I can't command a room. It's like, okay, what is the underlying belief I'm making about what leadership is there? There's an archetype that I have in my mind that is incompatible with this this way.\n\n(00:29:10):\nAnd so, there's a need to confront that. Okay, what makes you believe the only type of leader is the leader that orders people around? Maybe that's all I've ever seen. Maybe I don't believe it's possible to be another type of leader. Maybe there's an inner critic that is convincing me that that's not who I am, because a part of it is redefinition of what does leadership need for you, for you authentically? What would it be like, in my case, to lead with purpose and be decisive and lead with vision and to have other people felt like they're being brought along and listened to and participated and create safe spaces for other people? That was the question there.\n\n(00:29:47):\nIt took people challenging my point of view. It took working with a coach, asking me questions, forcing me to see places I'd made connections, that the connections don't really need to be made. There's a lot of instruments and tools we work with in coaching. There's 360-degree assessments that are very helpful here that will start to help you understand, hey, here are places where you're operating actively. Here are places where you're operating really creatively, because, by the way, most people are partially somewhere in that journey. It's a developmental process.\n\n(00:30:17):\nAnd to start to be able to get the feedback, the dopamine hit of seeing when I do it this way, actually it's more effective and it doesn't cost me as much. I'm happier and I'm enjoying it, I'm seeing that it's working, is oftentimes a big part of this because there is this belief that it won't work. The number of times when I'm with a client in coaching and say, \"Well, what if you did do that?\" and they go, \"It just won't work.\" You realize that there is this wiring in there that needs ... And this is what I talk about, this operating system that needs to be rejiggered to start to make sense of what if it did and how might you know.\n\nLenny (00:30:55):\nThe point you just made about how you can realize that you can be successful in a lot of different ways and you don't have to be this one archetype of a leader really resonates with my experience. I actually had an executive coach for a few months, and that was probably the biggest unlock for me. We did the strengths exercise, which a lot of people do. The main thing that she helped me see is you can do all the things that you want to do through the lens of the strengths that you have and not have to force yourself to be good at these other things, because there's many ways to accomplish the same outcomes.\n\nKen Norton (00:31:29):\nThat's exactly right. Then once you start to understand that, you start to develop a better way of finding the right place, the right environment, the right role. When we began the conversation, you asked me what brought me into executive coaching. I would feel these ... I would describe it as flying too close to the sun in my career, where I would have a team. I'd be managing a small team. I would love it. I would enjoy it. Then suddenly my team would grow.\n\n(00:31:57):\nI'd become more senior than I felt comfortable being. Then I felt like I wasn't getting to do the \"real\" work anymore. Then I would be just completely disheveled and dissatisfied. Then I'd go try to go find a smaller team or even stop being a manager. It was a very meandering, reactive path. It was like every so often I was catching a wave, and I knew what it felt like to be on the wave, but I didn't know what the characteristics of the wave were.\n\n(00:32:23):\nThen through coaching, I was like I love connecting with other people. I like helping people grow. I like helping challenge people. I like helping. Then I was like what are those parts? What if I unpack those? Oh, that's why I loved managing that team of five because I got to do a lot of it. That's why I hated managing a team of 35 because there's no time for it.\n\n(00:32:44):\nThen you start to say, okay, well, what if rather than just randomly meandering through my career, I actually elevated needing to connect, wanting to be helpful? Then you're like what would it be like if I wanted the helping professions? It's just a reframing of move through your career in a way that seems externally to fit some definition of success and to start to define that internally.\n\n(00:33:11):\nThat is the very definition of the reactive versus creative mindset. Reactive, allowing the world to set the expectations and try to meet them versus tap into what your real, true sense of purpose and vision is. Then use that to navigate the world.\n\nLenny (00:33:28):\nIt's interesting that so much of this is just mindset. It's not like learning a new skill as a leader or a product manager. It's just seeing yourself in the world differently. All of a sudden you unlock your career. Is that what you find?\n\nKen Norton (00:33:40):\nAbsolutely. That's why I think so much of the focus on the skills, the frameworks, it can be limited as you develop these capabilities, because it's inner work. Where we're talking about is this is all me.\n\n(00:33:57):\nNow that's empowering. There's empowerment to be able to say I want to change something and it doesn't involve a whole bunch of other people convincing and persuading them, getting into an executive ... This is all me. But it also, in some ways, makes it harder because it is all you. In coaching, it's all about you. It's all about that. Who am I and what matters to me? What underlying belief systems, inner voices are challenging me in ways that I want to be challenged? What is my unique ...\n\n(00:34:31):\nI love the word authenticity. It's, like you were just talking about, like what is my authentic way to lead, and then how do I center that rather than trying to fit into someone else's definition of what leadership might be?\n\n(00:34:43):\nYou may recognize I can't be that authentic way of leader at this place or in this place type of company, but I know how to find it and I'm going to go find it.\n\nLenny (00:34:55):\nDo you have any more examples of either someone uncovering this about themselves, or another mindset shift that you can make in one of these other buckets, similar to the idea of I'll think about people over the long term versus immediately?\n\nKen Norton (00:35:10):\nYeah. It really does vary. You start to pick up on that shift when it's less of the goals being defined externally and more of the goals being defined internally. So you'll have a conversation with somebody who's new to coaching and you'll say, \"What do you want?\" They'll be like, \"Well, I want to get promoted to VP.\" \"Why?\" \"Because I want to be a VP.\" It's like, \"Well, what's important about being VP?\" \"Well, because ... \" Eventually the answer is, well, because it's there and that's the thing that I'm supposed to do.\n\n(00:35:45):\nThen you start to notice the shift and it starts to become more of, \"Well, because really what's important to me is creativity. I want more creativity in my life. I want more ability to challenge other people.\" And so, you start to just sense that's more from in than from out. That's where that shift is.\n\n(00:36:06):\nThe journey is different for everyone. I think ultimately this is part of why, quite frankly, coaching may not be right for everyone. If we go back to that video game analogy, if you're looking for someone to just teach you the tutorial so you can learn how to play the video game and there's this jackass like me sitting next to you and saying, \"What's important to you about playing this video game?\" you're going to be like, \"Just can you tell me how to hold the controller? Can you stop?\"\n\n(00:36:31):\nSo it's not always right. It's a place where I think oftentimes people recognize that they've gotten all the advice, all the frameworks, all the rules, all the tricks, all the tips. They've learned that, they've mastered it, they've tweaked it, they've optimized it, they've recognized the shortcomings, they've customized it. The emergence that's required for them to get to the next level is just going to come just as much from inside them as it is from outside, if not more. That's when that shift is made.\n\nLenny (00:36:58):\nThat's called mentorship, I think, for people that are just looking for actual concrete advice on how to do a thing, is that right, versus coaching?\n\nKen Norton (00:37:05):\nI think so. This is where the words are squishy because there are a lot of people who are mentoring, who are also stepping into a coach role occasionally. There are plenty of managers who are great at coaching as necessary. So skills run the gamut, but it's a question of how much are you looking for someone to tell you the right way versus how much do you believe that there even is no right way? It's ultimately going to have to be your way.\n\n(00:37:33):\nThat's a different place, a different point in your career at different levels of journey. It's part of why I tend to work with probably more senior executives, because they're not looking to me to tell them how to do the job. They've already learned how to do the job. It's just something deeper that's going to need to break through from that.\n\nLenny (00:37:50):\nThis episode is brought to you by Unit. What did Gusto, Uber, Shopify and AngelList all have in common? They've all decided to build banking into their product. According to AngelList head of product, \"Banking makes every single feature more interesting. With it, our platform functions as financial mission control for our customers. Without it, we're just another software tool in a big messy stack.\"\n\n(00:38:12):\nEmbedding banking into your product not only adds differentiation, but also helps you acquire, retain, and monetize your customers. Unit is the market leader in banking as a service, combining multiple bank partners with a developer-friendly API to empower companies of all sizes to launch accounts, cards, payments, and lending in just a few weeks.\n\n(00:38:33):\nUnit is trusted by leading brands such as AngelList, Highbeam, Invoice2go, and Roofstock. To hear more about how Unit enables companies like yours to build banking, visit unit.co/lenny to request a demo or to try their free sandbox. That's unit.co/lenny.\n\n(00:38:51):\nFor someone that wants to do the work, but can't find a coach, can't afford a coach, is there something people can do on their own that you'd recommend to help them shift their mindset and do a lot of these things that you've been describing?\n\nKen Norton (00:39:06):\nYeah, it's a great question. Here's the secret about the coaching industry. Anyone can call themselves a coach. It's very democratized. It's great. There's no gatekeepers and barriers and there's no 500 licenses you have to go through.\n\n(00:39:22):\nThere are tons of great coaches who are at various different price levels, at different levels of accessibility. And so, if you say, \"I can't afford a coach,\" I might challenge that a little bit and say have you looked?\n\n(00:39:36):\nThe other thing is that you don't need a coach who's done the job before. I mean obviously I've done the job before, so I'm undermining part of my own selling point here. But coaches are trained to coach people on any topic. So when I go through coach training, I can coach you on anything. People can coach you on anything.\n\n(00:39:52):\nSometimes even there might be power in having a coach that's never done the product management job because there won't be any cheating of starting to move into a more of advisor role or maybe as the coach either. There may be, \"Well, you tell me what should I should do,\" and the person would be like, \"I don't know. I've never done this job. Let's go back to what you want.\" So there could be some benefit from that. Again, you don't have to have done that.\n\n(00:40:13):\nSo I would say coaching is incredibly powerful. I wish I'd had a coach much, much earlier in my career. And so, the answer may be coaching is more accessible than you thought. If not, I think the things that we're talking about here are internal understanding of what matters to you, your sense of purpose, this inner curiosity, and that could be harnessed at any age. So just wondering about yourself at any point in your career, wondering what's important to you.\n\n(00:40:43):\nI love doing values work, like, \"What are your values? Okay. No. What really are your values?\" That's something you can do yourself. That's something you can question. You can read about, you can start to understand.\n\n(00:40:53):\nMentors can be great, especially mentors who are less about trying to tell you the right way and get you to follow directly their path, but are more they're applying some curiosity, asking questions, challenging you in certain ways, being a way that you can bounce ideas off of.\n\n(00:41:09):\nGreat managers, I think, especially the best product leaders, understand how to put the coach hat on and when it's appropriate to put the coach hat on, and are explicit about that, are like, \"Okay, let me take off my manager hat now and put the coach hat on. What do you really want to do, Lenny? What's important to you? What's your career?\" And so, I think you can get coaching from everywhere.\n\n(00:41:28):\nThere's a lot of self-coaching you can do. This is honestly one of the benefits for me having gone through tons of training and coaching is starting to coach myself, like feeling an emotion and asking myself coach questions. Really powerful. That's something you can do when you've had a coach. You can do it when you don't have a coach. You can explore it.\n\n(00:41:46):\nSo I think this is really all about really being curious and wanting to understand who you really are at the core and what's important to you and what matters. That's something that can be done with or without a coach.\n\nLenny (00:41:58):\nAre there any resources that you love for either the values work or learning these questions to ask yourself? We can put them in the show notes if nothing comes to mind immediately. But is there something you recommend people check out?\n\nKen Norton (00:42:08):\nYeah, there are some great books. Maybe I'll use this opportunity to throw out a couple suggestions.\n\nLenny (00:42:13):\nLet's do it.\n\nKen Norton (00:42:14):\nI guess we can link it into the show notes. Brene Brown's Dare to Lead. It's a good book. She actually even has a whole section in there around values, confronting her values. I like her approach. There's some free resources on her website.\n\n(00:42:26):\nI love Conscious Leadership Group's work here. The 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership book is fantastic. You don't even need to buy the book. There's a ton of stuff on their website. Jim Dethmer, Diana Chapman and Kaley Warner Klemp are of the authors of that book. That's all about a lot of the stuff we've been talking about. They're the ones that have the above the line versus below the line that fits into this creative versus reactive standpoint. Those are all fantastic.\n\n(00:42:57):\nIf you want to go deeper into more of the management science behind it, if you're like me and really curious about the psychology and the management science, Bob Anderson and Bill Adams's book, Mastering Leadership, creates the entire integrated system around creative versus reactive.\n\n(00:43:19):\nAs a teaser, they identify five levels of leadership, of which reactive is the second, creative is the third. So beyond that, you get into integral and unitive. So if you're looking to unlock the advanced stages beyond creative, there's a lot of great stuff in there. Those are where all the research comes in as well.\n\n(00:43:38):\nFrom an adult development standpoint, Robert Kegan is the godfather of the adult-stage development work and the meaning-making that underlines a lot of this. He has a great book called Immunity to Change if you're curious about that.\n\nLenny (00:43:52):\nAwesome. We will link to all those in the description of this podcast so folks don't have to Google around. I have a couple of more coaching questions before we move on to a few other topics. One is just what are you finding are the most common blind spots for product people in general? How are people shooting themselves in the foot most?\n\nKen Norton (00:44:11):\nOh, that's a great question. I think probably the number one category, I'm not sure it's necessarily a problem, but maybe category or problems, is ... And this is, I think, great lesson for people earlier in their career, is how much all of the challenges that senior executives are dealing with come down to people versus product. So it's like it's fun to think about designing products, optimizing, doing user discovery, and testing what, but it's like you sit down with an executive and it's all about people.\n\n(00:44:47):\nThat's the hard part. It's about persuading people, getting groups of people to want to work together, trying to figure out how to deal with difficult personalities, figuring out how to set a vision and articulate a vision, create an environment where people can collaborate and play.\n\n(00:45:01):\nAnd so, I think this category of blind spot often is people being confronted with that without having been intentional about thinking of it as a skill or an area that they needed to work on, needed to improve.\n\n(00:45:18):\nPart of what I think is pretty exciting about product management is you are a leader from day one in product management. There's leadership all over the place, but that's your job. You're a leader. You don't have any formal authority, but you're a leader. You're expected to lead.\n\n(00:45:39):\nGuess what? The hardest part about being a leader is when you don't get to just rely on the formal authority. So you're getting to practice all the hard parts about leadership from day one, because you're nobody's boss. You get to sharpen those skills, develop those intuitions, get better and better at that, so that when you do someday, if this is right for you, become someone else's boss, you've already been able to lean into that.\n\n(00:46:04):\nAnd so, the people side of this is such an incredible aspect of what product management is. What I find, and this may be a category of blind spots, is people realizing that when they're put in a position where they're expected to have impact and realizing that they haven't developed the skills, they haven't developed the capability to actually be able to manage and work through all these people, which is ...\n\nLenny (00:46:33):\nHow do you actually get better at that or develop those skills?\n\nKen Norton (00:46:37):\nYeah. I just think recognizing it is part of the job. It's important. Maybe I came up at a certain time where it was often dismissed as soft skills. It's just like soft skills are helpful, but they're not actually something you want to work on. They're not something you train, not something you ...\n\n(00:46:54):\nAnd this is just as important. This is the equal ... I wrote a piece recently about the art versus the science. The art is communication, collaboration, the more fuzzy, softer skills, people stuff. It's an elevation of that being just as important, if not more important, over time, as all this skills, techniques, tactics, managing a backlog, all that kind of stuff that you have to do. You should invest in that the same way you invest in those other skills.\n\n(00:47:25):\nSo if you go off to a training to learn a technique for doing, I don't know, some sort of technical dashboard analysis, why don't you go to training to learn how to have difficult conversations? Because there's some great training about having difficult conversations, or do some training about storytelling. These are all really, really important factors that start to come into play.\n\n(00:47:54):\nWhat I would recommend is just appreciating that these are going to really, really matter and practicing and then valuing them and not thinking of them as something that either will matter later or a distraction or not really part of the job.\n\nLenny (00:48:07):\nI think the reason people don't do that work is because it's so hard. Difficult conversations are difficult. We talked about this with Trey Hass. But just like it's a rule of thumb, the thing that is hard is probably the thing you should be doing. It's like a compass point of you to the thing you should do.\n\nKen Norton (00:48:23):\nAbsolutely. We are all about doing hard stuff, product managers. That's what we're all about. And so, when something seems hard and it seems squishy and it seems like it's difficult to put a three-step rule around, chances are it's really going to matter. It goes back to this mindset shift. That means that there's an opportunity for you to readjust your inner complexity management system to adapt to that area of complexity that you're now seeing, because this stuff really feels squishy. And so, that's even more of a reason why you want to get your hands around it and grab onto it and value it and learn and grow from it.\n\nLenny (00:49:07):\nSpeaking of difficult and squishy, I'm guessing that one of the biggest challenges that people you work with face and one of the most recurring themes is imposter syndrome, people having imposter syndrome, something definitely I went through and it comes up a lot on this podcast. What do you usually advise your clients to do when they're feeling imposter syndrome?\n\nKen Norton (00:49:27):\nYeah, it's a great question. I always get corrected to say imposter phenomenon by people in the psychology community, because I guess it's not a dysfunction. And so, I've learned to use their terms. But, yeah, I think just about everyone experiences it at some point. Research shows that that definitely is born out ... It's really the moments when you're doubting your abilities or you feel like a fraud or you feel like you don't belong.\n\n(00:49:54):\nIt's funny because as I'm interrogating my own inner emotional state right now, I'm feeling it a little bit, because there's a part of me right now that's just like, \"You're not a trained psychologist.\" When I said that whole thing, well, it's technically a phenomenon, there's a voice that was like, \"What are you talking about? You don't know what you're talking about. Who are you [inaudible 00:50:14] on this?\"\n\nLenny (00:50:14):\nWe'll put a disclaimer on the episode.\n\nKen Norton (00:50:16):\nYeah, I'm not a psychologist. So, look, we all feel it. There's a part of me right now that's like I'm going to say the wrong thing and embarrass myself. Product managers, product leaders maybe more so because the role is so cross-functional and ill-defined. There's always going to be an edge of the job that you aren't as qualified as whoever you're interacting with. It's the nature of it. Look, we're never going to be as good as an engineer, as good as a designer, as good ... So there's all these opportunities for that.\n\n(00:50:40):\nI find, certainly from client work, that there is a little bit of a softening and solidarity just knowing that. I'm just like, \"Oh, you have that, too? Oh, I have that. Yeah, there's some value to that.\"\n\n(00:50:51):\nI think it's important to pause here and say that there is the risk of dismissing or even maybe weaponizing imposter phenomenon against particular populations, particularly women, people of color of all genders, women of color especially, who are facing real external feedback and doubt about their abilities.\n\n(00:51:15):\nThe environment is reinforcing and the source of a lot of this stuff, microaggressions, bias, real aggressions. And so, I think we always have to be careful in the helping professions to not dismiss it as a problem that just shifts the obligation to the person. So it's like, \"Oh, that's just your imposter syndrome. Deal with it.\" Well, it's really easy to overlook all these systemic issues that are leading to that imposter syndrome.\n\n(00:51:39):\nSo the leaders I work with, I think we have a special obligation both to confront our own inner dynamic, but also to recognize what our role is in the broader environment that might be contributing to some of this stuff. If you're a leader, you have a special obligation to dismantle those, not when you're meeting with your people, be like, \"Ah, it's just your imposter syndrome. You can work through it. Hire a coach,\" but to be able to recognize, \"Okay, wait, what signals are you getting? What issues are contributing to this? What's our role in needing to change that?\" So I think that's worth pointing out.\n\n(00:52:13):\nBy the way, there's a great article in Harvard Business Review from a couple of years ago. I think the title was literally Stop Telling Women They Have Imposter Syndrome. The two authors of that were Ruchika Tulshyan and Jodi-Ann Burey, if you're curious and you want to go into more depth on that.\n\n(00:52:29):\nAs coaches there, there's all sorts of ways we're trained to work with this. Oftentimes as an inner critic and inner voice, we all have voices, saboteurs. They're often trying to help us, they have good intentions, but they're developed to try to protect us in certain ways. So gaining awareness of those, just sort of like, \"Oh, that is an inner critic. That's what it's trying to do.\" There's a self-distancing that's valuable to that, really kind of ...\n\n(00:52:54):\nI like to think of it a little bit as you got inner border directors, and there's some noisy, chatty voices that every so often sit in the chairperson's seat and start taking over. If you start to recognize, \"Wait, no, I'm the chairperson. I don't want to hear from you right now. We'll hear from you later,\" it starts to create some power and you start to notice when it's happening.\n\n(00:53:16):\nWe bypass inner critic sometimes as a classic coaching technique. It's like, \"Okay, I'm sounding that's your inner critic is saying that. What if we just ask it to maybe step aside? Let's keep talking here.\"\n\n(00:53:28):\nYou can befriend it. There's a lot of practices and works just actually trying to understand what its motivations are. You can think of it as a board. Give this board member a new job, put it on a new committee, reassign it.\n\n(00:53:41):\nThere's oftentimes underlying belief systems. We talked before about my impression of what a real leader was and who they had to be. And so, hey, when all those second-guessing of me not being a real leader, of me not being qualified came from some of those underlying assumptions, that that was the only type of leader that was effective, was somebody that was slamming their fist out on the table.\n\n(00:54:02):\nOkay, so what if we redefine that? I'm too kind to be a leader. I'm not dominating, commanding enough. When you hear a client say that as a coach, you recognize, okay, there's a connection being made here between what effective leadership is and isn't. Let's interrogate that connection. Is that connection actually true?\n\n(00:54:21):\nAgain, it get backs to this question of you're often responding to other styles, approaches you've seen. You're comparing yourself to others. So this is the reactive mindset of I'm always comparing myself to that person, to that wave, that being, and seeing myself as lesser then. And so, the inner work of starting to see who I really am truly inside and less comparing myself to others.\n\n(00:54:42):\nBut, yeah, imposter phenomenon, syndrome, whatever you want to call it, very common and very popular, I suppose. Although when I say popular, it's like popular like a play.\n\nLenny (00:54:53):\nRight. Another inner critic tactic I've heard that I used for a bit that was helpful is to give your inner critic a name, like Jim. I mean like, \"Jim, not right now. I don't need you right now.\" That kind of helps.\n\nKen Norton (00:55:06):\nYeah. There is a whole school of coaching that I've worked with that's called parts work or internal family systems. It comes from a psychologist named Richard Schwartz who determined this. It can be really, really powerful.\n\n(00:55:19):\nI'll word my clients and we will give them names. We will imagine what they look like. They will interview these parts. If you've seen the Pixar movie Inside Out, this notion that like, hey, all these different parts show up in different ways. I'm going to put myself, the real me, the real self into the chairperson's seat. When I hear these voices, I'm going to appreciate them from what they are and who they are. They're not me. They're parts of me.\n\n(00:55:46):\nThere's something really powerful in that, in that sense of like ... Because, otherwise, they're all me. So I just hear this voice telling me I'm an idiot and I'm a clown and I'm not qualified to be in this room. Then when you can start to go, \"Oh, yeah, there it is. That's Larry Loser. My big angry, irritating judge who's, of course ... Oh, yeah, Larry always shows up every time I do something new, because Larry doesn't want me to challenge myself. So, of course, Larry's going to pipe in. I've heard from Larry. I'm going to ask Larry to step aside. Let's go.\" Yeah, it can be very powerful.\n\nLenny (00:56:22):\nI love that. One last question about coaching. For folks that want to find a coach, do you have any advice of just how to find a coach, and then what are a couple questions you can ask to evaluate if they're a good fit for you?\n\nKen Norton (00:56:35):\nYeah, great question. So I think, like any helping profession, finding a therapist or really anyone who you're going to have a deep and lasting relationship with, this sort of trust and authenticity is really important. I think we all, as coaches, recognize, and we feel this as well with clients, is it either has to be a fit or not. Sometimes it's hard to put your finger on it. Sometimes you meet with someone and you're like, \"Yeah, it clicks. It feels right.\" Sometimes you're like, \"Eh, it doesn't,\" and that's okay. And so, all coaches worth their salt will offer a free session to understand that, engage that.\n\n(00:57:13):\nI always tell everyone in that session, if you don't decide to work with me or I decide ... We don't need a reason. It's fine. It's just not a fit, and that's okay. You don't need to come up with bullet point reasons to let me down. It's part of how it goes.\n\n(00:57:28):\nYou might prefer certain people, certain gender, certain backgrounds. You may feel more comfortable or less comfortable with ... Maybe you want an old guy like me. Maybe you want an old guy like me, and that's fine. It has to feel right.\n\n(00:57:41):\nI would ask them to talk to you about what coaching is to them, because, again, it might combine some of these more mentory things. It might be more tactical. Some coaches are more structured, \"Week one, we're going to do this. Week two, we're going to do this. Week ... \" Others are more pure coaches like me, where, look, within the first five minutes, I'm going to ask you what you want to talk about today, because you're bringing the agenda. So figure that out. Figure out what works for you.\n\n(00:58:07):\nThen I think there's a lot of great places to go. Actually, specifically where to go, the International Coaching Federation is our governing body. So those of us that are credentialed coaches you'll find there. Again, you don't have to be credentialed, but that'll be a great place to find people who are.\n\n(00:58:23):\nThere are some matchmaking services, BetterUp, Torch, or some of the more accessible ones. There's one called Prismaticco. It's a little bit more higher end for more senior execs. Scale just put out a list of top coaches who work with product managers and product leaders, all sorts of great coaches. We can include that link. Lenny, I think you're involved.\n\nLenny (00:58:43):\nYeah. Congrats on winning one of their categories for best coach of ... Which category was that?\n\nKen Norton (00:58:49):\nProduct leaders. So, yeah, this was just a setup for you to say that. But thank you. But there's tons of great coach, and different styles, different stages of careers. I think all those folks have work with or have worked with product folks.\n\n(00:59:03):\nAnd so, again, just talk to a few. Reach out to a few. Ask them. If you're looking for more names, ask people who you admire, whose leadership styles you like and want to emulate, who they recommend, because oftentimes they have a better understanding of, hey, this is the type of coach that may want to work with, more of the emotional work, or this is the type of coach who actually maybe has a more compatible vision of what you're looking for, because, look, all coaches are different. You can tell I'm a touchy-feely heart coach.\n\n(00:59:35):\nThere are coaches who are ... Sometimes people want a coach and they're just like, \"You grab that brass ring. We're going to pound the table. I'm going to push you. I'm going to challenge you. I'm going to beat you up. I'm going to be more of a drill sergeant.\" That's a different style of coach that works with other people. That may be more what you're looking for.\n\n(00:59:50):\nSo I would just talk to a bunch, do some free sessions, get an opportunity to explore it. I coach people in the free session. So it's not just like we're talking. We're going to talk about something. I'm going to coach you. You're going to get a sense of what this looks like. Then come away and just ask yourself, what are your goals and where was there a fit? If there's not, just keep looking.\n\nLenny (01:00:09):\nAmazing. That was very tactically helpful. I really appreciate all those resources. We'll definitely link to all that in the description. I have just a couple questions I wanted to ask you outside of coaching, around some of your posts that you've written before we get to our exciting lightning round. One is around this idea of 10X versus 10%.\n\n(01:00:26):\nSo you wrote this post about the importance of thinking 10X versus 10%. Truthfully, I actually had a post started, \"10X versus 10%.\" I was like, \"Oh, this is going to be great.\" Then I Googled, \"Oh, Ken's already written about it.\" So I'm glad that you have written about it and written about it so well.\n\nKen Norton (01:00:41):\nGreat minds think alike, as they say.\n\nLenny (01:00:44):\nNow I don't have to write it. I'd love to just hear your general take on what this idea is and how to think about 10X or 10% bets.\n\nKen Norton (01:00:53):\nAgain, I'm a great synthesizer of ideas. This isn't my idea. This is a lot of ... It came from some thinking at Google and some push. I think it's really the sense that we think too small sometimes. You'll see that as a theme for some of the other things I've written too. There needs to be a push. If you really want to have huge breakthrough innovation, you need to be able to try, you need to be able to fail. You need to be able to shoot for the moon is where this 10X comes from.\n\n(01:01:22):\nA lot of it is mindset, but a lot of it is also cultural. It's creating environments where ... And I had the great privilege of working at Google for 14 years. I felt like it was definitely an environment that I got to play in, of being willing to take big swings that might fail.\n\n(01:01:36):\nThis doesn't mean that the company could all be out of business tomorrow. But it's like if you have a choice between trying something that could have a massive breakthrough, a massive change, and playing small ball where you're going to get a bunch of 10% improvements, you are over time, if you're willing to try, if you're willing to fail, if you're willing to push yourself, if you're willing to think bigger, if you're willing to create environments, great ideas come from places that are unexpected, you'll achieve massive, massive breakthrough.\n\n(01:02:02):\nYou can find the piece on my website, because I use examples from history, but it is a little bit of being brave and trying big things. If you look at all the great technology, the huge breakthrough innovations that we've had, the coronavirus vaccine, just this ... Man, there is no small balling that. That was a big, big swing that there was no guarantee of success, but we were willing to try it. We were willing to fail knowing that failure was probably the more likely outcome in the chance that we would achieve something that would really have that level of breakthrough.\n\n(01:02:36):\nAnd so, I think it is what I always challenge leaders to do is create the environment where people can step in and bring those types of ideas, and not play it safe or not be like, \"Ah, boy, that seems like a big one. If we bring that to the CEO, there's no way they'll take a chance. So let's ramp down our expectations. Let's bring this little idea in that is a little bit more guaranteed to work.\"\n\n(01:03:01):\nAnd so, it is the obligation of leaders to create that environment for people to be able to innovate, because the ideas are out there. I use the example of Kodak. Kodak invented the digital camera. It wasn't like, oh, people at Kodak were dumb. They didn't know digital was coming. No, they literally invented the digital camera. There just wasn't an environment created where the people who had that idea, who saw that potential, who saw that possibility could step up through the plate and try.\n\nLenny (01:03:29):\nDo you have any rules of thumb of how many of your ideas/resources should go into these big ideas versus incremental 10% bets, or is the general advice just like people aren't thinking big enough, often enough, so you should always think a little bit bigger than you naturally will?\n\nKen Norton (01:03:44):\nI think it depends. I mean it depends on the company. If you work in R&D, in labs, maybe everything is in that category and you build a portfolio. If you're a venture capital seed investor, or if you're working at a research lab, it's like you're building a huge portfolio of these bets. You're just assuming that maybe 99 of them will fail, but one will succeed and it'll make it all worthwhile.\n\n(01:04:09):\nMost of us aren't in those environments. We're in places where we have real customers buying our products, wanting our products, using our products. We're like, \"Let's bet the entire company own 50 things that may not work out.\" It may not be right for you.\n\n(01:04:20):\nSo I think it is a little bit of an approach. I think it needs to be thought of in a fractal way, though, because maybe at the company level, they're thinking Google once upon a time had a 70-20-10 thing, whereas 70% is our core business. It's the time we're searching ads. 20% is adjacent business, and then 10% on crazy bets that may not be anything.\n\n(01:04:43):\nBut I think that's at the company level. At the individual level, at your team level, you might have your own way of thinking. You're just like, okay, I've got 12 engineers on the team. We're working on, at any time, a bunch of stuff that we know we have to do. This is a bunch of stuff that we hope is like 10%. Then we're going to create some space for some innovation. Maybe it's just one engineer every sprint, or it's like a couple of times a year.\n\n(01:05:09):\nYou create that type of space in your own little air bubble that isn't necessarily at the portfolio level, to try things that may not work. But if they do, the payoff will be so substantial that it'll make the whole thing worthwhile.\n\nLenny (01:05:23):\nAwesome. Very helpful. Next question is around I think your most popular post that you've ever written, and maybe the thing that put you on the radar of writing, is around how to hire a product manager. Maybe this is where you mentioned donuts the first time. Is that right, or no?\n\nKen Norton (01:05:40):\nIt's funny. I think that was later.\n\nLenny (01:05:42):\nOkay.\n\nKen Norton (01:05:43):\nYeah, I think that was a talk that came after that.\n\nLenny (01:05:45):\nOkay, cool.\n\nKen Norton (01:05:46):\nYeah, that was definitely the big one for me.\n\nLenny (01:05:48):\nSo here's the question, just to keep it simple, what's one piece of advice that you would give people trying to hire a product manager? What's the thing that you think is most maybe missed or useful?\n\nKen Norton (01:06:00):\nYeah, I think the intangibles. So basically I wrote that originally as an email, that it was a copy pasta thing for me, where people kept coming to me and being like, \"Hey, I think we're going to try to hire a product manager or a company. Can you send over a sample job description?\" I'd be like, \"Yeah. Before we write the job description, let's talk about what the job is, because I'm not sure we all mean the same thing.\" And so, then I wrote that ... It was in 2005, so this goes back ... to try to define what the role actually is.\n\n(01:06:31):\nI actually feel like maybe the pendulum shifted way too far now where it's the interview process is so structured. Everyone's doing all these mock. They know exactly what questions they're going to get. It's SAT prep. Everyone's ready. But we've missed out with can they do the job? Because it's like they can pass the interview, but can they do the job?\n\n(01:06:53):\nAnd so, I think you have to be careful. This is particularly the case if you are a smaller company. You don't have a huge apparatus of Google and Meta, where you've got interviewing monolith of getting persuaded into ... Maybe this goes back a little bit to the science and the art. They passed all the technical questions. They do all this, they do all that. They do all that. But then you neglect to find out can this person show up and work with these engineers, these designers? Can they inspire them? Is this somebody that they want to follow? Do they have the right mindset for what this job entails? Do we even have an agreement on what their job is going to be?\n\n(01:07:35):\nThe number of people you see earlier in their career will be like, \"Well, I thought I was hiring for this, but it turns that's not even product management,\" or it was like, \"I thought I was going to do this, but all they want me to do is build fee.\" It's like how'd that not come out in the group process? It's like, well, I know how it didn't come out because they answered a whole bunch of structured questions around ... They did a programming exercise and they did a presentation and nobody stopped to ask.\n\n(01:07:55):\nAnd so, I think that's really the big thing from an interviewer perspective. I think same thing goes for the candidate's perspective. You are interviewing a potential employer. You're interviewing a boss. You're interviewing coworkers. What do you want? What do you care about? What is the type of place you want to be in? What do you not want to be in? How are you evaluating that? How are you asking those questions?\n\n(01:08:18):\nYeah, salary matters, title. All that kind of stuff matters. But you're interviewing a place to plop yourself into. How are you approaching that to make sure you're making the right decision?\n\nLenny (01:08:30):\nWell, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round, where I'm going to ask you a few questions and whatever comes to mind, just give me an answer. That's it. Very simple. Does that sound good?\n\nKen Norton (01:08:43):\nYeah. Inner critic is raging right now.\n\nLenny (01:08:45):\nOh, no. Real-time imposter syndrome.\n\nKen Norton (01:08:48):\nHere we go.\n\nLenny (01:08:49):\n[inaudible 01:08:49].\n\nKen Norton (01:08:48):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:08:50):\nOkay. So question one, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nKen Norton (01:08:55):\nOh, 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership. Definitely on that book. I'd just add books I've never recommended before. Probably Innovators Dilemma. It's probably my number one favorite book for product managers and product leaders.\n\nLenny (01:09:09):\nAmazing. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've liked?\n\nKen Norton (01:09:14):\nI love Ms. Marvel. My whole family were really enjoying it. I love all the MCU stuff. We just eat it up. Ms. Marvel has been amazing. Then watching Barry, which is crazy. It's sort of like nothing else I think ever on TV. Then, over the last year, probably Severance. It's my favorite program over the last ... I'd say last year.\n\nLenny (01:09:34):\nWow. Yeah. That is a trippy show. I've watched it all. We might be severed people, we don't even know.\n\nKen Norton (01:09:39):\nYou won't even know.\n\nLenny (01:09:41):\nOkay. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask folks when you interview them?\n\nKen Norton (01:09:46):\nWell, actually let me flip it because I just talked about interviewing as the interview ... Maybe I'll ask a favorite question for people who are being interviewed to ask the employer. Is that fair or is that turn the tables too much?\n\nLenny (01:09:58):\nI love it. Yes.\n\nKen Norton (01:09:59):\nI think a great question ... Actually maybe I have a couple. I think one question that I love is how does the company define a product team? Because it answers so much. It says so much about culture, collaboration, decision-making, the role of product management. If there's one question and you could figure out what is this culture like, it would be asking that.\n\n(01:10:20):\nI think another great question for candidates is to ask them to pick an example of something they've shipped recently and just talk about how it came to be. How did the bill become a law? Was it somebody in sales yelled and it got added to the backlog and it was the next thing? Is it a group of people together understanding customer user needs through discovery and ideating and trying some things and testing it? It says a lot about what it would be like to work there, particularly when it comes to empowerment and product culture. So those are probably two good questions.\n\nLenny (01:10:58):\nThose are really good questions. I'm going to steal them. Final question, who else in the industry do you respect as a thought leader? I imagine this list is very long, but what comes to mind?\n\nKen Norton (01:11:06):\nWell, this list is all of my fellow podcast guests on your podcast, Lenny, which is, speaking of imposter phenomenon, is just an incredible group of all the folks that I love and admire. I think, though, because ... Maybe I'll answer it a little bit outside of product, because I would worry that I would leave out too many great names.\n\n(01:11:26):\nIn the realms of leadership, Amy Edmondson is somebody I really admire. She's done a lot of the work on psychological safety. I really, really value her work, her contributions. There's a guy named Tom Garrity, who has a newsletter about psychological safety. I think he's collaborated with Amy before. It's one of the best, not the best newsletter I received, Lenny, maybe the second best, about psychological safety for those of us that are wanting to create environments where people can really thrive and do their best.\n\n(01:12:05):\nIn the coaching profession, I mean the coaching profession emerges from the humanist psychology traditions or the client-first work of ... Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow are intellectual heroes of mine. They're both dead. I don't know if we're supposed to talk about living people here, but definitely as I think about in my profession, they really set the stage and created the environment that coaching could even exist. So I'll include them.\n\nLenny (01:12:36):\nAmazing. Ken, this was such a special episode, unlike any other podcast that I've had so far. I can't wait for people to listen to it. Before I let you go, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, and then how can listeners be helpful to you?\n\nKen Norton (01:12:51):\nYeah, bringthedonuts.com is my home on the worldwide web. All my writing is there. You can get in contact with me there. I have a newsletter that I am occasionally send out, but you can find all the stuff that I've ever written and get in contact with me there.\n\n(01:13:09):\nThe how to help be helpful question is a really easy one to answer, but that brings me a lot of joy, which is just keep being awesome product folks. You're so much my tribe. You're so close to my heart, all the work that you do, everything you bring into the world, the amazing products that we get to use that I'm sure you're working on right now that we haven't even seen yet, that you can't wait to share with us, and the cultures and teams that you make better, so your very existence. So I would say you can be helpful to me by just keep doing what you're doing.\n\nLenny (01:13:41):\nWhat an awesome answer. Thank you for being here, Ken.\n\nKen Norton (01:13:43):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:13:46):\nThat was awesome. Thank you for listening.

  "transcript": "# Why not asking for what you want is holding you back | Kenneth Berger (exec coach, first PM @Slack)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou were famously the first PM at Slack and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:00:05):\nFor me, the impact was about making this work sustainable so that we're not burning out or selling out, but actually able to pursue these hard goals that we have in startups.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:14):\nWhat we're going to be talking about today is your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator and seven plus years as a coach.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:00:23):\nThe core idea is ask for what you want. Turns out when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:00:30):\nYou're hired.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:32):\nHow do you know that this is something you need to be working on?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:00:34):\nIf you're more in the people pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind. And if you're sort of more in the control freak camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, \"Go do this now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:44):\nHow do you know what you want?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:00:46):\nComplaints are great inspiration. Every complaint implies a dream. Let me envision a better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. See what it's like to not be sort of living in fear all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:01):\nToday, my guest is Kenneth Berger. Kenneth coaches startup leaders to help them avoid burnout and live the life that they want. He was the first product manager at Slack and spent over 10 years in tech before transitioning into coaching. His core focus with leaders is to help them learn how to ask for what they want. This sounds really simple, but as you'll hear in our chat, this one skill is at the core of so many of the struggles that people have in their career and in their life.\n\n(00:01:28):\nKenneth shares a ton of very tactical advice to help you figure out what it is you want, how to overcome the resistance that comes with asking for what you want, how to actually ask for what you want effectively, why the most important step is hearing the response that you get when you ask for what you want and all of the things that will change in your life if you get better at this one skill.\n\n(00:01:50):\nKenneth also shares the story of him being fired three times from Slack, which is hilarious. With that, I bring you Kenneth Berger after a short word from our sponsors. And if you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously.\n\n(00:02:09):\nLet me tell you about a product called Sidebar. The best way to level up your career is to surround yourself with extraordinary peers. This gives you more than a leg up. It gives you a leap forward. This worked really well for me in my career, and this is the Sidebar ethos. When you have a trusted group of peers, you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This was a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group of peers.\n\n(00:02:40):\nSidebar is a private, highly vetted leadership program where senior leaders are matched with peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives and raw feedback. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation, Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your career journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're already committed to growth.

Join thousands of top senior leaders who have taken the first step to career growth from companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta by visiting sidebar.com/lenny. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:32):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset. It should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's business 101. Here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize webpages fast.\n\n(00:04:02):\nThat means you can set ambitious business goals and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today at webflow.com.\n\n(00:04:20):\nKenneth, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:04:23):\nYay. thanks for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:30):\nI love that, yay. That should be a tradition that everyone goes with. I love that. So we originally met when I was doing a post on being a first product manager at a company. You were famously the first PM at Slack, and then you ended up transitioning into executive coaching, which is what you do now. What we're going to be talking about today is something that you described to me as, quote, your personal magnum opus, the output of 10 plus years as a founder and operator, and seven plus years as a coach to startup leaders.\n\n(00:04:59):\nAnd the core idea is simply asking for what you want, which sounds really simple. So let me just start broadly just why have you found that this skill, this one idea is so core to so many of the challenges that people run into in work and in life?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:05:19):\nIf I had to answer in one word, it would be integrity. I think that it's one of these funny things where everyone thinks they already know how to ask for what they want. We all ask for what we want. We order our coffee in the morning and we all think we have integrity. No one walks around thinking, \"I'm lying to myself all the time or lying to others certainly.\" And yet we tend to fool ourselves a little bit. When it comes to are we really pursuing the things that we want in life? And I think to me, the flip side of that is sort of the reason that the stakes around asking for what you want are so high because we can't guarantee we're going to get what we want.\n\n(00:05:59):\nBut if we're asking for it regularly, if we're listening to the response, we're expecting the nose we get from the world, then we can get the sense of, \"Yeah, I'm honoring what's important to me. I'm honoring the world's response and I'm moving forward towards what I want.\" And if we don't do that, \"Well, then we're fooling ourselves that we're actually moving towards of what we want.\" There tends to be all these unexpected secondary and tertiary effects that come out of that of stress and frustration, and unhappiness because of course, asking for what we want, pursuing what's important to us in life is just one of the most important things of fulfillment, of what's important in achieving our purpose.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:37):\nWhat are just some challenges that people have in their life and career that are just rooted in doing this badly? Not asking for what you want, not knowing what you want.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:06:47):\nFor me with clients, I think what I'm often looking for are just kind of this sense of being stuck because everybody has got frustrations. Everybody gets nervous at work sometimes. But if we're in the same stuck place week after week after week in our coaching sessions, probably you're trying the same thing and not getting any different results. It's that definition of insanity thing.\n\n(00:07:11):\nSo really I look at that and say, \"Okay. Maybe you're asking for what you want.\" Maybe. Although often people aren't. But even if you are, you're probably not achieving it. You're not getting the results that you want. So why are we not learning from that? Why are we not moving forward getting new data, trying something new, actually treating it as a sort of iterative development discovery process?\n\n(00:07:32):\nSo I think that stuckness is one thing. And I think the other thing I look for is interpersonal conflict, right? Because I think that one mode of not asking for what you want well is holding back and not really saying it out loud. I think another really common mode is coming with a lot of entitlement of, \"You know what? You better do what I say. I'm your boss. You're my report. You better obey or agree,\" or whatever it is. And of course the danger of that is interpersonal conflict. Even if you are their boss, that's a really disrespectful way to come into the conversation and it's an obvious source for a lot of issues.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:09):\nBefore we get into how to learn to do this better and more of why this is so important, is there an example from your career where you did this really badly or you didn't ask what you want?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:08:19):\nThere's so many examples. I think we will eventually get into the story of how I was fired from Slack. But I think for me, the thing that always came up was just being attached to being right. And I think a lot of us get into this boat. We enter into a meeting and we're sure from the first moment, \"I'm right and they're wrong.\" And I think that especially in product management, we're supposed to be the holders of this vision for what the product should be. And so it's easy to come in with a lot of conviction and not really a lot of openness to other ideas.\n\n(00:08:51):\nOften what I try to introduce people to, and I've learned all this stuff the hard way, believe me, is it's fundamentally disrespectful to go into a meeting already deciding that you're right and the other person is wrong because you can't know that for sure. There's always a new perspective, new data that could come in. And so you want that conversation to really be a back and forth. And if you're coming in with this really ingrained sense of righteousness, you can't do that. There's no way to have that conversation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):\nI think you may have already answered this question, but I think it's really important is how do you know that this is something you need to be working on? How do you know like, \"I really need to pay attention to what Kenneth is about to tell me?\" You said one is you feel you're stuck in your career, something you're just not making progress, and this could be the answer. Or you said there's interpersonal conflict and you're just having a lot of conflict with people. Are those the two answers? Are there more?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:09:37):\nI think those are great things to look for. I think it's also good to look for a sense of things being high stakes, because I think part of what can create a lot of conflict and difficulty in these situations is a sense of this is life or death. And that was certainly how it was when I was a founder of, \"Okay, normally...\" When I was at Adobe, it's a big company, they're going to be fine either way, no matter what I do. Right? I can be easy going. Let someone else have their way in the meeting. But when it was my company, when it was my vision on the line, I didn't feel especially flexible. The stakes seemed really, really high.\n\n(00:10:12):\nThis is the success of my idea, of my vision, my reputation is on the line. And so I think often when the stakes feel high, we're kind of focused more on the fear of what we don't want to happen than on actually achieving what we do want. And that's a really critical distinction because if we're running away from our fears, it doesn't necessarily mean we're getting anywhere meaningful for what our desires are. And so that sense of high stakes that often we can get, whether it's in interpersonal conflict or being afraid of asking for what we want, that can get us really focused on the fears rather than focused on the goals.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):\nThere's a question I was going to save for later, but it's something that's very top of mind for me is knowing what you want. How do you know what you want? There's basically knowing what you want and then asking for what you want. I like equanimity in my life, and so I often don't ask for what I want or push down maybe what I want, or I don't think about what I want. I just want other people to be happy.\n\n(00:11:15):\nI'm curious what people can do and what I can do to get better at knowing here's what actually want, here's what would make me happy and fulfilled? What are some skills there I could work on and other people can work on?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:11:27):\nWell, first of all, I'd say you're very far from alone there. I mean, I think the people pleaser coping strategy is one of the sort of most classic, and it is effective, right? In the short term like, \"Oh, you can feel safe and calm when other people are generally happy with you.\" And the cost tends to be long term in terms of am I really pursuing the things that are important to me?\n\n(00:11:48):\nSo one of my favorite techniques here is this concept they call dream behind the complaint. Because you're right that we tend to not be that great always at really dreaming and envisioning and saying, \"This is my dream of what I want out of life.\" That can sound really scary for people, but we're very good at complaining. Usually people are very good at saying, \"Oh my God, there's this thing happening at work, it's so annoying. Or there's this person that really bothers me so much, why are they always like this?\"\n\n(00:12:17):\nSo the magic of that complaining is that every complaint implies a dream. It implies a better world where that complaint is resolved. And so often that's the tool that I'll take people to first to say, \"All right, great. Let's complain. Right? It feels so fun and good and releasing to complain, and let's look at what that implied world is behind that complaint.\" What is this vision? And then to really check, \"Okay. Let's imagine you get that. That's the world of the future that you get. How does that feel? Is that big enough or is it kind of meh?\"\n\n(00:12:50):\nAre we like, \"Oh, my dream is that I get to speak up a little more in meetings?\" It's like, \"Well, that's probably not a hundred percent of your dream. What's really behind that?\" And so I think that check can help you sort of level up to say, \"Is this really an inspiring dream for me that's going to motivate me more than those fears that might be hiding in the background?\"\n\n(00:13:13):\nAnd on the flip side, with entitled people, you can also get really unrealistic dreams where I might say, \"Okay. So it sounds like what I'm hearing is that your dream is that everyone obeys you and automatically agrees with you no matter what.\" And they sort of say, \"Ah, I don't know if that's quite my dream.\" And so if your dream is so embarrassing to say out loud, you can't even really own it, maybe that's not the right dream. And so that checking whether it actually feels inspiring, but also sort of credible and possible is a good way to find that middle ground where, \"Yeah, this dream is hard. I don't know that I'm going to get it, but, damn, it's worth trying. I want to go for it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:54):\nI love that for someone that wants to try this on their own and help themselves get better at this without you being there, what is it that you do? Is it you dream about what would make you happiest? Is it complain and see what's at the root of it? Is it just imagine a world where you're really happy and see what emerges.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:14:11):\nSpecifically for articulating what you want because that's the first step of the asking for what you want process. It really is as simple as that of let's start with what you have consciously in terms of what you want. And if you have trouble, then we can try looking at complaints and starting to articulate a vision out of that.\n\n(00:14:29):\nBut to me, really what's interesting about asking for what you want is that on the surface it's very simple, right? I mean, the steps I outline are articulate what you want, ask for what you want intentionally and accept the response and then try again. Because it's an iterative process. We're learning from the response and what it tells us because the response is usually no. So really what tends to be hard there, I mean, that's a straightforward process. It's not rocket science. What's hard there is the resistance.\n\n(00:14:58):\nThe parts of us that are not so excited about that, that thinks asking for what we want is scary and articulating a big dream that we might not get is really scary. Because god, what if I don't get it? What does that mean about me? Am I a failure? Or what does it mean if I respect the no? What if I ask for my big dream and someone tells me I'm not going to get it? What does that mean? How am I going to feel?\n\n(00:15:19):\nSo working through all that resistance is really a lot of what tends to be tricky about asking for what you want because otherwise it's articulate, ask, accept.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:28):\nOkay. You're getting into where we're going to go. Before we get there. Final question. This idea of dealing with, no, I think this is the other big blocker for people is like, \"Oh, that's so scary to ask for something I really want or ask for something big that is really important to you.\" What is it that you advise there of just getting over this fear of just asking for what you want?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:15:49):\nSo I have a more expansive definition of no than most people, I think, because for me it's not a yes unless it's a hell yes. Because you really want enthusiastic consent. Not just, \"Maybe, kinda. I'll try. We'll see. But yeah, absolutely, let's do this.\" And I think that often it's so tempting to settle for something less than that to say, \"Oh, well, okay, we'll give that a try.\" And that often comes to bite us later on because we accept this thing that short of a hell yes. And then we realized later on, \"Oh yeah, they weren't really in.\"\n\n(00:16:26):\nThey didn't show up to the party or they didn't deliver on time because my CTO said, \"Yeah, I think maybe we can deliver by May 1st.\" And then May 1st comes and surprise, surprise, your milestone is not done because you didn't go for that hell yes. And so I think part of what I encourage people to do is, one, to really hear anything short of a hell yes as a no. So it's not a bad thing. Mostly the world tells us it's actually really great data. It helps us figure out what are we going to try next? What are we going to try next, try next, try next? Because that's going to help us learn how to actually get to that hell yes.\n\n(00:17:03):\nAnd part of that asking process is of not settling for it, but actually asking and saying, \"Hey, I'm hearing maybe you're lukewarm on May 1st as a date. What would be a hell yes day for you where you could say, absolutely, we can deliver on that?\" And that way we're not making them wrong for saying no. We're saying, \"Of course you get to say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want. But let's get to a hell yes. What would it take for us to get there?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:29):\nThat's a really helpful framework and phrase to use is just what would it take to get to hell yes? Not just what would it take to get to you feeling comfortable with this? What would it take for you to just agree to this? It's more a hell yes. And your point there is hell yes is when they actually fully agree. Oftentimes people kind of like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.\" And then they don't actually follow through.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:17:49):\nSome people call this a whole body yes because sometimes your head is saying yes, but your heart is saying no or your gut is saying no. And so I think you can really feel in your body when you've got a hell yes, when all of you is fully in and ready to do this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:06):\nAnd this applies to, you're giving examples here of just getting like aligning a deadline. I imagine the same skill applies to everything in relationship questions and friends and family and work.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:18:19):\nIt does. And it is something universal, but I do think of it as being particularly relevant to my work with startups because I work primarily with startup founders. Because with startups you know that mostly they fail. We all know the numbers on that. And so to me, there's a perspective you have to take if you're going to operate in the startup world of being okay with not knowing that you're going to get the outcome you want. A lot of people, we operate in a safer world where we're more clear exactly what the outcomes are going to be, but if you're a startup founder, you've got to be okay with, \"I'm just going to go for this, and I know I probably won't get it. But it's so meaningful to me, I'm going to go for it anyway.\"\n\n(00:19:00):\nAnd so to me, that's not just about the big picture of running a startup, it's about really anything you might want in life, because that's such a useful perspective to say, \"I know I'm not going to get it. I know I'm not guaranteed to get it. I'm not going to be attached to that. I know people aren't obligated to tell me yes, but I'm going to go forward anyway because I want it and that's enough.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:20):\nSo let's actually get into the skill of learning how to actually ask for what you want more effectively. You already described three steps, so maybe just describe them again and let's just walk through them.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:19:32):\nThe first step is articulating what you want. And we've gone into this a little bit, but to me, I think that the key places that people tend to have missteps here, or one in this phrase, it's fine. I think of the \"it's fine\" cartoon with the flames and the dog, I think it is. But I think a lot of us fall into that trap of saying, \"You know what? I'm fine. I actually, I don't need anything. I'm good.\"\n\n(00:19:59):\nAnd again, this is tempting, right? Because it's so nice to have this idea that I'm fine, I don't need anything. And in a certain way, that's a nice attitude because yeah, we're not guaranteed anything, so it's nice to be okay with the status quo. But for those folks, often what I'm encouraging that do is to really tune into the parts of them that maybe aren't so fine like, \"Gosh, I'd prefer it a little bit if things were this way or yeah, I'm a little bit bothered by this, or I'm a little bit nervous about this.\"\n\n(00:20:26):\nAnd so kind of tuning more into those subtle emotions that are pointing them towards, \"Sure, I'm okay with the status quo, but I want something more.\" And so helping them articulate that in a clearer way where they can want something without being attached to having to get it. The other extreme of this is people who articulate these sort of wildly unrealistic goals. So this is the founder that just wants everyone to agree with him all the time and to obey him immediately.\n\n(00:20:56):\nSo for those folks, it really tends to be more about saying it out loud. Once you say it out loud, it is clearer. That's not really what it's about. And so for those folks, I tend to ask them to go deeper to say, \"Yeah, I know you're not a control freak. You don't want everyone to think exactly what you think. What's it really about? What does that get you?\" And so often it goes from being this more kind of objective external goal to being a more kind of social emotional goal of, \"You know what, I just want to have a team that feels really aligned around me and we're just ready to go for it and we've got each other's backs.\"\n\n(00:21:35):\nThat doesn't mean we agree with each other all the time or that we're a hundred percent aligned in everything, but it doesn't mean there's a certain feeling that I have when I go into work. Even though I don't know that we're going to get what we want or that everyone is going to agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:47):\nDo you have any examples from your time you could share of someone articulating what they want and figuring out how they articulate, how to articulate what they want just to make it even more real?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:21:58):\nTo me a lot of the classic examples are around feedback. Because I work with a lot of founders who are not the sort of classic control freaks. They're super nice and their teams love them and they love their teams. So for them, it can be really hard to deliver hard feedback, to deliver negative feedback and even more to actually create consequences. Because the thing about accepting other people's no is that, \"Sure, they can always say no. Everybody gets to say no whenever they want, but there are consequences.\" And so the classic thing I see with the nice founders is they're really afraid to actually create consequences when people are not living up to their expectations. Right?\n\n(00:22:40):\nWhen they're not aligned with the culture, they're not delivering in the way that the CEO wants them to be delivering because it doesn't seem that nice. They're like, \"Oh, I think of myself as nice and of being so kind and of people loving me.\" And it's like, \"Well, that doesn't mean that there aren't consequences for their actions.\"\n\n(00:22:56):\nPart of really respecting them is respecting that they can make the choices they want and they're grownups enough that they can deal with the consequences of those choices.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:05):\nCan you even get more concrete there? Is it we need to hit this date, or are there going to be big problems? Or is it like, \"I need you to hire this large of a team?\" I don't know. What is it that they're not articulating that they later realize, \"Oh, here's what I need to articulate.\"\n\nKenneth Berger (00:23:20):\nSo I think sometimes it is about alignment, the disagree and commit. So I see that a lot of founders saying, \"Hey, I'm super respectful of your differing opinion here, and I totally validate you and I appreciate you. Thank you so much for sharing that.\" But they're not willing to go that extra step and say, \"Yeah, but this is the call and I need you to actually follow through with that. I understand that might be disappointing or frustrating or what have you, but part of the expectation for this role is that you can roll with disagree and commit sometimes when that's necessary.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:52):\nThat's an awesome example. I fully get that and I could see how scary that is to a lot of people. One is just coming to terms with, \"This is what I actually want to be doing, but I just don't feel like I can because it's going to, I think, upset people.\" Okay. So what else can you suggest people do to help identify what it is they want and articulate what they want? So you talked about pay attention to just like, \"Oh, this would be better. If this changed, I'd be happier.\" Or things would probably run better. That's a really cool example of how to think do that because easy, just like, \"Oh yeah, if we actually can make a decision in this meeting, that'd be really cool.\" Maybe we should try to do that and ask for that. Is there any other tips and approaches to helping you figure out what you want?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:24:40):\nIt always comes back to integrity. And a great way to do an integrity check is to just look have I fully expressed myself? And so I think we've talked a little bit about charting your feelings as a piece of that of like, \"Yeah, am I really tuning into how annoyed I am or how frustrated I am or how nervous I am?\" Because if I haven't fully owned those feelings and expressed those in whatever way is appropriate, then probably I'm not fully in integrity.\n\n(00:25:09):\nI think saying what you have to say is a piece of that too. \"Gosh, is there something that I keep thinking about and I'm just like three or four days, I'm just like, man, I really want to say this to this person.\" At this point, you're probably out of integrity because there's something deep in you that really needs to say this, right? And so to me, articulating what you want is really about mindfulness is about checking for all these things.\n\n(00:25:35):\nWhat is the part of me that's not fully expressed? Because it doesn't mean I'm going to get what I want or that people are going to give me all my dreams immediately, but it feels so much better to have it out. That sort of suffering that fear usually comes from holding it in and saying, \"Oh, having these stories of I'm not allowed to say that. It's not appropriate to express that I'm bored in this meeting.\" Versus saying, \"Probably a lot of people would be grateful if we said out loud, 'I'm bored in this meeting.' Let's move things along.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:04):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

I'm just scared to say this, to bring it up, to change the way people are operating to ask for what I want. What advice can you share for people to actually do this?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:27:12):\nSo for asking what you want, I think the really important tweak here is asking intentionally because I think a lot of us are stuck on a certain track that's comfortable for us when we ask. And so if you're more in the people-pleasing camp, maybe you're used to not asking at all. You're hoping that people are reading your mind and just magically knowing what you want.\n\n(00:27:34):\nAnd if you're more in the control-free camp, maybe you're used to ordering people around and saying, \"Go do this now.\" And so for both of those folks, it's not about... I think if you ask any of them, \"Is this working for you?\" They'd say no. Of course, it's obvious from an effectiveness standpoint, it's not working well, but they more just haven't embraced that you can do it a different way that they only really see one way of doing it.\n\n(00:28:00):\nSo part of asking for what you want effectively is really just recognizing the rut that you get stuck in and working through all those narratives that make us resist asking it a different way. Because often the people who don't want to ask have a story that says, \"This is too risky. Or it's not worth it. They're going to say no anyway, so why even bother?\"\n\n(00:28:24):\nSo these are all very common things that people go through, but then they end up not actually asking for what they want. Now, actually expressing who they are and what they stand for in the world. And that has a really serious cost. I think that we tend to tell ourselves the story, \"Oh, this is fine. I'll be fine.\" Versus owning, \"I'm going to be living my life not asking for what I want.\" Do I really want to be at my funeral and have people say, \"Oh, Kenneth played it safe. He didn't really go for his dreams, but he was nice. No one was ever mad at him.\" That's not what we want people to say at our eulogies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:01):\nNo. That's good motivation. Okay. So say in this example you gave of like, \"I need us to make a decision. I know I'm trying to keep everyone happy, but we need to make a decision.\" Do you have advice for maybe phrases of how to approach. You talked about making intentional. How do you actually go about doing that? Is it the way you communicate it? Is it something else? How do you actually do this without pissing people off and also just risking too much?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:29:33):\nEven implicit in that question, to me that's that question of, \"Oh, how do I do it without being any risk of ever pissing anyone off?\" That's a piece of the resistance right there. And so this is a great example of the type of work that we have to do, right? Because in theory, asking is easy, \"Oh, you just try some way and maybe people are pissed off and maybe they're not.\" But probably it's going to be fine and you'll have the chance to try again and iterate and work from it.\n\n(00:30:00):\nBut often we get stuck so we don't get to go through those levels of iteration because we want to make sure we're going to get the outcome. We say, \"Oh, well, I'm not willing to ever piss anyone off ever. And so I'm just going to be stuck at this step because I haven't figured out what's going to guarantee me.\" And of course, there's no guarantee. We can never guarantee that people are going to feel a particular way.\n\n(00:30:22):\nSo part of asking for what you want effectively is actually bringing some compassion for yourself. Of course, we all want to be sure that the way we ask is going to be effective and no one is going to be mad at us and we're going to get all of our dreams come true. But we don't get that. I wish we did. That would be nice. But is that worth not pursuing your dreams in life?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):\nSuch a good point about what you identified and the way... I think a lot of people that think about it, it's just like, \"I'd always do this without causing anyone any pain or risking anything going wrong.\" I think that's, to your point, part of it. So you talk a lot about founders. You work with a lot of founders, a lot of listeners here are not founders, they're product managers, ICs on teams, other functions that don't have \"power\". Is there anything that you suggest these folks do differently or think about this differently or is it kind of the same thing? In the end everyone has power in some way. How would you think about this if you're just, say, a product manager, individual contributor?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:31:23):\nI think one of the most important balances in terms of the asking step is both asking clearly, but asking with great humility. And this actually works whether you're in a position of power or not because I think a lot of folks will go so far to the end of humility. They say, \"Well, I'm not going to say this out loud at all.\" But in fact, if you're willing to say, I really disagree with this product decision and I would really prefer that we make this different decision. I know it's not my call and I'm just one opinion and a lot of people are going to see things differently and that's fine, but it's important to me that you know that. So what do you think? Are you willing to reconsider this?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:00):\nThat's such a great approach. It's very not scary to say that. It also, I think, highlights something I wanted to touch on is I think people have a lot more influence and power than they think they do. Say a PM on a team disagrees with a plan for a product. People actually care about your opinion and you could actually change things. But just telling them, \"I think this is a bad idea.\" And you often don't. Is that what you find, that people have a lot more influence than they think they do? Anything along those lines that comes up?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:32:35):\nYou're giving me deep goosebumps because I think this is a really underappreciated thing in terms of asking for what we want because especially in the PM world, we're trained to look for data. We're not just going to state an opinion. We're going to say, \"Oh, the AB test said this. Or 30% of our users do this, or the ROI on this is X.\" And data is great. We love data for a reason of course. And I think people forget about exactly what you're highlighting, that your relationships matter, and that just your opinion because you believe something or because you want something often that's enough.\n\n(00:33:13):\nBecause guess what? You're in a relationship with these people you work with. They care about you. You have some sort of leverage with them. And I think that often people go the other way and say, \"Oh, I've got power. I'm going to try and leverage it.\" But actually, if you go the other direction and you're humble and you say, \"I know I can't make you do anything, it's not my call to make. But man, this is really what I want. I'm just going to put it out there and ask.\" That I think it feels really vulnerable and uncomfortable to not lean on data as a sort of way of saying, \"No, no, I'm right, so you should believe what I believe.\" But just say, \"Actually, I don't know that I'm right. This is just what I think and I hope that's enough on its own.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:50):\nDo you find that that's actually a crutch a lot of times to people not saying anything is they don't have that data? They don't have evidence and they just, \"I shouldn't say anything. If someone asks for why I don't have a great answer, I just think this is what should be.\"\n\nKenneth Berger (00:34:03):\nTotally. And I think there's a balance there as with anything. Is ignoring data and going in gut all the time, great? Probably not, right? We use data for a reason, but I think there are all these moments when we are making a gut decision and having all the data there means having the opinion set out loud. I think often the dangers of people saying, \"Oh, I don't have data to back this up. It's just what I think. And I'm not sure people are going to agree with me, so I'm just not going to say it.\"\n\n(00:34:35):\nSo we don't have the data of all those gut opinions of these subject matter experts in the room, even though that gut information to me is just as important as anything we could get from the SQL database or whatever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:48):\nBefore we move on to step three, you talked about the opposite of asking for what you want. This was just step two is just complaining and being angry later like, \"I knew this project was going to fail. I knew this was a terrible deadline. I knew this design was not great.\" Anything more you want to say along those lines of just like, \"If you're not asking for what you want, complaining is often a sign that you should be doing that more\"?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:35:11):\nTo me, complaints are great inspiration. To me, I love radical candor, for example, where I try to go a step further than radical candor is to not just say, \"Hey, here's my feedback. Just wanted you to know.\" But to say, \"And I want something. I would like to see an outcome.\" And so I think that to me it's all about the effective framing that the complaint is probably not going to be an effective way to do it, but it can be great inspiration to say, \"Gosh, that complaining means I'm frustrated. What am I frustrated about? Let me envision that better future. Let me think about what's an effective way to actually move towards that. What's an effective way to communicate that desire that's actually likely to get me towards a yes?\"\n\n(00:35:58):\nAnd so when we actually embrace that sort of frustration, annoying, complaining thing and follow that thread down and think about how to be effective that way, we can actually get something really compelling and useful, but it requires actually embracing that part of ourselves that sometimes we're a little bit ashamed of like, \"Oh, I don't like that whiny part of myself. I'm just going to push that one down versus actually taking what it has to say as important data.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:24):\nThat's a really good point. I think that's actually another blocker for a lot of people is just, \"I don't want to be a complaining person. I just want to be like, let's do this. I'm in, let's go. I don't want to be seen as a squeaky wheel.\" Is there anything you say there about as a resistance point for people?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:36:40):\nWell, I'm a big fan of internal family systems, which is this sort of psychotherapy technique that really talks about parts and the sort of parts of ourselves and the ways in which they don't always agree with each other. Part of why I love this approach is, A, because we already use this language. We say, \"Part of me thinks this, a part of me thinks that.\" And really when I talk about how to work through resistance, really it's about embracing and validating all of our parts.\n\n(00:37:07):\nBecause often we're really comfortable with one part of ourselves that we think is, \"Oh, this part is virtuous and good and great, and this part is whiny and bad, and not great, and I don't respect that part of me as much.\" So really to sort of ask effectively, we generally need to embrace all these parts and really bring in all the information they're bringing in because if we ignore the part that's really scared to ask, well, then we're going to stay stuck.\n\n(00:37:32):\nVersus if we come in and say, \"Hey, buddy, why are you scared? You seem terrified. What's going on? Oh, well man, you think your whole professional reputation has staked on this and you're an imposter and they're going to find out, and then you'll never work again? Well, of course you'd be scared. That makes a ton of sense.\" And by embracing that, instead of ignoring that and being ashamed of that, that is often how we soften those fears and say, \"I know that's scary, but we also know that's not really true. You're not an imposter, right? You're an experienced professional.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:01):\nMan, there's so many threads we can't follow here. This whole line of internal family systems, right?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:38:06):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:07):\nThat's its own podcast episode potentially. And then imposter syndrome, we've touched a bunch of different podcast episodes, but I'll avoid going in that direction. Something you reminded me of is we just had Carole Robin on the podcast who taught this class touchy-feely at Stanford for a long time, which is all about helping people learn how to deal with other people, which we never learned in life. It's like a class, how to learn to work with other people.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:38:29):\nI took one of Stanford's T-Group Weekends, summer of 2020, I think a month after George Floyd was murdered and was facilitated by a black woman. And it was one of the most profound transformative weekends of my life. Because T-groups already people rave about them. But having it at that point in history with those people in the room, oof.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:53):\nA lot of tears, I imagine.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:38:54):\nIt was crazy. I mean, it was really wild.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:58):\nI feel like every single person that has gone through, I think it's called Leaders in Tech is the broader umbrella term. And Carole talked about it. Everyone that has gone through it, 100% have told me that it's a transformative life experience for them. And you had a bonus transformational piece. So anyway, if people want to check out that episode, I will include it in the show notes. But the reason I brought it up is Carole shared this framework for how to actually give feedback in a way where people can receive it that I'll just highlight here. I have it here.\n\n(00:39:26):\nAnd it's somewhat related to nonviolent communication, which is what you touched on. And she told me, actually, she taught this way before nonviolent communication came out with their whole philosophy. And it's basically when you want to give someone feedback, the template is when you do a behavior, I feel a feeling, and she's big on like say actual feeling word not like, \"I feel like, or I feel that,\" blah, blah, blah. And step three is, \"I'm telling you this because...\" and then what you want them to change. Do you find that sort of approach helpful?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:40:01):\nI do. I teach the same thing. I think sort of Carole's approach and nonviolent communication, DBT teaches a similar approach. They call dear man.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:12):\nTo me, what's DBT?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:40:14):\nIt's a dialectical behavioral therapy. It's related to CBT. So there's kind of rough consensus in the sort of personal development world of how to ask. And really what they have in common is around staying really factual because I think that what can we know factually well? We can know our thoughts, we can know our feelings because no one else can know that better than us. Maybe we can trust our eyes. What would a video camera have recorded? And that's about it.\n\n(00:40:44):\nSo I think often we get really distracted by all these stories we have about the data, but when we bring it back to that fundamental core of this is what I think, this is what I feel, this is what I've observed in the world, it tends to make the ask a lot clearer versus these stories like you mentioned of, \"I feel like you're an asshole.\" It's like, \"Well, that's a story. That's not a fact.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:07):\nYeah. I feel that is not the right way to say I feel. What do you actually feel? No. Okay, so let's move to step three. We've been going on this whole tangent of therapy and stuff, which is amazing, but let's make sure we cover all three steps. So step one again was articulate what you want. Step two is ask for what you want. What's step three?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:41:28):\nSo to me step three is actually the trickiest for most people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:32):\nSo far, they're all tricky to me.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:41:34):\nOh yeah, they're all tricky, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:36):\nThe most tricky.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:41:38):\nBut step three is accept the response. And it might seem so simple, but it actually is kind of subtle. And so one reason is that idea of sort of the whole body yes or the hell yes. Because I think often we really want a yes. And so we're very, very biased to look for a yes versus accepting no, \"That was a no.\" If someone made this face, that's a no. It doesn't matter what comes out of their mouth. And so the challenge of accepting the response is often that of hearing the no, but not over accepting or under accepting it.\n\n(00:42:18):\nBecause I think sometimes what people who are really afraid to ask will do is they say, oh, well, that was a no. So it's no forever and I should never ask again. My dream is dead and nothing is ever going to happen for me again.\" And that's because they get so scared. But actually no, that's over accepting. The no is just from this person right now in the way that you asked, which doesn't necessarily mean anything about the next time you ask to a different person in a different way, in a different time.\n\n(00:42:44):\nAnd on the flip side, in that sort of more control freak mode, I think for them they'll often skip over the response say, \"Well, they said no, but they don't know what they're talking about.\" Or they're my direct report, so they have to do what I say. So these are all fundamentally disrespectful ways to operate in this relationship. When we're talking about asking for what we want, we're talking about influence. So you need to have good relationships. You can't be influential with a bad relationship.\n\n(00:43:13):\nSo really accepting the response is about, yes, I'm going to be genuine about what I want, but I'm also going to genuinely care about you and have deep respect for your ability to consent or not consent to whatever the ask is. Because I think the counterintuitive thing is that often when we really respect people's no's, it can actually be more influential, more motivating. If someone says, \"Okay. I'm not ready to deliver this on time.\" Be like, \"Okay. Well, I'm going to give the project to another person.\"\n\n(00:43:46):\nI'm taking your no at face value. And they say, \"Oh gosh, well, I didn't realize that was going to be the consequence. Maybe I can get it done by that time.\" And so that way you're not forcing them and you're not coercing them, right? You're just saying, \"No, you said no? So that your no is no, and I accept that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:01):\nSo it feels like part of the skill here is preparing, is knowing. Some people just say no and that's okay. That's part of the experience. Part of it is if there's this not yet component... We had Mihika Kapoor on the podcast. She has a PM at Figma and she had this really great approach to building new things within companies is just like everything to her is not yet and no is a not yet. And the way you phrased it is it could just be the way you asked. It could be, maybe they'll agree if you can figure out a better way to pitch the thing. Is there anything more you can add there about just this idea of it's not no forever?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:44:36):\nAcceptance of the response is primarily an emotional regulation issue because once we get our emotions intact, it's just, is it yes or is it no? And if it's no, which it probably is, most of the time the world tells us no, then the question is, \"All right, what can I learn from this? What am I going to try next?\" And so when we're able to emotionally regulate, it's all very cut and dry, right? It's like, \"Okay. Here's data to tell me what to try next.\"\n\n(00:45:02):\nAnd so really, 99% of the challenge tends to be all the feelings that come up for us when we hear no. Because We hate hearing no. It's so uncomfortable. And so part of the practice of getting good at asking for what we want is recognizing you're going to hear no all the time, and that's completely normal and fine, and it doesn't need to be something so scary or awful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:23):\nEasier said than done in real life. Is there an example of either a client of yours... I know you can't actually share specific details, but I'm just curious if there's an example that comes up of someone dealing with this and getting better at it, or your own career.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:45:38):\nI gave a talk about this sort of right after it happened, but I was fired from Slack three different times, which I feel like has to be some kind of startup record. I don't know who would be the record-keeping body for this. But now 10 years on, I have different perspective, of course. And so this was almost exactly 10 years ago, spring of 2014 and I just gotten the job as the first PM at Slack. It was already the hottest thing out there. It was only a couple dozen employees.\n\n(00:46:03):\nI came in excited, but also a little insecure because I had just come off my breakup with my co-founder. I just wanted to put my head down and do a good job. I was engaged at the time, so Slack already knew I was going to be going away on a bachelor or backpacking trip. I have a wedding and honeymoon in the fall. And so I came in naive and overconfident of, \"I've been a founder. I've worked on iconic products. I know how to do this. I'm a pro. I'm just going to go in and do the work.\"\n\n(00:46:32):\nSo instead of getting really clear on what does success look like here or what's your culture or what are your expectations of me, I just went in and made my best guess and went for it. And lo and behold, turns out what I came in with, that supreme overconfidence was not what they wanted at all. They'd kind of been in the trenches reinventing from the game to Slack. They'd been through layoffs, really hard times together. So they wanted someone to come in humble and to earn their trust of this kind of core team that had been together for years.\n\n(00:47:07):\nI just didn't get any of that. I wasn't hearing that feedback. I wasn't hearing those nos, and I wasn't articulating what I wanted. What I wanted was really very basic. I just wanted to figure out how to do a good job, and I wanted to have a good relationship with the CEO because I was working for him. And you need to have a good relationship with your boss. But the problem was in the first firing anyway was I had not articulated those goals.\n\n(00:47:36):\nAnd so I shouldn't have been surprised when six weeks into my tenure at Slack, I came back from my backpacking trip with my bachelor buddies, and I had an email in my inbox saying, \"Hey, you're fired. It seems like it's not working out. Let me know how you want to wrap it up.\" So as you can imagine, I freaked out. I loved this job, I love this company, so I profusely apologized. I said, \"I'll do whatever it takes. I'm so sorry. I'm going to be committed to turn this around.\"\n\n(00:48:07):\nAnd so early stage startup turns out firing doesn't always stick. Monday morning, I had my job back. But obviously things were not the same as they'd been before because in the second era, what I wanted was sort of better articulated more clear, but all of a sudden that fear that had been under the surface, that insecurity was now very, very present every day because I was terrified of was I going to get fired? Was I going to not make the most of this opportunity? And so I went fully into people pleaser mode. And so that meant that even though what I desperately wanted was to have this good relationship was to be successful, build a great product. I had a year of one-on-ones with the CEO.\n\n(00:48:52):\nI never, never ever asked for what I wanted. I never said it out loud because I was scared. I was scared of what the consequences were. I knew there were a hundred PMs standing behind me ready to take my job if the CEO is ever a moment unhappy with me. I said, \"No, I'm not going to take the risk. I'm too scared of what the consequences might be.\" And so I held all that fear and all those desires of, \"I just want to do a great job. I want us to be awesome partners and build this amazing industry changing product.\"\n\n(00:49:22):\nI never said any of that stuff out loud. I just put my head down and I tried to obey. And so as you can imagine, this didn't work very well. I was feeling horrible day to day. I was terrified of this guy I was working for. And so again, I shouldn't have been surprised, but I was, when I got fired for the second time. It wasn't quite firing. But this time I'd come back from my honeymoon and I had a phone call on Monday that said, \"Seems like product management is not working out for Slack. We're actually just going to get rid of product. You're going to be user research. It's going to be fine.\"\n\n(00:49:56):\nAnd for me, I love user research, but that was the beginning of my career. I was not interested in going back to that. What was fascinating was at that point, I was actually able to articulate what I wanted there and was willing to say it out loud. Because what I wanted was, \"No, let's keep me in product. I've got an idea for how we can run it.\" So I wrote a proposal, I sent it around to the management team. Turns out, when you actually ask for what you want out loud, you're much more likely to get it.\n\n(00:50:21):\nAnd so within a week, this new plan had traction with the management team team and I had my old job back again. Everything was fine except of course it wasn't fine because now I was scared, but the stakes seemed really high, and this is where that deep imposter syndrome sit in. I was like, \"Am I even any good at this? Should I even be in product management? Am I ever going to work in this industry again? Is this going to be my dark secret that I take to the grave that Stewart Butterfield fired me three times?\"\n\n(00:50:58):\nI think what I couldn't be with in that moment was the no's, because I was getting no after no after no after no from Stewart and the rest of the management team saying, \"What you're doing is not working for us, right? Your ask are not landing. You're not being effective in the way that you want to be effective.\" And because I wasn't able to hear those no's again, because to that emotional regulation standpoint, I couldn't handle the feelings of like, \"Ugh, maybe what I'm doing is not good enough.\"\n\n(00:51:26):\nSo instead of pointing the finger at myself, I pointed the finger at him. I said, \"You know what? Actually this guy, he's not such a great manager. He's not so good at product. I'm the one who was on the ground with the users. I know what's right.\" Against all evidence to the contrary, by the way, is this product luminary, visionary, famous person.\n\n(00:51:45):\nSo clearly not based on any facts, but it was an emotional issue of I couldn't deal with the reality of what I was doing was not working. And so again, because I was not articulating what I wanted, I was not asking for it and I certainly was not listening to the no's. I shouldn't have been surprised when finally the third time it came down, and this time it was serious because we had HR.\n\n(00:52:09):\nSo it turns out once you hire HR, the firings are final. And so I only made it to a year at Slack and it was a year of just utter torture because I spent that year being fully out of integrity with myself. Never saying what I really wanted, how I really felt because it didn't feel safe. I was too scared. I kept it all inside. And it took me six months or a year even after that to really feel safe and okay again. It was a serious decompression time.\n\n(00:52:39):\nMy wife and I had a baby during that time. I was on zero sleep. It was a rough, rough period. But the irony is that when I actually came out of that experience, the reality of it was extremely simple. I hadn't articulated what I wanted. I hadn't asked for what I wanted. I had not listened to the no's in response to my non-ask.\n\n(00:53:02):\nAnd so of course I was unhappy with the result. Why would I have expected anything different? I wasn't the victim. Stewart wasn't the villain. It was just ineffective asking. And so to me, especially because I was already on that path towards coaching, that lesson hit really hard in terms of how do we make this work more sustainable?\n\n(00:53:24):\nWe stay in integrity with ourselves even when it's hard, even when it's scary, even when we don't know exactly what the outcome is going to be. And so that's really the story of how I became a coach, of seeing exactly how much I'd screwed up at Slack and seeing how much I had suffered and how much a lot of people suffer in these similar circumstances. All you have to do to turn it around is ask for what you want.\n\n(00:53:45):\nSo this is why I'm so passionate about this stuff because it can sound so fluffy to say, \"Oh, focus on integrity. Honor your desires. No, it's real life stuff of a year of suffering, of pain, of fear.\" I don't want other people to be going through that and that's why I'm so passionate about this stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:08):\nWow, what a story. I love that it's kind of a microcosm of everything we've talked about. You've did all the things that you teach people to avoid.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:54:18):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:18):\nAnd I think what's interesting is you went through these three phases. Interestingly, at the beginning, your first phase was you were not hearing the no's, but it was rooted in this confidence that you're a founder, you're awesome. They're so lucky to have you. I know what I'm doing, get out of my way. And then the third phase, you also, the issue there was you weren't hearing the no's, but it was more from fear of being fired again. And so it's interesting that there's these different reasons you're not hearing what people are actually saying.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:54:46):\nTotally. Well, and to me, the first one is about articulation as well because I think that if in the beginning it articulated that, \"Yeah, I'm confident, but actually I want to do a really good job and I want to have good relationships. So let me think about intentionally, how do I create those outcomes?\" But because I hadn't articulated that's what I wanted, it didn't even occur to me like, \"Oh yeah, I need to do some intentional relationship building, figure out some metrics for success.\"\n\n(00:55:11):\nIt was an early stage startup. There wasn't a ton of sort of process or structure in place, suffice to say. And so if I wanted that, I needed to create it myself, but because I hadn't articulated that any of that was important to me, I just flew by the seat of my pants and it took failing to get some data to say, \"Ooh, yeah, maybe I need to look at this more closely.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:31):\nI imagine you've gone through this exercise many times, but say you were to do it again, what would you do differently and what do you think would've happened? Do you think you would've stayed there for many, many years, had a product at Slack at this point? Just imagining that reality, what would you have done differently? And then what would you have imagined have turned out?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:55:49):\nWell, I mean obviously broadly, I would've asked for what I wanted and what I wanted was I wanted to do the best work of our life. I wanted to have a deep professional partner in the CEO and the rest of the product and management team. And I wanted to produce great work that people loved. And that was part of why I was attracted to the culture and the mission and the company. And so this is what's tricky is of course, that's what I would've done. Now, do I know what the outcome would've been?\n\n(00:56:16):\nNo, I might've been fired even sooner. They might've said, \"No, this is not working out. Let's just be done here.\" So that's what's tricky about this is it really isn't about the outcome. Of course, asking for what you want makes you more likely to get the outcome you want, but you don't do it for guarantee of a certain outcome because no one can promise you that. You do it so you can stay in integrity with yourself and not suffer through all this. Because at least then I would've said, \"You know what? It didn't work out. At least I'm not sitting here suffering. I can get another job at another startup. It's not the end of the world.\"\n\n(00:56:51):\nAnd I think that the mistake we make is pretending that it is of saying, going into fight or flight and saying, \"This is a severe existential threat to who I am and my safety in the world,\" versus being like, \"I'm disappointed. I wish it had worked out, but it didn't.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):\nThat's a really profound point that this practice isn't necessarily to just have everything work out beautifully and to get the things you're looking for. It's to feel like you did, which you could have and to feel integrity with yourself that you did what you needed to do and you're not going to regret something down the road.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:57:29):\nIndeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:31):\nI'm going to take a quick tangent down the being the first PM route real quick. There's a lot of people that think about being the first PM at a startup join as the first PM. I imagine you work with people asking for advice along these lines. It's classically a very challenging role. Many people don't last. Many people follow your trajectory where it's like, \"Oh, shit. What have I done?\" Any advice for people that are a first PM at a company or startup or thinking about that role?\" What can you tell them to help them be successful or at least not suffer?\n\nKenneth Berger (00:58:05):\nTo me, it really is about the relationship with the CEO or with the founders because that's the root of a lot of the issues that come out of that scenario because it's not always you. In my story, I think it was primarily about me, but I also work with a lot of founders who are going through really tough things. My clue to people who report to a founder is to say, \"Imagine if you're confused about how your founder is behaving. Imagine that they're terrified all the time, and see if that makes their behavior more clear.\"\n\n(00:58:38):\nBecause it is scary to be a founder. Everything is on your shoulders. And I think a lot of people do feel that sense of high stakes all the time. And so I think being real about that of what is the state that the person or the people you're working for are in and sort of working within that versus sort of pretending that it's something else or wishing that it were something else is the path to having a healthy relationship. Because if you don't have a healthy relationship with the person you're working for, you're not going to get anything done. You're not going to succeed in any meaningful way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):\nI love that framework of how to think about why a founder is behaving in a certain way. Just maybe a last following thread there is just what should people look for to help them understand if the founder and them are a good fit, if they're going to have a good time working with that founder? Is there anything just like questions they might ask or ways of operating that are useful to understand like, \"Okay, I think I'll be okay with this founder in this company as the first PM or not.\n\nKenneth Berger (00:59:34):\nI think it's a hard thing to generalize about, but to me it really is about understanding expectations. I guess this is a predictable coming from me, \"But what do you really want? Because I think that often the founders put together a job description, but then they're faced with a real human being who has real human subtleties and things they're good at or not so good at.\" And so being very, very clear about expectations and of figuring out collaboratively a way to work together that's effective to me is there's no guarantees of course, but it gives you a more sure path to having a productive relationship.\n\n(01:00:13):\nIt's actually something that I recommend to a lot of founders for maybe their first 10 or 15, or 20 employees of just have a relationship design conversation with each of them when they're first hired. Because I think a lot of us come in naive the way I did, assuming, \"Oh yeah, I'm just going to come in and do my thing the way I've always done it. It's going to be fine.\" Versus coming in and saying, \"I actually don't know how I'm going to operate at this company. I have range like anyone has range, and I don't know what this company needs and who else is here and sort of what my role and what my place is going to be within these other people. And so by really understanding that intentionally and not from a place of performance management, you're already doing this poorly, you're in big trouble. But what is the best way to work together given who we have now and what we want and what we need? Let's figure it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:01):\nComing back to our core topic, is there anything that we didn't cover, anything that I should have asked you about the skill, the art of asking for what you want? Anything else you want to leave listeners with?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:01:12):\nI do want to mention something that I hear a lot from founders when I talk about the piece of working through resistance because I think a lot of them say, \"Oh, you want me to let go of fear and focus on what I want? Well, I mean, I've been running from fear my whole career. That's how I'm so hard-working and I'm so smart is I'm always afraid I'm not good enough.\"\n\n(01:01:34):\nAm I going to be able to do this job without fear hounding me every step of the way? I just remember the first time I heard this, it broke my heart, and now I've heard it dozens of times I'd say. So I mean, it really is. I think it's a belief that sits deep in the hearts of a lot of us high achieving Silicon Valley tech types of, \"My fear of not being good enough is what drives me to be great.\"\n\n(01:02:00):\nAnd I just want to come out here and say there's other ways to motivate. You can motivate based on joy, based on vision, based on your inspiration in this vision of what you want. I think a lot of folks I talk to are skeptical understandably because operated a different way their whole life and all I can really say is try it. Try following an inspiring vision that's really meaningful to you and just see what it's like to not be living in fear all the time because it is a big difference and it's really meaningful. It matters a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:35):\nSo is the fear there that if they ask for what they want, they'll get what they want and they let go of this drive to prove themselves? And is that the fear? How is it that they move away from that need to prove themselves?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:02:51):\nWell, I mean that's a longer story. I would say managing our own fear as a sort of lifelong practice. I'm not going to claim I'm anywhere near done with it. But I guess I'd just say that I think part of the big shift I see in personal development for people I work with is from saying, \"Oh, no, my fear is good. I need it. It's keeping me safe.\"\n\n(01:03:16):\nTo saying, \"Fear is for when there's a tiger chasing you and there's no tiger chasing me.\" I'm sitting in my office in a desk chair on a zoom call. There's no real danger here. And so fear is not particularly functional. And so when they start realizing that, the practice becomes, \"Oh yeah, I'm feeling afraid.\" But I'm reminding myself there's not a tiger in the room. If I really want to get things done, achieve my goals, I need to focus on vision on what I want to achieve in the world, not on avoiding all these fears. So that's the short of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:49):\nAmazing. It reminds me, we have a chat... I had a chat with Matt Mochari, and we spent a bunch of time on dealing with fear and overcoming fear. So folks want to dig deeper there. They could check out that episode. Just maybe one more question before we get to our very exciting lightning round. I want to take us to Contrarian Corner, classic contrarian corner. I'm curious if there's anything that you have a contrarian opinion about, something that you believe that most other people don't.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:04:16):\nFor me, I'm not a big believer in discipline that I think some folks come to coaching looking for a drill sergeant and say, \"All right. Shout at me and tell me to do better.\" And I start to say, \"That's not how I operate.\" Because it's not the discipline doesn't work, but it's like people-pleasing. It's a short-term coping strategy. Discipline will get you in the gym for a week, but it's not going to get you in the gym for a year. The people who are in the gym for a year are doing it because they want to.\n\n(01:04:49):\nThere's actually something that's motivating for them in that. It's not just, \"Oh, I hate this, but I'm going to go anyway.\" And so I try to be really clear with people about that, that I'm not going to be the drill sergeant because it's unsustainable. Someone shouting at you is not going to get you moving towards what you want in life over multiple years. It's days or weeks or even hours thing. And so I really look for a higher bar to say, \"Let's look for true long-term sustainable motivation,\" which means relying on vision, pursuing what you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:25):\nI love that it all ties back to knowing what you want, asking for what you want, and then dealing with the answers that you get.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:05:30):\nI am a broken record admittedly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:33):\nAmazing. Kenneth, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:05:40):\nNo, but just thank you for letting me share this stuff. It really is my life's work and I'm very passionate about it and I hope it's helpful for people. I'm going to be writing more about it on LinkedIn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:51):\nOkay, amazing. We'll point people there. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:05:57):\nI'm ready. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:58):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:06:03):\nWell, I already mentioned Radical Candor. I think that is for sure a modern classic and I think that whole idea of challenging directly, but caring personally is very much aligned with what I'm talking about, right? Because you need the relationships and you need to actually speak your truth. So I love Kim Scott's writing on that stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):\nWe had a Kim Scott on the podcast. Folks want to dig deeper there. We'll link to that episode. I'll let you keep going. Sorry for the interruption.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:06:31):\nYeah. I mean I mentioned before, but I actually took Jonny Miller's Nervous System Mastery course. I just wrapped up. So you've had lots of great personal professional development thinkers on the podcast, so thank you for introducing me to them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:47):\nI'm so happy to hear that. We'll link to that episode as well. I love that. What a circle of life we've got here, guests following other guests, taking their courses, joining the podcast. What a happy world.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:06:58):\nYeah, indeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:00):\nOkay. Any other books before we move on?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:07:02):\nI also love the 15 Commitments of Conscious Leadership, so I'm pretty sure other guests have mentioned that as well. But to me, part of why I like that is that I think a lot of personal development books are not very directive. They say, \"Oh, just dig deeply and find your truth.\" And while there is value to that, of course, I think sometimes it's nice to have some direction of, \"Here's 15 things that generally your life's going to be better if you do them.\" And so to me, it's a nice balance of embracing the really deep stuff of how to live a good life and be effective in the world and be really directive. Try this stuff. It works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:38):\nDo you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:07:43):\nI'm a recent tennis fanatic, so it was one of the things I picked up during the pandemic, so I really enjoyed Netflix's Breakpoint because it's a documentary on the best tennis players in the world. I just find it so... I don't know. It is just beautiful seeing how everyone is the same because all these people, they all know all the strokes perfectly. They're technically perfect in pretty much every way. And so it really is mental.\n\n(01:08:10):\nFor those folks, it is about working through resistance as well. When they have a that says, \"Oh, I'm behind. The other person is better. I'm not going to be able to do this.\" Are they believing that or are they working through that resistance and saying, \"That's just a story I have. I actually don't know what's going to happen, but I'm going to try to win.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:29):\nI love that you see coaching opportunities in everything even entertainment.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:08:34):\nI mean actually speaking of that, I mean, it's almost too on the nose, but there's this movie living from a couple of years ago. This British actor is this sort of tough, old sort of stodgy government office manager, and he gets diagnosed with cancer. And he has this real transformation where he thinks about, \"God, I've just been sitting in an office filing papers my whole life. What do I actually want to do with the last months of my life?\" And he builds this playground for children, and that's actually his legacy. Sorry, actually, spoiler alert. Whoops, should've.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:12):\nYou mentioned tennis and you mentioned British people. I will actually be at Wimbledon this year in London with my dad in July and we're going to host a meetup there while I'm there just for anyone listening right now, just to give you a heads up.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:09:26):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:27):\nHow fun is that going to be? Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:09:33):\nWell, it's funny. I used to be a big wine aficionado, and I think as with many of us, I am discovering I feel better with less alcohol in my life. And so one of the things I've been picking up is oolong tea. I've got a little cup of Taiwanese [foreign language 01:09:51] in front of me, and I feel like it's all the nerdery that I put into wine of regions, and varietals, and history and processing, but it's actually good for me. It's like full of antioxidants and makes me more focused and I can drink it during the day. I've been totally going down a nerdy tea rabbit hole, and I recommend it. Taiwanese mountain teas especially.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:16):\nI got to give me some of that. I always have tea here when I'm doing these podcasts. I'm a less sophisticated tea drinker. I just go with Earl Grey, but a really nice Earl Grey, and so I'm going to have to buy some of this. Do you have a place in a brand you recommend most?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:10:30):\nThere's lots of great stores online. You can check out teafromtaiwan.com. That's a good one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:36):\nThey're going to get a bunch of traffic. They're like, \"What the hell just happened?\" Teafromtaiwan.com amazing. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, find useful, share with friends or family and work around life?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:10:52):\nI mean, I'm pretty sure you can guess, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:54):\nI wonder what it might be. I wonder what it might be.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:11:00):\nSo this is actually part of why I started writing this book, is because my friends were probably annoyed with me telling them, \"Have you asked for what you wanted? Ask for what you want.\" Because yeah, it's best advice I have is to ask for what you want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:15):\nIt all just comes back to that final question. We've been talking a lot about asking for what you want. Kenneth Berger, what do you want?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:11:25):\nOoh. All right. Well, I think for me, Lenny, you are already an industry luminary with thousands of followers. I am interested in sharing more of these ideas. So if y'all would come follow me on LinkedIn and subscribe to my newsletter, I'm going to be exploring these ideas and sharing more of this stuff because I just am so passionate about it. I'd love if you'd come and join me in that journey, bring questions and ideas, and I'd love to talk about this stuff because I just find it endlessly interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:00):\nBut you're working on a book along these lines at some point that will come out, right?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:12:03):\nThat's right, that's right. I am working on it in book form, but part of what I've been doing is I realize I want to work on it in community. Speaking of asking for what you want, I mean, for me, it's not just about my vision and my framing, but I'm a coach. I'm not just about big ideas. I'm about making a difference for my clients. And so I realize, if I really want to make a difference with people, I need... It's like a product, I need to get out in the world and test out these ideas and see what lands with people and what's effective for them and what works, and hear the stories and really get into it. So that's kind of why I've been putting myself more out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:39):\nAmazing. So along those lines, two last questions. Where can folks actually find you online and follow the stuff that you're writing and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKenneth Berger (01:12:47):\nSo you can find me on LinkedIn. I'm Kenneth Berger, B-E-R-G-E-R. So please follow me there. Subscribe to the Ask for What You Want newsletter. And you can check out my website, kberger.com, K-B-E-R-G-E-R.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:01):\nKberger.com. Kenneth, you're amazing. Thank you so much for sharing so much wisdom with us. I think we've helped a lot of people. Thank you for being here.\n\nKenneth Berger (01:13:09):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:10):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Taxi mafias, cash vaults & 100% MoM growth: The story of SEA’s biggest startup | Kevin Aluwi (Gojek)\n\n## Transcript\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:00:00):\nIn the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services. The most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them, and I think it would've been easy for us to say like, \"Hey, they're all contractors. They're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out.\" But instead, we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help our drivers in those situations, to help kind of extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time.\n\nLenny (00:01:16):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Kevin Aluwi. Kevin is the co-founder and former CEO of a company called Gojek, which I've always been fascinated by. You may recall a former guest Crystal Widjaja, who was head of growth at Gojek, and I've always wanted to get more of the story. Gojek is infamous for their scrappiness, their unique approach to ops and growth, and as being one of the first and most successful super apps in the world. They've also long been maybe the biggest startup in Indonesia and all of Southeast Asia. Kevin and the story of Gojek have a lot to teach founders in the US and all over the world, and so I was really excited to sit down with Kevin to dig into the story, he did not disappoint.\n\n(00:02:04):\nYou'll hear all kinds of wild stories about them having to hire a private security team to protect their drivers, having to build their own cash distribution centers to pay their drivers, plus how they won in large part thanks to their early investment in brand, why it's important to do the hard things as a startup. Also, why super apps are surprisingly overrated and much more. Enjoy this episode with Kevin Aluwi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:29):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda. You've heard me talk about how Coda is the doc that brings it all together, and how can I help your team run smoother and be more efficient? I know this firsthand because Coda does that for me. I use Coda every day to wrangle my newsletter content calendar, my interview notes for podcasts, and to coordinate my sponsors. More recently, I actually wrote a whole post on how Coda's product team operates, and within that post, they shared a dozen templates that they use internally to run their product team, including managing the roadmap, their OKR process, getting internal feedback, and essentially their whole product development process is done within Coda.\n\n(00:03:07):\nIf your team's work is spread out across different documents and spreadsheets and a stack of workflow tools, that's why you need Coda. Coda puts data in one centralized location regardless of format, eliminating roadblocks that can slow your team down. Coda allows your team to operate on the same information and collaborate in one place. Take advantage of this special limited time offer just for startups. Sign up today at coda.io/lenny and get a thousand dollars startup credit on your first statement. That's coda.io/lenny to sign up and get a startup credit of $1,000. Coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:03:45):\nThis episode is brought to you by rows.com, the world runs on spreadsheets. You probably have a tab open with a spreadsheet right now, but the spreadsheet product you're using today was designed decades ago, and it shows. They live in silos away from your business data. They weren't made to be used on a phone. And if you want to do even the simplest automation, you have to figure out complex scripts that are nightmare to maintain. Rows is different. It combines a modern spreadsheet editor, data integrations with APIs and your business tools and a slick sharing experience that turns any spreadsheet into a beautiful interactive website that you'll be proud to share.\n\n(00:04:20):\nIf you're writing a report on a growth experiment, you can use Rows to do your analysis on data straight from BigQuery or Snowflake. If you're deep diving on marketing, you can import reports straight from Google Analytics, Facebook ads, or Twitter. Or if you're working with sales, you can natively plug Stripe, Salesforce or HubSpot directly into Rows. And when you're done, you can share your work as a beautiful spreadsheet that's easy to read and embed charts, tables and calculators into Notion, Confluence or anywhere on the web. I've already moved some of my favorite spreadsheet templates to Rose. Go to rows.com/lenny to check them out. That's rows.com/lenny.\n\n(00:05:01):\nKevin, welcome to the podcast.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:05:03):\nThank you. Thanks for having me, Lenny. We've finally made it happen after a few weeks or months of going back and forth.\n\nLenny (00:05:10):\nYeah, I'm really excited to finally meet you and to dig into a bunch of stuff. I think this is going to be a really unique episode. I don't often have founders on the podcast, especially founders of companies that are not based in the US. In this case, Indonesia, Crystal Widjaja, who is on this podcast previously. One of my favorite guests is just like \"Lenny, you got to get Kevin on your podcast.\" And so here we are.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:05:32):\nI'm glad to be in a small group of category of people that you invite. Thank you. I'm a huge fan of what you do.\n\nLenny (00:05:38):\nThanks, man, I really appreciate that. And just redirect to you, you are the co-founder of a company called Gojek. Many people listening have never heard of Gojek, especially people in the US. So just to start, can you just describe what is Gojek, what do y'all do? And then also I think more interestingly is just the scale of I think people in the US, their mind will blow once they hear the scale you've reached with this company. They probably hadn't heard of it.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:06:03):\nSo Gojek started as a motorcycle taxi based service. So it's a kind of uniquely Indonesian things where we have millions of motorcycle taxi drivers in all of the urban centers in Indonesia. And so we started with a very local problem and the first product was a on-demand super app, if you will, where you could ask someone on a motorcycle to give you a ride, send a package for you or buy something and deliver it to you. This then evolved over the years into a more general on demand consumer super app that also included car drivers and other services ranging from the ones mentioned to grocery deliveries and payments and financial services.\n\n(00:06:52):\nAnd today we took the company public about a year and a half ago after we merged with Indonesia's top e-commerce platform. And we've managed to also expand outside of just Indonesia, where today we have about 2.7 million drivers across Southeast Asia. We've completed about 3 billion orders last year, so that's 3 billion orders. So the scale of our region is often under underappreciated, where we also have about 15 million merchants doing general e-commerce, but also restaurants on our food delivery service. And on that IPO, we're pretty proud to say that it was Indonesia's largest IPO of all time, where we raised over a billion dollars at something like 27, 28 billion dollars in terms of valuation.\n\nLenny (00:07:50):\nAnd these numbers you shared 2.7 million drivers, 30 billion orders,\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:07:55):\n3 billion.\n\nLenny (00:07:57):\n3 billion. How would that compare to an Uber or Lyft?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:07:58):\nI don't know what their latest numbers are, but just in terms of the numbers of people and the number of activity, I would place our scale among the largest US companies.\n\nLenny (00:08:10):\nThat's pretty wild that there's this company out there that a lot of people didn't know about that is basically of the scale of Uber and Lyft.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:08:17):\nIn terms of volume, I would say that we're up there with Uber globally and definitely larger than Lyft. I don't remember how many drivers are in the US, but we definitely have more drivers in the region than all of America.\n\nLenny (00:08:35):\nJust to kind of check this check box, you said it was a super app. What are all the things that Gojek does? Just whatever you want to share, all the things that you can do.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:08:43):\nFrom the point when we had the most services, we had everything from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery deliveries. We had moving services on trucks and vans. We had on demand massages, cleaning services. You could get your hair done on Gojek, you could order movie tickets, you could get a loan, you could pay for things. I think at our peak we had something like near 30 different services all in one app.\n\nLenny (00:09:18):\nI think it's like you're officially a super app if your founder can't even remember all the things that you do right now.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:09:25):\nYeah, definitely. I would challenge anyone within the company to be able to name all of our services that we've ever had on the app because it was pretty wild at one point. And I'd love to talk a little bit about my thoughts on super apps at some point during the session because I definitely have some mixed views over it as a product strategy as we've gone through that whole cycle.\n\nLenny (00:09:54):\nIt might be actually a good time just to jump into it. I know that I was actually saving that for later, but this might be a good time. And part of the reason I think this is really interesting is if you open up Uber these days, it's like 40 things that they're offering now. Elon at Twitter is talking about turning Twitter into a super app like payments, communication, messaging, all these things. So I think it's a really interesting trend that continues to pop up here in the US and I would absolutely love to hear your perspective on super apps.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:10:19):\nOkay, I'm going to come off a little strong on this, but I am kind of annoyed at how much it's being mentioned these days. It's really popular in VC-consultant-analyst circles because it sounds really great on a strategy deck because all of the things that are really appealing, we'll talk about lower customer acquisition costs, higher attach rates to different products, talk about higher retention across different services, the ease of cross-selling and upselling. All of these things sound great, but in reality, a lot of those benefits don't pan out. And one probably really good example that I like to reference is that I remember one of our products was mobile phone top up and recharge. In Southeast Asia, a majority of people are on prepaid plans instead of postpaid plans. So everyone basically buys their minutes and their data plans upfront in the beginning of the week or the beginning of the month.\n\n(00:11:27):\nSo we had a product which was a mobile top-up product. And so the reason I mentioned this specific product as a really illustrative point on super apps is that it's a product that 95% plus of our customers need because they're all on prepaid plans. So it's a very relevant product. And we had our UX research research team actually look into why the engagement in the product wasn't as high as we thought it should be. So one of the questions that our URX team asked our customers was like, \"Hey, do you know that you could top up your mobile minutes and by data on the Gojek app?\" And only about 40% of our customers, like 30 or 40% of our customers knew that this product existed. And that completely blew our minds because one, it's a product that is relevant for all of our customers.\n\n(00:12:25):\nTwo, it was literally there on one of the six buttons on the homepage. And I think the insight that we got here was that there kind of needs to be a unifying concept across all of your services within the app for your users to be able to think about your product in a sensible way. And for us, the way that our customers thought about us was that they thought about the driver. And so when we went from ride hailing to package delivery to food delivery, to grocery delivery, customers really understood that. And we didn't have to sell this idea to our customers that you had all of these services under one app because they thought about the Gojek driver. That made sense. You can easily cross sell somebody from a ride hailing customer to a grocery customer or a food delivery customer because they understood the unifying factor there being the driver.\n\n(00:13:24):\nBut then when you start doing other things that don't have that unifying factor in terms of the concept that a customer has when they think about your service, it starts breaking down. So one other fun UXR insight here was when we launched massage services. So we had at one point though we've shut it down a few years after, we had massage services where you can order a masseuse to come to your place. And a question that many of our customers asked was that, \"oh, is the driver going to come into my house and give me a massage?\" And for us, that was insane. Of course not, our drivers are not trained masseuses, but that was the question that people asked because they thought like, \"oh, this app is an app for these driver related services, so if there was a massage service, I'm assuming it's that same man who's going to give me a massage.\"\n\n(00:14:17):\nAnd so I think this kind of illustrates the importance of having these unifying concepts that are easy for customers to think about the multiple different services. It's not as simple as just saying, oh, we have a lot of engagement, we have a lot of eyeballs at a service. And then you have a super app that makes sense for customers. And so that whole nirvana of lower CAC, higher retention that are all on these great strategy decks often don't pan out because you kind of have to then resell this idea of like, oh, this is another service and that you can use. And that's a bit of investment that you have to actually put in terms of advertising and customer education that increases those customer acquisition costs.\n\n(00:15:03):\nAnd it also leads to design constraints because there's only so many ways you can display a whole bunch of different services that actually have little to do with each other, which is why when you see super apps today, it's kind of like this giant menu or this giant grid which does limit the design decisions that you can make, which is unfortunate because if you actually, I think it's an unsolved problem at this point.\n\nLenny (00:15:28):\nIt's hilarious story about the massage product. Sounds like a lot of startups are going to have some issues scaling to new products and trying to become a super app. I want to shift a little bit and talk about brand. I did a little research on you ahead of this chat. I watched your Marshall graduation and speech and a few other interviews you did, and something that came out of your previous writing and talks is just how much you care about brand and how much value you put into brand. And that you just have a lot of opinions about the importance of brand. And to me and to most people, brand is this really squishy thing and it's hard to know what exactly to do to build your brand, when to prioritize it, how to prioritize it amongst other things you're doing, especially early on. So I'd love to hear your advice for founders that are listening and just like, what should I actually do around brand? What's your advice for how to tactically do something about brand and also just why do you think it's so important?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:16:23):\nI do agree with you that it is kind of this squishy thing that most people see as an afterthought, may be because it is kind of this squishy thing that it's hard to define, but I'm a very big believer that the two most important things in a consumer business are product and brand in that order. And I don't think I need to sell the idea, especially to your audience. That product is absolutely critical and probably the most important. But brand as an afterthought is definitely one of the areas where I think there's a giant missed opportunity for consumer tech businesses. And I get why we opened the session by talking about the size of the business to get an appreciation of the scale for audience members who might be unfamiliar with us or with the region.\n\n(00:17:16):\nBut I wish I did have to start there because we actually started as a very scrappy company where we were by far the underfunded player and without brand. We probably would've never gotten to escape velocity beyond that scrappy stage, we've maintained our leadership in Indonesia through a lot of the things that we actually did on the brand side to give you a sense of how scrappy we had to be in competition.\n\n(00:17:52):\nFor the first six months after launching our app, we had only raised about $2 million and our regional competitor had already raised 250. So they had literally more than a hundred times more capital than we have. So it's easy to talk about what we built as this kind of giant business, but we came from a place where we were seriously underfunded. And I think a big reason why we survived was that we built a great brand for our consumers and for our drivers and for our merchants. And I think that great brands create associations in their customer's minds that transcend the typically transactional or utilitarian one that most people have with businesses and they become part of one's identity.\n\n(00:18:42):\nI think some of the best-in-class examples of these are probably all the Apple fanboys and fangirls, Nike sneakerheads, for these individuals, the brand becomes a really big part of their identity and their loyalty towards the products of the company go beyond a relationship that can easily be swayed just through discounts or other more features that other competitors might have. And so I'm a really firm believer of how important this is because you can see it if you step out of the tech bubble for a second, you can see that there's so many great companies out there that really rely on the strength of their brand to build these fantastic businesses and to create great experiences for their customers. And you ask, what are the things that one can do?\n\n(00:19:45):\nI think for us, we invested a lot in our brand across multiple areas. And I think one specific area that I think is really important is that you create consistency across all customer touchpoints. And so branding is not just cool logo, cool advertising, fun imagery, but it's really about the impression that a customer or user has with your product and with your business. So having that consistency across all customer touchpoints is really important. So how you write copy and advertising and in the app, how you've even designed the app, but we were the first company of scale to have ads that don't take ourselves too seriously. We make fun of ourselves, we make fun of our cultural observations of Indonesia. And again, to just build this overall field that like, Hey, we get, we are part of the overall culture of Indonesia. And I think even going beyond the more aesthetic or communication oriented investments, we also leaned into cultural artifacts in our product features to really build this brand that is part of day-to-day culture.\n\n(00:21:09):\nOne of my favorite cultural artifacts is that in Asia it's fairly common to send food as gifts to your loved ones or maybe people you're interested in dating. So people would send over food as gifts to their romantic interests. And so when we launched our food delivery service, a lot of people were actually using it for this, I'm going to send it to my boyfriend or my girlfriend or the person that I'm interested in dating. And so it became this whole cultural phenomenon of sending go-food for these people and we kind of lean into it in our product feature where all of the other players in the market at the time basically only allowed you to deliver food to your home or your office, but we actually created a feature that allowed you to choose a delivery point that was far away from where you were.\n\n(00:22:04):\nThere was a lot of reasons why other companies didn't allow it at the time because it's like, oh, it might be used for fraud and stuff like that. But we leaned into it, we leaned into it and actually created features that allowed to put your pickup point far away from where your actual location was. And then we just had fun with this whole idea of go-food dating. And so yes, it's kind of part of branding, but thinking about branding beyond just marketing communication but actually be as being relatable and being part of the culture and being sensitive of what that culture is, I think was something that we did really well in the early days that allowed us to continue maintaining leadership in spite of the fact that our competitors had more money, which meant that they could offer more discounts, they could offer more incentives to drivers, but we really kind of lean very hard into being not just a utilitarian commodity, which is what a lot of people would say is the nature of our business to some level of accuracy.\n\nLenny (00:23:08):\nSo just to get even more concrete, one takeaway from what you just shared, which is interesting, is the first part of figuring out how to approach your brand is what's the personality of your product for you? You said it was like we're just of the people, we're like you, we're here to help you, make your life easier. And then that informs the copy, the messaging, be a little, I forget how you describe it, but just almost bad grammar and stuff just because it relates more to people and then some of these product launches that connect to that. So maybe if there's anything else you want to add there that'd be interesting. And then what's like, I don't know, one or two moments that most helped build the brand. I know you're kind of famous for having helmets and jackets on the drivers that help spread the Gojek brand. Is there anything else that just like, wow, this was really effective to build this brand that ended up dominating Indonesia?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:23:58):\nThe jackets and helmets piece I think is really, really important for two reasons. One, the more obvious reason, which is that because they were just all over the streets of many cities in Indonesia, people were familiar with the imagery and the names, but I think it's also really important that people saw what was happening. So if we were like, I don't know, an airline and we branded a bunch of people on the streets with our brand, yeah, sure, that might help with brand recall and people might know about the name. But what was really powerful was that when people would be seeing these drivers with their jackets and helmets, they would be seeing passengers on the backseat as they were stuck in traffic. So I'm stuck in traffic and I'm seeing these people whiz past me with with this imagery on them, and immediately I get that association like, oh, I'm stuck in traffic, but I could be out there cutting through traffic on a motorcycle or you see them carrying packages or delivering food, and you immediately get like, oh, these are guys who can deliver food or deliver packages for me.\n\n(00:25:14):\nAnd so it was like this beautiful combination of one just having that imagery and having that visual everywhere as a reminder of the brand. But more importantly, it was also a physical reminder of the service of what we do and of how we can help you. And so looking for these opportunities where again, customers can make that connection between the logo and the colors and the name with actually what the service is, I think are the opportunities that I would say people should look out for. They're admittedly quite rare, which is why in my opinion, the laziest kind of branding tends to be the most popular. Just put your name and your copy on a billboard or on a CPM or CPC campaign. But there are these opportunities I think, on being able to reinforce the value proposition of your business in a way that is beyond just visual recall. And I think that was why that specific anecdote is something I like to talk about because it was really one of those special things that reminded people on why we're here.\n\nLenny (00:26:37):\nYeah, I think you tweeted that it was one of the most important things you ever did as a company is decide to put these logos on the helmets and jackets. Reminds me of Lyft's pink mustache, which went away, but felt like a really important way for them to differentiate.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:26:51):\nNo, totally.\n\nLenny (00:26:53):\nYou talked about how scrappy you've been, and I want to dig into that a little bit more. I think there's like US startup scrappy, and then there's like Gojek scrappy, and it'd be fun to hear maybe a story or two just to illustrate how ridiculously scrappy you were as a company early on, especially.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:27:11):\nOne thing that we did in the early days that was absolutely crazy was that we were one of the pioneering companies, one of the pioneering technology companies in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia. And so we came into a environment where a lot of the things that maybe companies or people in more developed economies take for granted, for example, having electronic or digital payments, that was something that actually didn't really exist that much when we first started. And so we had a problem of actually trying to pay drivers because drivers every day we would be paying out incentives or just having customers pay with their credit cards or their store balance, and then we'd have a challenge and getting our drivers to actually be able to take that money out for their earnings. And in the early days, we actually had cash booths. So we actually had physical spaces with a vault and cash sitting in the vault where drivers can show up that, oh, this is my driver ID and this is the balance that I have with you. Please give me the cash.\n\n(00:28:31):\nAnd so we would have these actual physical locations where there would be lions of drivers essentially taking cash. And we eventually figured this out of like, okay, we'll work with a bank and integrate with an ATM network and all that. But in the early days we just did it ourselves of building essentially a mini at ATM network, which I think even that sounds too fancy of what it was it. Because it was literally a booth with a vault with cash in it. And we had at the time already tens of thousands of drivers all across in Indonesia.\n\n(00:29:10):\nAnother scrappy story that actually Crystal reminded me of recently that we did was at the time there was a lot of fake driver apps out there because we didn't have all of the security investments that we eventually made, things like code obfuscation and better API security that wouldn't allow for these fraudulent driver apps, these basically third party driver apps to connect to our platform. So there were a lot of these drivers using these third party driver apps that were doing things that... So they were kind of doing unsavory things like stealing driver details, some of them even as bad as financial details so that they can then at some point drain driver funds. And the way that they did it, the way that they convinced drivers to actually use these apps was that they actually added some features that at the time we didn't allow. So things like we wanted drivers to be conscious of what was happening on the app, and so we would actually make sure that drivers would push the accept order button.\n\n(00:30:28):\nWe made sure that that was the only way that drivers could accept orders, but this app had a functionality that would automatically accept orders as soon as they came in. And so actually it was kind of this interesting situation where they were doing things that were fraudulent and were not safe for the integrity of the platform, but at the same time they were also providing some value to the people who were using them. And so at the time we had to make a decision of like, okay, we need to nip this in the bud and one way that we could have done it, that would've taken time was it really invest in a lot of the technical security aspects of it, but we didn't have the bandwidth to be able to do that. Engineering and security talent is actually super scarce in Southeast Asia at the time, still is today, but at that time extremely scarce.\n\n(00:31:25):\nAnd so we ended up making the decision of actually copying those features. So we actually saw all of these third party fraudulent apps and instead of building a whole system to prevent them from being built or preventing them from working on the platform, we just said, \"Hey, let's take their top two or three features and let's build them into our app.\" And that actually significantly reduced the number of users on these third party apps just by having this mentality of you can't beat them, then join them. And that I would say that wasn't a philosophical decision or a principal decision. Is was actually a decision made out of necessity because we simply couldn't build all the capability to combat these apps at the time?\n\nLenny (00:32:13):\nAre you hiring or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity?

That's amazing. I knew there would be good stories in this question and I'm glad you delivered. There's also this feeling of within Gojek of just doing the hard thing and you just shared a couple stories of this versus the simple... A lot of startups are like, let's do the simplest thing, feels like you guys lean into the hard thing. Why is that? Where'd that come from? And then is there any other story of something that you did that was like, we'll do it the hard way?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:33:41):\nI really don't like the idea of moats. Again, one of the concepts that gets thrown out a lot by strategy type folks of what's the moat of your business or your product? And usually people are looking for an answer like, oh, look at this capability or look at this feature or look at this distribution partner or all of those kind of things. And I don't believe that any moats are durable over time. Eventually with enough time all moats can be crossed. And I think one so-called moat that doesn't get talked about enough is the fact that you're able to do hard things because hard things are hard and just simply doing things that are hard, as long as they create value to your customers, actually is a position that makes it harder for your competitors to be able to win over your customers because it's hard to do those things.\n\n(00:34:52):\nAnd probably another example of doing something that sounds very difficult was that in the early days of Gojek, there was a lot of resistance to our services and one of the forms of that resistance, one of the more most common form of that resistance in the early days was actually by motorcycle taxi mafia. So you would have these areas that are essentially controlled through violence by specific area mafia. And when we start having drivers pick up orders and pick up passengers, these people would actually physically assault our drivers. We've had everything from bricks thrown at our drivers to knives and machetes being brandished at them to just physical altercations, literally mobs of people getting into these brawls. And there was a lot of these kind of things that actually happened in the streets of Jakarta at the time. And I think it would've been easy for us to say, \"Hey, they're all contractors, they're third parties, let them kind of just sort it out.\"\n\n(00:36:14):\nBut instead we actually hired private security. So we actually work with private security companies to help these situations, to help our drivers in those situations, to help extract them out of these sticky situations. And so we actually ran a fairly big private security operation for a fairly long time until it became common to have Gojek drivers do all of these things across cities. We actually ran this very operation intensive thing just to make sure that our drivers could be as safe as possible and it showed our commitment to the driver community, it showed our commitment that we cared. And again, going back to that earlier point around having that branding association, drivers knew that, hey, we weren't just a platform that didn't care. We actually cared about their safety and that helped build that goodwill even as competitors started coming in and paying more money, we still had a lot of loyalty within the driver community because of things like that.\n\nLenny (00:37:30):\nHow did you actually have a security person on a motorcycle? Were they pretending to be the rider and then just get out and punch them in the face?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:37:39):\nA minority of situations were like that, but a lot of that was just like, having an on-call service where they could just dial a number and somebody within a 5-10 minute distance would actually show up. And so we would have these patrols effectively in specific hotspots where if there was a situation brewing that they would instantly or almost instantly show up to the site and help diffuse it.\n\nLenny (00:38:13):\nI love that you have this super app that's doing all these things for people. Plus within the company you've built all these mini businesses, like a whole bank to pay people, private security company. There's probably some other... Crystal shared a story of you guys rented out a stadium for drivers to collect all the drivers and give them phones.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:38:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:38:34):\nOkay. This is great.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:38:34):\nYeah, that I think is probably one of the hallmarks of this region in general where I have no doubt that what we were building and what we are today is a technology company, but I do think that in the early days you do have to be a lot more operations heavy. And then I think that lends to that scrappiness because there are a lot of things that to solve elegantly and technically will take a lot of time and just kind of over focusing on those type of solutions I think would be doing your customers a disservice because there are opportunities to make things a lot better just through probably more innovation in operations to kind of kickstart things until you have the more elegant, scalable, technical or product solution.\n\nLenny (00:39:38):\nThat reminds me that at Gojek, you held tons of different roles throughout the time you were there. You were obviously co-founder, your Co-CEO at one point, defacto CPO at one point, CIO, CFO. I heard that you were writing like push notification copy, became a driver at one point just to keep things running. So feels like another good example of exactly what you're talking about of just doing the hard thing in the operational component.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:40:05):\nI mean, yes, actually I did have a stint as an amateur performance marketer in the early days of Gojek. I would write copy, I would upload ads onto Facebook and Google and try and do my best in optimizing our online marketing spend. But I think I did all of those things, not because I wanted to be scrappy necessarily, but I do think that as, and this is probably most relevant for founders, less for executives, but I think as a founder, I do think it's really important to understand the work that needs to be done in order to see what excellence looks like. And for us, again, we came from an ecosystem where the availability of experienced talent was relatively low. And so for me it was very hard to be able to say, \"oh, let's hire person X from organization Y with job description Z,\" and we know that they probably can deliver because again, the talent availability was really low.\n\n(00:41:16):\nAnd so a lot of times I felt like I needed to understand, okay, what is this job? What exactly does it entail is, and seeing how bad I am at it allowed me to understand what good looked like. And so I held a lot of those roles just because I wanted to understand every part of the business as best as I could in order to then find somebody who could do it orders of magnitude better than myself. I would say that is true for all of these roles except for being a driver. I think being a driver, I wasn't trying to understand what excellence as a driver look like. Obviously the drivers do a really challenging job and I think I just wanted to understand what that role was like to build a lot more empathy towards the job and make sure that our product was catered towards what those needs were.\n\n(00:42:12):\nSo when we first launched our car ride hailing services, I think I was the first actual driver on the app and I would every now and then be a driver. And I remember the early days when I actually picked up a customer. It was this lady and she put in her destination as a mall. And so I went to this house and I knew that, okay, I needed to drive to this mall, but then this lady comes out with this giant bag and so I had to hop out the car, take this giant bag, put it in my trunk, and then off we went. And in the middle of the drive she's like, \"Hey, I need to drop off and do my laundry on the way to the mall.\" And I just had to, \"okay, cool.\" We took a detour, I lugged this giant bag out of our trunk and helped this lady do her laundry.\n\n(00:43:17):\nAnd then we went to the mall and I got very little money out of that experience and it wasn't instant, but this is eventually what led to, I think a lot of the support I gave to our driver teams when they were pushing for, Hey, we need more waiting fees, we need to add multiple stops in order to make sure that hey, a lot of this extra work was actually compensated. And it was something that I obviously experienced personally and it was something that I definitely was excited about as a set of product features and principles when it came to building our driver app.\n\nLenny (00:43:58):\nIt feels like having to do that ends up being a feature as you said, that you actually experienced a lot of these challenges and you said the really good point about knowing what to hire and what these people are going to actually do.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:44:07):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:44:07):\nThat's interesting how that often turns into a good thing. I know you also have a pretty interesting journey into tech. What can you share around that?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:44:18):\nSo I am basically a failed finance professional. I didn't really know what I wanted to do in my life. And in 2005, which is when I entered college, the hot sexy thing to do was finance. And I guess that was what I wanted to do. And I went, studied finance, and then the crash of 2008 happened and I graduated 2009, so it's probably the worst time to try and be a finance professional. And so I went through a really challenging time there, but eventually I got a job at a boutique investment banking firm. And that was, I thought like, okay, now I was set for life. I got the job that I wanted. I'm working in finance. But then long story short, I was not very good. I was not very good. My bosses thought I was underperforming. I didn't feel like I was performing, and I kind of left that field that I thought I built my entire, I guess future dreams and identity around.\n\n(00:45:32):\nAnd after I did that, I decided to take a bet in Indonesian technology because when all of this was happening was around 2010, 2011, and it was starting to see the development of the current technology giants in the US at the time. And I thought that it would be pretty cool if Indonesia ever had a technology industry to be part of it at the ground floor. And so I moved back in 2011 and it was super early. It was really early at the time where the level of talent, the level of funding, the level of product market fit, the number of people who transacted on the internet was also still super low. People still saw the internet as a place for chat apps and social media. And so the level of belief that people had in the space at that time was pretty low.\n\n(00:46:30):\nPeople didn't think that real businesses and real valuable products could be built, especially be built locally. And so taking that bet was something that I think it really panned out for us to be really early in the space, which today has become very vibrant to the scene. Southeast Asia has become, I think one of the most exciting spaces in technology in the world to date. But at the time it wasn't obvious. And being able to see that development I think was something that was really important to me because it really shows you what's possible in a very short time. And I think it's something that probably people in technology in the US can relate to, the people who've been working in this space for like 20, 30 years. But being able to see those early days for me was just really valuable and I think was an experience that I definitely cherish.\n\nLenny (00:47:31):\nIt's really hard to just build a company outside of Silicon Valley, and it was even harder back then. COVID and remote work almost made it the easiest it's ever been.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:47:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:40):\nSounds like a lot of the fact that you were so far away from the Bay Area informed the way that you built this company, the scrappiness that you talked about. I'm curious if you have any advice for a founder who's trying to build a company now outside of, say the Bay Area or just US in general based on your experience.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:47:58):\nYeah, look, it was super hard back then. It was particularly hard because Indonesia is such a valuable market, Indonesia and the rest, I would say primarily Indonesia just because of its scale. But I think overall Southeast Asia was just such a valuable market and it was interesting for global companies to want to win it. So we competed with global and regional companies, but the local talent and funding ecosystems were really underdeveloped. So that challenge of having to compete with the best in the world for customers in the market while also not having all of the resources available within the market to be able to build products and companies that can compete was I would say one of the most challenging parts of building probably in markets that are atypical or outside of Silicon Valley and maybe some of the other technology centers in the world like China and India.\n\n(00:49:01):\nSo some of my learnings probably there that I would take going forward is I think we talked a lot about being scrappy. In the beginning, we were a lot more ops-heavy than tech-heavy. And doing the things that don't scale through other means I think is definitely something that is absolutely necessary if you're building outside of these main technology hubs. Another thing I would say is you need to get good at remote work really early. And I think today that's kind of become a lot more prevalent as more and more people have experience with remote work. For us, we built an engineering center in Bangalore in 2015, and this allowed us to compete a lot better with the global giants because we had access to a really deep talent market in India at the time, but we were really early in this whole remote work thing because it wasn't common for people in our region, but also globally to have so much talent concentration outside of headquarters.\n\n(00:50:14):\nAnd I do believe that companies who want to compete against world class competitors outside of these technology centers like Silicon Valley need to become good at remote work really fast because getting that talent probably means having offices or individuals who are outside of your home market or your headquarters. And probably the final I would say tip here is don't just copy, because Gojek was not an Uber clone, even though that was kind of how some investors or analysts talk about us, we were focused on a solution that was uniquely an Indonesian phenomenon, the motorcycle taxi driver. And this led to both product and branding innovation. On the product side, we were an on-demand super app because we saw that a human being on a motorcycle could do a lot of things. And so we built a product around that idea and hence we ended up with a super app even before super apps were really a thing.\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd then that branding point that we talked about a little earlier about giving our drivers jackets and helmets so people could see them zip around town, which actually doesn't make sense if you're a car ride hailing service because it's not very easy to brand a car and the drivers are inside the car. But all of our competitors at the time when they first entered the motorcycle ride hailing space didn't brand their drivers because they came from a car-centric view. And so again, understanding your unique market dynamics is also really important if you're building outside of these technology centers.\n\nLenny (00:52:10):\nWe've been chatting about Indonesia and Southeast Asia. I'd love to hear just what should people know about that market? We've chatted about what you guys have built and a few other companies here and there, but what companies should people be aware of what's happening? What's the latest, what's exciting?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:52:24):\nYeah, I think specifically Indonesia, most people don't know that Indonesia is the fourth largest country in the world and that Southeast Asia holds almost 10% of the world's population. But beyond the macro picture, I think also we've experienced a pretty unique level of pace of adoption for products with great product market fit. So products with great product market fit grow tremendously fast in this part of the world. And in 2015, for example, when we launched our app, we grew more than a hundred percent month on month for the first 16, 18 months. So we more than doubled every month for more than a year.\n\nLenny (00:53:16):\nThat is insane. I've never heard of that.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:53:19):\nNo, and our investors at the time, Sequoia is one of our investors at the time, told us that this was the craziest growth story that they've ever heard of in the world. And I wouldn't say because of our necessarily our brilliance, it was a combination of how in Indonesia and in Southeast Asia, there are a lot of these things that are obviously broken and could be improved with better technology and better products. But we also have in this region a very young population who are excited to try new things. And so if you find a solution that really resonates with a lot of these common day-to-day problems, the adoption curve is just absolutely insane. And I think it's one of the things that are definitely unique to developing regions like this one.\n\n(00:54:14):\nOne company that's really interesting for example, just to give a flavor of the type of seemingly off the wall product or company being built in this part of the world, there's a company called eFishery, and what they do is they basically create a closed loop ecosystem for fish farmers in currently, I think they're only operational Indonesia or they're recently expanding beyond Indonesia.\n\n(00:54:45):\nThey help farmers feed their fish through this IOT smart device that helps measure the amount of fish feed that needs to go into the ponds, but they also then help farmers do things that get financing and also sell their produce out to local or even regional or global markets. And it's a company doing something like a quarter billion dollars in revenue and it's profitable and it's basically a fish farmer, a close loop ecosystem. And it's pretty wild that something like this exists, but it does speak to, I think again earlier what I said earlier about the hunger that the population have for better solutions. And if you can find these better solutions, you can really build companies of the very meaningful scale very, very quickly.\n\nLenny (00:55:42):\nSo at this point, you've stepped down a CEO, you've stepped down from the board, what's next and how does it feel?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:55:50):\nYeah, I'm still on this journey honestly, of how does it feel. I think that building Gojek is by far the most important professional experience and frankly, one of the most important life experiences I've had. It's made me a way better person actually. And now that I've stepped away, I am not as bored or as aimless as people would expect after having such a kind of all-consuming thing be part of my life experience.\n\n(00:56:37):\nWhat's next? Honestly, Lenny, I don't know. I don't have a plan at this stage. I do some angel investing on the side. I work with other founders to be able to maybe just share some of these experiences that I shared today and just figuring out what makes me happy and what are the kind activities that I find rewarding. I don't know, maybe I'll start another company at some point. I think that's my default, but I think right now I'm just taking things easy and trying to figure out another problem I guess, that I could be obsessed about.\n\nLenny (00:57:25):\nYou've earned that time to explore and look for new problems. Is there anything else you wanted to touch on before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:57:33):\nNo Lenny. I think we've covered a lot today, and I just wanted to thank you for the time.\n\nLenny (00:57:41):\nAmazing. It's absolutely my pleasure. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:57:48):\nYes, let's go.\n\nLenny (00:57:50):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:57:54):\nWhat You Do Is Who You Are. I think that was the second most popular Ben Horowitz's book, but I'm really obsessed with building interesting and engaging cultures, so I think that's one. Another is a classic marketing book. Again, we talked a lot about branding today, so there's this book called How Brands Grow by Byron Sharp. I don't agree necessarily with everything in it, but I do think that it's a great primer on how to think about branding and marketing.\n\nLenny (00:58:25):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:58:27):\nFavorite recent movie, The Menu and favorite recent TV show? Netflix show is a Cyberpunk 2077 Edge Runners.\n\nLenny (00:58:38):\nOh, wow. I haven't heard of that one.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:58:39):\nOh, you should check it out. It's super cool.\n\nLenny (00:58:42):\nI'll go check it out.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:58:43):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:58:43):\nFavorite interview question that you like to ask.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:58:46):\nTell me about a subject or activity you've been obsessed with for a long time.\n\nLenny (00:58:51):\nWhat do you look for in an answer that's like, okay, this is good.\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:58:54):\nI want somebody to basically almost pitch to me an obsession they have than makes me interested in knowing more into that subject. The more obscure, the better and the more passionate they are about an obscure thing, even better. And I think it shows people's capability to be really passionate about something and sell something and think about something in a very structured and detailed way.\n\nLenny (00:59:25):\nWhat are some products that you love and have recently discovered?\n\nKevin Aluwi (00:59:30):\nTwo products, I think right now that I've found absolutely delightful. One is the ARC Browser. I know that it's gaining a lot of traction out there, but I'm a very chronic tab hoarder. My Chrome tabs are just all over the place, and I love that they've figured out I would say the best approach to kind of tab management, and there's just a ton of little delightful, awesome design details in the app that I think is just really cool. And it's a browser. When's the last time there was a really cool browser that came out? So I also love the ambition that the company has.\n\n(01:00:09):\nSecond product, Steam Deck. I'm a huge gamer, and I think it is probably, I would say the best game platform to actually build on the vision of truly portable mobile gaming.\n\nLenny (01:00:25):\nI love your point with ARC for tab hoarders. I also used to have a lot of tabs and I love it just auto deletes stuff and just disappear, and it forces you to lose your tabs and it works out surprisingly.\n\nKevin Aluwi (01:00:38):\nFinal question.\n\nLenny (01:00:38):\nI'm curious what comes up for this one? What's something you've recently changed or that you've heard of someone at Gojek recently changed in their product development process that was maybe minor, that had a tremendous impact on the team's ability to execute.\n\nKevin Aluwi (01:00:53):\nOne relatively minor thing that I thought had a lot of impact with execution is being very clear that whoever is accountable for the results should also be the decider. I found that a lot of literature out there says that product teams should be this communal best ideas come from everywhere group, which I think is well-intentioned and absolutely everyone should contribute ideas, but I think not having it be super clear who is accountable and who is deciding often slows down execution a lot. And I think when we switch to making it really clear that who was the decider for any kind of product development process, I think our execution definitely improved significantly.\n\nLenny (01:01:37):\nAmazing. Kevin, thank you so much for being here. Gojek is such an interesting and important story, and I feel like most founders can learn something from the story, so I was really excited to bring you on and to hear a lot of these wild stories that you shared. Two final questions. Where can folks find your line if they want to reach out, learn more, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKevin Aluwi (01:01:57):\nI am @kaluwi on Twitter. That's also my email, kaluwi@gmail.com. I'll always be happy to chat about Gojek or just generally anything technology related. Again, I have nothing I'm working on at the moment, so I just would love to jam with cool people.\n\nLenny (01:02:22):\nAmazing. Thank you again for being here.\n\nKevin Aluwi (01:02:25):\nThanks, Lenny.\n\nLenny (01:02:28):\nThank you so much for listening.

Everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on, but that's not true at all with AI. Every two months, computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nYou're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm.\n\nKevin Weil (00:00:29):\nOur general mindset is in two months, there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are. And we say this to developers too. If you're building and the product that you're building is kind of right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going because you're doing something right. Give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):\nFamously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra.\n\nKevin Weil (00:00:56):\nLibra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. It fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It should exist. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:27):\nToday my guest is Kevin Weil. Kevin is chief product officer at OpenAI, which is maybe the most important and most impactful company in the world right now, being at the forefront of AI and AGI and maybe someday super intelligence. He was previously head of product at Instagram and Twitter. He was co-creator of the Libra Cryptocurrency at Facebook, which we chat about. He's also on the boards of Planet and Strava and the Black Product Managers Network and the Nature Conservancy. He's also just a really good guy and he has so much wisdom to share. We chat about how OpenAI operates, implications of AI and how we will all work and build product, which markets within the AI ecosystem, companies like OpenAI won't likely go after and thus are good places for startups to own. Also, why learning the craft of writing evals is quickly becoming a core skill for product builders, what skills will matter most in an AI era and what he's teaching his kids to focus on and so much more.\n\n(00:02:24):\nThis is a very special episode and I am so excited to bring it to you.

Kevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nKevin Weil (00:05:23):\nThank you so much for having me. We've been talking about doing this forever and we made it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:27):\nWe did it. I can't imagine how insane your life is, so I really appreciate that you made time for this and we're actually recording this the week that you guys launched your new image model, which is a happy coincidence. My entire social feed is filled with ghiblifications of everyone's life and family photos and everything, so good job.\n\nKevin Weil (00:05:45):\nYep, mine too. My wife, Elizabeth, sent me one of hers, so I'm right there with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:51):\nLet me just ask, did you guys expect this kind of reaction? It feels like this is the most viral thing that's happened in AI, which a high bar since, I don't know, ChatGPT launched. Just like, did you guys expect it to go this well? What does it feel like internally?\n\nKevin Weil (00:06:04):\nThere have been a handful of times in my career when you're working on a product internally and the internal usage just explodes. This was true by the way when we were building stories at Instagram. More than anything else in my career, we could feel it was going to work because we were all using it internally and we'd go away for a weekend. Before it launched we were all using it and we'd come back after a weekend and we would know what was going on and be like, \"Oh, hey, I saw you were at that camping trip, how was that?\" You were like, \"Man, this thing really works.\" ImageGen was definitely one of those, so we'd been playing with it for, I don't know, a couple months and when it first went live internally to the company, there was kind of a little gallery where you could generate your own, you could also see what everyone else was generating and it was just nonstop buzz. So yeah, we had a sense that this was going to be a lot of fun for people to play with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:58):\nThat's really cool. That should be a measure of just confidence into something going well that you're launching is internally everyone's going crazy for it.\n\nKevin Weil (00:07:05):\nYeah. Especially social things because you have a very tight network as a company socially, so you know each other and you're experts in your product hopefully. And so there's some sense in which if you're doing something social and it's not taking off internally, you might question what you're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:23):\nYeah, and by the way, the Ghibli thing, is that something you guys seeded or how did that even start? Was that an intentional example?\n\nKevin Weil (00:07:29):\nI think it's just the style people love and the model is really capable at emulating style or understanding what... It's very good at instruction following. That's actually something that I think people... I'm starting to see people discover with it, but you can do very complex things. You can give it two images, one is your living room and the other is a whole bunch of photos or memorabilia or things you want and you say, \"Tell me how you would arrange these things.\" Or you can say, \"I'd like you to show me what this will look like if you put this over here and this thing to the right of that and this one to the left of this, but under that one.\" And the model actually will understand all of that and do it. It's incredibly powerful. So I'm just excited about all the different things people are going to figure out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:11):\nYeah. All right. Well, good job. Good job team OpenAI. Let's get serious here and let's zoom out a little bit. The way I see it is you're chief product officer of maybe the most important company in the world right now. Just not to set the bar too high, but you guys are ushering in AI, AGI at some point, super intelligence at some point. No big deal. I have more questions for you than I've had for any other guest. Actually put out a call-out on Twitter and LinkedIn and my community just like what would you want to ask Kevin? And I had over 300 well-formed questions and we're going to go through every single one. So let's just get started. I'm just joking.\n\nKevin Weil (00:08:45):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:46):\nI picked out the best and there's a lot of stuff I'm really curious about.\n\nKevin Weil (00:08:48):\nWell, it's 1 PM here. It doesn't get dark for a while, so let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:53):\nOkay, here we go. Okay, so first of all, I'm just going to take notes here. When is AGI launching? When in December?\n\nKevin Weil (00:08:58):\nI mean, we just launched a good ImageGen model. Does that count?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:03):\nIt's getting there. It's getting there.\n\nKevin Weil (00:09:05):\nThere's this quote I love, which is \"AI is whatever hasn't been done yet\" because once it's been done, when it kind of works, then you call it machine learning, and once it's kind of ubiquitous and it's everywhere, then it's just an algorithm. So I've always loved that we call things AI when they still don't quite work and then by the time it's like an AI algorithm that's recommending you follow, oh, that's just an algorithm, but this new thing, like self-driving cars, that's it. I think to some degree we're always going to be there and the next thing is always going to be AI and the current thing that we use every day and is just a part of our lives, that's an algorithm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):\nIt's so interesting because in the Bay Area you see self-driving cars driving around and it's so normal now when four years ago and three years ago, you would've seen this and you'd be like, \"Holy shit, what is... We're in the future.\" And now we're just so take it for granted.\n\nKevin Weil (00:10:01):\nI mean there's something like that with everything. If I showed you... When GPT-3 launched, I wasn't at OpenAI then. I was just a user, but it was mind-blowing. And if I gave you GPT-3 now I just plugged that into ChatGPT for you and you started using it, you'd be like, \"What is this thing?\" It's like mess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:22):\nFlop, flop.\n\nKevin Weil (00:10:24):\nI had the same experience when I first got into a Waymo, your very first ride, at least my very first ride, my first 10 seconds in a Waymo, it starts driving and you're like, \"Oh my God, watch out for that bike.\" You're holding onto whatever you can. And then five minutes in, you've calmed down and you realize that you're getting driven around the city without a driver and it's working. You're just like, \"Oh my God, I am living in the future right now.\" And then another 10 minutes, you're bored, you're doing email on your phone, answering Slack messages, and suddenly this miracle of human invention is just an expected part of your life from then on. And there is really something in the way that we all are adapting to AI that's kind of like that. These miraculous things happen and computers can do something they've never been able to do before and it blows our mind collectively for a week and then we're like, oh, yeah. Oh, now it's just machine learning on its way to being an algorithm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:23):\nThe craziest thing about what you just shared actually is, I don't know, ChatGPT, which is now feels terrible. 3.5 was a couple years ago, and imagine what life will be like in a couple years from now. We're going to get to that, where things are going, what you think is going to be the next big leap. But I want to start with the beginning of your journey at OpenAI. So you worked at Twitter, you worked at Facebook, you worked at Planet, Instagram. At some point you got recruited to go and come work at OpenAI. I'm curious just what that story was like of the recruiting process of joining OpenAI as CPO. Is there any fun stories there?\n\nKevin Weil (00:12:01):\nIf I'm remembering the timeline right, we communicated at Planet I was leaving and I was planning to just go take some time. I wasn't going to stop working, but I was also happy to take the summer. This was maybe April or something. I was like, cool, I'm going to have the summer with my kids. We're going to go to Tahoe or something and I'll actually get to hang out rather than what I usually do going up and down and all that. And then Sam and I had known each other lightly for a bunch of years and he's always involved in so many interesting things like companies building fusion and all these things. So he'd always been somebody that I would call occasionally if I was starting to think about my next thing because I like working on big tech forward, sort of next wave kind of things.\n\n(00:12:49):\nAnd so I called him and I think Vinod also helped to put us in touch again. And this time it wasn't like, \"Oh, you should go talk to these guys working on fusion.\" He said, \"Actually, we're thinking about something, you should come talk to us.\" I was like, \"Okay, that sounds amazing. Let's do it.\" And it goes really fast, really, really fast. I met most of the management team in a brief period of time, a few days, and they were telling me, 'Look, we're basically going to move as fast as we want to move. And if you talk to everyone, everyone likes you, you're ready to go.\" Sam came over for dinner and we had a great evening together just talking about OpenAI in the future and getting to know each other better. And at the end I was like, I was going to go in the next day for a bigger round of interviews and Sam was saying, \"Hey, it's going really well. We're really excited.\"\n\n(00:13:52):\nAnd I said, \"Cool. So how do I think about tomorrow?\" And he said, \"Oh, you'll be fine. Don't worry about it. And if it goes well, we're basically there.\" And so I go in the next day, meet a bunch of people, have a great time. I really enjoyed everybody I met with. In any interview, you can always second guess yourself like, oh, I shouldn't have said that thing or that thing I gave a bad answer on I wish I could redo, but I came away feeling like I think that went pretty well. And I was expecting to hear that weekend basically because they sort of set expectations as soon as if this goes well, we're ready to go. And I didn't hear anything. And then it was like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, I still didn't hear anything and I reached out to folks on the OpenAI side a couple of times, still nothing.\n\n(00:14:45):\nAnd I was like, \"Oh my God, I screwed it up. I don't know where I screwed it up, but I totally screwed it up. I can't believe it.\" And I was going back to Elizabeth, my wife and being like, \"What did I do? Where do you think I...\" Getting all crazy about it and then it's still nothing. And finally it was like nine days later, they finally got back to me and it turned out there was a bunch of stuff happening internally and this, that and the other thing, and there's just a million things happening. And they finally were like, \"Oh yeah, that went well. Let's do this.\" And I was like, \"Oh, okay, cool, let's do it.\" But it was nine days of agony and they were just super busy on some internal stuff and there I was fretting every single day and re-going over every line of our interview process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):\nIt makes me think about when you're dating someone and you've texted them and you're not hearing anything back, you assume something is wrong.\n\nKevin Weil (00:15:40):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:41):\nThey might just be busy.\n\nKevin Weil (00:15:42):\nI have a hard time about it still.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:47):\nThat's wild. I love that it worked out. And I guess the lesson there is don't jump to conclusions.\n\nKevin Weil (00:15:55):\nYeah. Have a little bit of chill.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:59):\nSpeaking of that, I want to chat about what it's just like to be inside the center of the storm. Again, you work at a lot of, let's say traditional companies even though they're not that traditional, Twitter and Instagram and Facebook and Planet, and now you work at OpenAI. I'm curious, what is most different about how things work in your day-to-day life at OpenAI?\n\nKevin Weil (00:16:19):\nI think it's probably the pace. Maybe it's two things. One is it's the pace. The second is everywhere I've ever worked before this, you kind of know what technology you're building on. So you spend your time thinking about what problems are you solving? Who are you building for? How are you going to make their lives better? How are you going to... Is this a big enough problem that you're going to be able to change habits? Do people care about this problem being solved? All those good product things. But the stuff that you're building on is kind of fixed. You're talking about databases and things and I bet the database you used this year is probably 5% better than the database you used two years ago, but that's not true at all with AI. It's like every two months computers can do something they've never been able to do before and you need to completely think differently about what you're doing.\n\n(00:17:10):\nThere's something fundamentally interesting about that makes life fun here. There's also something we will maybe talk about evals later, but it also really, in this world of... Everything we're used to with computers is about giving a computer very defined inputs. If you look at Instagram for example, there are buttons that do specific things and you know what they do. And then when you give a computer defined inputs, you get very defined outputs. You're confident that if you do the same thing three times, you're going to get the same output three times. LLMs are completely different than that. They're good at fuzzy subtle inputs. Then all the nuances of human language and communication, they're pretty good at. And also they don't really give you the same answer. You probably get spiritually the same answer for the same question, but it's certainly not the same set of words every time. And so you're much more, it's fuzzier inputs and fuzzier outputs. And when you're building products, it really matters whether there's some use case that you're trying to build around.\n\n(00:18:16):\nIf the model gets it right 60% of the time, you build a very different product than if the model gets it right 95% of the time versus if the model gets it right 99.5% of the time. And so there's also something that you have to get really into the weeds on your use case and the evals and things like that in order to understand the right kind of product to build. So that is just fundamentally different. If your database works once, it works every time. And that's not true in this world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:45):\nLet's actually follow this thread on evals. I definitely wanted to talk about this. We had this legendary panel at the Lenny & Friends Summit. It was you and Mike Krieger and Sarah Guo moderating.\n\nKevin Weil (00:18:58):\nThat was fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:58):\nSo fun. The thing that I heard that kind of stuck with people from that panel was a comment you made where you said that writing evals is going to become a core skill for product managers, and I feel like that probably applies further than just product managers. A lot of people know what evals are. A lot of people have no idea what I'm talking about. So could you just briefly explain what is an eval and then just why do you think this is going to be so important for people building products in the future?\n\nKevin Weil (00:19:23):\nYeah, sure. I think the easiest way to think about it is almost like a quiz for a model, a test to gauge how well it knows a certain set of subject material or how good it is at responding to a certain set of questions. So in the same way you take a calculus class and then you have calculus tests that see if you've learned what you're supposed to learn. You have evals that test how good is the model at creative writing? How good is the model at graduate level science? How good is the model at competitive coding? And so you have these set of evals that basically perform as benchmarks for how smart or capable the model is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:04):\nIs it a simple way to think about it, like unit tests for model?\n\nKevin Weil (00:20:07):\nYeah, unit tests, tests in general for models. Totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:10):\nGreat, great. Okay. And then why is this so important for people that don't totally understand what the hell's going on here with evals? Why is this so key to building AI products?\n\nKevin Weil (00:20:20):\nWell, it gets back to what I was saying. You need to know whether your model is going to... There are certain things that models will get right. 99.95% of the time and you can just be confident. There are things that they're going to be 95% right on and things they're going to be 60% right on. If the model's 60% right on something, you're going to need to build your product totally differently. And by the way, these things aren't static either. So a big part of evals is if you know you're building for some use case. So let's take our deep research product, which is one of my favorite things that we've released maybe ever. The idea is with deep research for people who haven't used it, you can give ChatGPT now an arbitrarily complex query. It's not about returning you an answer from a search query, which we can also do.\n\n(00:21:10):\nIt's here's a thing that if you were going to answer it yourself, you'd go off and do two hours of reading on the web and then you might need to read some papers and then you would come back and start writing up your thoughts and realize you had some gaps in your thinking. So you go out and do more research. It might take you a week to write some 20 page answer to this question. You can let ChatGPT just like chug for you for 25, 30 minutes. It's not the immediate answers you're used to, but it might go work for 25, 30 minutes and do work that would've taken you a week. So as we were building that product, we were designing evals at the same time as we were thinking about how this product was going to work and we were trying to go through hero use cases.\n\n(00:21:57):\nHere's a question you want to be able to ask. Here's an amazing answer for that question. And then turning those into evals and then hill climbing on those evals. So it's not just that the model is static and we hope it does okay on a certain set of things, you can teach the model. You can make this a continuous learning process. And so as we were fine-tuning our model for deep research to be able to answer these things, we were able to test is it getting better on these evals that we said were important measures of how the product was working? And it's when you start seeing that and you start seeing performance on evals going up, you start saying, \"Okay, I think we have a product here.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:35):\nYou made a kind of a comment along these same lines around evals that AI is almost capped in how amazing it can be by how good we are at evals. Does that resonate? Any more thoughts along those lines?\n\nKevin Weil (00:22:48):\nI mean, these models are their intelligences and intelligence is so fundamentally multidimensional so you can talk about a model being amazing at competitive coding, which may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding-\n\nKevin Weil (00:23:00):\n... may not be the same as that model being great at front-end coding or back-end coding or taking a whole bunch of code that's written in COBOL and turning it into Python. And that's just within the software engineering world. So I think there's a sense in which you can think of these models as incredibly smart, very factually aware intelligences, but still most of the world's data, knowledge, process is not public. It's behind the walls of companies or governments or other things. And same way, if you were going to join a company, you would spend your first two weeks onboarding. You'd be learning the company-specific processes. You'd get access to company-specific data. The models are smart enough, you can teach them anything, but they need to have the raw data to learn from.\n\n(00:23:58):\nSo there's a sense in which I think the future is really going to be incredibly smart, broad-based models that are fine-tuned and tailored with company-specific or use case-specific data so that they perform really well on company-specific, or use case-specific things. And you're going to measure that with custom evals. So what I was referring to is just like these models are really smart, you need to still teach them things if the data's not in their training set, and there's a huge amount of use cases that are not going to be in their training set because they're relevant to one industry or one company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:40):\nI'm just going to keep following the thread that you're leading us down, but I'm going to come back because I have more questions around some of these things. So you came to a space that I think a lot of AI founders are thinking about is just, where's OpenAI not going to come squash me in the future? Or one of the other foundational models. So it's unclear to a lot of people just like, \"Should I build a startup in this space or not?\" Is there any advice you have or any guidance for where you think OpenAI, or just foundational models in general likely won't go and where you have an opportunity to build a company?\n\nKevin Weil (00:25:10):\nSo this is something that Ev Williams used to say back at Twitter that's always stuck with me, which is, \"No matter how big your company gets, no matter how incredible the people are, there are way more smart people outside your walls than there are inside your walls.\" And that's why we are so focused on building a great API. We have 3 million developers using our API. No matter how ambitious we are, how big we grow, by the way, we don't want to grow super big, there are so many use cases, places in the world where AI can fundamentally make our lives better. We're not going to have the people. We're not going to have the know-how to build most of these things.\n\n(00:25:55):\nAnd I think, like I was saying, the data is industry-specific, use case-specific, behind certain company walls, things like that. And there are immense opportunities in every industry and every vertical in the world to go build AI-based products that improve upon the state of the art. And there's just no way we could ever do that ourselves. We don't want to. We if we did want to, and we're really excited to power that for 3 million-plus developers and way more in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:24):\nComing back to your earlier point about the tech changing constantly and getting faster, not exactly knowing what you'll have by the time you launch something in terms of the power, the model. I'm curious what allows you to ship quickly and consistently in such great stuff? And it sounds like one answer is bottoms-up empowered teams versus a very top-down roadmap that's planned out for a quarter. What are some of those things that allow you to ship such great stuff so often, so quickly?\n\nKevin Weil (00:26:53):\nYeah. I mean, we try and have a sense of where we're trying to go, point ourselves in a direction so that we have some rough sense of alignment. Thematically, I don't for second, and we do quarterly roadmapping. We laid out a year-long strategy. I don't for a second believe that what we write down in these documents is what we're going to actually ship three months from now, let alone six or nine. But that's okay. I think it's like an Eisenhower quote, \"Plans are useless. Planning is helpful,\" which I totally subscribe to, especially in this world. It's really valuable. If you think about quarterly road roadmapping for example, it's really valuable to have a moment where you stop and go, \"Okay. What did we do? What worked? What went well? What didn't go well? What did we learn and now what do we think we're going to do next?\"\n\n(00:27:44):\nAnd by the way, everybody has some dependencies. You need the infrastructure team to do the following things, partnership with research here. So you want to have a second to check your dependencies, make sure you're good to go and then start executing. We try and keep that really lightweight because it's not going to be right. We're going to throw it out halfway because we will have learned new things. So the moment of planning is helpful even if it's only partially.\n\n(00:28:12):\nSo I think just expecting that you're going to be super agile and that there's no sense writing a three month roadmap, let alone a year long roadmap because the technology's changing underneath you so quickly. We really do try and go very strongly bottoms up, subject to our overall directional alignment. We have great people. We have engineers and PMs and designers and researchers who are passionate about the products they're building and have strong opinions about them and are also the ones building them. So they have a real sense of what the capabilities are too, which is super important.\n\n(00:28:49):\nSo I think you want to be more bottoms up in this way. So we operate that way. We are happy making mistakes. We make mistakes all the time. It's one of the things I really appreciate about Sam. He pushes us really hard to move fast, but he also understands that with moving fast comes, we didn't quite get this right or that we launched this thing, it didn't work. We'll roll it back. Look at our naming. Our naming is horrible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:14):\nThat was a lot of questions people had for you. Model names, yeah.\n\nKevin Weil (00:29:18):\nIt's absolutely atrocious and we know it, and we will get around to fixing it at some point, but it's not the most important thing and so we don't spend a lot of time on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):\nBut it also shows you how it doesn't matter. Again, ChatGPT the most popular, fastest growing product in history, it's the number one AI, API and model. So clearly it doesn't matter that much.\n\nKevin Weil (00:29:39):\nAnd we name things like o3 mini high.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:46):\nMan, I love it. Okay. So you talked about roadmapping and bottoms up and I'm really curious, is there a cadence or a ritual of aligning with you or Sam or you review everything that's going out? Is there a meeting every week or every month where you guys see what's happening?\n\nKevin Weil (00:30:03):\nOn key projects. So we do product reviews and things like that, like you would expect. There isn't a ritual because there isn't... I would never want us to be blocked on launching something, waiting for a review with me or Sam, if we can't get there. If I'm traveling or Sam's busy or whatever, that's a bad reason for us not to ship. So obviously for the biggest, most high priority stuff, we have a pretty close beat on it, but we really try not to, frankly. We want to empower teams to move quickly, and I think it's more important to ship and iterate.\n\n(00:30:42):\nSo we have this philosophy, we call iterative deployment, and the idea is we're all learning about these models together. So there's a real sense in which it's way better to ship something even when you don't know the full set of capabilities and iterate together in public. And we co-evolve together with the rest of society as we learn about these things and where they're different and where they're good and bad and weird. I really like that philosophy.\n\n(00:31:12):\nI think the other thing that ends up being a part of our product philosophy is the sense of model maximalism. The models are not perfect. They're going to make mistakes. You could spend a lot of time building all kinds of different scaffolding around them. And by the way, sometimes we do because sometimes there are kinds of errors that you just don't want to make, but we don't spend that much time building scaffolding around the parts that don't match that because our general mindset is in two months there's going to be a better model and it's going to blow away whatever the current set of limitations are.\n\n(00:31:52):\nSo if you're building, and we say this to developers too, if you're building and the product that you're building is right on the edge of the capabilities of the models, keep going, because you're doing something right because you give it another couple months and the models are going to be great, and suddenly the product that you have that just barely worked is really going to sing. And that's how you make sure that you're really pushing the envelope and building new things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):\nI had the founder of Bolt on the podcast, StackBlitz is the company name, and he shared this story that they've been working on this product for seven years behind the scenes and it was failing. Nothing was happening. And then all of a sudden it was, sorry to mention a competitor, but Claude came out or a Sonnet 3.5 came out and all of a sudden everything worked and they've been building all this time and finally it worked. And I hear that a lot with YC, just like things that never were possible now are just becoming possible every few months with the updates to the models.\n\nKevin Weil (00:32:48):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):\nLet me actually ask this, I wasn't planning to ask this, but I'm curious if you have any quick thoughts just why is Sonnet so good at coding, and thoughts on your stuff getting as good and better at actual coding?\n\nKevin Weil (00:33:01):\nYeah. I mean, kudos to Anthropic. They've built very good coding models. No doubt. We think that we can do the same. Maybe by the time this podcast has shipped, we'll have more to say, but either way, all credit to them. I think intelligence is really multi-dimensional and so I think the model providers... It used to be that OpenAI had this massive model lead, 12 months or something ahead of everybody else. That's not true anymore. I like to think we still have a lead. I'd argue that we do, but it's certainly not a massive one. And that means that there are going to be different places where the Google models are really good or where Anthropic models are really good, or where we're really good and our competitors are like, \"We got to get better at that.\" And it actually is easier to get better at a certain thing once someone's proved it possible than it is to forge a path through the jungle and doing something brand new.\n\n(00:34:03):\nSo I just think as an example, it was like nobody could break 4 minutes in the mile, and then finally somebody did and the next year 12 more people did it. I think there's that all over the place and it just means that competition is really intense, and consumers are going to win and developers are going to win and businesses are going to win in a big way from that. It's part of why the industry moves so fast, but all respect to the other big model providers. Models are getting really good. We're going to move as fast as we can and I think we've got some good stuff coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:36):\nExciting. This makes me also think about, in many ways other models are better at certain things, but somehow ChatGPT is the... If you look at all the awareness numbers and usage numbers, it's like no matter where you guys are in the rankings, people seem to just think of AI ChatGPT almost as the same. What do you think you did right to win in the consumer mindset, at least at this point and awareness in the world?\n\nKevin Weil (00:35:02):\nI think being first helps, which is one of the reasons why we're so focused on moving quickly. We like being the first to launch new capabilities. Things like deep research. Our models, they can do a lot of things. So they can take real-time video input, you have speech to speech, you can do speech to text and text to speech. They can do deep research. They can operate on a canvas, they can write code. So ChatGPT can be this one- stop-shop where all the things that you want to do are possible. And as we go forward in it, we have more agentic tools like Operator where it's browsing for you and doing things for you on the web, more and more you're going to be able to come to this one place to ChatGPT, give it instructions and have it accomplish real things for you in the world. There's something fundamentally valuable in that. So we think a lot about that. We try to move really fast so that we are always the most useful place for people to come to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:04):\nWhat would you say is the most counterintuitive thing that you've learned after building AI products or working at OpenAI, something that's just like, \"I did not expect that?\"\n\nKevin Weil (00:36:14):\nI don't know, maybe I should have expected this, but one of the things that's been funny for me is the extent to which you're trying to figure out how some product should work with AI, or even why some AI thing happens to be true, you can often reason about it the way you would reason about another human and it works. So maybe a couple examples. When we were first launching our reasoning model, we were the first to build a model that could reason, that could, instead of giving you just a quick system one answer right away to every question you asked, it was the third Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, here's an answer.\n\n(00:36:59):\nYou could ask it hard questions and it would reason. The same way that if I asked you to do a crossword puzzle, you couldn't just snap fill in everything. You would be, \"Well, okay. On this one across, I think it could be one of these two, but that means there's an A here. So that one has to be this, away, back track, step-by-step build up from where you are.\" Same way you answer any difficult logistical problem, any scientific problem. So this reasoning breakthrough was big, but it was also the first time that a model needed to sit and think. And that's a weird paradigm for a consumer product. You don't normally have something where you might need to hang out for 25 seconds after you ask a question.\n\n(00:37:40):\nSo we were trying to figure out what's the UI for this? With deep research where the model's going to go and think for 25 minutes sometimes, it's actually not that hard because you're not going to sit and watch it for 25 minutes. You're going to go do something else. You're going to go to another tab or go get lunch or whatever, and then you'll come back and it's done when it's like 20, 25 seconds or 10 seconds, it's a long time to wait, but it's not long enough to go to do something else.\n\n(00:38:09):\nSo you can think, if you asked me something that I needed to think for 20 seconds to answer, what would I do? I wouldn't just go mute and not say anything and shut down for 20 seconds and then come back. So we shouldn't do that. We shouldn't just have a slider sitting there. That's annoying. But I also wouldn't just start babbling every single thought that I had. So we probably shouldn't just expose the whole chain of thought as the model's thinking, but I might go like, \"That's a good question. All right.\" I might approach it like that and then think. You're maybe giving little updates and that's actually what we ended up shipping.\n\n(00:38:49):\nYou have similar things where you can find situations where you get better thinking sometimes out of a group of models that all try and attack the same problem, and then you have a model that's looking at all their outputs and integrating it and then giving you a single answer at the end. I mean, sounds a little bit like brainstorming. I certainly have better ideas when I get in a room and brainstorm with other people because they think differently than me. So anyways, there's just all these situations where you can actually reason about it like a group of humans or an individual human and it works, which I don't know, maybe I shouldn't have been surprised but I was.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:27):\nThat is so interesting because when I see these models operate, I never even thought about you guys designing that experience. To me, it just feels like this is what the LLM does. It just sits there and tells me what it's thinking. And I love this point you're making of let's make it feel like a human operating and well, how does a human operate? Well, they just talk aloud. They think, here's the thing I should explore. And I love that deep sequence to the extreme of that where they're just like, \"Here's everything I'm doing and thinking.\" And people actually like that too, I guess. Was that surprising to you, \"Maybe that could work too. People seem to like everything?\"\n\nKevin Weil (00:40:02):\nYeah. We learned from that actually because when we first launched it, we gave you the subheadings of what the model was thinking about, but not much more. And then deep seek launched and it was a lot and we went, I don't know if everyone wants that. There's some novelty effect to seeing what the model's really thinking about. We felt that too when we were looking at it internally. It's interesting to see the model's chain of thought, but it's not... I think at the scale of 400 million people, you don't want to see the model babble a bunch of things.\n\n(00:40:34):\nSo what we ended up doing was summarizing it in interesting ways. So instead of just getting the subheadings, you're getting one or two sentences about how it's thinking about it and you can learn from that. So we tried to find a middle ground that we thought was an experience would be meaningful for most people, but showing everybody three paragraphs is probably not the right answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:57):\nThis reminds me of something else you said at the summit that has really stuck with me, this idea that chat, people always make fun of chat is not the future interface for how we interact with AI, but you made this really interesting point that may argue the other side, which is, as humans we interface by talking and the IQ of a human can span from really low to really high and it all works talking to them and chat is the same thing and it can work on all kinds of intelligence levels. Maybe I just shared it, but I guess anything there about just why chat actually ends up being such an interesting interface for LLMs?\n\nKevin Weil (00:41:30):\nYeah. I don't know, maybe this is one of those things I believe that most people don't believe, but I actually think chat is an amazing interface because it's so versatile. People tend to go, \"Chat. Yeah. We'll figure out something better.\" And I think it's incredibly universal because it is the way we talk. I can talk to you verbally like we're talking now. We can see each other and interact. We can talk on WhatsApp and be texting each other, but all of these things is this unstructured method of communication and that's how we operate.\n\n(00:42:12):\nIf I had some more rigid interface that I was allowed to use when we spoke, I would be able to speak to you about far fewer things and it would actually get in the way of us having maximum communication bandwidth. So there's something magical. And by the way, in the past it never worked because there wasn't a model that was good at understanding all of the complexity and nuances of human speech, and that's the magic of LLMs. So to me, it's like an interface that's exactly fit to the power of these things. And that doesn't mean that it always has to be just like I don't necessarily always want to type, but you do want that very open-ended, flexible communication medium, it may be that we're speaking and the model's speaking back to me, but you still want the very lowest common denominator, no restrictions way of interacting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:04):\nThat is so interesting. That's really changed the way I think about this stuff is that point that chat is just so good for this very specific problem of talking to superintelligence basically.\n\nKevin Weil (00:43:13):\nBy the way, I think it's not that it's only chat either. If you have high volume use cases where they're more prescribed and you don't actually need the full generality, there are many use cases where it's better to have something that's less flexible, more prescribed, faster to specific task, and those are great too, and you can build all sorts of those. But you still want chat as this baseline for anything that falls out of whatever vertical you happen to be building for. It's like a catch-all for every possible thing you'd ever want to express to a model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:51):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our long-time podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:43:58):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:00):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:44:15):\nYes. So we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead, use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:44:49):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:08):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers, and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. And if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:45:23):\nI want to come back to that you talked about researchers and their relationship with product teams. I imagine a lot of innovation comes from researchers just like having an inkling and then building something amazing and then releasing it, and some ideas come from PMs and engineers. How do those teams collaborate? Does every team have a PM? Is it a lot of research-led stuff? Give us a sense of just where ideas and products come from mostly.\n\nKevin Weil (00:45:49):\nIt's an area where we're evolving a lot. I'm really excited about it, frankly. I think if you go back a couple of years when ChatGPT was just getting started, obviously, I wasn't in OpenAI, but...\n\nKevin Weil (00:46:00):\nObviously I wasn't an Open AI, but... We were more of a pure research company at the time. Chat GPT, if you remember, was a low-key research preview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:14):\nFor many years.\n\nKevin Weil (00:46:15):\nYeah. It wasn't a thing that the team launched thinking it was going to be this massive product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:19):\nOh, Chat GPT. Yeah.\n\nKevin Weil (00:46:21):\nAnd it was just a way that we were going to let people play with and iterate on the models. So we were primarily a research company, a world-class research company, and as ChatGPT has grown and as we've built our B-to-B products and our APIs and other things, now we're more of a product company than we were. I still think we can't... Open AI should never be a pure product company. We need to be both a world-class research company and a world-class product company, and the two need to really work together, and that's the thing that I think we've been getting much better at over the last six months. If you treat those things separately and the researchers go do amazing things and build models and then they get to some state and then the product and engineering teams go take them and do something with them, we're effectively just an API consumer of our own models.\n\n(00:47:17):\nThe best products though are going to be, it's like I was talking about with deep research, it's a lot of iterative feedback. It's understanding the products you're trying to sell or the problems you're trying to solve, building evals for them, using those evals to go gather data and fine-tune models to get them to be better at these use cases that you're looking to solve. It's a huge amount of back and forth to do it well. And I think the best products are going to be ENG product design and research working together as a single team to build novel things. So that's actually how we're trying to operate with basically anything that we build. It's a new muscle for us because we're kind of new as a product company, but it's one that people are really excited about because we've seen every time we do it, we build something awesome, and so now every product starts like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:07):\nHow many product managers do you have at Open AI? I don't know if you share that number, but if you do.\n\nKevin Weil (00:48:11):\nNot that many, actually. I don't know, 25. Maybe it's a little more than that. My personal belief is that you want to be pretty PM light as an organization just in general. I say this with love because I am a PM, but too many PMs causes problems. We'll fill the world with decks and ideas versus execution. So I think it's a good thing when you have a PM that is working with maybe slightly too many engineers because it means they're not going to get in and micromanage. You're going to leave a lot of influence and responsibility with the engineers to make decisions. It means you want to have really product-focused engineers, which we're fortunate to have. We have an amazingly product focused, high agency engineering team. But when you have something like that, you have a team that feels super empowered, you have a PM that's trying to really understand the problems and gently guide the team a little bit but has too much going on to get too far into the details, and you end up being able to move really fast. So that's kind of the philosophy we take.\n\n(00:49:23):\nWe want Product ENG leads and product engineers all the way through. We want not too many PMs, but really awesome, high quality ones, and so far that seems to be working pretty well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:36):\nI imagine being a PM at Open AI is a dream come true for a lot of people. At the same time, I imagine it's not a fit for a lot of people. There's researchers involved, very product minded engineers. What do you look for in the PMs that you hire there for folks that are like, \"Maybe I shouldn't go work there. I shouldn't even think about that.\"\n\nKevin Weil (00:49:54):\nI think, I've said this a few times, but high agency is something that we really look for, people that are not going to come in and wait for everyone else to allow them to do something, they're just going to see a problem and go do it. It's just a core part of how we work. I think people that are happy with ambiguity, because there is a massive amount of ambiguity here, it is not the kind of place, and we have trouble sometimes with more junior PMs because of this, because it's just not the place where someone is going to come in and say, \"Okay, here's the landscape, here's your area, I want you to go do this thing.\" And that's what you want as an early career PM. I mean, no one here has time and the problems are too ill-formed and we're figuring them all out as we go. And so high agency, very comfortable with ambiguity, ready to come in and help execute and move really quickly. That's kind of our recipe.\n\n(00:50:55):\nAnd I think also happy leading through influence because... I mean it's usual as a PM, people don't report to you, your team doesn't report to you, et cetera, but you also have the complexity of a research function, which is even more sort of self-directed and it's really important to build a good rapport with the research team. I think the EQ side of things is also super important for us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):\nI know at most companies, a PM comes in and they're just like, \"Why do we need you?\" And as a PM you have to earn trust and help people see the value, and I feel like at Open AI it's probably a very extreme version of that where they're like, \"Why do we need this person? We have researchers, engineers, what are you going to do here?\"\n\nKevin Weil (00:51:40):\nYeah, I think people appreciate it done right, but you bring people along. I think one of the most important things a PM can do well is be decisive. So there's a real fine line. You don't want to be making... I mean it's kind of like, I don't love the PM as the CEO of the product illusion all the time, but just like Sam in his role would be making mistakes if he made every single decision in every meeting that he was in. And he would also be making mistakes if he made no decisions in any meetings that he was in, right? It's understanding when to defer to your team and to let people innovate. And when there is a decision to be made that people either don't feel comfortable with or don't feel empowered to make, or a decision that has too many different disparate pros and cons that are spread out across a big group and someone needs to be decisive and make a call, it's a really important trait of a CEO.\n\n(00:52:41):\nIt's something Sam does well, and it's also a really important trait of a PM kind of at a more microscopic level. So because there's so much ambiguity, it's not obvious what the answer is in a lot of cases, and so having a PM that can come in and... And by the way, this doesn't need to be a PM, I'm perfectly happy if it's anybody else, but I kind of look to the PM to say, if there's ambiguity and no one's making a call, you better make sure that we get a call made and we move forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):\nThis touches on a few posts I've done of just, where is AI going to take over work that we do versus help us with various work? So let me come at this question from a different direction of just how AI impacts product teams and hiring, things like that. So first of all, there's all this talk of LM's doing our coding for us, and 90% of code is going to be written by AI in a year. Dario at Anthropic said that. At the same time, you guys are all hiring engineers like crazy, PM's like crazy. Every function is dead, but you're still hiring every single one. I guess just, first of all, let me just ask this, how do you and the team, say engineers, PMs, use AI in your work? Is there anything that's really interesting or things that you think people are sleeping on in how you use AI in your day-to-day work?\n\nKevin Weil (00:53:52):\nWe use it a lot. I mean, every one of us is in Chat GPT all the time summarizing docs, using it to help write docs with GPTs that write product specs and things like that, all the stuff that you would imagine. I mean talk about writing evals, you can actually use models to help you write evals and they're pretty good at it. That all said, I'm still sort of disappointed by us, and I really mean me, in, if I were to just teleport my five-year-old self leading product at some other company into my day job, I would recognize it still. And I think we should be in a world, certainly a year from now, probably even more now, where I almost wouldn't recognize it because the workflows are so different and I'm using AI so heavily, and I'd still recognize it today. So I think in some sense, I'm not doing a good enough job of that.\n\n(00:54:46):\nJust to give an example, why shouldn't we be vibe coding demos right, left and center? Instead of showing stuff in Figma, we should be showing prototypes that people are vibe coding over the course of 30 minutes to illustrate proofs of concept and to explore ideas. That's totally possible today, and we're not doing it enough. Actually, our chief people officer, Julia, was telling me the other day, she vibe coded an internal tool that she had at a previous job that she really wanted to have here at Open AI and she opened, I don't know, Windsurf or something, and vibe coded it. How cool is that? And if our chief people officer is doing it, we have no excuse to not be doing it more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:34):\nThat's an awesome story. And some people may not have heard this term vibe coding. Can you describe what that means?\n\nKevin Weil (00:55:40):\nYeah, I think this was Andrej's term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:45):\nKarpathy. Yeah.\n\nKevin Weil (00:55:46):\nAndrej Karpathy. Yeah. So you have these tools like Cursor and Windsurf and GitHub Copilot that are very good at suggesting what code you might want to write. So you can give them a prompt and they'll write code and then as you go to edit it, it's suggesting what you might want to do. And the way that everyone started using that stuff was, give it a prompt, have it do stuff, you go edit it, give it a prompt, and you're kind of really going back and forth with the model the whole time. As the models are getting better and as people are getting more used to it, you can kind of just let go of the wheel a little bit. And when the model's suggesting stuff, it's just like, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. Keep going. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.\n\n(00:56:29):\nAnd of course the model makes mistakes or it does something that doesn't compile, but when it doesn't compile, you paste the error in and you say, go, go, go, go, go. And then you test it out and it does one thing that you don't want it to do, so you enter in an instruction and say, go, go, go, go, go, and you just let the model do its thing. And it's not that you would do that for production code that needed to be super tight today yet, but for so many things, you're trying to get to a proof of concept, you're getting to a demo and you can really take your hands off the wheel and the model will do an amazing job, and that's vibe coding.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:05):\nThat's an awesome explanation. I think the pro version of that, which is, I think, the way Andre even described it as you talk, there's a step like whisper or super whisper or something like that where you're talking to the model, not even typing.\n\nKevin Weil (00:57:17):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:19):\nOh man. So let me just ask, I guess, when you look at product teams in the future, you talked about how you guys should be doing this more, instead of designs, having prototypes, what do you think might be the biggest changes in how product teams are structured or built? Where do you think things are going in the next few years?\n\nKevin Weil (00:57:36):\nI think you're definitely going to live in a world where you have researchers built into every product team. And I don't even mean just at foundation model companies because I think the future... Actually, frankly one thing that I'm sort of surprised about about our industry in general is that there's not a greater use of fine-tuned models. A lot of people... These models are very good, so our API does a lot of things really well, but when you have particular use cases, you can always make the model perform better on a particular use case by fine-tuning it. It's probably just a matter of time. Folks aren't quite comfortable yet with doing that in every case. But to me, there's no question that that's the future. Models are going to be everywhere just like transistors are everywhere, AI is going to be just a part of the fabric of everything we do, but I think there are going to be a lot of fine-tuned models because why would you not want to more specifically customize a model against a particular use case?\n\n(00:58:37):\nAnd so I think you're going to want sort of quasi researcher machine learning engineer types as part of pretty much every team because fine-tuning a model is just going to be part of the core workflow for building most products. So that's one change that maybe you're starting to see at foundation model companies that will propagate out to more teams over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:57):\nI'm curious if there's a concrete example that makes that real, and I'll share one that comes to mind as you talk, which is, when you look at Cursor and Windsurf, something I learned from those founders is that they use a Sonnet, but then they also have a bunch of custom models that help along the edges that make the specific experience that's not just generating code even better like auto-complete and looking ahead to where things are going. So is that one or any other examples of which you... What is a fine-tuned model? Do you think teams will be building with these researchers on their teams?\n\nKevin Weil (00:59:29):\nYeah. I mean, so when you're a model, you're basically giving the model a bunch of examples of the kinds of things you want it to be better at. So it's, \"Here's a problem, here's a good answer. Here's a problem, here's a good answer,\" Or, \"Here's a question, here's a good answer times a thousand or 10,000.\" And suddenly you're teaching the model to be much better than it was out of the gate at that particular thing. We use it everywhere internally. We use ensembles of models much more internally than people might think. So it's not, \"I have 10 different problems. I'll just ask baseline GPT four oh about a bunch of these things.\" If we have 10 different problems, we might solve them using 20 different model calls, some of which are using specialized fine-tuned models, they're using models of different sizes because maybe you have different latency requirements or cost requirements for different questions.\n\n(01:00:32):\nThey are probably using custom prompts for each one. Basically you want to teach the model to be really good at... You want to break the problem down into more specific tasks versus some broader set of high level tasks. And then you can use models very specifically to get very good at each individual thing. And then you have an ensemble that tackles the whole thing. I think a lot of good companies are doing that today. I still see a lot of companies giving the model single, generic, broad problems versus breaking the problem down, and I think there will be more breaking the problem down using specific models for specific things, including fine tuning.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:15):\nAnd so in your case, because this is really interesting, is that you're using different levels of Chat GPT, like a 1 0 3 and stuff that's earlier because it's cheaper.\n\nKevin Weil (01:01:24):\nThere'll be parts of our internal stack. I'll give you an example. Customer support, with 400 plus million weekly active users, we get a lot of inbound tickets. I don't know how many customer support folks we have, but it's not very many, 30, 40, I'm not sure, way smaller than you would have at any comparable company, and it's because we've automated a lot of our flows. We've got most questions using our internal resources, knowledge base, guidelines for how we answer questions, what kind of personality, et cetera. You can teach the model those things and then have it do a lot of its answers automatically, or where it doesn't have the full confidence to answer a particular question, it can still suggest an answer, request a human to look at it and then that human's answer actually is its own sort of fine tuning data for the model. You're telling it the right answer in a particular case.\n\n(01:02:29):\nWe're using... At various places. Some of these places, you want a little bit more reasoning, is not super latency sensitive, so you want a little more reasoning, and we'll use one of our O series models. In other places, you want a quick check on something and so you're fine to use four oh mini, which is super fast and super cheap. In general, it's like specific models for specific purposes and then you ensemble them together to solve problems. By the way, again, not unlike how we as humans solve problems, a company is arguably an ensemble of models that have all been fine tuned based on what we studied in college and what we have learned over the course of our careers. We've all been fine tuned to have different sets of skills and you group them together in different configurations and the output of the ensemble is much better than the output of any one individual.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:20):\nKevin, you're blowing my mind. That sounds exactly correct. And also, different people, you pay them less, they cost less to talk to, some people take a long time to answer, some people hallucinating. This is...\n\nKevin Weil (01:03:38):\nI'm telling you. This is a mental model but really does work in thinking...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:41):\nOh, right. Yeah. This is great. Some people are visual, they want to dry out their thinking, some people want to talk word cell. Wow, this is a really good metaphor. So again, coming back to your advice here because I love that we circled back to it, you're finding a really good way to think about how to design great AI experiences and LMs, I guess, specifically is think about how a person would do this.\n\nKevin Weil (01:04:01):\nWell, it's maybe not always the answer is to think about how a person would do it, but sometimes to gain intuition for how you might solve a problem, you think about what an equivalent human would do in those situations and use that to at least gain a different perspective on the problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:18):\nWow, this is great.\n\nKevin Weil (01:04:22):\nBecause some of this really is talking to a model. There's a lot of prior art because we talk to other humans all the time and encounter them in all sorts of different situations, and so there's a lot to learn from that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:34):\nOkay, so speaking of humans, I want to chat about the future a little bit. So you have three kids, and a community member asked me this hilarious question that I think it's something a lot of people are thinking about. So this is Patrick [inaudible 01:04:47]. I worked with him at Airbnb. He says ask what he's encouraging his kids to learn to prepare for the future. I'm worried my 6-year-old by the year 2036 will face a lot of competition trying to get into the top roofing or plumbing programs and need a backup plan.\n\nKevin Weil (01:05:02):\nThat's funny. So our kids, we have a 10 year old and eight year old twins, so they're still pretty young. It's amazing how AI native they are. It's completely normal to them that there are self-driving cars. That they can talk to AI all day long. They have full conversations with Chat GPT and Alexa and everything else. I don't know, who knows what the future holds? I think things like coding skills are going to be relevant for a long time, who knows? But I think if you teach your kids to be curious, to be independent, to be self-confident, you teach them how to think, I don't know what the future holds, but I think that those are going to be skills that are going to be important in any configuration of the future. And so it's not like we have all the answers, but that's how Elizabeth and I think about our kids.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):\nAnd do you find that AI... There's a lot of talk about AI tutoring. Is that something you guys are doing? I know they're using Chat GPT, I love all the photos you post where they're playing with prompts and stuff, but I guess is there anything there you're experimenting with or you think is going to become really important?\n\nKevin Weil (01:06:16):\nThis is something that... It's maybe the most important thing that AI could do. Maybe that's a grand statement. There are lots of important things that AI can do, including speeding up the pace of fundamental science research and discovery, which maybe is actually the most important thing AI can do. But one of the most important things would be personalized tutoring. And it kind of blows my mind that there is still... I know there are a bunch of good products out there. Khan Academy does great things. They're a wonderful partner of ours. Vinod Khosla has a non-profit that's doing some really interesting stuff in this space and is making an impact. But I'm kind of surprised that there isn't a 2 billion kid AI personalized tutoring thing because the models are good enough to do it now, and every study out there that's ever been done seems to show that when you have... Like, education is still important, but when you combine that with personalized tutoring, you get multiple standard deviation improvements in learning speed.\n\n(01:07:31):\nAnd so it's uncontroversial, it's good for kids, it's free. Chat GPT is free, you don't need to pay, and the models are good enough. It still just kind of blows my mind that there isn't something amazing out there that our kids are using and your future kids are using, and people in all sorts of places around the world that aren't as lucky as our kids to be able to have this sort of built-in, solid education. Again, Chat GPT is free. People have Android devices everywhere. I really just think this could change the world and I'm surprised it doesn't exist and I want it to exist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:08):\nThis kind of touches on something I want to spend a little time on, which is a lot of people also worry a lot about AI, where it's going, they worry about jobs it's going to take, they worry about the super intelligence squashing humanity in the future. What's your perspective on that and just the optimistic case that I think people need to hear?\n\nKevin Weil (01:08:27):\nI mean, I'm a big technology optimist. I think if you look over the last 200 years, maybe more, technology has driven a lot of the advancements that have made us the world and the society that we are today. It drives economic advancements, it drives geopolitical advancements, quality of life, longevity advancement. I mean, technology's at the root of just about everything, so I think there are very few examples where this is anything but a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't...\n\nKevin Weil (01:09:00):\n... a great thing over the longer term. That doesn't mean that there aren't temporary dislocations or where there aren't individuals that are impacted, and that matters too. So it can't just be that the average is good. You've got to also think about how you take care of each individual person as best you can.\n\n(01:09:18):\nIt is something that we think a lot about and as we work with the administration, as we work with policy, we try and help wherever we can. We do a lot with education. One of the benefits here is that ChatGPT is also perhaps the best reskilling app you could possibly want. It knows a lot of things. It can teach you a lot of things if you're interested in learning new things.\n\n(01:09:43):\nThese are very real issues. I'm super optimistic about the long run, and we're going to need to do everything we can as a society to ensure that we make this transition as graceful and as well-supported as we can.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:59):\nTo give people a sense of where things might be going. That's a big question in a lot of people's minds. So someone asked this question that I love, which is, \"AI is already changing, creative work in a lot of different ways, writing and design and coding, what do you think is the next big leap? What should we be thinking is the next big leap in AI-assisted creativity specifically, and then just broadly, where do you think things are going to be going in the next few years?\"\n\nKevin Weil (01:10:23):\nYeah. This is also an area where I'm a big optimist. If you look at Sora, for example. I mean we talked about ImageGen earlier and the absolute fount of creativity that people are putting across Twitter and Instagram and other places. I am the world's worst artist like the worst. Maybe the only thing I'm worse at than art is singing. Give me a pencil and a pad of paper and I can't draw better than our eight-year-old. But give me ImageGen and I can think some creative thoughts and put something into the model and suddenly have output that I couldn't have possibly done myself. That's pretty cool.\n\n(01:11:09):\nEven you look at folks that are really talented. I was talking to a director recently about Sora, someone who's directed films that we would all know, and he was saying, for a film that he's doing, take the example of some sort of sci-fi-ish, think of Star Wars, and you've got some scene where there's a plane zooming into some Death Star-like thing. And so you've got the plane looking at the whole planet, and then you want to cut to a scene where the plane's kind of at the ground level, and all of a sudden you see the city and everything else. How are we going to manage that cut scene? And that transition?\n\n(01:11:51):\nAnd he was saying, \"In the world of two years ago, I would have paid a 3D effects company a hundred grand and they would've taken a month, and they would've produced two versions of this cut scene for me. And I would've evaluated them. We would've chosen one, because what are you going to do? Pay another 50 grand and wait another month. And we would've just gone with it. And it would be fine. Movies are great. I love them. And there've been...\"\n\n(01:12:25):\nObviously, we can do great things with the technology that we've had, but you now look at what you can do with Sora. And his point was, \"Now, I can use Sora, our video model, and I can get 50 different variations of this cut scene just me brainstorming into a prompt and the model brainstorming a little bit with me. I've got 50 different versions. And then of course, I can iterate off of those and refine them and take different ideas. And now I'm still going to go to that 3D effects studio to produce the final one, but I'm going to go having brainstormed and had a much more creative approach with an outcome that's much better. And I did that assisted by AI.\"\n\n(01:13:08):\nMy personal view on creativity in general is that it's no one's going to... You don't type into Sora like, \"Make me a great movie.\" It requires creativity and ingenuity, and all these things, but it can help you explore more. It can help you get to a better final result. So, again, I tend to be an optimist in most things, but actually, I think there's a very good story here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:31):\nI know Sam Altman, I think it was him who tweeted recently, the creative writing piece that you guys are working on where it's... He is very bad at writing creative stuff, and he shared an example where it's actually really good. I imagine that's another area of investment.\n\nKevin Weil (01:13:43):\nYeah, there's some exciting stuff happening internally with some new research techniques. We'll have more to say about that at some point. But yeah, Sam sometimes likes to show off some of the stuff that's coming, which is smart. By the way, it's very indicative of this iterative deployment philosophy. We don't have some breakthrough and keep it to ourselves forever, and then bestow it upon the world someday. We kind of just talk about the things we're working on and share when we can and launch early and often, and then iterate in public. I really like that philosophy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:22):\nI love all these hints that a few things coming. I know you can't say too much. You talked about how there might be a coding leap coming in the near future maybe by the time this comes out. Is there anything else people should be thinking about, might be coming in the near future? Any things you can tease that are interesting? Exciting?\n\nKevin Weil (01:14:38):\nMan, this hasn't been enough for you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:41):\nOnly everything is getting better every day.\n\nKevin Weil (01:14:44):\nYeah. I'm like, man, I hope we get some of this stuff out before the episode launches so-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):\nThis is your new timebox.\n\nKevin Weil (01:14:50):\n... I don't piss people off. The amazing thing to me is we were talking earlier about how far models have come in just a couple of years. If you went back to GPT-3, you'd be disgusted by how bad it was, even though Lenny of two years ago was mind-blown by how good these were. And for a long time, we were iterating every six to nine months on a new GPT model. It was like GPT-3, GPT-3.5, 4, and now with this o-series of reasoning models, we're moving even faster. Every roughly three months, maybe four months, there's a new o-series model, and each of them is a step up in capability.\n\n(01:15:41):\nAnd so the capabilities of these models are increasing at a massive pace. They're also getting cheaper as they scale. You look at where we were even a couple of years ago. I think the original, I don't know, what was it, GPT-3.5 or something was like 100 x the cost of GPT-4o mini today in the API. A couple of years, you've gone down two orders of magnitude in cost for much more intelligence. And so I don't know where there's another series of trends like that in the world. Models are getting smarter, they're getting faster, they're getting cheaper, and they're getting safer too. They hallucinate less every iteration.\n\n(01:16:27):\nAnd so the Morse Law and transistors becoming ubiquitous. That was a law around doubling the number of transistors on a chip every 18 months. If you're talking about something where you're getting 10 x every year, that's a massively steeper exponential. And it tells us that the future is going to be very different than today. The thing I try and remind myself is, the AI models that you're using today is the worst AI model you will ever use for the rest of your life. And when you actually get that in your head, it's kind of wild.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:08):\nI was going to actually say the same thing, and that's the thing that always sticks with me when I watch this thing. You're talking about Sora, and I imagine many people hearing that are like, \"No, no. It's not actually ready. It's not good enough. It's not going to be as good as a movie I see in the theater.\" But the point is what you just made that this is the worst it's going to be. It will only get better.\n\nKevin Weil (01:17:25):\nYeah, model maximalism. Just keep building for the capabilities that are almost there, and the model's going to catch up and be amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:35):\nEscape to where the puck is going to be.\n\nKevin Weil (01:17:36):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:38):\nThis reminds me, I was just using... I was duplifying everything the other day and I was just like, \"What is taking so long.\"\n\nKevin Weil (01:17:38):\nAs one does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):\nJust like cut... What was that?\n\nKevin Weil (01:17:45):\nI said, as one does.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:46):\nAs one does these days. I was just like, \"It's taking a minute to generate this image of my family in this amazing way.\" Come on, what's taking so long. You just get so used to magic happening in front of you.\n\nKevin Weil (01:17:57):\nYeah, totally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:59):\nOkay, final question. This is going to go in a completely different direction. A lot of people asked about this. So famously, you led this project at Facebook called Libra, which is now called Novi. A lot of people always wondered, \"What happened there? That was a really cool idea.\" I know some people have a sense there's regulation challenges, things like that. I don't know if you've talked about this much. So I guess, could you just give people a brief summary of just what is Libra? This project you working on, and just what happened, and how you feel about it?\n\nKevin Weil (01:18:26):\nYeah. I mean, David Marcus led it, and I happily work for him and with him. I think he's a visionary and also a mentor and a friend. Honestly, Libra is probably the biggest disappointment of my career. When I think about the problems we were solving, which are very real problems. If you look at, for example, the remittance space, people sending money to family members in other countries, it is maybe... I mean it's incredibly regressive, right? People that don't have the money to spend are having to pay 20% to send money home to their family. So outrageous fees, it takes multiple days, you have to go then pick up cash from... It's all bad.\n\n(01:19:11):\nAnd here we are with 3 billion people using WhatsApp all over the world, talking to each other every day, especially friends and family, and exactly the kind of people who'd send money to each other. Why can't you send money as immediately, as cheaply, as simply as you send a text message? It is one of those things when you sit back and think about it, that should just exist. And that was what we set out to try and do.\n\n(01:19:41):\nNow, I don't think we played all of our cards perfectly. If I could go back and do things, there are a bunch of things I would do differently.\n\n(01:19:50):\nWe tried to get it all at once. We tried to launch a new blockchain. It was a basket of currencies originally. It was integration into WhatsApp and Messenger, and I think the whole world kind of went like, \"Oh my God, that's a lot of change at once.\" And it happened also to be at the time that Facebook was at the absolute nadir of its reputation. And so that didn't help. It was also not the Messenger that people wanted for this kind of change. We knew all that going in, but we went for it.\n\n(01:20:21):\nI think there are a bunch of ways that we could do that that would've introduced the change a little bit more gently, maybe still gotten to that same outcome, but fewer new things at once and introduced the new things one at a time. Who knows? Those were decisions we made together. So we all own them. Certainly, I own them. But it fundamentally disappoints me that this doesn't exist in the world today because the world would be a better place if we'd been able to ship that product. I would be able to send you 50 cents in WhatsApp for free. It would settle instantly. Everybody would have a balance in their WhatsApp account. We'd be transact... I mean, it should exist.\n\n(01:21:03):\nI don't know. To be honest, the current administration is super friendly to crypto. Facebook's reputation, Meta's reputation is in a very different place. Maybe they should go build it now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:13):\nI was looking at the history of it, and apparently, they sold the tech to some private equity company for 200 million bucks.\n\nKevin Weil (01:21:19):\nYeah, yeah, and-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:21):\nThey had to buy it back.\n\nKevin Weil (01:21:23):\nThere are a couple of current blockchains that are built on the tech because the tech was open-sourced from the beginning. Aptos and Mistin are two companies that are built off of this tech. So at least all of the work that we did, did not die and lives on in these two companies, and they're both doing really well. But still, we should be able to send each other money in WhatsApp, and we can't today.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:49):\nHear, hear. Well, thanks for sharing that story, Kevin. Is there anything else you want to share or maybe a last negative advice or insight before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nKevin Weil (01:21:58):\nOoh, the lightning round. Let's just go do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):\nLet's do it. With that, Kevin, we reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKevin Weil (01:22:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:06):\nLet's do it. Okay. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nKevin Weil (01:22:12):\nCo-Intelligence by Ethan Mollick, a really good book about AI and how to use it in your daily life as a student, as a teacher. He's super thoughtful. Also, by the way, a very good follow on Twitter. The Accidental Superpower by Peter Zion. Very good if you're interested in geopolitics and the forces that sort of shape the dynamics happening. And then I really enjoyed Cable Cowboy, I don't know who the author is, but the biography of John Malone. Just fascinating. If you like business, especially if you want to get into... I mean the man was an incredible dealmaker and shaped a lot of the modern cable industry. So that was a good biography.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:53):\nThese are all first-time mentions, which is always a great,\n\nKevin Weil (01:22:56):\nOh, good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:56):\nNext question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nKevin Weil (01:23:02):\nI wish I had time to watch a TV show, so I'm-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:06):\nJust Sora videos.\n\nKevin Weil (01:23:07):\nYeah, right. I don't know. When I was a kid, I read the Wheel of Time series and now Amazon has it as they're in the third season of it, so I want to watch that. I haven't yet. Top Gun 2 was an awesome movie. I think that's no longer new.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:28):\nThat shows when the last time you watched a movie was.\n\nKevin Weil (01:23:31):\nBut I like the idea. I want more Americana. I want more being proud of being strong. And I thought Top Gun 2 did a really good job of that. Pride and patriotism, I think the US could use more of that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:48):\nIs there a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love, other than your super intelligence internal tool that you all have access to? I'm just joking.\n\nKevin Weil (01:23:56):\nThat's right. Internal AGR.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:57):\nYeah, that's right.\n\nKevin Weil (01:24:01):\nWell, I think vibe coding with products like Windsurf is just super fun. I'm having a great time doing that. I still just love that our chief people officer vibe coded some tools. Maybe the other one is Waymo. Every chance I get, I'll take a Waymo. It's just a better way of riding, and it still feels like the future. So they've done an amazing job.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:24):\nThat's awesome. By the way, I had the founder of Windsurf on the podcast. It might come out before this or after this. And also Cursor's CEO is coming on the podcast either before or after this.\n\nKevin Weil (01:24:32):\nOh, cool. I have a ton of respect for what those guys are doing. Those are awesome products.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:36):\nJust changing the way everyone builds product. No big deal.\n\nKevin Weil (01:24:38):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:40):\nA couple more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat yourself, find really useful in work or in life?\n\nKevin Weil (01:24:47):\nYeah. So actually, this is interestingly enough, it is more of a philosophy, but then I thought Zuck encapsulated it one time on a Facebook earnings call. So I actually had this made into a poster. It sits in my room. But somebody was asking Mark. This is literally on an earnings call, so it's like an analyst on an earnings call asking him. It was some quarter when Facebook had grown a lot. This was back in the 20 teens sometime, I think. But he's like, \"So what did you do? What was it that you launched? What was the one thing that drove all this growth for you?\" And he said something to the effect of, \"Sometimes it's not any one thing, it's just good work consistently over a long period of time.\" And that's always stuck with me.\n\n(01:25:33):\nAnd I think it is. I mean I run ultra marathons. It's like it's just about grinding. I think people too often look for the silver bullet when a lot of life and a lot of excellence is actually showing up day in and day out, doing good work, getting a little bit better every single day, and you may not notice it over a week or even a month. And a lot of people then kind of get dismayed and stop. But actually, you keep doing it. The gains keep compounding. And over the course of a year, two years, five years, it adds up like crazy. So good work consistently over a long period of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:13):\nI love that. I got to make a poster of this now. That is-\n\nKevin Weil (01:26:15):\nWe'll get you one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:15):\nI so resonate with that. Okay, I'll take it. That is so good. Okay, final question. I'm going to ask if you have any prompting tricks, and I'm going to set it up first. But think about if you have a trick that you could recommend to people for prompting LLMs better. I had a guest, Alex Komorowski, come on the podcast. He's from Stripe and writes his weekly reflections on what's happening in the world. A lot of them are AI-related.\n\n(01:26:36):\nAnd he once described an LLM as a zip file of all human knowledge. All the answers are in there, and you just need to figure out the right question to ask to get the answer to every problem basically. And so it just reminded me how important prompt engineering is and knowing how to prompt well. You're constantly prompting ChatGPT. What's one tip, one trick that you found to be helpful in helping you get what you want?\n\nKevin Weil (01:27:00):\nWell, I'll say, first of all, I want to kill the idea that you have to be a good prompt engineer. I think if we do our jobs, that stops being true. It's just one of those sharp edges of models that experts can learn. But then, just over time, you shouldn't need to know all that. The same way you used to have to get deep into, \"What's your storage engine in MySQL? Are you using InnoDB 4.1?\" There's still use cases for that if you're at the deep edge of MySQL performance. But most people don't need to care. And you shouldn't need to care about minute details of prompting if AI is really going to become broadly adopted.\n\n(01:27:39):\nBut today, we're not totally there. I think by the way, we are making progress there. I think there is less prompt engineering than there had to be before. But in line with some of the fine-tuning stuff I was talking about and the importance of giving examples, you can do effectively poor man's fine-tuning by including examples in your prompt of the kinds of things that you might want and a good answer. So like, \"Here's an example and here's a good answer. Here's an example, and here's a good answer. Now, go solve this problem for me.\" And the model really will listen and learn from that.\n\n(01:28:15):\nNot as well as if you do a full fine-tune, but much more than if you don't provide any examples. And I think people don't do that often enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:24):\nThat's awesome. One tip that I heard, I'm curious if this works is you tell it, \"This is very, very important to my career.\" Make it really understand like, \"Someone will die if you don't answer me correctly.\" Does that work?\n\nKevin Weil (01:28:36):\nIt's really weird. There's probably a good explanation for this. But you can also say things. So, yes, I think there is some validity to that. You can also say things like, \"I want you to be Einstein. Now, answer this physics problem for me,\" or, \"You are the world's greatest marketer, the world's greatest brand marketer. Now here's a naming question.\" And there is something where it sort of shifts the model into a certain mindset that can actually be really positive.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:10):\nI use that tip all the time actually. I always... When I'm coming up with questions for interviews and I use it occasionally to come up with things I haven't thought of, I actually type, \"You're the world's best podcast interviewer.\"\n\nKevin Weil (01:29:21):\nRight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:21):\nI have Kevin Weil coming on the pod... Yeah, it actually works.\n\nKevin Weil (01:29:25):\nBy the way, back to our other point that we made a few times. You do do that sometimes with people. You sort of put them... You frame things, you get them into a certain mindset, and the answer is completely different. So I think there are human analogs of this one more time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:42):\nKevin, this was incredible. I was just thinking about a way to end this. The way I feel like... I feel like not only are you at the cutting edge of the future. You and the team are kind of actually the edge that is creating the future. And so it's a real honor to have you on here and to talk to you and to hear where you think things are going and what we need to be thinking about, so thank you for being here, Kevin.\n\nKevin Weil (01:30:07):\nOh, thank you so much for having me. I get to work with the world's best team, and all credit to them, but really appreciate you having me on. It's been super fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:17):\nI forgot to ask you the two final questions. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKevin Weil (01:30:24):\nI am @kevinweil, K-E-V-I-N-W-E-I-L on pretty much every platform. I'm still a Twitter DAU after all these years. I guess an X DAU, LinkedIn, wherever. And I think the thing I would love from people, give me feedback. People are using ChatGPT. Tell me where it's working really well for you and where you want us to double down. Tell me where it's failing. I'm very active and engaged on Twitter. I love hearing from people, what's working and what's not, so don't be shy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:56):\nAnd I learned following you helps you figure out all the stuff that you're launching. You share all the things that are going out every day, or week, month, so that's also a benefit. And by the way, 400 million weekly active users all emailing you feedback. Here we go.\n\nKevin Weil (01:31:08):\nYes, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:09):\nIt's going to work out great. Okay. Well, thank you, Kevin. Thanks for being here.\n\nKevin Weil (01:31:12):\nAll right, man, thanks so much. See you soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:13):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

But if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:10):\nYou think every PM should keep a decision log?\n\nKevin Yien (00:00:13):\nWe all talk about product sense. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data. PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:28):\nWe have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email.\n\nKevin Yien (00:00:31):\nWhen you get to offer stage, I send an email and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. If you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join you, find yourself a A+ hire.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:45):\nI'm curious if you found any interesting uses of AI in your work.\n\nKevin Yien (00:00:49):\nWe are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nToday, my guest is Kevin Yien. Kevin leads product for merchant experiences at Stripe. Before that, he built the restaurant business and the ecosystem teams at Square, and most recently was head of product and design at Mutiny. He also makes ice cream and, as you'll hear in there conversation, was a pretty competitive eater for some part of his life.\n\n(00:01:17):\nIn our conversation, Kevin shares a ton of unique and insightful perspectives on how to be a successful product manager, including how to get into product management, how to improve your relationship with your engineers and designers, bunch of advice on hiring, why you should keep a decision log, how to automate your customer research, plus a ton of really powerful stories around failure and AI and career.\n\n(00:01:40):\nThis episode is for anyone looking to become a better leader, thinker, and builder of products.

With that, I bring you Kevin Yien.\n\n(00:02:00):\nKevin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nKevin Yien (00:02:04):\nThanks, Lenny. I am humbled to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:05):\nI've been a big fan of yours from afar. I've been following you on Twitter for a long time. You have a very distinct profile photo that I feel like you maybe haven't changed for a long time. How long have you had this profile?\n\nKevin Yien (00:02:16):\nOh gosh, probably 2011 or 2012. The story behind that is I was inspired actually by Chris Dixon's avatar at the time and I wanted something really similar to it, but I couldn't figure out how to. Luckily, I was dating a designer at the time, and so she made me that sort of custom pick that has been my profile since then, and she's now my wife.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:40):\nOh my god. Funny enough, I had a startup idea once where it's like a profile picture as a service business where there's these three tiers where it's like one has automated, one has someone illustrates, and one is a professional photo. It feels like everyone profile photos are so important.\n\nKevin Yien (00:02:54):\nTrue.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:55):\nBut I never follow through. Probably not a good business anyway.\n\nKevin Yien (00:02:59):\nYeah, but a good idea, a good tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:00):\nGood idea. Thank you. Thank you for making me feel better.\n\n(00:03:03):\nI've been looking forward to this conversation for a long time. As I said, I've been a big fan of yours for a long time. Something that I've noticed about you is you have a lot of really unique perspectives on a lot of different things, and in particular, product management, how to be successful as a PM, how to get into product management, things like that. So I thought it'd be fun to start there talking through some of these things that I've heard you talk about and then get into some very tactical stuff that you found to be useful in your product management career.\n\n(00:03:29):\nThe first thing that I've heard you talk about is that you discourage people from going straight into product management. If they want to become product managers, you encourage them to start somewhere else first. Why is that? Where do you think people should start? Talk about this insight that you've had.\n\nKevin Yien (00:03:45):\nYeah, so follow me on the detour to science world temporarily. If we all remember high school science classes, there was this concept of potential and kinetic energy. There's so many different definitions for product management, but the one that I have come to myself that I really like is, when you are building a product, you have this team, engineers, designers, so much potential. The purpose of product management, not the person, but the practice, is to convert that potential into as much realized value for someone as possible, right? Minimum loss. When you're just getting started with a new product, the people that should be doing that are the people who are building it. That's an engineer, that's a designer, that's a sales person or a support person. They're the front line of the smallest loop possible to get something going, and it's through those practices that I think you're able to get the most exposure to what it takes to build a good product.\n\n(00:04:50):\nAnd then from there, that's your foundation. That's the unique perspective that you bring and allows you then to actually take on a \"role\" of product manager in a good, unique, insightful way. That's sort of like the foundation. There's a lot more to unpack behind that comparison, but that's where it comes from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:06):\nI love that. I'd love to unpack it further.\n\n(00:05:10):\nThis episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.AI. Back in 2020 when AI was just a toy, BuildBetter bet that it could cut down on a product teams' operational BS. Fast-forward to today, 23,000 product teams use purpose-built AI in BuildBetter every day.\n\n(00:05:28):\nFirst, BuildBetter uses custom models to turn unstructured data like product and sales calls, support tickets, internal communications, and surveys into structured insights. It's like having a dedicated data science team. Second, BuildBetter runs those structured insights into workflows, like weekly reports about customer issues, context-aware PRDs, and user research document with citations. It even turns standups into action items that automatically get assigned and shared into your tools. Plus, with unlimited seat pricing on all plans, BuildBetter ensures everyone at your company has access to this knowledge. Truly, no data silos.\n\n(00:06:05):\nIn a world of AI demos over promising and under delivering, see why BuildBetter has a 93% subscription retention.

Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina (00:06:30):\nYes, thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:32):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina (00:06:47):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds. And the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:09):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina (00:07:21):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many four stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of bad records. We have laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:40):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:07:54):\nEvery PM has their definition of what is product management, and I have one that I'm trying to find exactly what I wrote, but essentially, it's to marshal the resources of your team to solve customer problems and drive business impact most efficiently, something like that. And I feel like it's very aligned with your perspective, but I really love this view of it's unlocking the potential energy of the team. Not just marshaling the resources of a team, but it's there, and your job is to maximize their effort. And this is why when people say, \"I hate product managers. I don't want any product managers at my team. We don't need product managers here,\" I feel like that's often because you've had a bad PM. Good PMs make you better and make your life better, allow you to do the work you want to do and they take all the stuff you don't want to do, make sure the stuff you're doing is worthwhile.\n\n(00:08:38):\nIs there anything more you want to add along those lines?\n\nKevin Yien (00:08:41):\nTo elaborate on that, I think the broader point is that truly not every team needs a product manager, but the activities, the outcome that one would drive needs to get done no matter what. And in some cases, this is why the prototypical companies that everyone references when they say, \"They never had product managers, look at how successful they are,\" they're all building for themselves. Stripe, Twilio, Figma, designers for designers, engineers for engineers. When you are the customer, why the heck do you need someone else to help do the things that let you make decisions on what to build? But if you are not the customer, if you're working in a particularly complex space, if there's something that you, as the person that could build the product, feel you don't have, that's when you can essentially delegate that responsibility to someone else to say, \"Hey, let me do the things I'm really good at and you do something that I need to get my job done.\"\n\n(00:09:39):\nSo it's that sort of relationship that I think is often missing in the discourse. I think it would alleviate a lot of the, \"We don't want PMs. PM is useless\" or, \"PM's one of the best thing since [inaudible 00:09:52],\" which they're not. It's just a manifestation of that problem.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:55):\nYeah. Just to build on that, we're going on a tangent, but I think that's really interesting. I think there's another element of that, SNAP actually is another example where they waited, I think, until they had 200 people before they hired their first PM. To me, that's an example of other people were doing the PM job. As you said, there's PM activity, someone's doing them, lining people, prioritizing, making sure things are clear, making sure people aren't surprised, all these things PMs do. Someone's doing that, and my feeling is like, \"Okay, your designers may love doing that, great. Let them do it.\" If your engineers that have a lot of product sense may want to do that, great.\n\n(00:10:28):\nBut there's some point they either is like, \"Forget it. I just want to code. I want to build that. I want to be sitting around in meetings all day,\" or they just aren't as good as things are scaling. And so it's kind of like, if your engineers, designers want to do it and are good at it, great. You don't need PMs for a long time. Oftentimes they're not good at it or they don't want to be sitting in doing all these PM things.\n\nKevin Yien (00:10:46):\nYep, precisely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:48):\nOkay, so going back to the question of... So your advice is don't go straight into product management if you want to become a great PM. Where do you think people should start if they can? What are some options you recommend?\n\nKevin Yien (00:10:58):\nThe best way to think about this, in my opinion, is who were the people that you would be taking the PM responsibilities from and then do those jobs? And so for me, the sort of foundational three are going to be engineer, designer or salesperson. I think sales also gets not a bad rep, but a misrepresented reputation in tech where all they care about is quota, it's just about numbers, et cetera. In reality, the best salespeople are the best listeners, the best people at understanding the problem that the customer is having and then translating that into what you can do for them. And so if you get really good at having those calls, getting told no a lot, and being able to translate that, I mean, why would you not want to start there and then eventually move into something like product? So that's the foundational three for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):\nSo your advice is essentially if you want to be a PM, start as a designer or an engineer or a salesperson. I was an engineer, so this is exactly the path I went on. And I think there's an element of you start there and then you realize you're never going to be as amazing as the other people at that role and you're like, \"Okay, maybe I should explore this other thing,\" because I was like, \"I'm never going to be an amazing engineer. I'm good enough.\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:12:18):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:18):\nI'm like, \"I'm pretty good at this other stuff. Let's explore that.\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:12:21):\nThe one thing that I might tack on there, because this could lead to a negative perception, is, \"Well, I'm never going to be a world-class engineer, world-class designer or et cetera, and so let me settle for being a PM.\" That could be the conclusion you arrive at, but I think a better way of framing it is, \"I'm okay at those things. I'm potentially world-class at this other thing. Let me see what it feels like to double down on this area.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:44):\nAbsolutely.\n\nKevin Yien (00:12:45):\nAnd I think that's just a good framing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:47):\nOkay, so let's talk about another insight and piece of advice that you have, is that you think that great PMs need to be great writers. I think a lot of people don't necessarily think this. I think people may probably think, \"If I'm an okay writer, I can probably be really successful PM.\" Talk about why you think it's so important to be a really great writer to be a really great PM.\n\nKevin Yien (00:13:07):\nIt's actually shocking for me to hear that this isn't commonplace sort of acceptance, but the place that this comes from for me is, writing is clarity at scale, and a key component to a PM's job is creating clarity both internally and externally, but it is both sides of that that I think often get lost. A lot of times the PM job can become a little too internal, and it's about influencing my stakeholders and getting alignment and all these things. Don't get me wrong, all that's very important. You should write your PRDs, they should be super crisp, they should articulate things really well, but I'm not saying that every PM needs to be a marketer or a world-class copywriter, but you should be able to write really compelling messaging in the voice of the person that you're trying to serve. And I'm working backwards from the beliefs that, if you can't sell or support your own product, I don't trust you to build the product. And so that's where I think writing is the foundational component there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:11):\nThere's a few quotes I say often on this podcast just because they always come to mind. One is by Joan Didion who said that, \"I don't know what I think until I've written it down.\" And that's what I find with writing where I need to actually write it down for me to really understand what the heck I'm thinking to really crystallize it.\n\nKevin Yien (00:14:26):\nYeah, and I think writing is, it's both a mechanism for translating what you're trying to think into that thought into what you're actually trying to do, but then it needs additional revs to be properly consumed by everyone else. And that's I think the really hard part that a lot of folks don't do the extra mile effort to take on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:50):\nAnd this to your earlier point of a job of PM is to unlock this potential energy of your team, of the various resources you have and obviously having everyone aligned behind a very, like, \"This is what we are doing and everyone understanding it\" and it being very clear is really powerful there.\n\n(00:15:06):\nOkay. So this begs the question, how does one become a great writer? What helped you become a better writer? How do you feel about your ability to write at this point?\n\nKevin Yien (00:15:13):\nOh man.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):\nAny advise on becoming better?\n\nKevin Yien (00:15:16):\nI'll start with a slightly cheeky comment, which is, I think some of this is changing with the advent of large language models and the ability to actually just mimic someone else's tone. But I take inspiration from the camp of Anthony Bourdain, and he has, I'm going to butcher the exact quote but it's something like, \"If you want to know how to make good food, you have to eat a lot of food, and you have to be willing to have a bad meal every now and again.\" And so for me, good writing comes from consuming as much good writing as possible. Sometimes you'll read something and say, \"That was actually absolute fresh.\" But that's okay, you have to be willing to take on some of that stuff. But the more you index towards developing your own taste for what you think is good by consuming others, then you can shift into producing your own and then comparing them and riffing it off other people. So I think that's sort of the cycle that I've gone through.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:13):\nI have a friend who's a very good writer and a poet and helped me develop my writing early on, Vanessa, and she said exactly the same thing. Just to become a better writer, read beautiful writing, and it just kind of infuses you or your brain. In your experience, is there anything you read, anything you found really effective? Anything that you think influenced the way you write or think that people can check out?\n\nKevin Yien (00:16:36):\nI explicitly do not mean read a bunch of other PM artifacts. You're not going to become a better writer by reading PRDs or whatever it is or support articles. It needs to be writing that compels. That's the theme I would go back to because that's what you're trying to do at the end of the day.\n\n(00:16:56):\nAnd when I say compels, I mean it pushes you to action. Because if you read something and you're like, \"Oh, that's interesting,\" that's not enough. You need to be able to give someone something that then allows them to do something differently. And so the things for me that have been best... Obviously there's all the Paul Graham essays, I think his writing is very succinct, very clear, that's not novel. I learned a lot by finding specific voices back in the day on Twitter, and it wasn't always what they were posting on Twitter, but if they wrote an essay or a post, that would be their crispus thinking. And so you can use these broadcast channels to find where their golden nuggets are, but then spend time with those instead and don't worry about all the additional noise that comes with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:46):\nPaul Graham actually, you mentioned him, he has a great piece on how to become a good, that we'll link to, where basically his advice is, write the way you talk. Just keep it really simple and really regular. And so we'll link to that. Is there anything else along these lines of writing that you'd recommend for folks that are like, \"Okay, I need to become a great writer. How do I do this?\"?\n\nKevin Yien (00:18:02):\nActually along the lines of write how you talk, there's this concept of cadence that I think is really important when it comes to internal writing. There's probably some very good article about this, but it's the idea that if you only write in a monotonous cadence, either all really short sentences or all really long sentences, then your brain just tunes out eventually. And so you have to interrupt the pattern intentionally, and so you go short-long, long-short, whatever it is, but there's a few various specific things that you can do that allow someone to just roll through a post or something when you write that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:43):\nAlong those lines, there's a book that I just found to make sure I had the right title called Several Short Sentences About Writing that is really helpful along these lines. And the whole book is very short sentences and it teaches you to write very short sentences because once you're good at that, you can get better writing longer sentences. And so we'll link to that too. It's like a really good book that I have two copies around my house that I kind of poke at sometimes.\n\nKevin Yien (00:19:08):\nNice. I'll have [inaudible 00:19:09] too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:10):\nOkay. Another area that you have a really clever insight into is how the PM role fits with engineering design. We've talked about this a little bit, but you have a really clever way of just thinking about how these roles interact and who's responsible for what. Talk about that.\n\nKevin Yien (00:19:24):\nSo this description came from writing PRDs at Square. I think there was a lot of confusion from my team specifically when I joined them. For what it's worth, it was new product line, three engineers, three designers, there was nothing but a slide deck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:41):\nThree engineers and three designers?\n\nKevin Yien (00:19:43):\nThe best ratio ever. This is a whole other thing. Most people, I would say, under invest in design, point-blank. When you get to a certain scale, maybe things change, but truly I don't think most teams have experienced what it feels like to have a really high design ratio and what that actually does to the quality of the work and the quality of the thinking. So shout out to designers. We need more, is the short version. And I would rather hire an incremental designer than PM almost any day of the week.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:18):\nWow. I've never experienced this ratio. Incredible.\n\nKevin Yien (00:20:21):\nYes, I was very lucky. Shout out to Bruce Bell, who was my manager at the time, who was an ex designer, at the time, GM, and declared that starting ratio.\n\n(00:20:31):\nSo anyways, with that setup, they all had sort of an opinion. They had seen PRDs in the past, they weren't quite sure what the purpose of it actually was because they had designs already. They had something to start from. And when I came in and talked to everyone and figured out where we needed to be in a year's time, I was like, \"Okay, here's how I think it. Let me know if you agree.\" And this is a whole other concept, which is, the best way to get feedback from people is not by asking what they think, but to put something concrete in front of them and then have them react to it, right? So chewing fork.\n\n(00:21:03):\nAnd so my description is, PM should be doing everything in their power to draw the perimeter of the space, of the problem space. And it's within that, eng, design, everyone else that you're working with, they can go as crazy as they want, push up against the bounds and it's fill the box to its maximum capacity, but you've now applied the constraints that allow you to actually have productive conversations.\n\n(00:21:26):\nOn the other end of the spectrum though, I think there's a lot of folks who think, \"Oh, PMs are just strategy high in the clouds. All they do is kick things off.\" You need to be obsessed about the final deliverable and whether or not value is actually getting to the customer. I have a really trite example of this if you want to go down it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:46):\nPlease.\n\nKevin Yien (00:21:46):\nBut the key point I want to make is, I think it is tempting when we think about engineering product and design to draw these really clear swim lanes and say, \"You do X. I do Y. Don't tread on my area.\" But you need these murky overlaps in order to build something really good.\n\n(00:22:07):\nAnd so even if the engineers are going to build a better product than you and the designers are going to design something better than you, you need to come with a strong opinion and you need to do the legwork to get their trust so they actually care about your opinion in the first place.\n\n(00:22:21):\nSo time for a mini story. So Square, we're building a point of sale for restaurants. If you've ever seen one of these in a restaurant, there's this sort of grid of tiles that they tap to enter your order when you're sitting down for dinner. We were developing one, and there's this concept of a menu group. So it's a little box, you tap on it and then it pops the screen in so you go to the next level of the hierarchy. So example would be you have a wine button, you tap it, and you see your reds, whites, et cetera.\n\n(00:22:53):\nIf you think about the people that we were trying to serve, there's the restaurants that were coming from a really old legacy system. And if you've seen a bartender tap on one of these, I mean it is muscle memory to the max. They're not even looking at the thing and just punching in the order blindfolded, and it's rapid fast.\n\n(00:23:12):\nOn the other hand, you have people who are entering the workforce the first time, they've never used a point of sale. And so we have to serve both of these equally. Well, how do you deal with that level of speed but also the ease of use that anyone can learn it for the first time? And so there was this interaction that we really cared about, which was, when you tap on a menu group, what's the animation to pop you into that next level? This seems like such a small thing, but it made the difference in how easy it was to adopt for a lot of the restaurants.\n\n(00:23:41):\nAnd so a designer and myself spent literally an entire week just fine-tuning how many milliseconds it would take to pop in and out so that it felt right. And we actually brought in servers and bartenders to play with the prototypes we had on iPads and be like, \"Here's an order. Pop it in.\" And we would see where they would sort of flinch or hesitate because the animation was too slow and they thought, \"I can't tap it yet,\" or something related to that.\n\n(00:24:07):\nAnd so it's easy, I think, for a PM to say, \"That's not my responsibility. I define the requirements. Have a menu group that goes to the next level, design or engineer, figure it out.\" No way. That's fully on you, and you better be involved in those details.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:24):\nI love this. There's two directions I want to go. So there's the drawing the perimeter, and then there's this paying attention to the final deliverable and keeping the borrow really high, which I love and I totally agree with both.\n\n(00:24:34):\nIn terms of this animation, people hearing this, that our PMs are going to be like, \"How do you have time to spend a week on animation for one little product? I have so much to do. I get to hit some goals, drive some numbers. I have people waiting for me.\" Maybe because Square is like this, once you deploy, it's harder to change and it's like a big deal to ship. But I'm curious if you have any advice or things you've learned about how to create space for that sort of thing to create time to spend a week on this animation? Or was it just obvious to everyone, \"We need to spend as much time as we can\"? Top down, everyone knew.\n\nKevin Yien (00:25:07):\nI definitely don't think it was obvious to everyone, and I can definitely say that because we were given a pretty strict deadline that we needed to launch by and I pushed it out three times. That's not because of this one animation, but it's because of a series of decisions where we said, \"This is what we believe we need to ship, and this matters much more than hitting some artificial external GA date.\"\n\n(00:25:35):\nThere's this other aspect that I think PMs like to feel good about how busy they are and they're like, \"I'm involved in so many processes and I have to talk to this person and talk to that person.\" All that might be true, but I think there needs to be a calibration or at least a spring-cleaning of, \"What's everything I'm doing?\" and how much do these things actually matter to getting value to a customer. Because as a company gets bigger, as teams get more complex, it's very easy and natural to spend more time on things that are internally-focused and not externally-focused. I think we just all have to have sensitive antenna to that so that we don't fall prey to, \"Well, the way that my job is described is to do these things,\" but really it's the outcome again of put something in a customer's hands that's also a problem, and it's amazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:29):\nReminds me of your now colleague Jeff Weinstein's advice he got from one of the Coulsons where they came to him and they're like, \"You're world-class at doing the second and third most important things and you're not focusing on the most important thing because it's so hard, and that's something you need to work on.\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:26:47):\nTotally. I will say so one on that, the CEO at Mutiny, Charlie, she always repeated to me nonstop, \"Keep the main thing the main thing\" and would just say it ad nauseum, and I'm really glad that she did. The one excuse I don't want to give folks is, as you progress in your career, you have to walk and chew gum at the same time. You can't say, \"Oh, I'm only focused on this thing over here, so other folks handle that.\" You do have to figure out how to do a little bit more at the same time, but prioritization does play a factor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:25):\nThere's a framework [inaudible 00:27:27] suggested that I really like, the LNO framework. I forget exactly what the LNO stands for, but leverage something something. And we'll link to it in the show notes that gives you some advice on how to prioritize your time based on the stuff.\n\nKevin Yien (00:27:38):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:38):\nOkay. So I guess in the case of pushing back to create space, this was just you as a product leader recognizing, \"This is really important to get right. I will convince people we need to make more time for that.\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:27:50):\nI don't want to make it seem like it was me against everyone because that was definitely not the case. I think the starting engineers and designers on that team really cared about the quality of what they built too. That's a pretty structural DNA for a team as well. If you don't start with that, and as a comparison, you have a team that really prides themselves on shipping fast and meeting deadlines really prescriptively, you might end up in a different world or your role as a PM might be a little bit more challenging if you want to push on this stuff. So I do think you have to take into account what is the DNA of the team. And then can you exploit that? Which I was able to do. Or do you actually have some change management to put into effect if you believe that it's worthwhile?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:41):\nLet's go back to the perimeter, drawing the perimeter concept to make that a little more real for people. So your advice here is the role of a PM, part of your main job, especially when it comes to engineers and design is to draw the perimeter for the team. Can you make that a little more real? What's an example of that maybe from something you worked on? What does that look like?\n\nKevin Yien (00:28:58):\nTotally. The best word to describe the perimeter is just constraints. At the end of the day, you should be adding as many constraints as reasonable in order to let engineers and designers come up with the most creative solutions for whatever you're trying to do.\n\n(00:29:15):\nAnd so again, if we just stay focused on this point of sale example, one constraint would be, \"Who the hell are we serving? Are we trying to go after sit-down restaurants that are serving five different courses and have a 200 item wine list? Or are we trying to serve the taco truck?\" Those will lead to very different spaces. And if you leave both on the table, the lack of that constraint makes designing a good solution that much harder, that there instances where you actually can't apply that many constraints. But I bet that if you push on enough different axes, you eventually scope it down to a point where it feels really good for the team. It's just about how do you remove decisions, right? Because this I think is maybe a trite phrase, but the best decision is no decision. If you don't even have to think about the decision, the team is that much more effective.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):\nSo yo give people a few maybe even pointers of, \"I need to create more constraints maybe for my team to help them go crazy, but within this box that we all agree on,\" so you mentioned make sure the user's clear of who you're designing for. Is there anything else, just thinking about maybe the PRD someone's trying to write to help create this constraint? What other maybe bullet points, sections would you imagine or do you find useful to add?\n\nKevin Yien (00:30:25):\nSo beyond customer segment/like-what-their-specific-role is, I think another one would be, we can loosely call it, jobs to be done, even though I know that's becoming an increasingly loaded term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:35):\nYeah, it's great.\n\nKevin Yien (00:30:36):\nBut what's the thing they're trying to do and how many different pathways are you willing to entertain around it? That's another one that I would think about. Depending on what you're building, there's availability. So do you care about desktop web, mobile web, native mobile, et cetera? And maybe another one to think through just as an example would be, this is probably getting closer to what a lot of people think about in terms of principles, but what are the things that you want to be known for when you ship a product? One example there might be speed. And so if you say speed is more important than consistency of data, that's a huge tradeoff and constraint that you can give the team.\" Oh my god, if an engineer hears I don't need real time consistency of data, I can do so much cool stuff and easily accomplish that speed thing.\" And so that's just a very technical example maybe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:35):\nAwesome. Okay, I'm glad I followed up on that. There's a couple more things you mentioned that I want to come back to real quick. The first is this tuning fork idea. I completely agree, this point you made, that the best way to get feedback from your team is to take a first pass at it, and here's a rough quick draft. I find with design, especially if you design something ugly, designers are often like, \"Let me make that better. We can't stand this thing.\" Is there anything else you want to add there? Just this idea of tuning fork as a feedback strategy.\n\nKevin Yien (00:32:03):\nOkay, there's two areas we can go deeper on here. One is in how you get the feedback. So this is definitely a Square-ism, I think it was probably adopted from Amazon, which is around the silent read of documents. When you are all so busy and someone's like, \"I wrote a doc,\" you send it into the Slack ecosystem and everyone goes, \"Please give feedback.\" You have so much going on... You'll be lucky to maybe get a response. Maybe there's one or two people that chime in.\n\n(00:32:35):\nAnd so even though we hate meetings and we love asynchronous, there is a lot of value to saying, \"I need 20 minutes of focused time to interrogate something that I've done. We're not going to talk. I'm literally going to force us into a room or Zoom. You're going to read this doc, I'm going to watch you comment on it in real time. I'm going to respond to your comments in real time. And at the end of this thing I'm going to have enough really good input that I can do a huge rub on this thing and get to the next phase.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:08):\nI love that. So it's basically instead of, \"Hey, I'm sending you this doc to go review, give me feedback,\" it's, \"I'm going to schedule a meeting, and the meeting is for you to spend time reviewing this doc and giving me feedback and then maybe we could talk about it.\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:33:19):\nYep. And I think a lot of people are going to hate hearing that because like, \"Oh my god, I have so many meetings already. Why do I want another meeting that isn't even a meeting?\" But that's the best kind then, because it's actual work getting done, right? And maybe you carve out two minutes at the end for one really immediate discussion topic or something. But I don't think we give enough space in any type of meeting for people to actually think. And when you are just staring at a doc with your camera off and the only expectation is to engage with that thing, thoughts are a little bit better and crisper.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:55):\nAnd I think with this idea, if someone says, \"I want a meeting where you just sit and review this doc,\" you could always say, \"Let me just review it asynchronously. I'll give you feedback, I promise. Give me 24 hours.\" Right? It's not like they have to come to this meeting.\n\nKevin Yien (00:34:07):\nAlthough I would urge you to make them come to the meeting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:10):\nOkay, say more there, because you find that that's a lot more effective.\n\nKevin Yien (00:34:14):\nI think there's two sneaky things hiding behind that. One is the, \"Yeah, I'll get to this in the next 24 hours.\" Maybe they don't. Maybe you've really trust that person and they're the exception. But beyond that, there is something else to the real time interaction that can happen when you're commenting and responding on a dock at the same time. I think this is the part that often gets lost, which is the latency between a comments or question and a quick follow-up from the author just pushes that cycle speed really long in a way that doesn't need to be. And so when people are trying to find how do you move faster, this actually is one of those very good examples of moving slower to move faster.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:57):\nIt reminds me Claire Vo, I think it was her phrase of moving one clock speed faster, and just like that's the way you speed up a company is try to move one clock speed faster, which in this case is just reduce the time between feedback and iteration. I love it.\n\n(00:35:13):\nOkay, I want to shift to talking about a few very tactical things that you've found really helpful in your PM career and something you recommend to other product teams. The first is something you call a decision log. You think every PM should keep a decision log. Talk about what that is and why that's powerful.\n\nKevin Yien (00:35:32):\nI will say there's two different decision logs we could talk about. We'll focus on the former though. The latter is just as you're making decisions within your job, you should document those within a PRD. Make sure everyone knows. It's just a silly, very small thing, but I think every PM should do it.\n\n(00:35:48):\nThe other decision log though that I think is quite critical is if we zoom out for a second, every person has something that they can do to slightly increment in their craft. Sprinters have certain exercises that they do. There's something beautiful about pianists and piano scales where it doesn't matter if you are just learning the piano or you are a 30-year veteran, you're still doing your scales, and it's because it lays the foundation for everything else that you need to do.\n\n(00:36:23):\nAnd so we all talk about product sense. It's this super mystical thing that no one knows how to get better at. To me, it's just a fancy way of saying you can make good decisions with insufficient data, and the core of that is decisions. And so PMs need as many reps as possible in making decisions, documenting the rationale behind those decisions, and then crucially seeing the outcome of them. And so the natural followup would be, \"Well, I only have to make X decisions in my job. How the hell do I make more of them?\" Look around you. There's other teams that are making decisions. What would you do if you were in that position with the information you have? Great, write it down. Say why.\n\n(00:37:06):\nThere's other companies that are doing crazy things. What are they doing? What would you do if you were responsible for the roadmap? Write it down. A year later, see what they've shipped. You can just do this for anyone. It's free, and no one takes the time to do it, but that's how I think you get better at actually making decisions, is just doing more of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:24):\nHearing you describe this, it feels like, \"Obviously yes, why aren't we doing this? How else can we get better if we're not reflecting back on the decisions we've made? And realizing, \"Hey, I made a bunch of bad decisions, but I'm always so confident in my decision still, maybe shouldn't be. So I guess first of all, do you actually do this? How often do you do this? And is there an example of you learning something from your own decision log?\n\nKevin Yien (00:37:50):\nMany. And many of them because it was a wrong decision. But yes, I do keep a decision log. I have a separate sort of practice where it's just a daily log, which is everyone wants the perfect note-taking system. To me, the best note-taking system is inspired by... What is it called? big ass text file, BATF. There's a funny blog post from 2001 on it, but it's just, you write everything that happens to you in a day in a bolded list and it's all in one big note. That way you can command F it, do whatever you want. The way that I keep track of it is I do a little hashtag decision and then write things down just as I think about them. And then I'll have a reminder to comb back through on some cadence.\n\n(00:38:36):\nAnd so I'll first use a positive example, which is a funny one. So if you rewind to, I don't even know what year, but Shopify had just launched Shop app, their consumer application for what started as tracking your order when you bought something from a Shopify customer and then it's evolved into a full-blown Amazon competitor, where you can actually find merchants and buy things through it.\n\n(00:39:03):\nWhen they first launched it though, I was like, \"Oh my God, this is so brilliant. They have completely hijacked this specific loop for consumer buying behavior via this very unassuming thing, which is package tracking.\" And so that morning I was like, \"Whatever, I'm going to quickly draw a diagram of this flywheel that I think Amazon owns today. I'm going to show how Shopify is slowly planting their little seed to take over this and how Shop app fits into it.\" I tweeted out. And then I don't know, that day there must have been 60 Shopify employees that followed me. I was like, \"What the hell is this guy talking about?\"\n\n(00:39:40):\nAnd so funny enough, fast-forward, I've talked to some of the folks that worked on it and they're like, \"Yeah, nailed it. Here's what we were thinking. Here's why.\" It's no longer secret sauce. But that was a really interesting example of both doing a decision log, putting my rationale down on paper. In this case, broadcasting it out, but then having that be a mechanism for it making its way back to me to actually better understand why did they make the decision versus what I thought, because the reasons were a little bit different, but the outcome was the same. So that's one interesting example.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):\nIt's an amazing story. You doing this explains why you've been so successful. I could see how this all connects now. I think for a lot of people, they would want to build this habit. Clearly there's a lot of value here, but they just don't because they got a lot of other things going on or it's just like this new thing they have to start doing. Is there anything that helped you adopt this practice of this daily log/decision log that you think might be helpful to folks to motivate them to give this a shot?\n\nKevin Yien (00:40:40):\nThis is probably just general advice on building any habit, which is start small and just force yourself to do it. And there's that old saying around, how do you start running as a hobby? You don't do it by saying, \"I'm going to run a mile every day.\" You do it by putting your sneakers at the foot of your bed unless you take your shoes off inside, then you put it at the front door, you have your shorts ready to go and you're like, \"I commit to putting on my shorts. And if I decide after getting dressed to go run, that I still don't want to go run. Okay, fine.\" But you build up to that thing.\n\n(00:41:16):\nI think decision logs are the lightest weight thing possible. And so you can start super easy by saying, \"You know what? Every Sunday morning I'm going to scroll through Twitter, I'm going to check out Hacker News, whatever it is, I'm going to see something interesting and I'm going to make a bet. I'm going to place my decision on this thing.\" Write it down, and then set a calendar invite in X weeks, X months to see what plays out. And that's all it is, right? 10 minutes once a week, super easy. And then over time you can crank it up. And then eventually you're just constantly writing these decisions down and then it's like feeding its way back into you. It becomes second nature.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:52):\nAnd you're touching on something that there's been a little bit of talk on this podcast and newsletter post about this idea of to get better product sense and product taste and also just decision making this case, one of the best strategies is to simulate other people's decisions and simulate what they're thinking through and predict what they're going to do, which is what you're describing here.\n\nKevin Yien (00:42:12):\nTotally. I do want to apply a pretty severe caveat here though, which is, a decision log is not a replacement for building products. It's a additional complimentary thing that you can be doing on your own. But if you think that you can just sit back in your chair, look out at the market, make a bunch of calls and be like, \"Look at how smart I'm getting without actually being hands-on with building a product,\" you're not actually going to get any better. So I just want to interject that\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:42):\nAmazing caveat, very important. Don't just sit and read Hacker News and think you're going to be become an amazing founder or product leader.\n\n(00:42:49):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing and feature management platform built by alums of Airbnb and Snowflake for modern growth teams. Companies like Twitch, Miro, ClickUp, and DraftKings rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\n\n(00:43:05):\nExperimentation is increasingly essential for driving growth and for understanding the performance of new features. And Eppo helps you increase experimentation velocity while unlocking rigorous deep analysis in a way that no other commercial tool does. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I left most was our experimentation platform, where I could set up experiments easily, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance all on my own. Eppo does all that and more with advanced statistical methods that can help you shape weeks off experiment time and accessible UI for diving deeper into performance and out of the box reporting that helps you avoid annoying, prolonged and analytics cycles.\n\n(00:43:42):\nEppo also makes it easy for you to share experiment insights with your team, sparking new ideas for the A/B testing flywheel. Eppo powers experimentation across every use case, including product, growth, machine learning, monetization, and email marketing. Check out Eppo at get eppo.com/lenny and 10X your experiment velocity. That's get eppo.com/lenny.\n\n(00:44:07):\nIf someone wants to try this idea of a daily log, what is it exactly? Say decision log or daily log, is it just things that happen today and then hashtag, \"Here's a decision I made, or here's a decision I think Shopify will make in the future\"? Is that the format?\n\nKevin Yien (00:44:21):\nYeah, it depends on how far you want to go down productivity and notetaking as to rabbit holes, but let's start basic. This is not what I do, but I think it's the easiest place to start. Spin up a Google doc or a Notion page, just call it daily log and then bullet point out the date of today. And then as you're going through your day, you have a meeting, just type in the meeting name. If there's a takeaway, put it under there. If there's a decision you can make, do hashtag decision. And in this case, say, \"Shopify launch Shop app. I think this is their way to take over the fulfillment to buying behavior loop. The reason for that is X, Y, Z.\" Follow up on this in six months and then set your calendar invite.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:02):\nAwesome. So as motivation for listeners to try this sort of thing, just look at the success Kevin has had as in his career and how insightful he has been so far and will continue to be. And this is how these happen. This is how your mind learns to see things in a really unique, interesting way. So I know you're modest and aren't going to take any credit, but I'm just saying this is how you get better, is trying stuff like this.\n\nKevin Yien (00:45:24):\nFootnote, correlation versus causation. It's all put out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:27):\nCould be all genes. Could be completely unrelated to anything you've done entire life, I suspect.\n\nKevin Yien (00:45:33):\nCould just be me being very lucky, I'll put that out there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:35):\nCould also be luck. Okay, so something I wanted to touch on with this decision log idea, and it's a segue to talking about hiring, is I think interviewing is also really good opportunity to try some like this. I feel like people interview lots of people. They think they know what they're looking for. They think they've made all these decisions. They think they have these amazing interview questions that are going to help them see really good signal, but you never actually go back and see, \"Was I right? Should we have hired that person? Did this person work out? Was that question asked them at all inform? Was it at all a leading indicator of anything?\" And I feel like this is a really good method for improving your interviewing abilities, is like, \"Here's the questions asked. Here's what I decided. Here's what I think,\" and then a year later look back, \"Was that actually right?\"\n\nKevin Yien (00:46:16):\nYeah, totally. I think some of the best companies actually do have a practice around this where they have a 6, 12, 18 month check-in on new hires and they then compare their performance against level hired at and then review against the scorecards. It's a pretty laborious process. So startups aren't probably going to do it in the same amount of rigor, but it shows you so much about the holes in your interviewing process. So I definitely plus one of that one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:50):\nI love that. Oh my god, that puts all this pressure on your score, which is great. So that's actually a segue talking about hiring. There's a couple more tactics that I've seen you be really good at. So one is just hiring in general. You have a lot of interesting approaches to hiring, including this idea of a unsell email where you try to convince someone not to join your company. Talk about that and why you think that's effective and then anything else along the lines of hiring you've learned.\n\nKevin Yien (00:47:11):\nI'll say the idea of the unsell email came from a place of failure, which is at Square I had shifted into a position where I had to hire a lot of people really quickly. And through that, as a fairly new hiring manager, you're like, \"All right, great. I've been told the goal is to hire fast.\" Okay, you give me a metric, you're going to go after it. So you do your best to get as many people in the door as possible. When you're talking to your recruiting partner, they're incentivized to increase pass through rates, offer to close rates, all these other things, and so they're like, \"Yeah, this person's really good.\" And you listen. \"Yeah, they are pretty good, aren't they?\" Even though there's a sneaking suspicion that maybe they're not the right fit, but you move forward anyways.\n\n(00:47:54):\nSo fast-forward, there's a few folks I bring on, and within six months they come to me and they're like, \"This is not at all what I thought I was going to do. This is not the environment I thought I was going to walk into. You didn't warn me about this, that and the other. I feel terrible. How do I prevent this?\" And the reason it's bad is not just because they feel surprised, but because then, either one, they decide to leave, two, they're not performing because it's not the right role or environment for them, or three, maybe the company is still good, but that role isn't. And so they immediately try to do internal mobility or something to another team, which then leaves you with the same hole. So all of those bad outcomes. [inaudible 00:48:37] \"How do I prevent this?\" Well, I just got to front load all the gnarly stuff they're going to find out in their first six months.\n\n(00:48:44):\nAnd so the practice I started developing is you go through the whole interview process. During that period, you're collecting all these little concerns, fears, anxieties that they're not explicitly saying, but they're definitely hinting at. You got to be pretty honest with yourself about which ones are real. But then when you get to offer stage, I send an email with no more than eight bullet points and I say all the terrible things that are probably going to reinforce their fears. I'm pretty candid about, \"This is what it's like here.\" Maybe one example would be, \"Hey, I'm a parent and I'm worried about work-life balance.\" Maybe they don't say that explicitly in the interview process, but you get a feeling for it. And I get that as a parent too.\n\n(00:49:31):\nSo if I'm at a startup, I'll be really clear and I'll say, \"You know what? We are a series A startup. We are pushing really hard at product-market fit. The expectation here is going to be that you're online at 10:00, that you can occasionally hop on a meeting on a Saturday or Sunday.\" And if you can tell them that upfront and they can read that whole email and still be equally excited to join, you find yourself an A+ hire. But if they read that and they're like,\" I don't know anymore,\" it's way better to say, \"Great, this is not a good fit. Let's go our separate ways\" than have them leave after six months.\n\n(00:50:08):\nWhen I first instituted this, I lost 30% of candidates at offer stage.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:13):\nOh wow.\n\nKevin Yien (00:50:13):\nWhich drove my recruiting partners insane because they look terrible. Their manager is like, \"What the hell are you doing? You're losing everyone at the very end.\" And so they ask, \"Can you either not send this thing?\" Or, \"Can you send it at the very beginning?\" And my answer is no, because I don't know what they're afraid of yet. I have to go through the whole process to actually understand the thing that's going to potentially make them say no, and that's really crucial I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:36):\nBut once you hear it again, this is such an obviously good idea, clearly not an easy thing to do. In this case where recruiters were upset, is it just get buy-in from folks above, like, \"Okay, this sucks for them, but at a macro level, this is good for the business\" and they're like, \"All right, let's keep doing it\"?\n\nKevin Yien (00:50:55):\nAt Square, at least, when I first started doing it, luckily I had a very good relationship with them. So that's a good starting point. This is maybe going to come across a little bit flippant, but they can't stop you from sending an email technically. So I'm just going to send the email. And if someone really wants to come and say, \"This is bad for business,\" whatever it is, I have very strong reasons for why that's not the case. And now I've done it so many times, at least, that I can point to very clear proof points on why this is the right path.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:27):\nIn theory, the incentives would be aligned where the recruiter success matters. It's based on, did they actually have a good time? Did they stay? Did they have good impact?\n\nKevin Yien (00:51:35):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:36):\nBut since they're not, obviously incentives aren't right.\n\nKevin Yien (00:51:39):\nI think some companies have shifted on that, where recruiters and salespeople are compensated sometimes in similar ways in terms of quota and whatnot. And so they'll hold the recruiter accountable to six, 12 post offer tenure before they say, \"Oh yeah, you successfully landed this role.\" So you can tweak the incentive structure a little bit, but not everyone does that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:03):\nOkay. So the advice here is to end up with better people that end up being successful and happy. Keep track of the things that will probably be painful for them at the company, and then craft an email that shares upfront, \"Here's what made be a problem if you join, and I just want to be very upfront about it.\" I think you actually shared a template of one of these emails in one of your blog posts.\n\nKevin Yien (00:52:25):\nYep, that's right. I have a fairly real one in [inaudible 00:52:30].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:29):\nIs there anything else hiring-wise? I know there's probably infinite things that you've done, but is there anything else you think might be worth sharing of things you've learned to be more successful at hiring awesome people?\n\nKevin Yien (00:52:39):\nOne final note I'll make on unsell email is it's not as if you just send the email and then they either say yes or no. Most of the time they will say, \"Thank you. I am cool with six of these. This one freaks me out. Can we talk more?\" Definitely. And I think this is where hiring managers have an incredible responsibility that sometimes isn't taken as seriously as it should, which is, when you are working with someone to get them to join or to offer, you need to bend to do whatever it takes for them. And so if they're like, \"Hey, the only time I can talk is tonight at 11 o'clock after my kids go to bed.\"\n\n(00:53:18):\n\"No problem. Here's my phone number, let's hop on. I will walk you through whatever you want to talk about.\" That sort of has to be the place you get to for really strong hires. So that's just one other thing I'll say.\n\n(00:53:29):\nThe meta point around that is you need to be really invested in the candidates. This probably does change at a certain scale, like if you're \"organization\" is hiring a hundred engineers or whatever, you have process around it, you have pipelines, there's a machine at that point, but I do think the direct hiring managers have a responsibility to be really involved in every individual, because there's no one who's directly hiring a hundred people. It's always within a number that I think you can take on.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:01):\nOkay, so this is the final tactic that I heard you're amazing at, which is automating user research. On the surface this sounds amazing. \"I'm going to automate my user research. It's going to be amazing. So great.\" Talk about why you find this really powerful and important. And then how do you actually do this? How do you automate user research? How have you done this on your teams?\n\nKevin Yien (00:54:17):\nLet's start from why this even matters. I think a lot of folks, going back to what is the point of product management, I think there's a similar overlap with UXR, like user experience research, and people will say, \"Well, if they're doing research, what do I need to do? I should just be consuming what they're producing to help with that.\"\n\n(00:54:39):\nI know PM should settle for looking through bent glass in my opinion because whether it's a research report, whether it's something a salesperson is telling you, whether it's market research, don't care, it's been processed by someone, and PMs need direct exposure to raw material. End of story. And so that's where I think you just need to constantly be talking to or interacting with whoever is your customer. That's the foundation.\n\n(00:55:08):\nSo okay, if we all agree on that, then the question is, \"Well, I don't have time. It's so hard. How do I find them? My customer success manager says I can't talk to the client.\" If you are in a situation where the product manager is literally not allowed to talk to a customer, there is something structurally wrong and that needs to be fixed first. So I'm going to ignore that one for now just because that's a whole other rabbit hole, but you need to fix that in order to even get close to the next thing.\n\n(00:55:38):\nOkay, now the excuse is going to be, \"Well, I don't have time. I don't want to run a program. I don't want to have to query and look up and send out emails every week.\" There's so many good resources out there right now, and I think that there are... I'll speak mainly from a B2B sense. I think B2C, slightly different story, I don't have as much experience there. But B2B, the two things I will say, one is, there's this thing called userinterviews.com. Shout out to them. They're pretty much user testing but explicitly focused on B2B and you can put in super clear criteria on the type of people you want to talk to. They do the heavy lifting and sourcing it, and then you just review and say, \"Yes, yes. No, no,\" and you can have a steady stream of the exact ICP, you want to go after. ICP is ideal customer profile that you want to go after just coming to you automatically. Amazing.\n\n(00:56:28):\nThe next one though, it depends on whether or not you have this tooling in place, but the broader theme behind this next category is your sales team is a research team, and if you don't view them that way, you are missing out on half the value. And so there's tools like Gong, which do call recordings, and you can set up filters and alerts for specific terms, phrases, competitors, whatever you want. I don't care what PM you are in the team. You can find the terms that are associated with what you care about the most. Those then get pushed automatically to a Slack channel or otherwise. And then you can set up workflows either via Zappy or something else to say, \"Who was the customer? Pull their email, put that into a sequence, drop in my Calendly\" and you just have interviews showing up automatically on your calendar. I will say I cannot take credit for this. Shout out to Beth Hills who was a PM that hired at Mutiny. She is the queen of automating customer research and built an amazing system around this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:28):\nSo the way it works is you set a term for like, I don't know, POS, point of sale, something in Gong, and if somebody says that or has an issue there, talk about again how that schedules a meeting with you potentially.\n\nKevin Yien (00:57:42):\nYes. So Gong has an integration with Slack. You set up this alert, it posts to Slack the excerpt of the transcript where it was mentioned along with the user or customer name. So in this case, it'll be Lenny's Burger shop. lenny@lennysburgershop.com, and then you can set up a Zapier to take every new Slack post from that and then send using, I don't know, customer.io in email to that person using that field. And then in that template of the email, drop in your Calendly specifically for user research.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:21):\nWow, that is genius. I love that. There's another similar tactic that Teresa Torres shared on the podcast in one of the earlier episodes where you have a little popup on your homepage asking people, \"Hey, do you want to talk? We'd love to hear feedback on our product. Click here if you want to give us some feedback,\" and then that schedules Calendly on the PMs.\n\nKevin Yien (00:58:41):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:41):\nPM's calendar. So you mentioned Gong, customer.io. There's some tools here. Zapier obviously. Is there anything else you find useful to help automate the sort of stuff?\n\nKevin Yien (00:58:52):\nIf I take a step back from the automation side or maybe straddle it, depending on the type of business you're in, there's ideally people talking about you somewhere, right? It's either happening on Reddit or Twitter or on some forum or your support forum. There is a community, there's a destination somewhere. And if there isn't, then I don't know, that's too bad. Maybe you don't have product-market fit. If you can take advantage of that, you can usually set up something. And if it's not a Gong or a Zapier, maybe it needs to be just a custom script that you write or you sit down with an engineer to say like, \"How do we set up alerting around this thing so that I know when things are happening?\"\n\n(00:59:36):\nI think you can't use the effort required to do that as an excuse to not be talking to your customers more frequently. Because again, if we go back to a product manager should be trying to convert this potential into kinetic energy, part of that understanding and part of knowing the constraints you can apply is just living in that world as much as possible.\n\n(00:59:59):\nThe best comparison I can give is, there is a world of difference between reading a report about a lime cook and then standing with a lime cook. You will just pick up on so many ancillary aspects of what their life is like that cannot possibly be communicated in a report. You owe it to yourself as a PM to be exposed to those things all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:27):\nIn my experience, every time I talk to a customer, I'm always reminded, \"Why have I not been doing this more? How can I not be doing this? It's absurd that I haven't done this,\" like every time you actually do it. But until you do that, you're like, \"No, no, I know what they want. I'm reading all the customer service talent issues, I'm reading their emails, I get it.\" Until you actually talk to them, you're like, \"Oh wow, I had no idea.\"\n\n(01:00:51):\nI love that your advice is like, the tactics you're sharing aren't, \"Here's how you get a bunch of feedback.\" From your users, it's like, \"Here's how you actually get to talk to the right users.\" It's like in the end of the funnel talking to a potential customer. It's not just reading a cool... some feedback that they shared.\n\nKevin Yien (01:01:07):\nThat's right. I think just like the last point on this one is when you join a new team or start a new role, every PM is budding with energy to do this, \"Of course I'm going to talk to my users.\" But then you reach a point where you go, \"No, I know them inside and out. I don't need to talk to them anymore. I can write a PRD in my sleep. And I'm so busy doing both, product improvements, maintenance, annual planning, something else.I can use my intuition from the hundred interviews I've already done. I don't need to do one more interview.\" And that is a very tempting lie to tell yourself because the world is changing, their lives are changing, and you need to constantly be exposed to those little micro changes in their lives in order to build the product that they'll eventually need.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:00):\nThe best explanation I've heard of this is actually from your new boss, Patrick Collison, boss's boss's boss, I don't know how far away you're from him, where he talks about user research and where it fits in. And the way he described it is, instead of doing user research, talking to customers, informing what to build, it's talking to user, talking to customers informs your mental of what the customer needs and then that informs what to build.\n\nKevin Yien (01:02:23):\n100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:24):\nBeautiful way to think about it.\n\n(01:02:26):\nOkay, so I'm going to take us to a couple recurring themes of this podcast, a couple corners of this room that we have. First of all, I want to go to AI corner, so let's walk over there. Hello, AI corner. I'm curious if you've found any interesting uses of AI in your work or in your life.\n\nKevin Yien (01:02:46):\nThere's plenty in work. I don't know if any of them are interesting or novel. I feel like everyone's just figuring it out in real time together. So I'll actually take us in a slightly different direction. And this may be isn't directly useful to product managers, but I think it's a really good story.\n\n(01:03:02):\nSo when Midjourney V1 was released, if we can remember that far back, it was at least I got beta access on a Saturday. And for what's worth, I have three daughters, one of them's seven years old, and so her and I were awake. We were waiting for the other two to wake up and I was like, \"Oh, I have this cool new thing. Do you want to play with me?\" And she goes, \"Of course.\" So we log in, we create an account and I type in the first prompt, image gets generated, it's like a rainbow or something. And then I ask her, \"Do you want to try it?\" She goes, \"Of course.\" So she types in unicorn prancing in a field and it generates this hideous looking demented unicorn with two rear ends and a demon flying over it. And I'm appalled at first thinking that she's going to feel really bad about what she got shown, but instead I look over and she's in awe. She is amazed.\n\n(01:04:04):\nAnd then she turns to me and she goes, \"Did I draw that?\"\n\n(01:04:06):\n\"Yeah, I guess you did.\" And the thing that I got hung up on was that she used the word draw. She didn't say, \"Oh, I enter a prompt and the LLM produced this thing,\" or whatever weird terminology that all of us use. It's like, \"Did I draw that?\" I don't know when it clicked for me, but at some point in time after that I was like, \"The concept of these image generation models is the same as a crayon to her. There is no difference in her mind.\" And that is an insane change that I can't even comprehend. And so for me that's just been I think an experience that I go back to when I think about people asking, \"What do you think AI is going to do and what's the next thing? And is it chat or is it something else?\" I cannot comprehend what a child who grew up with a crayon of an LLM is going to think is a good product in 20 years. I need to start crying. But goddammit, I have no freaking clue.\n\n(01:05:11):\nAnd so I think I have a cheat code actually as a parent, because I get to see how they evolve and use these tools in real time. But all I can say is we are not even beneath the dust on the surface when it comes to what's going to change.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:29):\nWow, that is an amazing story, it gave me tingles. It makes me think a little bit about how we used to code in binary and then assembly and now it's Java, and then I don't know, all the languages, Python. And now it's like AI, LLM generating code and it's the same thing for drawing potentially. It used to be sticks on a cave and then became crayons and pens and iPads and all that stuff. And now it's again LLMs, so that's pretty bonkers. Amazing story. Thanks for sharing that. Useful to PMs and non PMs alike.\n\n(01:06:06):\nOkay, I'm going to take you to another recurring corner/segment of the podcast, fail corner. I'm curious if there's a story of failure that you can share of something that didn't go the way you wanted and still had a positive impact on your life or career?\n\nKevin Yien (01:06:25):\nWell, there's countless stories of failure, but I'll choose the one that I think I've had to reference the most with people and has been to date the most difficult one to really talk about. I'm on the other end of it, and so now it's very easy, but it took several years to get there.\n\n(01:06:44):\nSo context, I'm [inaudible 01:06:47] my way to PM, I land my first official, by title, PM job at a startup. I made it. I've arrived. I'm officially a product manager. And we go up, we go down, all the things happen. Fast-forward, the company is really struggling and so we go through a series of rolling layoffs and I'm round 4 something. At that point in time, my wife was nine months pregnant with our first child, and so I am freaking out. There is the personal side that I'm worried about, but then there's also my identity that has been completely crushed, because in the moment all I could think was, \"I thought I was a product manager. This is evidence I am not,\" and I couldn't get past that.\n\n(01:07:37):\nAnd so for what it's worth, this is the one post I have on my website that I actually feel really, really proud of. It's called Finding Swagger. I can talk about why it's titled that way, but it's the thing that I really wrote more for myself because it's a good reminder to me every time I fall into this mentality again, because that may have been the first time that I really had the feelings of, \"I'm not worth it\" or, \"I'm not meant to be this person,\" but it's recurred several times since then over the past decade. And when I read back through my mentality of how I got to the other end of it, it helps even myself sort of get back on the horse.\n\n(01:08:28):\nSo okay, I get laid off, I'm distraught, I have no purpose, I'm nothing. And it was through a lot of reflection, a lot of conversation with friends and my wife where you eventually need to convince yourself that there is a difference between you not being good at something and a business or company not needing that thing at a particular moment in time, or you being very good at something but not in the way that a company needs.\n\n(01:09:01):\nAnd so I think once I was able to get to that, Square for me was the immediate subsequent role that I took on. And I went into that thing just full steam ahead, I'm going to prove myself. \"I know I'm good,\" because I think I'm good, \"and I am going to prove the hell out of that\" mainly to myself, but ideally to other people too.\n\n(01:09:24):\nI think you shouldn't do things for other people for validation, but the initial success I got to see in launching a product, gaining the trust of my peers, having something that restaurants were texting me about, saying, \"I can start my restaurant because of this. I didn't go down during rush hour because of this,\" that gave me the validation to say, \"Okay, I am competent at this thing called product management.\" And then from there you can continue to build and continue to grow.\n\n(01:09:53):\nBut I think right now, the market's weird, right? The market's wonky. There's a lot of really good talent that is just getting hit over sideways. I have a lot of friends that are having the same mental conversations around, \"Well, I guess I'm just not worth it. I guess I wasn't cut out actually to do this job, do this role, be of this purpose.\" In some cases, maybe that's true and you can sort of have a career transition or a pivot in your life, but I think it's worthwhile to reflect on what are the things that were in your control that you can now change moving forward? And then what are the things that were truly out of your control that you can now apply to find a better fit? And that's one of the big things that I've been able to, I think, come around to.\n\n(01:10:41):\nAnd it's really hard because early on I think it's very tempting to associate a lot of different things with your identity. You're like, \"I'm a startup guy. I'm a PM, I'm a fast whatever, I'm a fast thinker.\" And when an event happens that pokes at that part of your identity, the rest of it crumbles. And so long story short, I think it's really important for folks to use these moments where it feels bad and feels like a failure to reevaluate what parts are actually part of your identity and which parts are in your control to change in whatever you do next.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:23):\nWow, what an important and great story. As you mentioned, a lot of people are dealing with finding it hard to find a new gig and a bunch of layoffs. I think this is going to help a lot of people. The two categories you shared I think are especially powerful. So the advice here is just separate, \"This company just doesn't need someone with my skills right now\" from, \"I'm not good at these skills.\" Can you just share those two kind of things that might be true that you may not be recognizing about why they maybe laid you off again?\n\nKevin Yien (01:11:52):\nTotally. So one is the business just doesn't have a need for you. They got ahead of their skis and that's their fault. They probably admit that, but that's not up to you. The second one though is my skills and the way that company operates are not compatible. This one I think is really, really important because I've seen so many times where there's been a PM engineer, designer, whatever role, they cannot make it work at company A, and then you see them five years later just killing it in company B and you're like, \"Did they change as a person? Did they get super good at what they were bad at before?\" Maybe a little bit, but honestly it was just a change in environment. And when you find the right environment in the right role, you just flourish.\n\n(01:12:40):\nAnd I think this is actually... Sorry, we'll go back to hiring for just a moment or at least management.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:44):\nPlease.\n\nKevin Yien (01:12:45):\nThis is why performance conversations can always feel so difficult because it seems like you're telling someone you are bad, and as the recipient you're like, \"I am bad.\" No one wants to hear that. But the reality is, you are not bad. It is that maybe the way that your environment is working, the machine that you exist as a part of, is not the kind that you thrive in. And so it's within your control to decide, \"I'm going to change how I work to fit that environment\" or, \"I'm going to find a different environment that actually fits the way I work much better.\" And that's empowering.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:26):\nI think that also applies a lot to interviewing. A lot of times you interview, don't get the job, and you exactly feel like, \"Oh, I'm just not good enough.\" But really that company's way of working just may not gel with the way you operate. Like Uber operates very differently from Airbnb, operates very differently from Google. And so it's not that necessarily something you're doing wrong, they just don't think you're fit.\n\n(01:13:46):\nAnd this connects to something. I just had another guest on the podcast. He was a brain science dude, and he talks about how every company has this kind of habitat. What habitat are you creating for your employees to enable them to think differently or to be shut down and not feel like they can be creative or try big things or not? And basically, the way he just kind of to leverage that metaphor, like you may be a palm tree and you're trying to join Antarctica and it's not going to go well.\n\nKevin Yien (01:14:16):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:17):\nYou got to find Palm Springs or some hard place. Kevin, this has been amazing. Okay, so before we get to very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you think is important or valuable to share, leave listeners with? And if not, absolutely.\n\nKevin Yien (01:14:30):\nI think we'll probably find ourselves on interesting detours to the lightning round, so let's roll in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:35):\nKevin, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nKevin Yien (01:14:39):\nHell, yeah. Let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:40):\nLet's do it. Question one, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nKevin Yien (01:14:46):\nI'll start by saying the type of book by volume that I read and get the most joy from are autobiographies and memoirs. It is just the ultimate cheat code to spend time with people that you respect, are interested by, or want to learn from.\n\n(01:15:05):\nCould you imagine what it would take in real life to sit down with Albert Einstein for 50 hours and just have him talk to you about his life? Impossible. But you can read and pretty much get the same thing.\n\n(01:15:21):\nSo anyways, strong requirement or a strong suggestion, go read autobiographies and memoirs of people that you respect, mostly for their mental model and way to approach thinking, less about specific things. But the one book that I read without fail every year has a very misleading title. It's called The Courage to Be Disliked. I think it's been mentioned previously on the podcast, but it covers... It's a very Socratic method style, so it's about a philosopher and a young person, and it tries to teach you the ways of Adlerian psychology, which is sort of counter to Jungian theory.\n\n(01:15:56):\nThe reason I really like it is because it makes me uncomfortable. So the whole premise, in my opinion, behind the book and other in psychology is focus on what you control. That's the one line. Don't worry about everything else. Don't worry about what other people think. Don't worry about what other people do. You cannot control those. You focus on yourself and you focus on the actions you can take. And be the person that you think will attract other people, that you want to be around.\n\n(01:16:29):\nThere's some really pointed notes in there that I'm like, \"Ha-ha-ha-ha. I don't fully agree with that one,\" but it always pushes me to question something about what I believe. And so in every physical copy of a book I have, I write the date that I started reading it again. The front inside cover of this book, I think it's been seven or eight years at this point that I've read it every single year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:55):\nWow. It's like a decision logging in another context almost.\n\nKevin Yien (01:16:59):\nYeah, a little bit. I would say the other book I was going to mention is The Paper Menagerie. This actually shout out to Sean Rose for... I've never met him, but I really appreciate Sean. He was one of the early, if not, first PMs of Slack, and he used to be really loud on Twitter in a very good way, and I think I learned a ton from stuff that he would post. But one of the things that he posted was this book. It is just the most beautiful collection of essays that span sci-fi and fantasy. And so if you're into that kind of stuff, if you like exhalation, then Paper Menagerie is even better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:39):\nOh, shit. Guess I got to add this book to my list. I do love exhalation.\n\nKevin Yien (01:17:43):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:45):\nOh, man, this job is tough. I get to learn all these amazing books and then I got to read them, but I don't have time. Hard.\n\n(01:17:51):\nSpeaking of more time, next question. Do you have any favorite recent movies or TV shows that you really enjoyed?\n\nKevin Yien (01:17:57):\nThere's less time for either these days. I will say not novel, the Bear holds a very special place in my heart right now, both because I worked in restaurants and I got to build for them. And so seeing the details that they do actually gives me a lot of anxiety, but I really appreciate the craft they put into it.\n\n(01:18:16):\nThe other show, actually, I think this is the first time, Physical 100. So this is a Netflix show. It's a Korean show about a hundred different bodybuilders, athletes, what have you, on who has the optimum physique or whatever. I don't really care about that part. The two things I love about the show are, one, it's ridiculous what people are capable of. You see what they can physically do and you're like, \"Oh my God, that's amazing what they can put their minds to.\" The other part though, and this is maybe a trend of Korean shows that I've noticed, is the amount of respect they have in this competition is bar none. You have this guy who is historically famous, was the top champion in judo or something, and you have all these other athletes that are 15, 20 years younger, and they're bowing and just humble to compete against the guy. I kind of wish that more American Joes had that level of respect as opposed to just trying to find the most conflict. There's something that I really like about that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:25):\nThat's beautiful. I've started that show, but I haven't continued it, so I'm going to revisit it.\n\nKevin Yien (01:19:30):\nCool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:30):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nKevin Yien (01:19:34):\nWe got a really old 2002 Jeep to work on with my daughters, just like a true junker. And as a result of that, we're repairing it. We're taking off the rust, replacing parts, and so there's these little magnetic trays that you can hold screws and nails and whatnot, so they don't go flying and rolling around everywhere. It's stupidly useful when you're working on a car. And the girls love it because they can use it for other things like collecting hair clips or whatever else. So magnetic trays, shout out.\n\n(01:20:06):\nAnd then selfishly, I will say my buddy Arjun Mahanti has an app called Circuit. If you search the app store for Circuit, like C-I-R-C-U-I-T, HIIT timer, it's such a delightful little app that lets you track Tabata sex or whatever else to just get a little workout in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:24):\nSuper cool. Magnetic tray is not boring at all. That is extremely cool and it has a really cool story too. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to and find useful to share with friends and family in work or in life?\n\nKevin Yien (01:20:36):\nI think we've actually maybe touched on both of these. I'll cheat and I'll pull one from maybe each parent so that in case they see this, they don't feel like I'm favoring one of them.\n\n(01:20:45):\nSo my mom's side, I think something that she would always repeat to me growing up is everything happens for a reason. I hated that growing up because she only said it when something bad would happen. Something bad happens, she goes, \"Everything happens for a reason,\" and I'm like, \"No, it doesn't. Life just sucks.\" And to no surprise at this point in the conversation, I've now grown to really, really appreciate that piece of advice because what it's actually trying to communicate is, when something happens, good or bad, frankly, don't dwell on it. That's the past. Focus on what you want to do and then just move towards that. And then in most cases, you'll be able to look back in one, five, 10 years and connect the dots in a way where the story makes sense in your mind. And so just having that shift in perspective I think has helped me a lot to not overreact to anything that happens in my life. So that's one side.\n\n(01:21:46):\nAnd then on my dad's side, so the funny origins of this, unsurprising to anyone with Asian parents, I'm a spunky little 7-year-old, I come home with my math test one day. I got 97%. I think that's pretty good. I go show it to my dad with beaming eyes and pride. He sort of stares down his nose at it, looks at me, \"Where's my other 3%?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:08):\nOh, my God.\n\nKevin Yien (01:22:10):\nI'm just distraught and I sulk away. I'm very sad. I study hard. I do the next math test, I get 100% yes. All right, dad's approval, here we come. I come flying back, I put the test in his hands, he stares down his nose at it, looks at me, \"Where's my other 3%?\" I'm so confused. I'm like, \"I got 100 out of 100. I have no clue what you're talking about.\" He just looks me down the eye and goes, \"Who said a hundred is the most you can get?\" At that age, I literally had no clue what he was talking about. And he had to reframe it for me in the moment around like, \"Well, was there extra credit? Can you just write your own problems to challenge yourself more? Could you have given yourself another test? And maybe the teacher won't give you credit, but you give yourself credit for doing additional work.\"\n\n(01:23:01):\nI think I carry that theme forward where there's this weird transition we all go through from childhood to adulthood where we no longer receive homework, we're responsible for defining the work that we do. And when you do that, if all you do is the minimum of what defined the 100% of what your job requires, you'll never grow. And so it's up to you to actually find what is the additional 3%? There's always three more percent. So that's my dad's lesson.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nKevin, you're blowing my mind. There's so many great stories, you're just full of them. And I feel like this lesson also applies really well to product and building product and founding companies.\n\nKevin Yien (01:23:46):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:46):\nJust pushing further than people expect and making it a lot more delightful than the minimum bar.\n\n(01:23:53):\nFinal question, speaking of things that maybe people don't expect and may not understand is possible, looking at you, nobody would've guessed that you're a competitive eater at some point in your life. As a final question, tell us about this part of your life. What did you eat? How does this work? How far did you get in this path?\n\nKevin Yien (01:24:12):\nIt's probably misleading to say that I was a true competitive eater. I wasn't on the circuit with a... I forget his name, but Johnny Chestnut.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):\n[inaudible 01:24:21]. Oh yeah, Chestnut\n\nKevin Yien (01:24:22):\nBack in the day, that's like the OG competitive eater on the hotdog circuit, I guess.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:25):\nRight.\n\nKevin Yien (01:24:26):\nFor me it was more eating challenges. And so whenever I would travel, I would find the local eating challenge, whether it was time-based, volume-based, something else, and just try to see what I could push my body to do. I was blessed with a great metabolism, so I never really had to worry too much about anything else. And the origin, the first moment of this was when I was 14, my sister was going to college in Minnesota and there's this steakhouse up there called Manny's, which is where the Vikings Frontline goes to after every game. And they have this ridiculous 97 ounce order house. I don't know how many pounds that is, but it's too much meat for a human to consume.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:26):\n97 ounce.\n\nKevin Yien (01:25:07):\n97 ounces, yeah. And so I sit down, I order it thinking, \"This is going to be great.\" They put it in front of me, it's a monster. You have to eat in under an hour. And so 45 minutes into it, I'm halfway through and about to die. And the catch is, if you finish it in under an hour, you get it for free. And so my dad again leans in and goes, \"You can't afford not to finish this.\"\n\n(01:25:39):\nAnd so, \"Message received, sir.\" Hunker down. I plowed the other half in 15 minutes. I then slept for I think three days afterwards. But after that I was like, \"Oh my God, if I could do that, what else could I do?\" And so, [inaudible 01:25:54] carried for, I don't know, nearly a decade of trying to do these interesting challenges.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:58):\nWow. I don't know how that's physically possible, but clearly you did it.\n\n(01:26:02):\nKevin, this has been wonderful. I think there's so many lessons here for people in so many ways, life and work and parenting. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to follow you and learn more from you over time? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nKevin Yien (01:26:17):\nI'm on Twitter, just @kevinyien. Technically, I'm on LinkedIn. I don't post over there. I probably should. I hear it's very good. But that's where you can find me. Also, my website. I don't write that often, and I don't have an RSS feed, which has always been on my backlog, and I'm always too lazy to do. But one day I will add it.\n\n(01:26:38):\nOne quick note, I'll actually make on websites. So on one hand, I love all the different website builders that exist. It's amazing what we've enabled anyone to be able to do. There is something really special about having your corner of the internet that you built sort of hand by hand, line by line. And so my website is, it's a GitHub page. It's hosts on GitHub pages, but it's just raw HTML, CSS, nothing fancy. I get so much joy every year just doing a slight tweak or cleaning of it. And so I really do recommend that for anyone with the curiosity and the desire to buy your domain, even if you're never going to write anything on it, you're never going to share it out, just own a little piece of the internet. It feels good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:28):\nI love that. I didn't know that about your website. And I could see it now as I go there. It's .html, which you don't see as much anymore.\n\nKevin Yien (01:27:35):\nExactly. [inaudible 01:27:37].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:36):\nAnd then... Yeah, can listeners be useful to you.\n\nKevin Yien (01:27:39):\nThis is going to sound trite, and it has nothing to do with product necessarily, just be kind. Make for a nicer world, right? Say thank you a little bit more often. Hold the door open a little more often. Wave if you cut someone off in a car. I think there is a temptation and incentive structure to create conflict intention. And in most cases, the world would just benefit from a little bit more kindness.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:06):\nWhat an incredibly beautiful way its ended. Kevin, this was so much fun. I'm so glad we did this. Thank you so much for coming on.\n\nKevin Yien (01:28:13):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:14):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:28:16):\nThank you so much for listening.
