This is the first ever live recording of this podcast and it was so much fun. If you watch this on YouTube, you can see the epic stage that they built specifically for us to recreate my podcast studio. I could not be more thankful to the Config team for making this happen.\n\n(00:28):\nIn my conversation with Dylan, we dig into how he builds and refines his product taste and intuition, how intuition is a hypothesis generator, the future of product management. How Dylan attempts to operationalize keeping Figma simple and to continue simplifying the experience. A bunch of stories from the early days of Figma that I've never heard before. Also, he shares his favorite AI tool called websim, which is wild. And if you wait till the very end, you can see a very young child actor Dylan Field in a clip that I found online that was hilarious.\n\n(01:00):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing future episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Dylan Field.\n\n(01:12):\nDylan, thank you so much for joining me and welcome to the podcast.\n\nDylan Field (01:16):\nThank you, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18):\nHi all.\n\nDylan Field (01:22):\nIs this your first live podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24):\nThis is my first ever live podcast. Also, a big thank you to the Config team who set up this crazy studio. I had no idea this was going to happen. I feel like I'm in my studio here with a thousand people watching us. It's very impressive. I very much dig the background and also the mics that may or may not be wired.\n\nDylan Field (01:40):\nThat's right. Don't say that. Don't tell people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42):\nOh, sorry.\n\nDylan Field (01:44):\nThere's no wires coming out of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:45):\nThere's no one behind the curtain either. Okay, so Dylan, I want to start by just checking in on how you're doing. So Config is about to wrap up. We've been at it for two days now. I know how much lift goes into doing these sorts of things. I imagine you've been thinking about this for a long time now. I'm just curious how you're doing, any surprises, any highlights, any low lights?\n\nDylan Field (02:06):\nThe highlight is the community and just the incredible, incredible people here at Config. Y'all are awesome. I don't know why I keep talking in the mic like this. It's instinctual. But seriously, it's just the most amazing community to be part of and I feel so lucky. And then in terms of how I'm doing at this exact moment, exhausted, but riding on caffeine and whatever this really cool probiotic drink is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (02:36):\nAny surprises from the past couple of days? Anything that's like, \"Oh wow, that went a lot better than I thought, maybe less well.\"\n\nDylan Field (02:44):\nDemo, definitely things I would've improved. But also Emil and Mihika were phenomenal, and it was just so awesome to see them do their demos and present materials. I was just really pleased with the conversation, I think, that's getting started at Config around AI. I was looking online on social media and I think people are already zeroing in the right conversation, which is, okay, in a world of more software being created by AI, what does that mean and the impact on craft and the impact on quality and the need to have more unique design and how design is a differentiator.\n\n(03:37):\nAnd I think some people are saying, \"I agree with that.\" Some people are saying, \"That I disagree with that\", and that's exactly the bounds of what the conversation I imagined would emerge from yesterday. It was funny, the make design feature, I think that I said on the keynote, I was like, \"This is going to give you the most obvious thing in the most obvious form possible.\" And then people online are like, \"It's just going to give you some obvious thing.\" I agree.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (04:10):\nThis episode is brought to you by WorkOS. If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and skim provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know like Versal, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube. This enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on, skim or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com.\n\n(05:28):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their Document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams and the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch. It's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations or you can use an all-in-one Document SDK.\n\n(06:03):\nMost product managers will tell you paperwork sucks. Anvil's Document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features. For your users, paperwork often starts with an AI powered Webform styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's Drag and Drop builder and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil.

You once said that the definition of design is art applied to problem solving. Can you just add a bit more to that? What do you mean by that? Because that's an amazing line.\n\nDylan Field (07:09):\nWell, I don't think it's my original line. I think someone else said it, but there's a lot of definitions of design out there too. There's also 'design is dialogue' or 'design is problem solving'. You just go straight there. I could go with 10 more. But I like art applied to problem solving because I think that design is often... There is some component of creativity to it and unique expression that you're trying to provide and create and put out into the world. But you are also trying to do it and match it to a user need, a problem that needs to be solved. And I think that it's not pure art, but if you lose the art and you're just solving the problem, it's totally utilitarian and it lacks soul. And so the combination of those two things is to me really beautiful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (08:03):\nI'm going to pivot to a very hard hitting question. I hope your PR people don't kill me for asking this. Many people asked me to ask you this question. Very important. Please explain a Figma tradition called raccoon feet and muffin hands.\n\nDylan Field (08:21):\nI should probably just leave this interview now. So this is a conversation, I'm not sure exactly where it started, but it started in early Figma. And basically we had these lunch tables at Figma where we would just all gather and have very long, interesting meandering conversations before we got back to work. And one of the questions that, was a 'would you rather', was would you rather have raccoons for feet or muffins for hands? And I think this is a deeply philosophical question. I have pondered it since I've heard it. I still don't have one answer. If you've got an answer, I'm curious what it is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:02):\nI've got follow up questions. Can you control where the raccoon take you or are they just deciding on their own what's happening?\n\nDylan Field (09:09):\nI think that raccoons probably wouldn't even agree with each other where to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:14):\nOkay, that's complicated.\n\nDylan Field (09:16):\nIf you had raccoons for feet right now, do you think that it would interfere with this podcast?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:21):\nBut muffin hands would also interfere with my newsletter and I feel like I'd be out of work.\n\nDylan Field (09:25):\nI don't know if you can type.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:26):\nI'd need a special keyboard. This is very difficult.\n\nDylan Field (09:29):\nYou haven't even thought about the upsides of this yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:33):\nWhat are the upsides?\n\nDylan Field (09:34):\nWe can get there, it's all-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:36):\nMaybe I could eat some of the muffins.\n\nDylan Field (09:36):\nIt's the case for optimism.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:37):\nCupcakes?\n\nDylan Field (09:38):\nIf you have muffins for hands, maybe if you're hungry...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:41):\nDo they regenerate as you you eat them?\n\nDylan Field (09:43):\nThat's a good question. There's no answers here, just questions. Do your nails grow?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:49):\nYes.\n\nDylan Field (09:50):\nOh, okay. Interesting. It's deeper than you might think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (09:58):\nI'm going to play a short clip with Rick Rubin and then I have a question about it. So we'll see if that plays.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:06):\nBut exactly what he does and how is difficult to describe. Do you play instruments?\n\nRick Rubin (10:12):\nBarely.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:13):\nDo you know how to work a soundboard?\n\nRick Rubin (10:15):\nNo. I have no technical ability and I know nothing about music.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:21):\nThen you must know something.\n\nRick Rubin (10:22):\nWell, I know what I like and what I don't like. And I'm decisive about what I like and what I don't like.\n\nSpeaker 3 (10:29):\nSo what are you being paid for?\n\nRick Rubin (10:31):\nThe confidence that I have in my taste and my ability to express what I feel has proven helpful for artists.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (10:45):\nSo I'm not going to say this is you. You need to grow the beard. But I think this is a little bit you because what I've heard from a number of your colleagues is that one of your superpowers is intuition and product taste. And someone said that you have the sixth sense for what's going to work, when you're designing Figma and you're making decisions in the product. So I'm curious how you've built and refined your intuition and product taste when it comes to Figma and then even broadly.\n\nDylan Field (11:13):\nThat's a lot kinder than I thought you were going to be. I thought you're going to be like, \"You don't know how to code and you don't know how to design.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:17):\nNo.\n\nDylan Field (11:19):\nBut no, here's my framework for it. I think intuition is like a hypothesis generator and you're constantly generating these hypotheses and others are generating hypotheses as well. And you then take these hypotheses and you put them forward and you debate them and you try to find data to support them or negate them. And then you winnow it down into what is our working hypothesis? And from that you move forward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (11:48):\nI heard that you read every tweet that mentions Figma and share them with folks. There's a Slack channel where you paste them. I imagine that is a part of this where you're just constantly watching what people are saying about Figma, what people are complaining about.\n\nDylan Field (12:00):\nI definitely look everywhere trying to constantly ingest information about Figma, and it's not just Twitter/X, whatever that's called now, but anywhere on the internet, support channels, et cetera. And I'm always trying to understand. I also ask a lot of questions and I try to get to root problems and understand where people are coming from and what are they actually trying to solve. Sometimes people are saying, \"Hey, I need X\", but they really want Y or Z. And trying to do that myself and engage and dive deeper there, but also to encourage our team to do that, I think leads to really good outcomes in terms of what we ship.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (12:51):\nIs there something you've changed your mind about, building on that, either based on customer feedback or some employee just making a case and like, \"Okay, you're right.\" Is there something that comes to mind of something you've changed your mind about recently? Somebody said Flides.\n\nDylan Field (13:09):\nFor when we started out Flides. I have not. It's Figma Slides. Well, it's not recent, but one good example of me changing my mind is that you all have Pages in Figma, you're welcome. But I think I have deep skepticism of Pages still. I'm not sure they're... If you could freeze time and I could just go in with my team, work on Figma for a very long time, I'm not sure we'd come to the same implementation of Pages that we are at today. I just don't think it's the most elegant solution in the context of the entire system of product design that you could create. The world told me and our team that that did not matter and they needed Pages. And don't worry, we're not shipping Pages. But I am still very skeptical of them and I think that in general, probably my team would tell you that I don't always change my mind, but I also build trust with people in deep ways.\n\n(14:22):\nAnd I think across our organization, if things are not going to be fatal, then if I hear from someone, \"Hey, I really think we should do X\", then I'll say, \"Okay, just go with it. And here's my feedback, here's what I'm skeptical of, let's see what happens.\" And then sometimes they come back to me and they're like, \"See I was right.\" But usually they're pretty polite about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (14:49):\nJust to build on that, something a lot of people try to work on is being good at influencing leadership execs, CEOs. What do you find works to change your mind? What do people come to you with that helps you like, \"Okay, you're actually right?\"\n\nDylan Field (15:05):\nI think the more concrete an artifact is or the more you can debate something, the better. I ask for examples a lot, I try to ask follow up questions about things and make sure I fully understand it. And I think where I get stuck sometimes is if I ask follow up questions and we don't have answers yet, and then my response might be, \"Let's go find the answer to these questions and then let's go back to this conversation\", if I think it's something that's really important. And I think for some people they might go, \"Okay, this is actually really obvious. I can't believe you're so dense and you don't get it yet.\" And sometimes they're right and they come back and they're like, \"Okay, here's the data now, can we move on?\" And we do, we move on and they're right. And I just think that it's important though to just really understand something from first principles for a lot of decisions. And maybe it's just a perfectionist quality repeated over time, I think it leads to good outcomes as long as you make sure it's not bottle-necking the organization.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:15):\nSo following up on that, let's talk about product management. So last year you had Brian Chesky here, I think maybe on this stage, maybe a bigger stage. And he said that they got rid of product management at Airbnb and everyone cheered and all the PMs were very sad. And he didn't actually mean they got rid of product management, they changed the function and evolved it. I'm curious just to get your take.\n\nDylan Field (16:38):\nIt's funny. This year we have you here Lenny, so that's your answer. No...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:43):\nI had him on the-\n\nDylan Field (16:45):\nBefore and after, all. Surprise.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (16:45):\nWe're still here. We're still here. I want to get your take on product management. You all have amazing product managers at Figma. I've had three of them on the podcast already. I'm curious just what value you find the best product managers bring to Figma?\n\nDylan Field (17:00):\nIt was really funny last year after that interview, so Yuhki, our chief product officer, had invited me to a dinner for our PM team. And it took a while to get out of Config at the end of the day, and I eventually made the dinner but I was 40 minutes late. And I walk in and Mihika who was on stage yesterday, presenting Figma Slides, Flides, she was standing up and doing a mock Brian Chesky impersonation. And she's standing up in front of the entire product team and she goes, \"And then Brian Chesky's like, 'There don't need to be any PMs.' And Dylan's like... Ooh.\" And I'm like, \"Hi, Mihika.\" And I'd never seen her so red. And then I gave a quick, \"Hey PM team, I believe in you. Thank you for your hard work.\"\n\n(18:08):\nSeriously, I think that if you zoom out, it's always tricky whenever you're asked to formally define, what is the separation between a product manager, a designer, and an engineer? It's always hard to actually create those clear lines. And I think in many organizations they're blurry. But at the end of the day, a PM and designer, they need to have some technical expertise or at least understand how some systems work to probably create the best things they can possibly make. A designer, engineer, they should probably have some sense of the business objectives. They should have some sense of what users want. An engineer and a product manager, they should have taste and craft and some sense of the option space, and some desire to care about the visual implementation.\n\n(19:08):\nAnd I think you can include research in there too, if you want to make it four legs of the stool rather than the trio. And you can talk about all three probably should have exposure to users and be talking in dialogue with users. So I think that if you think about that group holistically, each is important. If you think about a team, there's all these qualities that you have to have to make a great product. And that said, I think for product managers and the product function... I think sometimes when you see people that fall down in that function is because they treat it too much like process. Which is very important too, don't me wrong. Good process can help support good outcomes. But I think that you can't lose sight of the problems that you're solving. You have to go talk to users and you have to actually have a strategy. And if you're really good, you should have a point of view. And some point of views are going to lead to good outcomes and some point of views aren't. And there's some tense sense of taste.\n\n(20:16):\nAnd you also have to bring everyone together and make sure that they get to the objective, that it's celebrated, and that at the end of the project or when you complete a milestone, everyone's stoked. Otherwise, it's not going to be a team that gels, you're not going to get to the next outcome. Even if you get to an outcome and it's a milestone, but if everyone's unhappy, you failed. And so somehow good product people are able to do all this and they're able to create great frameworks that bring everyone along with them. And so everyone's able to have a shared head space around what it is they're trying to get to.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (20:54):\nSomeone once said that if PMs disappeared or if a PM goes on vacation, everything's okay for a week or two or three and then things start to crumble a little bit because they glue everything together. Do you find that sort of thing? Let me actually ask a different question along those lines, are you bearish or bullish on the future of product management? Do you think PMs will continue the way they are? Do you think PMs will dwindle any sense of the future of product management?\n\nDylan Field (21:23):\nI think probably everyone's learning to do a bit more of everyone else's job in this current moment. That said, I definitely think there's still immense value in product, immense value in design, immense value in engineering. And so I think those roles will continue to exist.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (21:43):\nSo maybe I just want to come back to the question of just, with the best PMs that you work with, do you find, what value do they most bring? I guess is there anything that's like, \"Here's what would be gone if we didn't have these PMs\"?\n\nDylan Field (21:57):\nThe best PMs, I think again, create those frameworks that bring everyone else along and those frameworks also have a point of view and a strategy associated with them. So you're able to take the strategy, take the point of view, wrap it all up in a framework, and then make it so that everyone knows what the destination is and how to get there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (22:20):\nSo along these lines, something I've heard you're really big on is simplification. Somebody told me that when you're in a designer view and things just feel too complex to you, quote, \"You furrow your brow and insist there must be something simpler.\" Why is simplification so top of mind for you, why is it so important for you and just why is it so hard to do?\n\nDylan Field (22:41):\nOh, gosh. Well, I think probably anyone here who's worked on product knows how hard it is. I think the more that you add, the harder it is to create something that's coherent. One essay that Evan, my co-founder, introduced me to early on in famous history, I think from Stevie's [inaudible 00:23:06] grants or something like that, contains the term irreducible complexity. And it's basically this idea that one plus one does not equal three, it sometimes equals one and a half. And the more that you add and the more that you continue to put in something, the more complex it gets and the worse it gets. And I think this is definitely true for tools.\n\n(23:28):\nSo in the context of Figma, we can make it more powerful, but to do that in a way that's not making it more complex at the same time is extremely hard. And we have to always be paying attention to how complex or how simple things are because if we don't, it just becomes a monstrosity really fast. And there's parts of our product that, I don't want to dive into that part of the conversation, the self-critique, but definitely as I'm in conversation with a bunch of our product leaders at Figma, there's parts where it's like, \"Okay, this thing is too complex as a system and we made all the right local decisions and yet together they're too complex and they're not working anymore. And let's go revisit the system now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (24:14):\nThis episode is brought to you by UserTesting. Transform how you build products and experiences with UserTesting.

Is there anything that's been bugging you in the old Figma but like, \"Oh, this is way too complicated, I really want to simplify this thing\"?\n\nDylan Field (25:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:11):\nWhat's that?\n\nDylan Field (25:12):\nWe'll move on, but many things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (25:18):\nSounds good. And in terms of how to keep things simple, so I had Dharmesh Shah on the podcast, he's the co-founder of HubSpot, and the way he described it is that you're always fighting the second loft through more dynamics of entropy, just the product getting more complicated. And he sees himself as part of the solution, of top down, you have to be on top of that. Is that the way you see it? That's your role, to keep things simple. Do you think people further down the ladder can do that?\n\nDylan Field (25:46):\nAbsolutely, everyone's responsible for simplicity. And I think another quote that is not mine but is a really a good one is \"Keep the simple things simple. Make the complex things possible.\" And I think that's a really important principle to hold as you're designing tools. And I'd say that it's really easy to make the simple things complex, unfortunately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:10):\nI want to pivot to talking about early days Figma. So I don't know how many people know this, but it took three and a half years to launch Figma from when you were beginning to work on it.\n\nDylan Field (26:19):\nWay too long, don't do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:22):\nThis is my question. So it took three and a half years to launch and then five years to get your first customer. Dylan, what the hell were you doing all that time?\n\nDylan Field (26:28):\nI don't think it took five years for a first... Well okay-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (26:32):\nPaying.\n\nDylan Field (26:33):\nFirst paying customer, sure. Okay, fine. Slightly less but approximately five years, it gets to be round up. I think that if I had been probably better at hiring and recruiting... I see Nadia in the audience, making eye contact with her the entire time, for some reason. She's our chief people officer. If she had been at Figma from day one, we would've hired probably faster and we would've gotten to market faster. But I think that it was a hard product to build and to get everything to come together with. I also see Sho. And I think for... Sho's joined us as a director of engineering. He's a VP of product now. Again, people can wear many hats. And he was someone that joined Figma and said, \"Hey, y'all need to ship this thing, you're really close.\" And he really helped catalyze us to ship in that moment. And I think, in week one, he gave a presentation. It was like, \"Here's what we got to do, here's the gap. Everyone agrees on it. Let's go.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (27:45):\nYou already said that you wish you shipped earlier. Is there any advice there for just people building something today of-\n\nDylan Field (27:49):\nGet it out as fast as you possibly can. Everything they tell you about making sure that you get a product out really quickly is totally true. The faster you get it out, the more feedback you get. That is a positive thing. And now I index on that when we try to build. And FigJam's a great example of that, we shipped it incredibly fast and it helped us get to market and get feedback faster. Figma Slides, great example of that too. Dev Mode, for what it's worth, it took us longer. We just had to keep iterating and building it and building it again. Certain directions we tried didn't work out and we really had to get to a place where we were able to really believe that we were adding value and really understood the developer's user, and it just didn't happen for a long time. So it's interesting because I think people look at Dev Mode and sometimes they go, \"Oh, this is quite simple\", to the point about simplicity.\n\n(28:53):\nFigma, is this simpler than FigJam? And the reality was it took at least three times as long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:04):\nSo your advice is ship quickly. There's also this push the-\n\nDylan Field (29:09):\nI'd hold the bar, for sure.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (29:11):\nThat's the question I have, is there's also a lot of talk of just the bar has risen. You need, especially B2B software, craft is really important. Linear talks a lot about this, just the bar is very high for people to switch from something out there. Is there anything... I don't think you'll have, \"Here's the answer. When you're ready to ship...\", but just any advice of just like, \"Here's good enough\" versus \"No, you should probably wait.\"\n\nDylan Field (29:32):\nWell, another thing that Evan taught me was that for a new launch, you got quality, features, deadline, choose two. And I think that the beautiful thing about software is you can keep iterating on it. So it's not like a physical product where you have to always have quality in there, otherwise it's never going to have quality. You can ship it with features and deadline and then improve it iteratively over time. I'm not saying you should always do that. Sometimes you need to at least have a minimum bar of quality for the things you have and you're going to ship less features maybe.\n\n(30:04):\nSo you choose quality and deadline and sometimes you say, \"Actually here's the minimum feature set and we're going to have this quality bar and you're willing to push it out.\" But I think you have to know when you're introducing a new thing, what it's going to take and then to make that minimally awesome product. But also I think that when you're iteratively improving it, you shouldn't just be focused on the features, you have to focus on the quality too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (30:33):\nI like this term you use, 'minimally awesome product'. Love it. So the way you got your early users for Figma is quite fascinating. I don't know how many people know this story, but you basically wrote a script to scrape Twitter and create a graph of the most influential designers on Twitter, and then you made it your mission to convince them to use Figma and make them evangelists. Is there anything more to the story there? And then I have a question along those lines.\n\nDylan Field (31:01):\nYou can't do this anymore, first of all, because the Twitter API doesn't exist anymore. Rest in peace, Twitter API. But look, I was an intern at LinkedIn and when I was there I saw some really cool work people had done with Gephi, which was a network visualization tool. And based on that I thought it'd be interesting to try to, like you said, look at who the design network was, who the central nodes were, which you can just run [inaudible 00:31:31] on and see. And you could do that for other communities too, which I have done in the past just because I'm curious about social network dynamics and social network analysis.\n\n(31:42):\nAnd you could just do those things back in 2012, 2013 when Figma started. So I constructed this list of, \"Here are the most central designers in the graph\", but also then I looked at their work. And the ones that I was really inspired by as a total fanboy, and someone who wanted to learn as much as I could about design, was inspired by these folks, the ones I was inspired by I reached out to and said, \"Hey, can I buy you a coffee?\" And most of them are really kind. The design community is amazing. And they said yes and then from there was able to learn from them, show them Figma, get their feedback. And I think it started honestly more as me fanboy and me getting feedback.\n\n(32:29):\nOne example is Tim Van Damme. I saw him on Dribble. Max [inaudible 00:32:35], I'm like, \"Oh, my God, this guy is just genius. These icons are incredible.\" I think the first time I met Tim was at Dropbox and think I had this total fanboy moment. I'm like, \"I've been tracing your icons.\" He's like, \"Hi.\"\n\n(32:54):\nAnd I had been working on vector networks with a team, and my test cases were a lot of his icons. Because they were just beautiful and I liked looking at them and studying them. And to now have Tim on the team and have him doing the icons for UI 3 is such an honor, and privileged to work with someone of that craft. So reaching out to your hero sometimes works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (33:24):\nIt's interesting because when people hear that story, when I've heard that story many times, it was always like, \"Here's a growth hack. Find the most influential people in your field, go try to convince them to use your product.\" And the way you're describing it is you were using it more as feedback. \"I just want to show you the product, get your feedback, make this better\", and then it ended up working. They're like, \"Oh, I love Figma, I'm going to use it.\"\n\nDylan Field (33:43):\nWell, I think it especially works for designers that way, because designers are really good at giving feedback. It turns out that not everyone is good at giving feedback, but designers are awesome at that. So we're really lucky. And literally early on in Figma's existence, folks... I think Payam [inaudible 00:34:00] is here somewhere. I'm not sure if he's in this room, but I was hoping to see him before the end of Config. Payam wrote a very long doc for us about all the things that he wanted to see in Figma after we did a user research study with him. With a bottle of wine because our text editing didn't work very well then. So I ran him through the user study, I knew we'd need a bottle of wine to finish and it took hours. The type of sentence in Figma was so slow.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:27):\nThat reminds me of a story I've heard where... One of your first customers was Coda, sponsor I think of Config. It used to be called Krypton. And there's a story where you installed Figma, you helped them get set up, you drove home and then they called you like, \"Hey, Figma is not working anymore.\" And you drove back yourself to help fix them and it ended up their wifi was down or there was a wifi issue. Is that the story?\n\nDylan Field (34:53):\nI don't remember what the solution was, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (34:54):\nThat's what I heard.\n\nDylan Field (34:56):\n... we were halfway home and somehow I saw... I'm sure I was not looking at my email while driving, definitely is not something anyone here should do. But somehow found out that they had an issue and we turned the car around. Shishir is amazing by the way, and has been a mentor for a long time to me and many people on our team. And he, I think, at the time did not know he was the first customer.\n\n(35:27):\nAnd later on he came over to Figma's office and I introduced him without really thinking about that. And I was like, \"This is Shishir, he's team was really the first user of Figma as a team.\" And he goes, \"Wait a second, I am?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (35:48):\nI want to talk about something totally different. Something I've noticed you are good at is you spot trends ahead of other people. So obviously WebGL you were on early and that's what allowed Figma to exist, to link it in the browser. I saw you tweeting about CryptoPunks way before they were worth millions of dollars. You're just like, \"Look, CryptoPunks. Look, I got a few, they're really cool. They're super cool, little pipe.\" I'm curious if there's anything these days you're really excited about that might become bigger in the future?\n\nDylan Field (36:15):\nWell, we talked about websim. We were just talking about them backstage and I think before this conversation too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:23):\nTalk about websim.\n\nDylan Field (36:24):\nAnd that's an example of something where it's so interesting because there's a generative UI component and yet it's not what we're going for, for Figma, it's totally different. So we actually invested in websim with Figma Ventures.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (36:39):\nMaybe explain what websim is for folks.\n\nDylan Field (36:41):\nWebsim is a hallucinated internet basically. If you go to websim.ai, you can use different models like Claude or GPT-4o, and you can do that either through their defaults or you can use open router to get a bigger context window. And the more that you use it, the more you construct this context window of this almost universe that you're building up in websim. And as you do it, it's almost like you're world building. And I just have gone deep and geeked out on this when I've had time, and they've evolved the platform a lot.\n\n(37:21):\nSo we were back there and they were showing me some new functionality that's really cool too. But I think it's so interesting to see it as this almost lean forward entertainment tool using the internet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (37:36):\nSo I thought you would answer this and so we're going to have a picture come up here, that I tried websim and played around with it. And hopefully a photo comes up somewhere. So all I typed here was gmail.com/dylanfield. So this is in an invented Gmail. Just came up with this using AI of what your inbox should look like and it looks pretty accurate. There's Adobe stuff-\n\nDylan Field (38:00):\nDOJ, not FTC.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:02):\n... financial. This is not actual information. Nobody buy stock based on this. So it's pretty-\n\nDylan Field (38:09):\nNo comment on 75% year over year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:13):\nSo the way it work-\n\nDylan Field (38:14):\nI hadn't ever tried Gmail before. Did you try you? What was your inbox?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:18):\nI didn't do me. I don't think it would have anything. It'd be like, if it does-\n\nDylan Field (38:21):\nWho are you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:22):\nSo the way it works is just you type a URL or a prompt in the URL field and it'll just invent what that website looks like. It's hilarious.\n\nDylan Field (38:29):\nIt's awesome.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (38:30):\nIt's awesome. So I think they're going to get a lot of traffic right now.\n\nDylan Field (38:32):\nOne time someone posted in our random channel on Slack, they said, \"I had a dream last night.\" It's always a good start for the random channel. \"I had a dream last night that I was working on FigJam, but it wasn't FigJam, it was Frog Jam.\n\n(38:52):\nAnd websim was like figma.com/frogjam and it came up with a whole marketing website complete with toad puns for Frog Jam. The sticky notes were lily pads and you were supposed to... It had this whole metaphor of hopping from lily pad to lily pad to generate new ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (39:17):\nThis is genius. Interestingly, before Figma, your only other job was an intern at three different companies and now you're leading this juggernaut of a business, a thousand plus people. I imagine there's a lot you've had to learn over this time. So I'm not going to ask you what you've learned because I think it's probably a lot. I'm curious just what has most helped you scale and learn? Is it exec coaches, is it co friends? Is it hiring execs? What's most helped you scale with the business and become the leader you are today?\n\nDylan Field (39:51):\nI think all the above. And also just having a mindset of, you have to constantly adapt and grow and change and adapt. But I would say that mentors can come from anywhere. It can come from the community, all of you. Mentorship can come from the people you hire. It can come from folks that you actively seek out as investors or explicit mentorship and mentors. It can come from people that call themselves coaches. And what's interesting too is it can come from people you mentor as well. There have been plenty of people where they ask me a question at some point and I give them an answer and they think it's insightful for whatever reason. And then years later where we're talking again and I ask them a question and they're like, \"Well, years ago you told me...\" And they repeat back what I told them like, \"That's a really good point.\"\n\n(40:45):\nOr they've grown and they've changed and they've learned and they tell me something completely different. They give me a new framework. And so I think that when you're... A lot of times when I talk with new founders, they teach me things that are totally things that I've just never thought about. Or interns at Figma have been mentors to me, in many ways. So you really have to have a ready mindset and just always be ready to absorb new information, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (41:09):\nWhen you were just tinkering around with Figma 12 years ago, I think at this point, did you ever imagine you'd be running a thousand person company and audience just spell bound by what you're building? There's people lining up to take photos with your logo in the lobby. That doesn't happen. That's very rare. Just to give you a chance to reflect on just how it feels to have built that over time, how does that feel? I'm sitting here right now.\n\nDylan Field (41:32):\nI feel very, very lucky, but also very humbled by just the community that is around Figma. I mentioned in the keynote, but just the people that are in the Figma community are the people that are shaping the world's technology. And the chance to serve them and to make software for them and hopefully improve their life in some little way is such a privilege. It's a responsibility and one I don't take lightly, but also I try not to carry that as a weight, but rather as pump me up and get me excited to go build for them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (42:10):\nWhen we were talking about this idea earlier... The first thing you said is it's a responsibility, which I didn't expect. Is there anything more there just like, \"Wow, I really have to help make...\"?\n\nDylan Field (42:19):\nWell, again, going back to the simplification point, it's very important that we continue to make Figma more and more simple. We make Figma as powerful as we can for the people that are in our community. That we figure out what people's needs truly are and that we advance the state of the craft, make it so that we do that in a responsible way. And that we champion design and champion quality. So we're trying to do all those things. We sometimes mess up, but people have been very patient with us and we're very thankful for that. And thankful for the support of just everyone here and in our community that are giving us a chance to make this impact.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:06):\nIs there anything else you want to... Oh, there's some applause. Love that.\n\nDylan Field (43:11):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:15):\nApplause break. Is there anything else you want to share? Anything else you want to leave listeners with before we get to a very quick lightning round?\n\nDylan Field (43:24):\nWell, no, one thing I'll share is I think we're so early on this journey of computing in general. And in our lifetimes, we're going to have the chance to just build such incredible technology and incredible products. And I'm really excited to see what everyone in this room builds, but also everyone on the internet that [inaudible 00:43:48] maybe also builds and send me cool stuff. If you build something cool, message me somewhere and share it with me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:56):\nWhat's the best way to message you?\n\nDylan Field (43:59):\nEmail's good. You can probably figure out my email if you-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (43:59):\nJust use websim.\n\nDylan Field (44:03):\n... [inaudible 00:44:03] for five seconds or use websim. Twitter/X is good. Those are two places at least you can find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:12):\nDylan, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. We only have a couple of minutes left. It's a very short one. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really love other than websim?\n\nDylan Field (44:28):\nWell, I'll say that, and it's not like a favorite product, but I will say that if you get... Hesitate if I should say this or not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (44:45):\nWe'll cut it out in post, don't worry about it.\n\nDylan Field (44:52):\nI'll say this, it's so fascinating to look at all the different LMs out there right now and what each one is uniquely good at. And it's really fun if you can hack them the right way and get them in the right mood, what they'll do. That's what I'll say.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:07):\nWhoa, what does that mean?\n\nDylan Field (45:11):\nIt's my diplomatic answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:13):\nInteresting. Do you have a favorite life motto that you come back to, repeat to yourself, share with friends or family, that you find really useful?\n\nDylan Field (45:22):\nI don't know if I've got a life motto, but one piece of advice I've always appreciated is when people give you advice, they're not giving you advice, they're giving themselves advice in your shoes. I think that's an interesting one. So if I gave you advice here, I'm giving myself advice in your shoes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (45:41):\nFinal question. Not many people know this, but you were a child actor when you were five years old. Do you think you made the right career move? Do you feel like you sometimes regret acting?\n\nDylan Field (45:54):\nYes, definitely. That's my mom. My mom's in the audience and she says yes. No. We've been talking about product. If you're an actor, you're a product in some way. And that's not to disparage actors, actors are awesome. Acting is awesome. I loved it. But my differentiators when I was five, five and a half I think, was that I could read and I could sit still and I was decently cute. And I hit puberty and those things were no longer differentiators. And then it was like, let's do some computer science.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (46:38):\nSo to close, we're going to play a... Oh, applause. We're going to play a clip, something I found on YouTube to close and enjoy. 30 seconds clip.\n\nSpeaker 5 (47:09):\nWhere will you find a world of ideas for your child? Only at eToys. From Barbie to Brio to SwimWays. eToys, where great ideas come to you.\n\nDylan Field (47:22):\nThat was a good find. Thank you.\n\nSpeaker 5 (47:27):\nDylan, thank you so much for doing this.\n\nDylan Field (47:28):\nThank you. Can I make one comment about that commercial?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:31):\nOkay, one comment.\n\nDylan Field (47:32):\nOne comment before we end. That commercial made that company go bankrupt. Thank you all for joining. Thank you for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (47:40):\nGood luck. Thanks Dylan. Bye everyone.\n\n(47:44):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Crafting a compelling product vision | Ebi Atawodi (YouTube, Netflix, Uber)\n\n## Transcript\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:00:00):\nI do not believe in being liked. I believe in being loved, right? And that's a very, very different thing. When I said this once in a meeting, people were like... Yes, right? But it took me a while in reading a lot of books to come to a definition of love and love is the choice to extend yourself for the spiritual growth of oneself or another, right? It's very big, lofty and whatever, but you're literally extending yourself for somebody else or yourself, self-love, right? And that's love. And when you are extending yourself, you're not nice. It's not always nice or like, it sometimes is having hard conversations. It's knowing that, oh, there's a human, they know I care about them. So when the feedback is coming like raw, they know that it's in their best interest because I've shown enough times that I genuinely care about the person behind the role.\n\nLenny (00:01:00):\nToday my guest is Ebi Atawodi. AB is director of product management at YouTube overseeing the creator experience. Previously, she was director of product management at Netflix and head of product for Uber Wallet, checkout, pay, and financial Products at Uber. Ebi shares the most tactical advice I've ever heard on how to develop a vision for your product, along with a bunch of very concrete ways to communicate your vision to your teammates and to executives. We also dig into the craft of product management and how to get better at it. Along with what Ebi's learned about creating a strong product culture on your team and across the company. Ebi is such a wonderful human and clearly an amazing product leader, and I'm excited for you to get to learn from her. With that, I bring you Ebi Atawodi after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:48):\nThis episode is brought to you by sidebar. Are you looking to land your next big career move or start your own thing? One of the most effective ways to create a big leap in your career and something that worked really well for me a few years ago is to create a personal board of directors, a trusted peer group where you can discuss challenges you're having, get career advice, and just kind of gut check how you're thinking about your work, your career, and your life. This has been a big trajectory changer for me, but it's hard to build this trusted group. With sidebar, senior leaders are matched with highly vetted, private, supportive peer groups to lean on for unbiased opinions, diverse perspectives, and raw feedback. Everyone has their own zone of genius, so together we're better prepared to navigate professional pitfalls leading to more responsibility, faster promotions, and bigger impact. Guided by world-class programming and facilitation Sidebar enables you to get focused tactical feedback at every step of your journey. If you're a listener of this podcast, you're likely already driven and committed to growth. A Sidebar personal board of directors is the missing piece to catalyze that journey. Why spend a decade finding your people when you can meet them at Sidebar today, jump the growing wait list of thousands of leaders from top tech companies by visiting sidebar.com/lenny to learn more. That's sidebar.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:09):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason, but sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning in spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:04:35):\nThank you for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nIt's my pleasure. First, I just want to give a big thank you to Andre Albuquerque, who is the founder of One Month PM, who actually posted on LinkedIn about how much of a fan of yours he is and that I need to have you on this podcast. And so here we are. I want to start by talking about vision. Every product manager I've ever worked with and managed vision has always been this development area for every single one. It's always this like, \"You need to get better at crafting a vision, telling your story.\" It's also this very powerful tool. The product managers have to align teams to be more successful in the products they're building. And you have a really neat way of thinking about a framework for developing a vision and then telling the story. What are elements of a good vision for a product or even a company?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:05:22):\nI think the first piece is that you absolutely need to have one, to start by saying that. Regardless of what level you are in the company. So people say, \"Oh, I'm just a junior PM.\" Whatever level, there is some micro macro vision that you need to have. Because essentially if you got on a plane and the pilot was like, \"I don't really know where we're going, but I'm a really good pilot. The company needs to fly 400 flights this year. So I'm trying to make that happen, but trust me, we'll get there. There might be turbulence, I'm not sure.\" You probably would be thinking twice about staying on that flight, right? What happens is you get on there, it's like, \"Our destination is Miami.\" Maybe I'm dreaming of beaches, \"And it's going to be 24 degrees when we get there.\" And he always paints or she paints this image of the destination.\n\n(00:06:13):\nAnd that's the vision not to be confused with the mission, which is we want to fly people where they're going safe. That's not... It's like a picture. So that's the start. I want to just delineate between vision and everything else that people think vision is. So really I think there are a couple of key elements. The first one is it needs to be lofty. So it needs to be something that feels... It almost scares you in an exciting way, right? Like, oh, my God, this is something I can get up every morning. And if we did that, goddamn. But at the same time, it needs to be realistic and attainable, so it cannot feel so pie in the sky that it feels so out of reach, right? And of course, there are leaders and people who have really, really big visions and they see beyond the rest of us, but that's not most people. Most people, it needs to feel within reach.\n\n(00:07:05):\nAnd then I think the key thing is it needs to kind of be in a vacuum from the limitations of today because the whole point of going to the future and saying, [inaudible 00:07:15] time traveled five years out is to say, \"Okay, I've come back to tell you what we need to fix in order to get there. Or I've come back to tell you what we need to put in place now so that we will get there, right?\" And so you have this kind of three components and if those come together and they are grounded of course, in a problem that people are excited about, you've got your vision. And how that vision manifests really depends on what you want to do. There're simple ones you can do, they're big ones you can do. But those are the core pieces in my mind.\n\nLenny (00:07:46):\nCan you just summarize them again and are some examples you can share if here's a really good vision that it hits on these, and then if you have another example of a bad vision, that would be really helpful?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:07:57):\nSo four things. So it has to be lofty, it has to be realistic, it has to be devoid of any tech or limitations of today, and it has to be grounded in a very clear and potent problem. User problem.\n\nLenny (00:08:16):\nAwesome. And then, yeah, are there any examples either from places you've worked or visions?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:08:20):\nAbsolutely. What I particularly love, so a lot of my product thinking and my product chops and craft, I really owe to Uber. So when I think about things, there's something really magical there. And one of our values at the time was making magic. So I met the word magic all the time, but so mission, push a button, get a ride, transportation as reliable as running water. I used to be in Nigeria, that tagline did not scale because water was not that reliable in Nigeria. So they went for a slightly more inclusive version, which is reliable transport, sanitation everywhere and for everyone, right? So that's the mission. That doesn't really tell me what the image looks like when I get there, but that's like when I wake up every day, I'm like, \"Why do I work in this company?\" It's that make transportation reliable everywhere for everyone.\n\n(00:09:12):\nAnd I'll talk maybe later about how that came to... We were able to use that to actually challenge the then CEO Travis Kalanick. The vision was a world where you get to this continuous trip so that you do not need parking. Because cities, 25% of the average city is parking spaces. You're in San Francisco, you'll see buildings, just floors just for parking, right? You'll have basements just for parking. In a world where we have housing problems, we have ridiculous prices for rents. Just imagine if you could free up all of those spaces for all kinds of things, right? Homes, restaurants, you name it. Parties, warehouse parties especially, they have the best. That was the vision. You could kind of see it, right? You're like, \"Oh, I could see a world.\" I mean, I live in Amsterdam, I have a bicycle, I can see it every other day. They're getting rid of cars and actually converting the parking lots on the street into communal gardens, right?\n\n(00:10:16):\nSo it's not crazy. It's attainable. But now doing that for the whole world, what does that look like? And that's how things like Uber Pool came in where in a world where the average car has 1.5 people in it, we can maximize that and then we can get this connected trip where the car is just moving and then maybe the car is autonomous, so you don't actually have to drive that car, and so it just doesn't need to stop. I guess, it needs to charge at some point. But so that's it. I think that's a really good vision. I think one that's lofty and I dance between whether it's attainable or not, is Elon Musk saying, \"We're going to get to Mars.\" He believes it. He believes it so much that sometimes I'm like, \"I guess, we're going to Mars.\" But then there was the other one of, oh, we want a car that's electric and we want that car to be beautiful so that we will get to a car that's accessible to everyone. And that's kind of followed through. So yeah, I mean, the beautiful things about visions is that it helps you decide it. Is that a work... Do I care about this problem? Is it something I want to do? And then you can take it or leave it.\n\nLenny (00:11:22):\nI think with the lofty slash attainable balance, I think that Elon Musk is an interesting example where it may feel impossible, but as an inspirational leader, you almost convince people that it is possible through your confidence and your being in the details, helping people see maybe there's a path. So I think there's an interesting opportunity there to be a leader.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:11:42):\nYeah. Absolutely.\n\nLenny (00:11:44):\nYou've mentioned this kind of difference between mission and vision a couple of times. It'd be cool maybe just to... Can you summarize that again, just like what is the difference between vision and mission in your mind?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:11:53):\nI'll use it an analogy. Let's say we want to go hike. We want to go up to Mount Everest. The vision would be once we're up there, me describing the picture of what we're going to see, we're going to get there, we're going to look around, we'll be the Himalayas, be beautiful, we'll be above the clouds, probably out of breath. That's the vision. It's like I fast-forward into the future, I hold time and I'm in that place and I'm describing the picture, right? And so a city without parking, you can see that, right? And we've all watched sci-fi movies. You can see Mars, Red Planet. So that's the vision and then the mission is the purpose of why we're doing that. We're going to do this to demonstrate that we're able to do it and making sure that we both get there together. It's a very simplistic one, but I'm just giving... That's the purpose.\n\n(00:12:46):\nWe're doing it because we want to prove to ourselves that we can summit Mount Everest, which I will not be doing anytime soon, and we're doing it to prove to ourselves something that we can do it and we're capable, and we will do that by making sure that we look out for each other. Because you can get to Mount Everest and not have all the people with you, right? That's a team bonding challenge that I've done once upon a time. It's actually very, very, very intricate and interesting. So that's your vision. And then the mission is the purpose and some set of guiding principles as to what will allow you to achieve that vision.\n\nLenny (00:13:23):\nThat's really handy. So simple way to think about... I'm just taking notes as you're talking and I totally agree with this. The mission is essentially the why and why you exist and the purpose for your team slash company and the vision... The word vision almost tells you what it is. It's what it looks like when you get there. Awesome. So that's exactly how I think about it actually. I have this post that I'll link to in the show notes that talks through mission and vision strategy. I'll give a bunch more examples real quick. Just again, I pulled it up as you're chatting just for folks to have more examples. So a couple of mission examples real quick.\n\n(00:13:55):\nAt Ted, their mission is to spread ideas. They're around to spread ideas. Stripe's mission increased the GDP of the internet. IKEA's mission created better everyday life for the many people. So I think that's exactly what you're talking about. They're like the purpose, why do we exist? And then visions. So Microsoft's vision, a computer on every desk and in every home. Very much like what does it look like when we've achieved it? Tesla create the most compelling car company of the 21st century. It's kind of in between, but I think that's close. Lyft, a world where cities feel small again, where transportation and tech bring people together instead of a apart. How sweet.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:14:31):\nSo that's one where it's very warm and fuzzy and I love it. Maybe this is my Uber, but you can see a computer on every desk. That's what I mean by it has to be realistic.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nYeah.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:14:44):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:14:45):\nYeah. Awesome. So what is a vision concretely as a document in your experience? So we've talked about vision so far, mostly as this tagline, like a sentence, is that usually all you need when you're thinking about a vision, your experience? Do you often suggest going further into dock-deck, storyboards along those lines?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:15:07):\nSo I have a very simplistic framework. I actually don't know who put it together at Uber, but I see as well, one of the most powerful skills of a product manager is storytelling, right? Because you look at generation after generation after generation, what people pass on as stories, they're not numbers, they're not stats, it's stories. And actually when you blend stories with numbers, so if you do numbers alone or numbers with stories or stories alone, the gap is so wide in stories alone. So it's not metrics blended with stories. It's a story, just a pure story. This doesn't mean don't be analytical. So one of the very simplistic tools that I've used, and I use it as well right now at Google, when my team ships the product, I'll put the vision in there to remind what the vision was that they set out to do, right?\n\n(00:15:59):\nAnd it's once upon a time, write the problem and then write something and then write something, and then one day something happened. And as a result, the state of the world where we're trying to be. It's very simplistic, but in its simplicity of the magic because you are like, \"I'm a PM, I'm trying to solve problems.\" Once upon a time, where were we? Right? It's like what is the thing that we're trying to solve? So I'll give you a simplistic one. I know the team didn't do this for shorts, but the shorts team at YouTube. Once upon a time, YouTube was fun and people had cat videos and zoo and all of that. And then one day it became this really polished thing and a lot of people were producing really polished, very one hour content. And then because of that, a lot of people felt maybe I couldn't create because I can't tell a one-hour story.\n\n(00:16:57):\nAnd because of that, people decided, okay, I'm just going to watch and consume and not create. And then one day, we launch shorts, 60 seconds, and because of that, anyone can now express themselves again and bring back the joy and magic of YouTube. So it's very simplistic. I'm just using that into the teams who built this. I know this is not your vision, I'm just giving it a story. But I remember this when we did it for Uber as well, we were talking about the loyalty for drivers and some would have this framework and I thought, holy cow, this is it. So that's a very simplistic version. You can go one step up. The one I like to do, and I know that Amazon does this a lot, but as I write... I write an article. I'll write in the headline because if the vision has come to pass, right? And it's gone well, someone's going to be writing hopefully some sexy headline about the thing that you've built.\n\n(00:17:54):\nSo I go to the future and I write the headline I would see. And I write the subtitle, just that, and I'll actually use the... I'll [inaudible 00:18:01] it into the page of TechCrunch or [inaudible 00:18:04] or something just so it looks realistic. And I'll put that in the deck just to kind of like, this is where we want to be. And then if I really want to go deep, then I'll write the rest of the article, right? So that's a very simplistic one. Let's stick another version. One that I used, and I show that in a lot of my talks is, I was trying to tell a story when I was at Uber and I was like, \"Okay, words are amazing, but a picture tells a thousand words, right?\" So I wrote out the thing and I worked with my design partner at the time, and he literally took out a pencil and drew the future.\n\n(00:18:37):\nAnd the vision I was trying to show was this world where you could walk into any store, any Bodega, mom-and-pop shop, wherever you are in the world, and actually top up your Uber balance, right? So even if you don't have a credit card and you have cash, you can also experience this cashless, seamless Uber experience and that can scale all over the world. And he literally drew a Bodega or does it look like a kiosk, like the ones in Nigeria in my country, you have like a [inaudible 00:19:06]. And then he drew that and you had the person with cash and a receipt just showing your top-up was successful. And we built that product. Not exactly in that way, but we built that product. Sorry, for another day or maybe for later, but that's the story. It took four years to build it, but that image got people so excited about, oh, it's possible. I can see that.\n\nLenny (00:19:29):\nThis is awesome. So essentially these are three ways to communicate your vision. The first is this kind of Mad Libs approach, which is really simple. So the framework and is there something we can link people to you that where you talk further, kind of have this template? Okay, cool. Okay, cool. So in the show notes, you'll find a little template that you can plug and play here, but the idea is once upon a time, blank and then blank. And because of that blank and one day something happened, and that's essentially the vision is like what happened, the big change that you're going to create.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:20:00):\nAnd then as a result of the thing that happened, how did you leave people feeling? What did you change in the world? What's the dent in the universe that you made?\n\nLenny (00:20:09):\nCan you just share this Mad Libs real quick again, just like what's the framework real quick?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:20:14):\nOnce upon a time, the thing that happened, then one day... And you can actually put the date in 2026. And because of that and because of that... And I usually like to end it with, and finally, this was the last thing you left the world with.\n\nLenny (00:20:36):\nBeautiful. It's interesting, it kind of follows the hero's journey a little bit where it's like, here's today's world and then here's a problem that you ran into and this challenge you had to overcome. And then here's how we've defeated the foe. And then here we are back in our default world again. Okay, so that's one path. The other path is to write, working backwards approach, write an article. I think the press release is... To me, it's dumb to write a press release. No one reads press releases anymore. So I like that you think of it as a TechCrunch article.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:21:03):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:21:04):\nIs there something you remember where you did that actually with a product? Like you wrote an article of a product you were launching?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:21:08):\nAt Uber, we were talking about cars, then it was like, well push a button, get a ride. It could be push a button, go anywhere. And so, one of the things I started talking about... And this was the beauty of Uber, it allowed you kind of challenge the status quo. I started pushing this idea of if we need to have this more multimodal trip where I could take a... Ride a bicycle or a scooter, then I get to the train station, buy my ticket, scan in. Then from there I go into an Uber maybe then I come out and the other end and I get a scooter, whatever that is. It's this connected single trip. And the reason I was doing that was I was a Platform PM and surprise surprise, I always say Platform PMs, you have to be an order of magnitude even more stronger I think at vision setting because you have to build the foundations of stuff you don't even know is coming.\n\n(00:22:03):\nSo I would do these exercises with my partner teams to figure out, even if they don't know it, force a vision out of them just to say, \"Is this where we are going?\" Because then as somebody building the commerce infrastructure for Uber, I need to know when I need to build if that is a scenario that's actually going to happen. And we were also thinking about this world where you could tap to pay with your Uber phone. So there were all these crazy ideas and I wrote a headline of Uber really wants to replace your... I put it as your clipper card in San Francisco. Because I wanted my San Francisco buddies to relate to what I was saying. So I was like, \"Uber is now replacing your Clipper card. All you need is your phone and the app.\" And I wrote it out and we didn't go and build that product, but we built the payments and commerce infrastructure for the team that did. And we were very involved at the beginning when it was getting kicked off of how does this look in a world where you can use your Uber to pay for transport? You can do that today. So yeah, that's a real life example.\n\nLenny (00:23:05):\nAnd that was an article that you ended up writing of what the announcement would look like or is that using this? Okay, awesome.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:23:11):\nIt was the article framework. So it was truly the New York Times headline. Even had their logo and then I had the subtitle and later on over time I wrote the actual article, the whole thing. But I started first with that just to kind of provoke a response.\n\nLenny (00:23:29):\nAnd what did you see as the impact of having that? What kind of benefits did you see having this article that you could pass around? Do you have any memories of like, wow, that was really helpful here?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:23:37):\nIt's two things. So you'll hear me say product management is clarity and conviction. And in writing the headline, you have to focus. Headline is not like... It's not a PRD, right? It's a headline. So when I've done this, what is the impact of this going to be? What's the feeling [inaudible 00:23:56] people with? And it forces you to get to that clarity of, okay, we solved this problem. This is actually going to be the painkiller that we're solving. And then they translate that pain dealer into, they have a headache, they no longer have a headache. Do you know what I mean? So I think it breaks clarity. So for me, as the PM I'm like, this is why I'm saying this is important. Then you have the subtitled. So they'll usually have the headline and I'm like, sub bit. They've just launched a way to something something, and you have to write that as well.\n\n(00:24:22):\nWhat is the thing we're launching and is that realistic? And then using that to kind of socialize the idea to say, \"This actually could work, right?\" And I didn't go off and build it. Somebody else went and did it, but we had already thought about it and bit that into our platform vision of we need to be able to support these different kinds of ways to pay. There's another interesting one that you're going to go to. The third one, which is write the story. Write the article that someone else will write or visualize it, right? And the visualize it, two things actually happened. One a year and a half ago, in a strategy session I was running at YouTube, i...\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:25:00):\nThe strategy session I was running at YouTube, I actually took a screenshot of the Google Play Store. I mean, I use an iPhone, but I worked at Google, so I was trying to be... So I took the Google Play Store and then I created rounded rectangles, just blank rectangles, four panels. And then I printed that out and I gave everyone a sheet and I said, \"If we solve these problems, we solve all these problems that we've identified, what would be the screenshots?\"\n\n(00:25:32):\nYou know when you go on the app store, it has the make money or express yourself, what are we trying to say and what is the mock, the hero mock, the marquee mock that we're showing? And then again, it forces people to, oh goodness, we can't show everything, so it's got to be three or four things that land the big rocks that will solve this problem. Right? So everyone did theirs and then we talked about it and what was interesting is you'll find two or three that everyone comes up with if you've done a good job of telling a story around the problems. And it actually quite beautiful to see. So that's a very simplistic visualization that's not like a beautiful sketch or video.\n\nLenny (00:26:12):\nI really like that as just a reminder that when you're even the article approach of announcing the thing instead of the traditional press release or even a Tech Wrench article, it's where will people find out about the thing you've built, and then use that as a way to frame what you've done. So in your case, it's like the app store. They're going to see this update in the app store. Let's just see what that would look like as we announce it in the app store. Could end up being a tweet, could end up being podcasts. There's all these different channels. So I think that gives people more ways of telling the story. If it's not going to be a press release.\n\n(00:26:41):\nThen yeah, so you talked about this third approach of mocking up essentially the vision. I always feel like if you have a designer helping you craft your vision, it's such a unfair advantage. So definitely try to a rope a designer in to help you tell a story.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:26:41):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (00:26:56):\nBecause just one design is going to, like you said, worth a thousand words, as they say.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:27:02):\nThe thing though is I feel like it's an easy cop out to be like, \"Oh, but my design team doesn't have resources.\" So I'm like, \"No, that's not an excuse. Start drawing it with your hands in the app store.\" Still tell the story because the story, you should be able to tell this. I'm obsessed with Steve Jobs. He would say, \"Tell the story without slides.\" Right? So that mocking it up is just so you can actually bring that narrative and tell that story. And do an app store or sketch it out or use little rectangles to show low fidelity mocks. Do not use, I don't have a designer, to be the excuse for why you don't bring it to life.\n\nLenny (00:27:44):\nAnd often the designer sees it and like, \"This sucks. I'm going to make it better.\"\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:27:47):\nExactly. So that's exactly what I did. I sketched this thing once and I gave it to a designer. It was literally post-it notes and they were like, \"Okay, I see where you're going and it's exciting. I have some cycles, I'll spin it up.\" They spun up a lo-fi one, loved it, and I'm like, \"Actually, I'm just going to make it pretty.\" Then they made it pretty and we got there. I mean now I'm a director, so I have a bit more agency with resources, but I was like a L-four PM, not even a senior PM when I did my first vision exercise.\n\nLenny (00:28:16):\nOkay, this is awesome because I think it's really vague, this idea of I need to develop a vision, and I think you've shared some incredibly tactical clear steps you can take. I also want to talk about how to actually develop the vision. I think you have kind of this step-by-step approach. Is that right?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:28:31):\nMm-hmm.\n\nLenny (00:28:31):\nOkay, awesome. So before we get to that, just again reminding people what we just talked about, which is just like here's all these ways of framing your vision, and there's a lot of ways to do it. It's not like you need to make a beautiful deck that you can just write it out. You could write a press release, you could write a tweet or you could get a designer help you mock it up or just mock it up yourself. Awesome. Okay, so let's talk about your suggestions of how to actually go about developing and figuring out the vision for your product.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:28:59):\nYeah. There are three pieces if you think about it. So one is what I call empathize. The second is create. So we spend a lot of time talking about create, the middle piece. Another's evangelize. And so I empathize with the customer, the problem. I put myself in their shoes. I really get a visual understanding of what those problems are. I'll talk about it in a second the tactical way I have done that across Uber, Netflix, and Google in a way that scales. Then the create piece where it's okay, now we've solved this problem. What does the world look like? That's the vision we've just been talking about. And then finally, evangelize.\n\n(00:29:36):\nSo I find just especially as you get more senior, the life cycle of a product or a group of products gets wider and wider and wider. And so I set out a vision, for example at YouTube last year that was called Vision 2026. And only this year, a year and a half later, are we now at a stage where it's actually going into the planning cycle. We've actually finished all the things were already in progress. We're actually now funding some of the big rocks that get us there.\n\n(00:30:08):\nSo there's a bit of patience that comes with it. And I think some people just give up when they get to the stage because you're going to meet a lot of naysayers. That one person's like, \"But there's no way the engineering is ever going to solve.\" There's always going to be those people which is why I said you need to come up with a vision that's in a vacuum of the technical limitations because the limitations of today might not be the limitations of tomorrow.\n\n(00:30:32):\nSo going back to the empathize, one of my peers at work uses this word, he says, \"You need to do understand work.\" And what is understand work? It's crazy to me the number of PMs who never go through their products and go through the... unless of course you're the onboarding PM, but actually go through the onboarding flow. Because we're all in this state of using the product. But actually, that first step where I don't have the product, what does that look like? I have multiple variations of accounts on YouTube. I have multiple accounts on Instagram. I have multiple accounts on Tiktok where I'm just using the product just like how does it manifest? What do I like? What's going well? I had this thing with Uber. I had Uber, I had other partner apps, I would look at them and payment services, empathize comes very easily if you dog food and then cat food. Dog food, meaning using your own product, absolutely a must. Cat food using your competitors or other people in the landscape's products.\n\n(00:31:36):\nSo that's one piece. The other piece is obviously research, but research is an interesting one because I think you use research. I think research is rich when it's giving you foundational problems that are a couple of cycles out, obviously depending on the level of research you're doing. But your researcher, if you think about the product cycle, research is ahead, and then UX, and then you go into building, it's like in that phase.\n\n(00:32:06):\nAnd so I find too many people lean into and, \"Let's go test it, let's go do some research.\" It's like, dude, you're a human. Look at the products. Would you use that? You built some intuition from just exposing yourself to really good products. Every time you pick up your phone, what is it about the apps that you love? Do you think about that? Oh, I open up my phone. I love Spotify. I also love YouTube Music, but I really love Spotify for my music. I've used it for years and I'm like, okay, what is it about this new thing that just rolled that I love? And I try to articulate that.\n\n(00:32:44):\nSo there's that piece, but then the tactical thing that I almost make every PM on my team do I call it top 10 things you should know. It's a living document. So in my org right now I've got quite a number of PMs and for each of those PMs in this living Google Doc, it's like go slash studio problems, they literally put 10 things, like 10 problems you should know. And you revise it. Every quarter you update it and they're separate. So it's like a living set of problems. And they could be qualitative, they could be quantitative, they could be tech debt. They should be tech debt.\n\nLenny (00:33:27):\nThese are just known problems with the product that everyone was aware of?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:33:27):\nCorrect.\n\nLenny (00:33:31):\nOkay. Awesome.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:33:33):\nYou kind of farm for the problems. So you keep that doc going. And so I first started this at Uber on the money team and I called it money problems, more money, more problems because I do fundamentally believe we should bring joy into everything we try to do, so have fun with it. So more money, more problems. And essentially, it was in partnership with my data scientist partners that he had a team of product analysts and data scientists and they would pair up with my PMs and we would have the UX team, the UXR team, the data team, and the product managers, and engineering get together and actually look at their problems.\n\n(00:34:09):\nSo that living document means that for me, if I go around at least my minus one, not just for me but my engineering partner's minus ones, and my design partner's minus ones, and we chat them and say, \"What are the top five problems for studio?\" They should all have the same answer. This says I've done my job because then we all know the problems. You can debate them. You can discuss them. You can have sessions where you revise and review them. But we do that and then we go into a room and for example at Uber, I literally printed them on cards and I put them on tables, scattered the groups and had people discuss and vote the ones that is the most painful because then you see the whole thing.\n\n(00:34:52):\nSo that's the empathize bit. I'm spending a lot of time on this because I can't tell you how many times the clarity of the problem, going back to clarity and conviction, is missing and that problem is kind of like the North star. Everything's going on, but there's a north star that doesn't move.\n\nLenny (00:35:10):\nBefore you move on, there's so much there I just want to touch on that are really interesting insights. One is just this point you're making of when you're trying to develop a vision or thinking about the next step, you should be way ahead of that. You have this doc that you've been working on and consistently update and it's there way ahead of time. It's not like cool, next year's coming up, let's start from scratch and figure out what the vision is long-term.\n\n(00:35:32):\nTwo is there's this quote that I think Patrick Hollison tweeted that I always think about in these discussions where a lot of people think of user research. It's like user research, often people think of user research, you do user research and that tells you what to do. And he made this point, no, it should be user research updates your mental model of your customer and what they need and the problems they're having, the stock that you're writing, and then that mental model informs what to build.\n\n(00:35:57):\nAnd so I think that's a big difference and it connects with what you also said of you should trust your gut and judgment. A lot of people discount as a PM like I should have no opinions. I'm just going to listen to what data and research is telling me. I'm not going to try to bias the team, but something I've learned more and more over time is just you should really trust your gut and your instincts exactly like you said.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:36:19):\nIf I could put all the research into Bard or ChatGPT and it could spit out a PRD, then you haven't done your job. So basically I maybe panicked my team. I came in, I'm like, gen AI, everybody's talking about all the stuff that you do with creating content, but what I want you to think about is what is the value add you bring that I can't just put into an AI right now and say, \"Tell me the big thing based on this research that exists.\"\n\n(00:36:49):\nSo I've never heard that quote from Patrick Hollison, but I agree. It's spot on. And I think this is where when you think about the qualities of a product manager, I think there are four pillars, product sense, leadership, execution promise, and technical ability. And it's not product logic. It's product sense.. It's a feeling, right? It's a sense of what is right and that the exposure to products and the curiosity will refine that sense over time. And I think that's the thing that people undervalue a lot.\n\n(00:37:25):\nIt's like you start program managing and just spitting out what engineering said we can't do and UX said they could do and you become this. That's not the job. The job is clarity and bringing this kind of context really to the set of problems that are being solved and you're curing them together. That's the key there. It's like you're curating those problems together.\n\nLenny (00:37:48):\nAnd one of the challenges I find as a PM is convincing people of your gut instinct of why this is right. But I think that loops back to the power of vision and helping everyone align, like here's why we exist and here's where we're going and here's what I'm sensing is probably an opportunity.\n\n(00:38:04):\nOkay, so just to summarize some of the tips you've shared on this empathize step. One is basically user research, but I think even more importantly, use it to inform your understanding of the problem the users are running into and their needs and things like that. What else did you talk about? Oh, use the product. Actually be a user of the product. In your case it'd be like upload YouTube videos. Yeah. Is there anything else? Okay, there's this doc that you shared. That's awesome. So just basically a running document of known problems our users have with our product.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:38:38):\nCorrect. And when you start getting to the strategic lens, so you have a set of problems, what I sometimes will do is especially if you're, for example a platform PM, PMs generally have lots of stakeholders, there'll be a marketing team that's asking for something or an operations team that's like our market needs this. I'll sometimes bring them in at the beginning of the strategy session and give them a template, 10 things you should know. So you use my framework to give me 10 problems. Because if you say, \"Come present,\" they'll do like 50 slides. No, that's just 10 things you should know and stack rank them. So I put the work on you now to give me some color.\n\n(00:39:14):\nI hear from marketing, comm, support, research, content strategy. Actually had that in my last strategy session where it was the most mind-blowing 10 things you should know. One of them was like the average reading age of an American is 11 years old. And so you start to think of, oh my god, all the text we have, maybe we should use images or a video or whatever. So bringing this sort multifaceted view of the problems and then you do the work of sandpapering down to the core thing and then you have the final 10.\n\n(00:39:50):\nSo that would be the tactical if you want to take it to a more strategic lens. That's how I'd run the first day of my strategy session is usually insights. I'll usually do three days, insights, strategy, then big rocks. And the insights piece is this where we go deep into the problems and I use this template of 10 things you should know, and then we come out with the final list of 10 things you should know, like a consolidated list.\n\nLenny (00:40:14):\nI really like this additional tip you just shared of as you're trying to develop a vision for a team is bring in stakeholders and use this framework to help them crystallize here's the most important things to me from the product and things that I think are big opportunities. And then essentially, now you've got buy-in from stakeholders of hey, at least they've heard me and they understand and then here's what they came up with. And then I could be like, \"No, but what about this thing?\" That at least gives you a way to bring everyone together and understand how the process is going. Okay, so this week of work you just shared, so can you just talk a bit more about this? Is this you leading the team through an exercise to develop a vision and a strategy?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:40:54):\nCorrect. Correct.\n\nLenny (00:40:56):\nGot it. And so you said the first three days are aligning and fully understanding and immersing yourself in insights?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:41:02):\nI usually have strategy sessions of three days. I've tried to do it in two days. That is the absolute limit because I think you need to create white space for just the magic to happen. But I usually use a framework that it's literally what I call the narrative structure. So when we get into the conviction part, the clarity is the problems to solve. The conviction is the narrative. The framing of that conviction is insights, strategy, big rocks.\n\n(00:41:29):\nSo the insights day is just focused on understand work, these five problems, actually using the app, doing teardowns of other apps. It's just like a day of understanding. So the Google design, they ask the experts. In a way I've given the experts a template, that's what I'm doing basically. And then the second day is where we now go into the strategy of all the problems we've seen, the 10, which are the ones we want to focus on in which order?\n\nLenny (00:41:58):\nAnd who's in these meetings?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:42:02):\nI always have four folks. So it would be depending on the level of the strategy, it usually be product, my engineering partner, my design partner, and research.\n\nLenny (00:42:14):\nGot it. So it's the leaders of the team.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:42:16):\nThe leaders of the team. And depending on the org, I'll bring in data science because at Google we have a more shared data science resource. So I'll usually invite them as one of the partners. Come tell 10 things you should know. So they'll say, \"We need to do more instrumentation,\" or whatever.\n\n(00:42:31):\nBut you hit on the fantastic point which I was going to connect later, which is when you get to the evangelized stage, humans love to know you heard them. So imagine it's like you did all the work of bringing them together to say, \"Hey, tell me 10 things.\" You've asked the questions, you've come back and said, \"Here's the strategy that we're going to focus on and here's the vision.\" And that last stage where you evangelize becomes so much easier because it's like how did you arrive at this vision? That goes away or like, but you guys didn't solve in that. It's like we heard you and then we parse them into these 10 and everybody agreed with these 10 and therefore that's why we came up with this solution.\n\nLenny (00:43:11):\nSo let's segue to the evangelize step, which I think I always talk about. I always think about the Seinfeld meme of when he is trying to get a car reservation where he shows up and they don't have his car and they're like, \"We have your reservation, we just don't have your car.\" And he's like, \"That's the most important part of the reservation. You take the reservation, but you don't keep the reservation. That's the most important part.\" So I think to me it's always like you have this vision, you have amazing roadmap strategy, but if no one even knows it or hears it, that's the most important part. So I think it's super important to understand this. So I'd love to hear your advice on just how to successfully evangelize and share this vision that you've come up with.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:43:50):\nIn terms of evangelizing, I think about three concentric circles. So the core of your vision is your team. And I want to make sure my team understands the vision because I'm basically saying, \"Get on this boat, we're sailing to the vision of the Bermuda or some island,\" and I describe this beautiful island. They kind of have to be bought in and have conviction that they want to get there to actually sail on that boat together.\n\n(00:44:20):\n And so the team is the biggest part and it's the whole team. It's not like just the PMs are the vision. We're just the designers are the vision. I will literally first start with each of the folks that were in the room. We will basically bring our teams together and present an app. So for example, the one we did last year, we presented to what we call studio leads, which are essentially the triads for each of the product team, PM, engineering, and design for each of the product teams, and just presented it out. And I had multiple.\n\n(00:44:50):\nWe had the first one. Then I had one in my PM weekly, presented it again then, \"Hey folks, still any questions?\" Because people are still... It's percolating. It's like the tea bag. It's oozing out. They're trying to understand it and they're trying to stress test it. And what I also do is I write the output of the workshop. So I'll always write the output. These are the insights we came out with. Here's the ones upon a time framework. Here's the strategy. Here are the big rocks and a vision is coming.\n\n(00:45:18):\nAnd then we'll do the vision and say, \"But this is the vision of where we're going if we do all these things.\" And that will be a living document, comments, open for comments, no edit, not view only, comments because you want anyone to leave comments in there and just feel they have a say. You don't have to respond to all of them. You don't have to resolve all of them, but just if you put rocks in a washing machine, they polish each other. I like this friction.\n\n(00:45:47):\nI always like, I go into the forest, I cut a piece of wood, and our job together is to polish it down to the beautiful danish furniture. So it's okay to have that friction to do that for a bit. And then once the team has kind of gotten to a place, I'm not trying to get anyone to a hundred percent certainty, I'm trying to get you just on the ride. They will come, right?\n\n(00:46:05):\nThen I kind of go to this next layer, which is the stakeholders, those people that came in and their teams and their managers go to them and sort of get them brought in to the vision as well. And they'll also bring perspectives, right? You're missing this piece. We have a lot of engineering. Support tickets will blow up if you do this thing. What does that look like? You guys haven't solved the thing we need to do today. You're talking about something five years out.\n\n(00:46:32):\nYou're going to get all the variations of feedback. That's okay. The core that people have bought into that story. And it's okay to have all the... And then finally, once you've got the feedback from stakeholders, you then go to leadership, and leadership really as high as possible. So when I was at Uber and I was like an L-five, L-six, I had visions going all the way. I mean I had a fantastic leader. He put me on stage at an all hands to present the vision. And we were like one wallet, all Uber experiences. And then we have this vision of a world where Uber Eats, it could be trains, it could be whatever and you have this one Uber wallet that can be used for all of them. And we had mocks of what that looked like.\n\n(00:47:13):\nSo go as big as possible. Go big. Let people tell you to pull back. Let your manager use lasso and pull you back. Go as much as possible. So I go to leadership and then I have leadership, I have to find that story as much as possible. So those are the three concentric circles. Core team, the people who will actually build this thing, stakeholders, the people that need to be bought in for this thing to be successful because they play a part, and adjacent teams because as we're building this thing, it might mean that we tell you no for one of your requests or something, and then finally leadership. It's hard.\n\nLenny (00:47:48):\nIt sounds like a lot of work and a lot of time. Do you do this for yearly planning? Do you do this for future 2026 vision? Do you do this for quarterly plans? What's kind of the scale of vision that you invest this time into?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:48:05):\nWe go back to the four parts of the vision we [inaudible 00:48:10]. If a vision is something that's coming next year, write a newsletter. Write the newsletter, the headline article version or do the mock. When you are really getting into a vision, you're talking about something that almost feels attainable, but realistic, so it's a long-term thing.\n\n(00:48:26):\nAnd so you do the work and you take that time because you know that the rewards when you get everyone rowing in the same direction will mean a lot more velocity. And the ripple, I talked about evangelizing within the company, it's everything. When I start talking to a candidate, I say, \"Hey, my team's mission is expression meets connection, our vision is this.\" Then their eyes are like, you can see the twinkle. And so the ripple effect of this thing is just broad and big. My edge partner was just hiring for a role and in the job description, she opened it first with our team mission. And it was like we have these short links at Google, so it's like Google slash studio vision. People get excited just seeing it. So it's really this evergreen thing that is, we're talking four, five years. It's not the next six months. It's the next six months, do the tweet. Do the tweet.\n\nLenny (00:49:24):\nOkay, awesome. I think that's very clarifying. And so is this something you encourage your PMs to do is just always be working on this vision for the next, say, five years? Invest this time kind of in the background as you're shipping things every day, every quarter, to make sure people understand where it's going long term. And then it's like this one-off exercise that maybe you repeat every year too.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:49:45):\nI think if you have to repeat the vision every year, you have not created a good vision. You haven't done the work. So I'll give you an example of the one at Uber. What we kept doing was we would bring more fidelity to actually parts of the vision. So we had a low fidelity mark, more higher, and higher. Then at one point-\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:50:00):\nRight. We had a [inaudible 00:50:03] at Ohio. Then at one point we did a sizzle reel and actually had, if this thing is live. But we're not creating multiple visions. Remember all the things you read. A desk on every table. It's not like every year it's changing. Or going to Mars. It's not every year. It's something that it's you literally rinse and repeat. So the vision is something that is evergreen and lasts in my mind at least three years. However, and I'm talking about PMs from L4 all the way to L7 in my team, which is from a junior PM, senior PM all the way to GPMs in my org, all have a variation of a vision. That's a three-year thing. Now when they're going into a micro-visions that's like a macro-vision where maybe they're solving a small problem. Then they'll just do a mock of what that thing looks like next year and then in that mock, they'll present, \"This is the mock of what we think it should look like.\" That is a vision. It's a micro-vision but it is a vision. So do that.\n\n(00:51:04):\nAnd that's the thing they used to say, \"Hey, leadership, this is the problem statement. Here's what we think how might we solve this big problem and here's what we think it looks like when we ship it.\" That's a mini-vision. What I'm talking about is this macro-vision, but you actually can have the micro ones along the way.\n\nLenny (00:51:24):\nAwesome. That is really helpful. By the way, I really like that phrase, \"How might we.\" I find that extremely useful in communicating. Almost a vision, basically, just how might we solve this problem? Just that phrase alone is a really... There's this concept one of the PMs I worked with used called fertile questions. When you ask someone a fertile question that leads to discussion and a really good way to create a fertile question is how might we get more people to engage with YouTube analytics? It leads to lot of good brainstorm ideas. So good micro tip right there that we can include.\n\n(00:51:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by Wix Studio. Your agency has just landed a dream client and you already have big ideas for the website but do you have the tools to bring your ambitious vision to life? Let me tell you about Wix Studio, the new platform that lets agencies deliver exceptional client sites with maximum efficiency. How? First, let's talk about advanced design capabilities. With Wix Studio, you can build unique layouts with a revolutionary grid experience and watch as elements scale proportionally by default. No-code animations at sparks of delight while adding custom CSS gives total design control. Bring ambitious client projects to life with any industry with a fully integrated suite of business solutions from e-commerce to events, bookings and more. And extend the capabilities even further with hundreds of APIs and integrations. You know what else? The workflows just make sense. There's the built-in AI tools, the on-canvas collaborating, a centralized workspace, the reuse of assets across sites, the seamless client handover, and that's not all. Find out more at Wix.com/Studio.\n\n(00:52:59):\nSo I want to move on to craft but before we do that, is there anything else that you think would be helpful for folks to leave with in terms of getting better at vision? Say someone's got a development opportunity of get better at vision. Which of these things you've shared do you think would be maybe something they could start working on? Is it craft this five-year vision? Is it pick one of these three ways to communicate it? Is it change the way they're empathizing to inform the vision?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:53:28):\nI'll give a 1.5. I think it's, number one, it baffles me, and I'm somebody who came into product. I don't have a product management career. I came into product. And I've done that now at Uber and Netflix and Google and it still baffles me the number of people where when I say, \"Tell me the top problems that keep you up at night,\" and then rambling. I'm like, \"What are we talking about? Why are we rambling?\" This is literally the thing that you come to work. This is the thing that should excite you. So I cannot overemphasize this importance of top 10 things [inaudible 00:54:09] but you don't need to start with 10. I start with 10 and actually I always end up with top three. So in every deck, I'll have three things. Three numbers or four numbers. We just got a new chief product officer at YouTube because Neal Mohan is now the CEO, when I did my presentation to her, the opening sign is four things you should know. With these four numbers and four insights. So she walks away with that information now.\n\n(00:54:36):\nSo it needs to be visceral and crisp and clear. And then from that, just for yourself, have fun with it. Take out a post-it note and sketch, if you were to solve this problem, what it looks like. Just start there. Right? Just start there. And then if you can at least convince yourself, I don't so much care about the deck. The deck helps, absolutely. Or the pictures in the box. If you can tell the story of this is a problem and this is the world I see, imagine a world, that in itself is already you evangelizing the vision.\n\nLenny (00:55:11):\nAmazing. That is so helpful. So essentially, make this list of the biggest problems that your users have with your product and I think you also include infrastructure, tech, debt issues, maybe internal problems too.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:55:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:22):\nAwesome. I just want to know this list for every company now. Just what are their biggest problems? I wonder what they're struggling with.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:55:22):\nRight?\n\nLenny (00:55:22):\nOkay.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:55:30):\nBy the way, the infrastructure piece, I know it's a nugget on the side but infrastructure is the product. Period. People are like, \"Oh, tech debt.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, it's a product debt.\" I cannot build a skyscraper on a shaky foundation. So it is your problem too. It's not for the engineer to be barging on the door and be like, \"Oh, there's a problem.\" So that's the other one I'll just call out. That in itself is problem as well.\n\nLenny (00:55:57):\nYou're speaking to the heart of every engineer listening.\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:55:59):\nI know.\n\nLenny (00:56:02):\nOkay, and then the other tip was sketch the solution. Just do a post-it, draw it out, see how it feels. I think just people don't realize just the power of, \"Oh, I have to actually think about what this will look like and not just paint this very fuzzy picture of what it might be.\" Amazing. I feel like this is the most tactical and practical segment of advice on how to get better at vision. I'm so excited to get this out and for folks to have things that they actually do to get better at vision. I feel like this could be the whole podcast but you have more awesome stuff to share so I want to keep going. We're going to keep you here, extract as much content as we can out of your brain.\n\n(00:56:39):\nSo you touched on this phrase that you like to use for describing what is the craft of product management, succinctly describing the craft of product management. And I know there's many layers deep in this concept but just to start, what is this phrase and framework you think of to describe what is product management craft? What is the job of PM, basically?\n\nEbi Atawodi (00:57:00):\nSo I use, I want to say clarity and conviction. And that's what product management is. You bring clarity and you have conviction. So you find a lot of time, we've just talked about a number of things. All of those things, what they're doing is bringing clarity. And that clarity especially for the problem. So even when, I'll just give you a little tactical thing. I noticed there's some PMs who will send an email and I read the email, I'm like, \"What do you want me to do? Is this an FYI? Are you saying there's a problem? Do you want me to help?\" So just even something as simple as that. Because as PMs, we're constantly influencing by bringing clarity. So the clarity, all the stuff we just talked about, coming up with a list of problems, really trying to understand what customers care about. All you're doing is bringing clarity so that when you're in a room and someone is going off and doing [inaudible 00:58:07] actually we don't need that research. I feel like we all know that that's a problem. We don't need that research.\n\n(00:58:11):\nInstead of doing foundational research, let's do UX validation when the time comes. That's the kind of clarity you can break that saves cycles. So that's the clarity piece. And if you think when you think about what clarity is, you define clarity. It's this transparency. It's the simplicity of understanding. That's what the word is. It's removing all, it's sifting out all the stuff that's polluting the core thing. That's how I think of clarity. And the tactical thing that I use to bring that clarity is the framework I talked about which is the narrative, insights, strategy, big rocks. It brings clarity to why we're doing what we're doing, how we're going to do it and what we're going to do. And I spend time talking and I can spend time talking about all this but we talked about the workshop to do that and I actually have, and one of my old EMs who you've actually had on the podcast talks about this a lot. People have fancy decks. That's great. Clarity comes when you write. So I made them write two-page documents.\n\n(00:59:20):\nI'll let you go up to four, maybe. But two page documents with insights, your strategy or I use the word approach sometimes and then the big rocks. And the big rocks are not a laundry list of 20 things because if I asked you to make me a cocktail, you would put ice in first. Then you would pour the drink. You would not put the drink and then put the ice or it will splash and it's messy and that's how an endless roadmap looks to me. So it's like 3, 4, 5 things that anyone can remember that are the biggest things that if we land, this gets us closer to solving the problems. Then every other little thing is around. You can fill that around. That's the sand around the big rocks.\n\nLenny (00:59:59):\nSo let's just actually double click on this little framework that you're sharing of insight strategy, the big rocks. This is essentially what you ask your teams to share as their strategy, as their plan, essentially. The high level plan, it's not yet a roadmap strategy. Do you think of this just as vision and strategy as this document?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:00:17):\nThis is not vision. This is not telling us what the world will look like if we solve the problem. That's the vision. This is actually bringing clarity to the narrative of why we exist. So if you were a company, and I always use these, I feel like we can solve a lot of problems in life if we found a parallel in the world. And the parallel I just look for is if this was a startup and you wanted to tell people why you exist and why they should invest in you, which is why you're doing this PM, what is the big problem you solve as a company? What's the strategy and what are the things you're going to deliver that would end up in the headlines that are coming in the future that you need money for? You're telling investors, \"I'm going to build these things, I need money to do these things.\" That's what this is. It's just the narrative.\n\n(01:01:04):\nAnd I think one of the simplest things a PM can have is this narrative that when people come to you and be like, \"Hey, you see all these emails, introduction, meet this person.\" And the PM [inaudible 01:01:16] are like, \"Oh, I want to set up a time to understand what you do.\" I'm like, \"Nope. Go to [inaudible 01:01:22] slash my narrative, read it. Then when we set up the time, let me know if you have questions.\" And guess what? A lot of calls will fall off just from that. Or when someone comes into the team and they're like, \"hat are we about?\" Onboarding, here's the narrative. So that's the narrative and that's the one that you refresh periodically so that you can refresh every quarter and refresh every six months because you're adjusting to what's happening in the world, what the problems are. That's a narrative.\n\nLenny (01:01:48):\nOne last question just so folks get a sense of where this fits into all their work. Does this come before defining the vision and then the roadmap? Where does this fit in terms of vision and roadmap in terms of the process?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:02:00):\nSo the document is evergreen and updated. I'm a big fan of evergreen documents because you create this mental thing where everybody just knows, link whatever the short link is, whatever you use in your company, they remember it and that's the link and that's where I go or they know what the name is to search for the document. It's like how we all know good PM, bad PM. It's lived for the test of time. So I believe in evergreen documents. Update the existing document or do a versioning of the doc, like 2022 version, 2023 version, whatever that is. So typically the narrative will happen before as you go into planning. So just my team right now, we've just gone through a planning cycle. Now I already had a vision for the team, but basically each team, they took the overarching vision and said, \"Okay, let's now bring that to life for our area.\" They had a set of problems, they had their strategy, approach we called it, and then they have the big rocks. And everyone wrote the two pager. So we wrote this two page document.\n\n(01:03:05):\nAnd then they circled around, the partners, the engineering teams and got feedback. And that's what they then used to then build out the roadmap. Then they built out the roadmap and said, \"Okay, based on that, this is what the roadmap looks like of unpacking those big rocks a little bit more.\" And usually what the rule we gave was, if you have less than three engineers on a problem, consolidate. More than three, it needs [inaudible 01:03:30]. So then you have the roadmap, it's just a Google sheet with a list of things and the resources assigned to it, and that's when we start to see, okay, where are you blocked? You have enough UX, you have enough this, it's a bit more tactical. And then you have your roadmap. But then after you've done the inside strategy, the big rocks or the roadmap, you can in parallel or after say, \"Okay, let's take a week off. Spend time in a room and shape the vision.\" Or \"Let's take a day off.\" I've once done one a day, the sketches I talked about. We literally locked ourselves in a room.\n\n(01:04:06):\nAt Uber, we had no meeting Wednesday. Google and YouTube, we have no meeting Friday. And I said, just block your no meeting Friday. The next one we're going to get in the room, we're going to whiteboard. We literally posted notes and the designer of course was like, \"This thing is ugly,\" and then made a pre. And that was the vision. The vision, I remember seeing so many docs at Uber with literally slides from my doc saying, \" We agree with this vision and so therefore we're going to build this thing in our team to support it.\" And that's great. I feel influencing. And I'm seeing it right now at YouTube as well, where teams are like, \"Oh, I've seen that vision,\" and they'll refer to it. \"I saw your studio vision on slide five when you talked about this. This is what we did with it.\" So that's how I would do it.\n\nLenny (01:04:53):\nOh man, I feel like there's so many directions I want to go. You have so many nuggets of wisdom but I'm going to get back on track. So you have this framework of what a great PM is, clarity. Let's talk about conviction. What does that actually look like? We\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:05:05):\nAlready spoke about conviction. So conviction is the vision.\n\nLenny (01:05:08):\nMm. Where you basically very succinctly tell here's where we're going and here's why we're doing this.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:05:15):\nSo definition of conviction is a feeling of what you think the way the world should be. It's a feeling. It is not certainty. It is not absolute. It is not perfect. But it's a feeling of, I feel like this is the right thing to do. And that's what we're seeing when we talk about product sense. It's building this feeling of what you think is right so you bring that to life. And so everything we just talked about is literally you converting the conviction from your head into something that people can consume. And that's the conviction, clarity, narrative, vision, conviction.\n\nLenny (01:05:50):\nSo this is specifically the craft or product management. If you want to get better at the craft of building great products, these are the two areas I imagine you point your PMs to get clear on things and then have more... Is it more conviction? Is it clear conviction? How do you think about the skill of getting better at conviction?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:06:09):\nIf you have conviction and it's not clear, then you don't have conviction, quite frankly. If you're like, \"I think maybe we should, there are five things we should solve.\" I'm like, \"Then you don't have conviction.\" So I'll sometimes stress test. And I'm like, \"What if I took away all your resources and you only had five, which is the one you're going to build?\" I do all these Draconian things that just force clarity. So then the conviction will come out and it's like, \"Yeah, but I'm uncomfortable.\" I'm like, \"Okay, so the thing that's making your uncomfortable, go spend time, go spend your research, go spend your cycles on getting higher certainty on that conviction,\" rather than chasing four things because we're, I don't want to use the word lazy, but too scared to pick a lane. So don't peanut butter. Nobody does anything well by peanut buttering resources, spreading them thin. So that's the conviction. I'll sometimes have someone come to me and say, \"We have these two scenarios,\" and there'll be a document and there'll usually be the typical pros and cons of the options.\n\n(01:07:12):\nI'm like, \"Let's say we weren't in the room as the leadership team,\" which is the one the team wants to get behind. Then you'll sometimes see the team hasn't even done the work between themselves talking. I'm like, \"No, no, no, no, no. You need to go do the work.\" And if you have gotten to a point where you have conviction, but there is some risk, then let's talk about the risk that you need by help mitigating or help solving because that's too easy to come to me and be like, \"Oh, here's A and B. You do the work and tell me which you one to pick.\" No way. No, that's not going to make you a better PM. Go figure out why you can't stand by A.\n\nLenny (01:07:47):\nSo the core to conviction is pick what you think is right. That seems like the core of it. Clarity is being very clear about what you've learned and where you think things are going and then conviction is pick your battle. Here's where we think we need to invest.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:08:00):\nRight. I like the word battle. Clarity is seeing that you are committed to actually fighting this war in the first place, right? There are lots of other things you can fight. This is the fight you're fighting in and why. And the conviction is how and the way you see the world if you win that battle.\n\nLenny (01:08:20):\nGreat. Okay, so you gave a talk on product culture and how the company culture informs and it changes the way the product is built. So you worked at three very different cultures that I'm aware of, Uber, Netflix, and Google. All very different companies. I guess maybe just as a broad question, what did you see about the culture of the company due to change the way product is built?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:08:43):\nYou think about what Uber has done in the world and you think about where we are now where it's almost so natural to bring out your phone and the car turns up with someone you do not know that you get into and trust them to take you where you're going. If you fast forwarded to when my grandmother was alive, she would've thought you were crazy. So just think of all the pieces that had to come together for that to work. And it was a super hands-on, zoom out, zoom in. We say boardroom to streets. You could roll up your sleeves and go in the streets and then go to boardroom, operations team, that really went into the fabric of a city and tried to convert that mission into what the manifestation is in the city. And I started at Uber as a GM before I became a PM. So I firsthand experienced that. I got my job, there were seven cars on the road and I had to figure it out in a country where there's no reliable running water, we want to do reliable transport.\n\n(01:09:44):\nSo what does that look like when drivers don't have a mobile phone? We didn't have [inaudible 01:09:49] So there's this big piece of the operations and what Uber basically did was we're going to work very hard to get the right people in seats. We're going to give them complete autonomy. And the magic that just came out of that is the reason that Uber exists and that infrastructure is very much what has allowed a lot of the gig economy actually thrive. Setting up these playbooks, trying things, learning, sharing with each other was a very big part of the culture. Now, over time, I call this the monolithic culture. There was a culture. And the culture of ever went back and said, \"Hold on, let's revisit this. Does it still serve us? Has the context changed? What are the parts that we need to improve, evolve?\" Because here's the thing, if you don't intentionally evolve the culture, it will evolve without you. So culture is always going to evolve. That's just the way humans are. And the culture are the norms and beliefs. And beliefs and norms change. That's how humans are.\n\n(01:10:53):\nSo I always say, \"What are the good behaviors that you reward and the bad behaviors that you condone?\" And if you're not going back to revisit that, then the culture just moves on and then the company's out playing catch-up or it moves on in the way you don't want it to. And then the world is like, \"Oh my god, Uber. Delete Uber,\" which actually happened. I lived it. It's very sad to wake up and know that you're doing the right thing for the world and see that 400,000 people have deleted your app just because of a miscommunication, really. So this is a really big piece of Uber. The spin there on the autonomy was one of the cultural values was the principle of confrontation and toe stepping. And this is codified in the value system. It's like, forget about levels, step on toes if you believe it's the right thing for the business. And I talk all the time about the story of cash, where Travis Kalanick was against cash.\n\n(01:11:47):\nBy the way, I think up until he left Uber, he was against cash. But he believed in data and he believed in principle confrontation. And he was like, \"Go test it out.\" And we tested it out and it did well. And that's why cash exists on Uber. Because the culture enabled that. So I've talked about how it evolves and also the [inaudible 01:12:06] of Uber. You go to Netflix where it started as a monolithic culture. It came out of, \"Oh, we went through this experience where we had to cut the org down and we left these sets of people and they were performing just as well and had the same output and the same joy. Hey, what did we do right here? Let's distill this down and distill it down into this no-rules rules framework of [inaudible 01:12:34] responsibility of highly aligned, loosely coupled a few of these tenants at Netflix.\n\n(01:12:42):\nBut I saw in my time, my very short time at Netflix when I left Netflix to go to YouTube, I saw the culture evolve in a very short space of time. There was a very high degree of intentionality to evolving the culture. What does it mean to entertain the world? Let's evolve, let's discuss, let's change. And so again, going into the product, when I joined Netflix, there was a whole value of the product would not ever be advertising video on demand. It's subscription video on demand because we believe if we, and it was a strong belief. It was a belief system. And then over time, there were debates and debates. I was a part of a lot of conversations around access. In a world where more people are on their mobile phone, do not have a TV screen, might not have a credit card, do we want to entertain the world or do we want to entertain some people in some places? Sounds familiar, right? This is what we also had at Uber. Do we want to offer Uber to the world or just some people in some places who have credit cards?\n\n(01:13:50):\nSo I saw that conversation go back and forth and the company allowed a structured way of having these debates. So you would typically be encouraged to write down things. Write your argument but ultimately it's Lenny's decision. And it's funny when the buck stops with you, how the whole thing flips on its head. You'd think it would be chaos. It's actually not. You actually saw people go a lot more methodically around, okay, I need to make sure. I remember when we talked about conviction earlier, we said, how do you get the firmness in your conviction? I saw people do that work. Be like, okay, I'm at 95%. Can I get to 99%? What would I need to do that? And because the buck stops with you, right? In a world where people can sign up to multimillion dollar deals. So without any approval, it's actually quite liberating but it's the liberation that's frightening.\n\n(01:14:47):\nSo you saw this and this intentionality involving the culture and now going back to subscription video on demand, because you would write things down and people kept debating and pushing and pushing, there's now advertising on Netflix. That's a culture that allows the product.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:15:01):\n... right? That's a culture that allows the product to sort of evolve and change tenets. And then you see Google where it's very much just this, I sort of use this story of two little fish swimming in the water and the old fish goes past them and says, \"Hey, how's the water?\" And they're like, \"Good.\" And then they swim along and they go, \"What's water?\" That's a little bit of what you get and it's like, we have this respect the user, respect the opportunity, respect each other, and that's all you get. That's it. That's it.\n\n(01:15:41):\nWhat is Googling? You know it when you see it, but what is Googling? And so it allows for when you have this, what I call, the microcultures, where the culture within YouTube is different from the culture within cloud is different from the one in photos, different from the one in maps. You actually hear people say, \"Oh, they came from search because they have a culture in search, which if you say you're going to deliver two basis points, you're delivering two basis points, right? And there's a different culture and assistant where it's like, \"Oh, experiment and try things and so on.\"\n\n(01:16:14):\nSo the culture almost becomes, it almost feels like a city, right? So I'm in Amsterdam and there's a culture in De Pijp and there's a culture in Amsterdam-Noord, where all the hipsters are, and there's a culture in West, right? It's the same in San Francisco. There's a culture if you're in the Mission and you're in all of those things. So essentially what you then end up with is these microcultures, but then there is this looser macro culture that allows the flex of the culture so it manifests in different ways.\n\n(01:16:45):\nAnd what that means for the product is, you end up with a company like Google, where one side of the business is building something like cloud, another part's building something that's heavily data-centric, another part's building something very human. Give everyone a voice, show them the world. That's YouTube, right? And you were able to do that because the culture allows that flex.\n\nLenny (01:17:04):\nWhen you think of Uber versus Lyft and then there's Airbnb versus there's this company Wimdu that was one of their main competitors. There's these German guys. It's interesting. In the case of Uber, they're very aggressive versus Lyft was nice brand. But in the case of Airbnb, Airbnb was the very nice culture and brand and Wimdu was extremely aggressive, just very hardcore. And it's interesting in some markets, maybe you win going really hard and aggressive and just like... Another Uber value, I think was, find your red line.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:17:37):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (01:17:38):\nJust find your limit and get there, and that's where you're going to work. And then in hospitality, maybe there's an advantage to being an Airbnb where it's more warm and fuzzy. So that's interesting, that depending on the market, maybe a different culture has a bigger opportunity to win. Never thought of it that way before.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:17:53):\nWhat I saw that was interesting about Uber was there was a core that was very monolithic about, this is the culture and you hired people from all walks of life that live and breathe that culture, but there was a lot of magic that came out of a culture that also had the city at the core.\n\n(01:18:14):\nSo celebrate cities was one of the core things, and customer obsessed was another value. So if you're customer obsessed and the culture says celebrate cities, then you know what? Maybe when we do ice cream in Nigeria, we're going to put this spin on it. We do Uber ice cream in San Francisco, we're going to put that spin on it.\n\n(01:18:33):\nSo there's also this element of like, I could... Nice isn't the word I would use, but it was very accessible to anyone because it met them where they were. The product met them where they were. And I think that opened the roads for... No other company has been able to create ride sharing at that kind of scale. It's very region by region and I think it's because of that.\n\nLenny (01:18:54):\nI think one of the other interesting things about culture is every team also has its own culture and part of PM and a PM leader's job is to create that culture and create good vibes and be a recent guest, put it, you're the emotional center of the team. Is there anything you do on your teams to create that culture to make sure everyone's feeling good and excited and create good vibes?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:19:16):\nSo I actually spent time with both my VP and my peers, my engineering and design partners, and we have a little acronym called BEM, because it's Brian, Ebi, Matilde. And I kind joke, I'm like, \"BEM.\" So BEM got together and created a cult. We discussed the culture that we wanted to have on the team because indeed, it's how do you work? And by the way, just fun fact, the reason I ended up at Netflix and got obsessed about Netflix actually, was when I was at Uber and we started all this evolving beyond this what we call Uber 1.0... So I'm very Uber 1.0. I joined Uber as employee number 1024. It's a very different Uber. As the culture was going out and in a way, in my mind, losing a little bit of the conviction that the other one had and becoming kind of like a catchall.\n\n(01:20:11):\nIt's pivoted in the right way now, but it kind of swung the other way. I actually had my product marketing partner, his wife worked at Netflix and so he sends me the Netflix culture memo. To your point, I created a culture of Netflix within my team at Uber. And so the values that actually I have carried through, kind of go back to those. I do believe in this freedom or responsibility. I will give you freedom, but with that comes responsibility. That means the buck stops with you. We had a similar one at Uber, which was, owner, not a renter.\n\nLenny (01:20:45):\nSpeaking of Airbnb.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:20:46):\nYeah. Owner, not a renter. How would you act if this house was yours versus when you rent, right? And so it's that buck stops with you, kind of mentality. Then there's this other one that I really think about which is, there's an informed captain. And so, I'm in too many conversations where I'm like, \"Who is on the hook for this decision? Who cares if this decision is made?\" It's not like six people with consensus. Who is the person?\n\n(01:21:11):\nAnd I'm very big on people on count [inaudible 01:21:14]. A lot of people are like, \"Well, but there are five of us.\" And I'm like, \"No, no, no. There's one person who owns this decision and that's the person that we're going to empower to get all the context, get all the input, to make the decision.\" Right? And it's like the rapid model where you end up with the decider.\n\n(01:21:29):\nAnd then, I think one for me, and this is just something I'm very passionate about, I'm a Black woman. I think a lot about how I show up in the workspace. And for me, something that's so crucial is I say vulnerability is your strength, right? And so we're all human. We're all fantastically flawed in many ways.\n\n(01:21:51):\nAnd so I really, really fundamentally believe in this whole, who's the human behind the role and how's that human doing? And I don't optimize for being liked to be very... And it sounds very harsh. I do not believe in being liked. That's Ebi. I believe in being loved, right? And that's a very, very different thing. And when I said this once in a meeting, people were like... Yes. Right? But it took me a while and reading a lot of books to come to a definition of love, and love is the choice to extend yourself for the spiritual growth of oneself or another. Right?\n\n(01:22:32):\nIt's very big and lofty and whatever, but you're literally extending yourself for somebody else or yourself, self-love. Right? And that's love. And when you're extending yourself, you're not nice. It's not always nice or like. It's sometimes is having hard conversations. It's knowing that, \"Oh, there's a human.\" Matilde, my engineering partner or Brian, my engineering partner, whoever those are, they know I care about them.\n\n(01:22:59):\nSo when the feedback is coming like raw, they know that it's in their best interest because I've shown them enough times that I genuinely care about the person behind the role. I feel like that brings the most powerful thing a team has. You'll see teams just tactically, they'll write a PRD, they'll send the PRD outside to the world, right? To the other partners and I'm like, \"Have you spoken to the other PMs on your team? Have they read it? Because actually, it might help you write a better PRD.\"\n\n(01:23:28):\nAnd so in my team now, we have our email distro. Gmail allows you to do the plus thing, plus PRD, and just ship your PRD, even when it's getting date. And people will just help you shape it because we all care about each other. So it's a very, I know fuzzy and whatnot, but I do really believe in this thing of, if we get back to the core of humanity and there's a human behind the role and they have goals and aspirations, and if you care and love them, the rest of it will follow.\n\nLenny (01:23:58):\nWow. I love this. You shared a trick for getting a sense of, if you have a good relationship with your EM, kind of along these lines, can you share that? But this was before we started recording.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:24:09):\nI did, I did. And it came from when I first got into product management, I was a PM in training, called a PM trial. And my engineering manager was an associate EM, sort of EM in trial and we hated each other. We absolutely hated each other. And now, we love... There was love in the end and he... Still a very good friend of mine and it came down to first this... I asked this question.\n\n(01:24:36):\nDo you know your engineering manager's birthday? It's the day they showed up in the world. It's the most important day for them. It's the day they showed up the world. Do you know their birthday? Do you know their work anniversary? Do you know why they're doing the job they're doing or what they want to be? Are they trying to be a VP? Are they trying to go grow a startup? What is it?\n\n(01:24:59):\nAnd so, if you go to this sort of human element of trying to actually bond with the person. We'll do fun things where we'll just go to a show together or something or have lunch or dinner. Because if I'm spending half of my waking life at work, right? You sleep eight hours. The remaining time is 16 hours and you work, let's say, eight hours if you're lucky, right? You work eight hours. If I'm spending that time with someone, I kind of want to have fun while I'm doing it and you'll have fun when you like each other, you love each other, even better.\n\nLenny (01:25:33):\nEbi, I wish I got to work with you. You're awesome. By the way, this EM you're talking about is Gergely Orosz, who was on the podcast.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:25:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:25:41):\nHe's the author of Pragmatic Engineer. People may be aware of him already. So how about that?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:25:46):\nAnd I knew he loved to write, so every time we would do a doc for example, to leadership, he would start. He would kick it off. Even though it was something product centric, he would start writing it. I'm like, \"Great, you're an awesome writer.\"\n\nLenny (01:25:59):\nLook at him now. [inaudible 01:26:02]. Maybe as just the last topic, I'd love to hear any cool stuff happening on YouTube. Stuff that you... I think you just launched some AI stuff, there's AB testing stuff that's coming out. Just like what should people know about new YouTube features, especially people like me that aren't publishing stuff on YouTube?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:26:15):\nWell, I'll go to one of the things we talked about, which is this once upon a time vision. One of the visions we have as a team is, if you go back to the core of YouTube which is, give everyone a voice, share it in the world, it's really this... YouTube is for creators big and small, who want to tell their story however they want to tell it, whether it's a podcast or live or video or short or post, and that we are the creative partner. Maybe that's another podcast for another day, but I fundamentally believe in when products take on some kind of persona. Right?\n\n(01:26:52):\nAnd so we're like, \"Okay, YouTube Studio...\" Really, we're the creative partner. We're not making the thing. You're making the thing, but we are partnering it. We're the ones giving you insights. We're the ones helping you with testing things that might work and if we could make your life easier, then you could just go do the fun stuff of telling your stories, right? So there are a couple of exciting things coming.\n\n(01:27:16):\nSo one of them is AI inspiration, which we launched at Made on YouTube and when you talk to creators, and I always ask creators this question, \"Tell me your creative process.\" There's always this big piece that's like the research, where they come up with an idea and they kind of flesh it out. In your case, maybe it's finding the person and it's reading about them. This is pre-work that they do and sometimes they'll do work by looking at tweets or watching other YouTube creators or listening to other things.\n\n(01:27:47):\nAnd so imagine a world where we can actually use AI to generate ideas for you based on what we know your community of subscribers and viewers are watching, right? So that's what I'm very excited about in some future world where I'd love to see you using that. It's going to launch next year. There's already a version of it in YouTube Studio where you can just type in a word, you could be like vision. And then it will give you ideas and other videos and topics and keywords that are being searched. That's one exciting one.\n\n(01:28:20):\nAnother really exciting one is we launched thumbnail Test and Compare. So creators spend a lot of time on thumbnails, a lot of time. And we've been working a lot with creators. We've been very systematic about just getting feedback and getting it out there. It's just rolled out even to a bigger set of creators yesterday, actually. By the time this comes out probably... You might have it in your hands, Lenny. And so you're able to basically put two thumbnails, up to three, two, three thumbnails, and the system will actually AB test them and see which one actually works versus you sort of designing a thumbnail and then [inaudible 01:29:01] it out. So that's another exciting area.\n\nLenny (01:29:04):\nDreams coming true. I can't wait to try that. It feels like it's like the edit button for Twitter where it's like, \"Come on. Why don't we have this?\" And here it is. That's awesome. Yeah, I've been trying to do some more testing on that stuff and there's all these clunky tools people have built that are hacky on top of YouTube to try to do this for you, so I'm really excited to try that. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you want to leave listeners with? Anything else you wanted to touch on or share?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:29:26):\nI think one of the questions I get a lot of the time is, how can I be a PM? How can I convert into product management? And I just want to say, I'm this Nigerian girl. I don't have an MBA, I didn't work in consulting, and I'm here, right? And I genuinely think that some of the best product managers come from something else because you have empathy for being on the other side. And so, what I always say to people is, \" There's a power of 10,000 hours,\" and you see a lot of the stuff I spoke about.\n\n(01:30:04):\nThere's a lot of this kind of immersing yourself. So already start product management, doing product management before you're a product manager. Open up your favorite apps. What are the top 10 problems you see? In your head, design what the world could look like if you fix them, right? And what you do by doing that is this constant training of your product sense. So when the opportunity comes, you don't get lucky, right? But you get, it's opportunity meets preparation. You're already prepared.\n\nLenny (01:30:31):\nI love that. By the way, I think you're the third Nigerian guest on this podcast. There's something in the water in Nigeria that's creating a lot of great product leaders.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:30:43):\n[inaudible 01:30:43]. They say, \"Get you a Nigerian friend. We keep it real.\"\n\nLenny (01:30:45):\nWell. With that. We've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:30:45):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:30:49):\nAll right. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:30:55):\nI really, really love this book called, 48 Laws of Power. I know it sounds very Machiavellian. Beautiful book. Another book that is one of my absolute favorites, is The God of Small Things. It's a beautifully written, really wonderful book. And more recently, a book that keeps popping up in my mind is Outliers by Malcolm Gladwell. Such a beautiful book because it just goes back to what we talked about earlier, it helps you see that there are patterns in certain things, right? Yeah. It's been coming out maybe quite a lot. I'm a voracious reader, by the way. Find me on Goodreads. I read a lot.\n\nLenny (01:31:43):\nOh, that's amazing. We will find that. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:31:48):\nOh, my God, The Bear. Just The Bear. Go watch it. It feels like being a PM, honestly. The Bear is the show, I think it's on Star or Disney.\n\nLenny (01:31:58):\nHulu.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:31:59):\nHulu. That's the one in the US. Yes. It's about a chef. It's so well done. Beautiful cinematography, but also, you feel the heat in that kitchen. You feel it.\n\nLenny (01:32:12):\nIt's very stressful to watch that show.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:32:14):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:32:15):\nSecond season's less stressful, at least. In my-\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:32:18):\nWait. Do you know the season is less stressful because the restaurant is closed? That's beautiful cinematography. The pace goes down and it picks up when the restaurant's open again.\n\nLenny (01:32:29):\nOh, yeah, that last-\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:32:29):\nDo you agree?\n\nLenny (01:32:31):\nYeah. Interestingly, The Bear has been the most recurring recommended show on this podcast recently.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:32:36):\nNo [inaudible 01:32:37].\n\nLenny (01:32:37):\nThere's a phase of Last of Us, there's a phase of White Lotus and now it's The Bear. So we'll see what comes next.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:32:43):\nDamn it. I want to be contrary now. I'm trying to think of something else.\n\nLenny (01:32:47):\nI've been a huge fan of this new show on HBO called, Scavengers Reign, if folks haven't seen that. It's incredible. It's animated and sci-fi ish and it's just like, \"Wow.\" I can't wait to watch more. Anyway, that's my answer. It's not about me. Let's keep going. What's a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:33:06):\nTwo questions. If they're a people manager, what is your leadership philosophy? The amount of leaders who have never thought about that is quite scary. And if you're just pure product chops, tell me your favorite product, product you're most passionate about, and why. And I live for the storytelling. Do you start with a problem? I wake up in the morning. I'm always looking for the mood. Music is a backdrop to my life and I open up Spotify and it just finds exactly what I need to... I've just told you the problem and the solution, right? So I look for those kind of things. Then I'll ask, if you could improve it, what would you do?\n\nLenny (01:33:42):\nI love it. That's an awesome one. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love, whether it's physical or digital?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:33:51):\nThere's a product I'm using a lot now, very simplistic. It's a product called Sleep Cycle. It basically allows you set an alarm but a progressive music alarm to wake you up because I don't want that jarring like [inaudible 01:34:07] in the morning. It kind of just gets me there, but it also tracks my sleep using the microphone. So it tells me whether I'm coughing or whether I woke up, or I'm snoring if I'm in the wrong position. It also shows stats. When I'm in Nigeria, I snore less than everybody. When I'm in certain countries, I snore more than everybody. So it's a really cool app.\n\nLenny (01:34:30):\nIt feels like... We have a Nana to watch our kid. It's like a camera that's watching him sleep all day and I feel like I need that for me because it tells you when he was woken up, how long he's been sleeping. That's awesome. It's called Sleep Cycle. Okay. We'll link to that in the show notes. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to or share with friends or find useful just either in your day life or in work?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:34:52):\nI'm going to pull it up. It's a poem called, Invictus. And I love this quote because he was going through issues with his leg and was actually going to potentially lose it, and then wrote this quote. I want to read the last part. It's worth reading, looking up. It says, \"It matters not how strait the gate, how charged with punishments the scroll, I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.\" And the last two lines that, \"I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul,\" is literally my Twitter thing, right? Or X. com, whatever we're calling it now. [inaudible 01:35:33]. It's such a powerful reminder of freedom or responsibility.\n\nLenny (01:35:38):\nAnd also I think, I love... This touches on something you also shared earlier of just agency over your fate. You are responsible. Even though you may not be responsible for what happened, you're responsible for what you're going to do about it. And I think that for being a great PM, that's such an important thing. It's so easy just to complain and like, \"Oh, we don't have our resources. We keep changing plans. We're losing engineers.\" But the more you feel like you are in control and you're responsible for what's going on, the better things end up going.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:36:07):\nAbsolutely.\n\nLenny (01:36:08):\nAnd that's a beautiful way of putting it. Amazing. And we'll link to that poem. Final question. Before we started recording, you told me you'd do DJing on the side or I don't know, maybe full-time. I don't know. I guess, one, where can folks find your DJ sets if you put them out? And then two, I guess, any advice for someone that wants to start getting into DJ Ness, what could they do to start going down that path to learn how to do it?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:36:30):\nIt goes back to this, \"I'm the master of my fate, I'm a captain of my soul.\" One thing I love and one of the things that's brought me to YouTube is just a power of what you can learn and learning through YouTube. And so I used to DJ initially, 15 years ago when it was still vinyl and then I quit because I was like, it's either I do design at the time, because I started as an engineer, then I was a designer. Either I do design or I do DJing, and I stopped.\n\n(01:36:58):\nAnd then a year ago, my Burning Man Camp was like, we need a DJ. So I needed to go DJ at Burning Man. And so I went on YouTube and I just followed all these DJ creators. The game has changed, I will say that. And so I have my mixtapes on YouTube. So if you look for my name, Ebi Atawodi. My handles, it's always Ebi Atawodi, my name and my surname. You'll see all kinds of videos, but you'll also see my mixtapes and I name each mixtape after a sauce. So one's called Sriracha, the last one was called Mango Chutney, and there's one coming up soon that I'm calling Jerk.\n\nLenny (01:37:39):\nAmazing. And then, yeah, I guess is your advice. Then just watch YouTube. Go look for people teaching you how to DJ on YouTube and...\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:37:46):\nGo watch people and I cannot underestimate the power of those 10,000 hours to become an expert. So just DJ. I got this really cheap controller. It costs me 300 bucks, but you can actually do it on an iPad. And even when I'm on flights, I'll do a full mix on my iPad with the app. I use this app called DJ Pro AI, and it's like, I don't know, 30 bucks or something. And I just DJ because I'm training, right? I'm just training and it's for me. Then I'll come home and I'll do it with the actual controller and record it, and put it on YouTube for fun.\n\nLenny (01:38:24):\nSo cool. Ebi, I'm in the Ebi fan club. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to follow up on anything and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:38:35):\nI'm on pretty much every social platform. My handle is Ebi Atawodi, my name. Work stuff, LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram, all of it. And this is maybe a bigger one. I think we will all be more useful to ourselves if we actually spend a lot more time being a bit more present and mindful. The world will be a better place if people just went into themselves and were a bit more mindful. I'm very big into meditation, so I think that's why I ask for everyone, be more mindful.\n\nLenny (01:39:13):\nYou're reminding me to breathe. Amazing. What a beautiful way to end it. Ebi, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEbi Atawodi (01:39:19):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:39:23):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

You're completely bootstrapped, haven't raised any VC money. I don't believe anyone has ever done this before.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:00:10):\nWe basically never wanted to play the Silicon Valley game. I always thought it was ridiculous. I used to work at a bunch of the big tech companies and I always felt that we could fire 90% of the people and we would move faster because the best people wouldn't have all these distractions. So when we start Surge, we wanted to build it completely differently with a super small, super elite team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nYou guys are by far the most successful data company out there.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:00:29):\nWe essentially teach AI models what's good and what's bad. People don't understand what quality even means in this space. They think you could just throw bodies at a problem and get good data, that's completely wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:40):\nTo a regular person, it doesn't feel like these models are getting that much smarter constantly.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:00:43):\nOver the past year, I've realized that the values that the companies have will shape the model. I was asking Claude to help me drop an email the other day. And after 30 minutes, yeah, I think it really crafted me the perfect email and I sent it. But then I realized that I spent 30 minutes doing something that didn't matter at all. If you could choose the perfect model behavior, which model would you want? Do you want a model that says, \"You're absolutely right. There are definitely 20 more ways to improve this email,\" and it continues for 50 more iterations or do you want a model that's optimizing for your time and productivity and just says, \"No. You need to stop. Your email's great. Just send it and move on\"?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:14):\nYou have this hot take that a lot of these labs are pushing AGI in the wrong direction.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:01:18):\nI'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, we are optimizing for AI slop instead. But we're optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at a grocery store. We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:35):\nToday, my guest is Edwin Chan, founder and CEO of Surge AI. Edwin is an extraordinary CEO and Surge is an extraordinary company. They're the leading AI data company, powering training at every frontier AI lab. They're also the fastest company to ever hit $1 billion in revenue in just four years after launch with fewer than 100 people and also completely bootstrapped. They've never raised a dollar in VC money, they've also been profitable from day one.\n\n(00:02:05):\nAs you'll hear in this conversation, Edwin has a very different take on how to build an important company, and how to build AI that is truly good and useful to humanity. I absolutely love this conversation and I learned a ton. I'm really excited for you to hear it. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

With that, I bring you Edwin Chen after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:02:53):\nMy podcast guests tonight love talking about craft, and taste, and agency, and product market fit. You know what we don't love talking about? SOC 2. That's where Vanta comes in. Vanta helps companies of all sizes get compliant fast and stay that way with industry-leading AI, automation, and continuous monitoring. Whether you're a startup tackling your first SOC 2 or ISO 27001 or an enterprise managing vendor risk, Vanta's trust management platform makes it quicker, easier, and more scalable. Vanta also helps you complete security questionnaires up to five times faster so that you can win bigger deals sooner.\n\n(00:03:29):\nThe result, according to a recent IDC study, Vanta customers slashed over $500,000 a year and are three times more productive. Establishing trust isn't optional. Vanta makes it automatic. Get $1,000 off at vanta.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:48):\nHere's a puzzle for you. What do OpenAI, Cursor, Perplexity, Vercel, Plad, and hundreds of other winning companies have in common? The answer is they're all powered by today's sponsor, WorkOS. If you're building software for enterprises, you've probably felt the pain of integrating single sign-on, Skim, RBAC, audit logs, and other features required by big customers. WorkOS turns those deal blockers into drop-in APIs with a modern developer platform built specifically for B2B SaaS.\n\n(00:04:17):\nWhether you're a seed stage startup trying to land your first enterprise customer or a unicorn expanding globally, WorkOS is the fastest path to becoming enterprise-ready and unlocking growth. They're essentially Stripe for enterprise features.\n\n(00:04:30):\nVisit workos.com to get started or just hit up their Slack support where they have real engineers in there who answer your questions superfast. WorkOS allows you to build like the best with delightful APIs, comprehensive docs, and a smooth developer experience. Go to workos.com to make your app enterprise ready today.\n\n(00:04:51):\nEdwin, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:04:55):\nThanks so much for having me. I'm super excited.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:58):\nI want to start with just how absurd what you've achieved is. A lot of people and a lot of companies talk about scaling massive businesses with very few people as a result of AI, and you guys have done this in a way that is unprecedented. You guys hit a billion in revenue in less than four years with less than 60, around 60 to 70 people, you're completely bootstrapped, haven't raised any VC money, I don't believe anyone has ever done this before, so you guys are actually achieving the dream of what people are describing will happen with AI. I'm curious just, do you think this will happen more and more as a result of AI? And also just where has AI most helped you find leverage to be able to do this?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:05:40):\nYeah, so we hit over a billion of revenue last year with under 100 people. And I think we're going to see companies with even crazier ratios, like 100 billion per employee in the next few years. AI is just going to get better and better and make things more efficient so that ratio just becomes inevitable.\n\n(00:05:57):\nI used to work at a bunch of the big tech companies and I always felt that we could fire 90% of people and we would move faster because the best people wouldn't have all these distractions. And so when we started Surge, we wanted to build it completely differently with a super small, super elite team, and yeah, what's crazy is that we actually succeeded. And so I think two things are colliding.\n\n(00:06:18):\nOne is that people are realizing that you don't have to build giant organizations in order to win.\n\n(00:06:23):\nAnd two, yeah, all these efficiencies from AI. And they're just going to lead to a really amazing time in company building.\n\n(00:06:29):\nThe thing I'm excited about is that the types of companies are going to change too. It won't just be that they're smaller, we're going to see fundamentally different companies emerging. If you think about it, fewer employees means less capital. Less capital means you don't need a raise. So instead of companies started by founders who are great at pitching and great at hyping, you'll get founders who are really great at technology and product.\n\n(00:06:51):\nAnd instead of products optimized for revenue and what VCs want to see, you'll get more interesting ones built by these tiny obsessed teams. So people building things they actually care about, real technology and real innovation. So I'm actually really hoping that the slick on [inaudible 00:07:06], it'll go back to being updates for hackers again.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:08):\nYou guys have done a lot of things in a very contrarian way, and one was actually just not being on LinkedIn, posting viral posts, not on Twitter, constantly promoting Surge. I think most people hadn't heard of Surge until just recently, and then you just came out, and like, okay, the fastest growing company at a billion dollars. Why would you do that? I imagine that was very intentional.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:07:27):\nWe basically never wanted to play the Silicon Valley game. And like I always thought it was ridiculous. What did you dream of doing when you were a kid? Was it building a company from scratch yourself and getting in the weeds of your code and your product every day? Or was it explaining all your decisions to VCs and getting on this giant PR and fundraising hamster wheel? And it definitely made things more difficult for us, because yeah, when you fundraise, you just naturally get part of this kind of Silicon Valley industrial complex where people will, your VCs will tweet about you. You'll get the tech runs outlines, you'll get announced in all of the newspapers because you raised at this massive valuation. And so it made things more difficult us because the only way we were going to succeed was by building a 10 times better product and getting word of mouth from researchers. But I think it also meant that our customers were people who really understood data and really cared about it.\n\n(00:08:21):\nI always thought it was really important for us to have early customers who were really aligned with what we were building, and who really cared about having really high quality data, and really understood how that data would make their AI models so much better because they were the ones helping us. They were the ones giving us feedback on what we're producing. And so just having that kind of very close mission alignment with our customers actually helped us early on. So these are people who basically just buying our product because they knew how different it was and because it was helping them rather than because they saw something in that current [inaudible 00:08:52]. So it made things harder for us, but I think in a really good way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:55):\nIt's such an empowering story to hear this journey for founders that they don't need to be on Twitter all day promoting what they're doing. They don't have to raise money. They can just kind of go heads down and build, so I love so much about the story of Surge. For people that don't know what Surge does, just to give us a quick explanation of what Surge is.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:09:16):\nWe essentially teach AI models what's good and what's bad. So we train them using human data, and there's a lot of different products that we have, like SFT, RHF, rubrics, verifiers, RL environments, and so on and so on, and then we also measure how well they're progressing. So essentially we're a data company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:36):\nWhat you always talk about is the quality has been the big reason you guys have been so successful, the quality of the data. What does it take to create higher quality data? What do you all do differently? What are people missing?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:09:47):\nI think most people don't understand what quality even means in this space. They think you could just throw bodies at a problem and get good data and that's completely wrong. Let me give you an example.\n\n(00:09:59):\nSo imagine you wanted to train a model to write an eight line poem about the moon. What makes it a good, high-quality poem? If you don't think deeply about quality, you'll be like, \"Is this a poem? Does it contain eight lines? Does it contain the word, moon?\" You check all of these boxes, and if so, sure. Yeah, you say it's a great problem. But that's completely different from what we want. We are looking for a Nobel Prize-winning poetry. Is this poetry unique? Is it full of subtle imagery? Does it surprise you and target your heart? Does it teach you something about the nature of moonlight? Does it playthrough emotions? And does it make you think? That's what we are thinking about when we think about high quality poem.\n\n(00:10:34):\nSo it might be like a haiku about moonlight on water. It might use internal rhyme and meter. There are a thousand ways to write a poem about the moon, and in each one, gives you all these different insights into language, and imagery, and human expression, and I think thinking about quality in this way is really hard, it's hard to measure. It's really subjective, and complex, and rich. And it sets a really high bar. And so we have to build all of this technology in order to measure it, like thousands of signals on all of our workers, thousands of signals on every project, every task. We know at the end of the day, if you are good at writing poetry versus good at writing essays versus great at writing technical documentation. And so we have to gather all these signals on what your background is, what your expertise is, and not just that. Like how you're actually performing when you're writing all these things, and we use those signals to inform whether or not you are good [inaudible 00:11:23] for these projects, and whether or not you are improving the models.\n\n(00:11:26):\nAnd it's really hard, and so to build all this technology to measure it, but I think that's exactly what we want AI to do, and so we have these really deep notions about quality that we're always trying to try and achieve.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:37):\nSo what I'm hearing is there's kind of just going much deeper in understanding what quality is within the verticals that you are selling data around. And is this like a person you hire that is incredibly talented at poetry plus evals that they, I guess, help write, that tell them that this is great? What's the mechanics of that?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:11:57):\nThe way it works is we essentially gather thousands of signals about everything that you're doing when you're working on platform. So we are looking at your keyboard strokes. We are looking how fast you answer things. We are using reviews, we are using code standards, we are using... We're training models ourselves all on the outputs that you create, and then we're seeing whether they improve the model's performance.\n\n(00:12:23):\nAnd so in a very similar way to how Google search, like when Google search is trying to determine what is a good webpage, there's almost two aspects of it. One is you want to remove all of the worst of the worst webpages. So you want to remove all the spam, all the just low quality content, all the pages that don't load, and so it's almost like a content moderation problem. You just want to remove the worst of the worst.\n\n(00:12:44):\nBut then you also want to discover the best of the best. Okay, like this is the best webpage or just the best person for this job. They are not just somebody who writes the equivalent of high school level poetry. Again, they're not just [inaudible 00:12:57] writing poetry that checks all these boxes, checks all of these explicit instructions, but rather, yeah, they're writing poetry that makes you emotional. And so we have all these signals as well that, again, completely differently from moving the worst of the worst, we are finding the best of the best. And so we have all these signals...\n\n(00:13:12):\nAgain, just like Google Search uses all these signals that feeds them into their ML algorithms and uses and predicts certain types of things, we do the same with all of our workers and all of our tasks in all of our projects. And so it's almost like a complicated machine learning problem at the end of the day, and that's how it works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):\nThat is incredibly interesting.\n\n(00:13:31):\nI want to ask you about something I've been very curious about over the past couple years. If you look at Claude, it's been so much better at coding and at writing than any other model for so long. And it's really surprising just how long it took other companies to catch up. Considering just how much economic value there is there, just like every AI coding product sat on top of Claude because it was so good Claude code and writing also. What is it that made it so much better? Is it just the quality of the data they trained on or is there something else?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:13:59):\nI think there are multiple parts to it. So a big part of it certainly is the data. I think people don't realize that there's almost like this infinite amount of choices that all the frontier labs are deciding between when they're choosing what data goes into their models. It's like, okay, are you purely using human data? Are you gathering the human data in X, Y, Z way? When you are gathering the human data, what exactly are you asking the people who are creating it to create for you?\n\n(00:14:30):\nFor example, in the coding realm, maybe you care more about front end coding versus back end coding. Maybe when you're doing front end coding, you care a lot about the visual design of the front end applications that you're creating, or maybe you don't care about it so much and you care more about, I don't know, the deficiency of it or the pure correctness over that visual design.\n\n(00:14:47):\nAnd then other questions like, okay, are you carrying [inaudible 00:14:49] how much synthetic data are we throwing into the mix? How much do you care about these 20 different benchmarks?\"\n\n(00:14:55):\nSome companies, they see these benchmarks and they're like, \"Okay, for PR purposes, even though we don't think that these academic benchmarks matter all that much, maybe we just need to optimize for them anyways because our marketing team needs to show certain progress on certain standard evaluations that every other company talks about, and if we don't show good performance here, it's going to be bad for us even if ignoring these academic benchmarks makes us better at the real tasks.\"\n\n(00:15:21):\nOther companies are going to be principled and be like, \"Okay, yeah, no, I don't care about marketing. I just care about how my model performs on these real world tasks at the end of the day, and so I'm going to optimize for that instead.\"\n\n(00:15:31):\nAnd it's almost like there's a trade-off between all of these different things, and there's like a...\n\n(00:15:36):\nOne of the things I often think about is that there's a... It's almost like there's an art to post training. It's not purely a science. When you are deciding what kind of model you're trying to create and what it's good at, there's this notion of taste and sophistication, like, \"Okay, do I think that these...\"\n\n(00:15:57):\nSo going back to the example of how good the model is at visual design. I'm like, \"Okay, maybe you have a different notion of visual design than what I do. Maybe you care more about minimalism, and you care more about, I don't know, 3D animations than I do. And maybe this other person prefers things that look a little bit more broke.\" And there's all these notions of taste sophistication that you have to decide between when you're designing your post training mix, and so that matters as well.\n\n(00:16:21):\nSo long story short, I think there's all these different factors, and certainly the data is a big part of it, but it's also like what is the objective function that you're trying to optimize your model towards?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:30):\nThat is so interesting. The taste of the person leading this work will inform what data they ask for, what data they feed it. But it's wild it shows the value of great data. Anthropic got so much growth and win from essentially better data.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:16:49):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:50):\nAnd I could see why companies like yours are growing so fast. There's just so much... And that's just one vertical. That's just coding, and then there's probably a similar area for writing. I love that it's... It's interesting that AI, it feels like this artificial computer binary thing, but it's like taste. Human judgment is still such a key factor in these things being successful.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:17:09):\nYep, exactly. Again, going back to the example I said earlier, certain companies, if you ask them what is good poem, they will simply robotically check off all of these instructions on our list.\n\n(00:17:20):\nBut again, I don't think that makes for good poetry, so certain frontier labs, the ones with more taste in sophistication, they will realize that it doesn't reduce to this six set of checkboxes and they'll consider all of these kind of implicit, very subtle qualities instead, and I think that's what makes them better at this at the end of the day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:38):\nYou mentioned benchmarks. This is something a lot of people worry about is there's all these models that are always... Basically, it feels like every model is better than humans at every STEM field at this point, but to a regular person, it doesn't feel like these models are getting that much smarter constantly. What's your just sense of how much you trust benchmarks and just how correlated those are with actual AI advancements?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:18:00):\nYeah, so I don't trust the benchmarks at all. And I think that's for two reasons. So one is I think a lot of people don't realize, even researchers within the community, they don't realize that the benchmarks themselves are often honestly just wrong. They have wrong answers. They're full of all this kind of messiness and people trust... Long as for the popular ones, people have maybe realized this to some extent, but the vast majority just have all these flaws that people don't realize. So that's one part of it.\n\n(00:18:30):\nAnd the other part of it is these benchmarks at the end of the day, they often have well-defined objective answers that make them very easy for models to hill-climb on in a way that's very different from the messiness and ambiguity of the real world.\n\n(00:18:48):\nI think one thing that I often say is that it's kind of crazy that these models can win IMO gold medals, but they still have trouble parsing PDFs. And that's because, yeah, even though IMO gold medals seem hard to the average person, yeah, they are hard at the end of the day. But they have this notion of objectivity that, okay, yeah, parsing a PDF sometimes doesn't have. And so it's easier for the frontier labs to hill-climb on all of these than to solve all these mess ambiguous problems in the real world. So I think there's a lack of direct correlation there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:17):\nIt's so interesting the way you described it is hitting these benchmarks is kind of like a marketing piece. When you launch, say Gemini 3 just launched, and it's like, cool. Number one with all these benchmarks. Is that what happens? They just kind of train their models to get good at these very specific things?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:19:31):\nYeah, so there's, again, maybe two parts to this. So one is, sometimes, yeah, these benchmarks, they accidentally leak in certain ways or the frontier labs will tweak the way they evaluate their models on these benchmarks. They'll tweak your system prompt or they'll tweak the number of times they run their model, and so on and so on in a way that games these benchmarks.\n\n(00:19:54):\nThe other part of it though is it's like by optimizing for the benchmark instead of optimizing for the real world, you will just naturally climb on the benchmark and, yeah, it's basically another form of gaming it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:09):\nKnowing that with that in mind, how do you get a sense of if we're heading towards AGI, how do you measure progress?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:20:15):\nYes, so the way we really care about measuring model progress is by running all these human evaluations.\n\n(00:20:21):\nSo for example, what we do is, yeah, we will take Gore human annotators, and we'll ask them, \"Okay, go have a conversational model.\" And maybe you're having this conversation with the model across all of these different topics. So you are a Nobel Prize winning physicist. So you go have a conversation about pushing different tier of your own research. You are a teacher and you're trying to create lesson plans for your students, so go talk to the model about these things. Or you're a coder and you're working at one of these big tech companies, and you have these problems every day, so go talk to the model and see how much it helps you.\n\n(00:20:57):\nAnd because or searchers or annotators, they are experts at the top of their fields, and they are not just giving your responses, they're actually working through the responses deeply themselves, they are... Yeah, they're going to evaluate the code that it write. They're going to double check the physics equations that it writes. They're going to evaluate the models in a very deep way, so they're going to pay attention to accuracy and instruction following, all these things that casual users don't when you suddenly get a popup on your ChatGPT response asking you to compare these two different responses. People like that, they're not evaluating models deeply, they're just vibing and picking whatever response looks flashiest or [inaudible 00:21:38] are looking closely at responses and evaluating them for all of these different dimensions, and so I think that's a much better approach than these benchmarks or these random outline AV tests.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:49):\nAgain, I love just how central humans continue to be in all this work that we're not totally done yet. Is there going to be a point where we don't need these people anymore, that AI is so smart that, \"Okay, we're good. We got everything out of your heads\"?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:22:00):\nYeah, I think that will not happen until we've reached AGI. It's almost like by definition, if we haven't reached AGI yet, then there's more for the models to learn from, and so, yeah, I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:12):\nOkay, cool. So more reason to stress about AGI. \"We don't need these folks anymore.\"\n\n(00:22:18):\nI can't not ask just... People that work closely with this stuff, I'm always just curious. What's your AGI timelines? How far do you think we are from this? Do you think we're in like a couple years or is it like decades?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:22:28):\nSo I'm certainly on the longer time horizon front. I think people don't realize that there's a big difference between moving from 80% performance to 90% performance to 99% performance to 99.9% performance, and so on, and so on. And so in my head, I probably bet that within the next one or two years, yeah, the models are going to automate 80% of the average LL6 software engineer's job. It's going to take another few years to move to 90%, and another fewer to 99%, and so on, and so on. So I think we're closer to a decade or decades away than [inaudible 00:23:03].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):\nYou have this hot take that a lot of these labs are kind of pushing AGI in the wrong direction and this is based on your work at Twitter, and Google, and Facebook. Can you just talk about that?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:23:14):\nI'm worried that instead of building AI that will actually advance us as a species, curing cancer, solving poverty, understand the universe, all these big grand questions, we are optimizing for AI slop instead. We're basically teaching our models to chase dopamine instead of truth. And I think this relates to what we're talking about regarding these benchmarks. So let me give you a couple examples.\n\n(00:23:35):\nSo right now, the industry is played by these terrible databoards like LLM Arena. It's this popular online leaderboard where random people from around the world vote on which AI response is better. But the thing is, like I was saying earlier, they're not carefully reading or fact-checking. They're skimming these responses for two seconds and picking whatever looks flashiest.\n\n(00:23:53):\nSo a model can hallucinate everything. It can completely hallucinate. But it will look impressive because it has crazy emojis, and boating, and markdown headers, and all these superficial things that don't matter at all, but it catch your attention. And these LLM-reading users love it. It's literally optimizing your models for the types of people who buy tabloids at the grocery store. We've seen this [inaudible 00:24:15] data ourselves. The easiest way to climb LLM Arena, it's adding crazy boating. It's doubling the number of emojis. It's tripling the length of your model responses, even if your model starts hallucinating and getting the answer completely wrong.\n\n(00:24:26):\nAnd the problem is, again, because all of these frontier labs, they kind of have to pay attention to PR because their sales team, when they're trying to sell to all these enterprise customers, those enterprise customers will say, \"Oh, well, but your model's only number five on LLM Arena, so why should I buy it?\" They have to, in some sense, pay attention to these leaderboards, and so what their researchers [inaudible 00:24:47] tell us is like they'll say, \"The only way I'm going to get promoted at the end of the year is if I climb this leaderboard, even though I know that climbing it is probably going to make my model worse and accuracy [inaudible 00:24:57] following.\" So I think there's all these negative incentives that are pushing work in the wrong direction.\n\n(00:25:03):\nI'm also worried about this trend towards optimizing AI for engagement. I used to work on social media. And every time we optimize for engagement, terrible things happened. You'd get clickbait and pictures of bikinis and bigfoot and horrifying skin diseases just filling your feeds. And I think I worry that the same thing's happening with AI. If you think about all the sycophancy issues with ChatGPT, \"Oh, you're absolutely right. What an amazing question,\" the easiest way to hook users is to tell them how amazing they are. And so these models, they constantly tell you you're a genius. They'll feed into your delusions and conspiracy theories. They'll pull you down these rabbit holes because Silicon Valley loves maximizing time spent and just increasing the number of conversations you're having with it. And so yeah, companies are spending all the time hacking these leaderboards and benchmarks, and the scores are going up, but I think it actually masks up the models with the best scores, they are often the worst or just have all these fundamental failures. So I think I'm really worried that all of these negative ascendants are pushing AGI into the wrong direction.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:03):\nSo what I'm hearing is AGI is being slowed down by these, basically the wrong objective function, these labs paying attention to the wrong basically benchmarks and evals.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:26:11):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:12):\nI know you probably can't play favorites since you work with all the labs. Is there anyone doing better at this and maybe kind of realizing this is the wrong direction?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:26:21):\nI would say I've always been very impressed by Anthropic. I think Anthropic takes a very principled view about what they do and don't care about and how they want their models to behave in a way that feels a lot more principle to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:38):\nInteresting.\n\n(00:26:39):\nAre there any other big mistakes you think labs are making just that are kind of slowing things down or heading in the wrong direction? Where we've heard just chasing benchmarks, this engagement focus, is there anything else you're seeing of just like, \"Okay, we got to work on this because it'll speed everything up\"?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:26:55):\nI think there is a question of what products they're building and whether those products themselves are something that kind of help or hurt humanity. I think a lot about Sora and...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:07):\nI was thinking that's what you're imagining.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:27:10):\nYeah, what it entails, and so it's kind of interesting. It's like which companies would build Sora and which wouldn't?\n\n(00:27:17):\nAnd I think that answer to that... Well, I don't know if answer is myself. I have an idea in my head, but I think the answer to that question maybe reveals certain things about what kinds of AI models those companies want to build and what direction and what future they want to achieve, yeah, so I think about that a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:37):\nThe steel man argument there is, it's like fun, people want it, it'll help them generate revenue to grow this thing and build better models, it'll train data in an interesting way, it's also just really fun.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:27:51):\nYeah. I think it's almost like, do you care about how you get there? And in the same way, so I made this tabloid analogy earlier, but would you sell tabloids in order to fund, I don't know, some other newspaper?\n\n(00:28:09):\nSure, like in some sense, if you don't care about the path, then you'll just do whatever it takes, but it's possible that it has negative consequences in of itself that will harm the long-term direction of what you're trying to achieve, and maybe it'll distract you from all the more important things, so yeah, I think that the path you take matters a lot as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:33):\nAlong these lines, you talked a bunch about this of just Silicon Valley and kind of the downsides of raising a lot of money being in the echo chamber. What do you call it, the Silicon Valley machine? You talk about how it's hard to build important companies in this way and that you might actually be much more successful if you're not going down the VC path. Can you just talk about what you've seen in that experience and your advice essentially to founders, because they're always hearing? Raise money from fancy VCs, move to Silicon Valley, what's kind of the countertake?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:29:02):\nYes. So I've always really hated a lot of the Silicon Valley mantras. The standard playbook is to get product market fit by pivoting every two weeks. And to chase growth and chase engagement with all of these dark patterns and to blitz scale by hiring as fast as possible. And I've always disagreed.\n\n(00:29:20):\nSo yeah, I would say don't pivot. Don't put scale. Don't hire that Stanford grad who simply wants to add a hot company to your resume, just build the one thing only you could build, a thing that wouldn't exist without the insight and expertise that only you have.\n\n(00:29:32):\nAnd you see these buy to [inaudible 00:29:34] companies everywhere now. Some founder who was doing crypto in 2020, and then pivoted to NFTs in 2022, and now they're an AI company. There's no consistency, there's no mission, they're just chasing valuations. And I've always hated this because Silicon Valley loves to score on Wall Street for focusing on money. But honestly, most of the Silicon Valley's chasing the same thing. And so we stayed focused on our mission from day one, pushing that frontier of high quality complex data, and I've always loved that because I think startups...\n\n(00:30:03):\nI have this very romantic notion of startups. Startups are supposed to be a way of taking big risks to build something that you really believe in. But if you're constantly pivoting, you're not taking any risks. You're just trying to make a quick buck. And if you fail because the market isn't ready yet, I actually think that's way better. At least you took a swing at something deep, and novel, and hard instead of pivoting into another LLM wrapper company. So yeah, I think the only way you build something that matters that's going to change the world is if you find a big idea you believe in and you say no to everything else.\n\n(00:30:30):\nSo you don't keep on pivoting when it gets hard, you don't hire a team of 10 product managers because that's what every other cookie cutter startup does, you just keep building that one company that wouldn't exist without you. And I think there are a lot of people in Silicon Valley now who are sick of all the grift, who want to work on big things that matter with people who actually care, and I'm hoping that that would be the future of how we go with technology.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:52):\nI'm actually working on a post right now with Terrence Rohan, this VC that I really like to work with, and we interviewed five people who picked really successful generational companies early and joined them as really early employees. They joined OpenAI before anyone thought it was awesome, Stripe before anyone knew was awesome, and so we're looking for patterns of how people find these generational companies before anyone else, and it aligns exactly what you described, which is ambition. They have a wild ambition with what they want to achieve. They're not, as you said, just kind of looking around for product market fit no matter what ends up being, and so I love that what you described very much aligns with what we're seeing there.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:31:33):\nYeah, I absolutely think that you have to have huge ambitions, and you have to have a huge belief in your idea that's going to change the world, and you have to be willing to double down and keep on doing whatever it takes to make it happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:44):\nI love how counter your narrative is to so many of the things people hear, and so I love that we're doing this. I love that we're sharing this story.\n\n(00:31:51):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally use Coda every single day to manage my podcast and also to manage my community. It's where I put the questions that I plan to ask every guest that's coming on the podcast, it's where I put my community resources, it's how I manage my workflows. Here's how Coda can help you.\n\n(00:32:08):\nImagine starting a project at work. And your vision is clear, you know exactly who's doing what, and where to find the data that you need to do your part. In fact, you don't have to waste time searching for anything because everything your team needs from project trackers and OKRs, the documents and spreadsheets lives in one tab all in Coda.\n\n(00:32:26):\nWith Coda's collaborative all in one workspace, you get the flexibility of docs, the structure of spreadsheets, the power of applications, and the intelligence of AI all in one easy to organize tab. Like I mentioned earlier, I use Coda every single day. And more than 50,000 teams trust Coda to keep them more aligned and focused. If you're a startup team looking to increase alignment and agility, Coda can help you move from planning to execution in record time.\n\n(00:32:52):\nTo try it for yourself, go to coda.io/lenny today and get six months free of the team planned for startups. That's coda.io/lenny to get started for free and get six months of the team plan, coda.io/lenny.\n\n(00:33:07):\nSlightly different direction, but something else that was maybe a counter narrative. I imagine you watched the Dwarkesh and Richard Sutton podcast episode, and even if you didn't, they basically had this conversation, Richard Sutton. He was a famous AI researcher, had this whole bitter lesson meme, and he talked about how LLMs almost are kind of a dead end, and he thinks we're going to really plateau around LLMs because of the way they learn.\n\n(00:33:35):\nWhat's your take there? Do you think LLMs will get us to AGI or beyond, or do you think there's going to be something new or a big breakthrough that needs to get us there?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:33:42):\nI'm in the camp where I do believe that something new will be needed. The way I think about it is when I think about training AI, I take a very... I don't know if I would say biological point of view. But I believe that in the same way that there's a million different ways that humans learn, we need to build models that can mimic all of those ways as well. And maybe they'll have a different distribution of the focuses that they have. I know that it'll be different for humans, so maybe they have a different distribution, but we want to be able to mimic their learning abilities of humans and make sure that we have the algorithms and the data for models to learn in the same way. And so to the extent that LLMs have different ways of learning from humans, then yeah, I think something new will be needed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:32):\nThis connects to reinforcement learning. This is something that you're big on and something I'm hearing more and more is just becoming a big deal in the world of post-training. Can you just help people understand what is reinforcement learning and reinforcement learning environments, and why they're going to be more and more important in the future?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:34:49):\nReinforcement learning is essentially training your model to reach a certain reward. And let me explain what an RL environment is. An RL environment is essentially a simulation of real world. So think of it like building a video game with a fully fleshed out universe. Every character has a real story, every business has tools and data you can call, and you have all these different entities interacting with each other.\n\n(00:35:12):\nSo for example, we might build a world where you have a startup with Gmail messages, and Slack threads, and Jira tickets, and GitHub PRs, and a whole code base. And then suddenly AWS goes down. And Slack goes down. And so, \"Okay. Model, well, what do you do?\" The model needs to figure it out.\n\n(00:35:29):\nSo we give them models tasks in these environments, we design interesting challenges for them, and then we run them to see how they perform. And then we teach them, we give them these rewards when they're doing a good job or a bad job.\n\n(00:35:40):\nAnd I think one of the interesting things is that these environments really showcase where models are weak at end-to-end tasks in real world. You have all these models that seem really smart on isolated benchmarks, they're good at single step tool calling. They're good at single step instruction following. But suddenly you dump them into these messy worlds where you have confusing Slack messages and tools they've never seen before, and they need to perform right actions and modify the [inaudible 00:36:06] and interact over longer time horizons where what they do in step one affects what they do in step 50. And that's very different from these kind of academic single step environments that they've been in before, and so the model just fails catastrophically in all these crazy ways.\n\n(00:36:21):\nSo I think these RL environments are going to be really interesting playgrounds for the models to learn from that will essentially be simulations and mimics in real world, and so they'll hopefully get better and better at real tasks compared to all these contrived environments.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:35):\nSo I'm trying to imagine what this looks like. Essentially, it's like a virtual machine with, I don't know, a browser or a spreadsheet or something in it with like, I don't know, surge.com. Is that your website, surge.com? Let's make sure we get that right.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:36:49):\nSo we are actually surgehq.ai.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):\nSurgehq.ai. Check it out. We're hiring it, I imagine. Yes. Okay. So it's like, cool, here's surgehq.ai. Your job, here's your job as an agent, let's say, is to make sure it stays up. And then all of a sudden it goes down and the objective function is figure out why. Is that an example?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:37:12):\nYeah, so the objective function might be... Or the goal of the task might be, okay, go figure out why and fix it. And so the objective function might be, it might be passing a series of unit tests, it might be writing a document like maybe it's a retro containing certain information that matches exactly what happened, there's all these different rewards that we might give it that determine whether or not it's succeeding, and so the models, we're basically teaching the models to achieve that reward.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:38):\nSo essentially it's off and running. Here's your goal, figure out why the site went down and fix it. And it just starts trying stuff, we're using everything, all the intelligence it's got, it makes mistakes, you kind of help it along the way, reward it if it's doing the right sort of thing. And so what you're describing here is this is the next phase of models becoming smarter. More RL environments focused on very specific tasks that are economically valuable, I imagine.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:38:04):\nYeah, so just in the same way that there were all these different methods for models of learning in the past, originally we had SFT and RHF, and then we had rubrics and verifiers. This is the next stage, and it's not the case that the previous methods are obsolete, this is, again, just a different form of learning that compliments all the previous types, so it's just like a different skilled model not only to learn how to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:30):\nAnd so in this case, it's less some physics PhD sitting around talking to a model, correcting it, giving it evals of here's what the correct answer is, creating rubrics and things like that. More it's like this person now designing an environment. So another example I've heard is like a financial analyst. Just like, \"Here's an Excel spreadsheet, here's your goal, figure out our profit and loss,\" or whatever. And so this expert now, instead of just sitting around writing rubrics, they're designing this RL environment.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:38:56):\nYeah, exactly. So that financial analyst might create a spreadsheet, they may create certain tools that the model needs to call in order to help fill out that spreadsheet, like it might be, okay, the model needs to access Bloomberg terminal. It needs to learn how to use it. And it needs to learn how to use this calculator. And it needs to learn how to pour on this calculation. So it has all these tools that it has access to.\n\n(00:39:19):\nAnd then the reward might be... Okay, it's like maybe I will download that spreadsheet and I want to see, does cell B22 contain the correct profit and loss number? Or does tab number two contain this piece of information?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:37):\nAnd what's interesting, this is a lot closer to how humans learn. We just try stuff, figure out what's working and what's not. You talk about how trajectories are really important to this. It's not just here's the goal and here's the end, it's like every step along the way. Can you just talk about what trajectories are and why that's important to this?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:39:55):\nI think one of the things that people don't realize is that sometimes even though the model reaches the correct answer, it does so in all these crazy ways. So it may have in the intermediate trajectory, it may have tried 50 different times and failed, but eventually it just kind of randomly lands on a correct number. Or maybe it is...\n\n(00:40:20):\nSometimes it just does things very inefficiently or it almost reward-hacks a way to get at the correct answer, and so I think paying attention to the directory is actually really important. And I think it's also really important because some of these trajectories can be very long. And so if all you're doing is checking whether or not the model reaches the final answer, it's like there's all this information about how the model behaved in the immediate step that's missing.\n\n(00:40:48):\nSometimes you want models to get to the correct answer by reflecting on what it did. Sometimes you want it to get it at the correct answer by just one-shotting it. And if you ignore all of that, it's just like teaching it... just missing a lot of the information that you could be teaching a model to do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:03):\nI love that. Yeah, it tries a bunch of stuff and eventually gets it right. You don't want it to learn this is the way to get there. There's often a much more efficient way of doing it.\n\n(00:41:11):\nYou mentioned all the kind of the steps we've taken along the journey of helping models get smarter. Since you've been so close to this for so long, I think this is going to be really helpful for people. What's kind of like been the steps along the way from the first post-training that has most helped models advance? Where do evals fit in the RL environments? Just like what's been the steps and now we're heading towards RL environments?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:41:33):\nOriginally, the way models started getting post-trained was purely through SFT. And-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:41):\nWhat does that stand for?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:41:42):\nSo SFT stands for supervised fine-tuning. So again, I think often in terms of these human analogies, and so SFT is a lot like mimicking a master and copying what they do.\n\n(00:41:54):\nAnd then RLHF became very dominant. And analogy there would be like sometimes you learn by writing 55 different essays and someone telling you which one they liked the most.\n\n(00:42:04):\nAnd then I think over the past year or so, rubrics and verifiers have become very important. And rubrics and verifiers are like learning by being graded and getting detailed feedback on where you went wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:17):\nAnd those are evals, another word for that?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:42:19):\nYeah. So I think evals often covers two terms. One is you are using the evaluations for training because you're evaluating whether or not the model did a good job, and when it does do a good job, you're rewarding it.\n\n(00:42:35):\nAnd then there's this other notion of evals where you're trying to measure the model's progress like, okay, yeah, I have five different candidate checkpoints and I want to pick the one that's best in order to release it to the public. So going to run all these evals on these five different checkpoints in order to decide which one is best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:51):\nAwesome.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:42:51):\nYeah, and now we have RL environments, so this is kind of like a hot new thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:55):\nAwesome. So what I love about this business journey is just there's always something new. There's always this like, okay. We're getting so good at just all this beautiful data for companies and now they need something completely different. Now we're setting up all these virtual machines for them and all these different use cases.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:43:08):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:08):\nAnd it feels like that's a big part of this industry you're in, it's just adapting to what labs are asking for.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:43:13):\nYeah. So I really do think that we are going to need to build a suite of products that reflect a million different ways that humans learn.\n\n(00:43:25):\nLike for example, think about becoming a great writer. You don't become great by memorizing a bunch of grammar rules. You become great by reading great books, and you practice writing, and you get feedback from your teachers and from the people who buy your books in a bookstore and leave reviews. And you notice what works and what doesn't. And you develop taste by being exposed to all of these masterpieces and also just terrible writing. So you learn through this endless cycle of practicing reflection, and each type of learning that you have, again, these are all very different methods of learning to become a great writer, so just in the same way that... it's a thousand different ways that the great writer becomes great, I think there's going to be a thousand different ways that AI [inaudible 00:44:05] need to learn.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:05):\nIt's so interesting this just ends up being just like humans in so many ways. It makes sense because in a sense, neural networks, deep learning is modeled after how humans have learned and how our brains operate, but it's interesting just to make them smarter. It's how do we come closer to how humans learn more and more?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:44:22):\nYeah, it's almost like maybe the end goal is just throwing you into the environment and just seeing how you evolve. But within that evolution, there's all these different sub-learning mechanisms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:34):\nYeah, which is kind of what we're doing now, so that's really interesting. This might be the last step until we hit AGI. Along these lines, something that's really unique to Surge that I learned is you guys have your own research team, which I think is pretty rare, talk about just why that's something you guys have invested in and what has come out of that investment.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:44:52):\nYeah, so I think that stems from my own background. My own background is as a researcher. And so I've always cared fundamentally about pushing the industry and pushing the research community and not just about revenue. And so I think what our research team does is a couple different things.\n\n(00:45:13):\nSo we almost have two types of researchers at our company. One is our forward-deployed researchers who are often working hand in hand with our customers to help them understand their models. So we will work very closely with the customers to help them understand, \"Okay, this is where your model is today. This is where you're lagging behind all the competitors, these are some ways that you could be improving in the future, given your goals, and we're going to design these data sets, these evaluation methods, these training techniques to make your models better.\" So this very collaborative notion of working with our customers being researched by themselves, just a little bit more focused on the data side, and working hand on hand with them to do whatever it takes to make them the best.\n\n(00:45:57):\nAnd then we also have our internal researchers. So our internal researchers are focused on slightly different things. So they are focused on building better benchmarks and better leaderboards.\n\n(00:46:07):\nSo I've talked a lot about how I worry that the leaderboards and benchmarks out there today are steering models in the wrong direction, so yeah, so the question is, how do we fix that? And so that's what our research team is focused focused really heavily on right now. So they're working a lot on that.\n\n(00:46:23):\nAnd they're also working on these other things like, \"Okay, we need to train our own models to see what types of data performs the best, what types of people perform the best.\" And so they're also working on all these training techniques and evaluation of our own data sets to improve our data operations and the internal data products that we have that determine what makes something good quality.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:46):\nIt's such a cool thing because I don't think basically the labs have researchers helping them advance AI. I imagine it's pretty rare for a company like yours to have researchers actually doing primary research on AI.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:46:59):\nYeah, I think it's just because it's something I've fundamentally always cared about. I often think about us more like a research lab than a startup because that is my goal. It's kind of funny, but I've always said I would rather be Terrence Tau than Warren Buffett, so that notion of creating research that pushes the frontier forward and not just getting some valuation, that's always been what drives me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:25):\nAnd it's worked out. That's the beautiful thing about this. You mentioned that you were hiring researchers, is there anything there you want to share folks you're looking for?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:47:32):\nSo we look for people who are just fundamentally interested in dataset all day. So types of people who could literally spend 10 hours digging through a dataset, and playing around with models, and thinking, \"Okay, yeah, this is where I think the model's failing,\" this is the kind of a behavior you want the model to have instead, and just this aspect of being very hands-on and thinking about the qualitative aspects of models and not just the quantitative parts. So again, it's like this aspect of being hands-on with data and not just caring about these kind of abstract algorithms.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:07):\nAwesome.\n\n(00:48:07):\nI want to ask a couple broad AI kind of market questions. What else do you think is coming in the next couple of years that people are maybe not thinking enough about or not expecting in terms of where AI is heading? What's going to matter?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:48:20):\nI think one of the things that's going to happen in the next few years is that the models are actually going to become increasingly differentiated because of the personalities and behaviors that the different labs have and the kind of objective functions that they are optimizing their models for. I think it's one thing I didn't appreciate a year or so ago.\n\n(00:48:45):\nA year or so ago, I thought that all of the AI models would essentially become very commoditized. They would all behave like each other, and sure, one of them might be slightly more intelligent in one way today, but sure, the other ones would catch up in the next few months. But I think over the past year, I've realized that the values that the companies have will shape the model.\n\n(00:49:09):\nSo let me give you an example. So I was asking Claude to help me draft an email the other day, and it went through 30 different versions. And after 30 minutes, yeah, I think it really crafted me the perfect email, and I sent it. But then I realized that I spent 30 minutes doing something that didn't matter at all. Sure, now I got the perfect email, but I spent 30 minutes doing something I wouldn't have worried at all before, and this email probably didn't even move the needle on anything anyways.\n\n(00:49:35):\nSo I think there's a deep question here, which is, if you could choose the perfect model behavior, which model would you want? Do you want a model that says, \"You're absolutely right. There are definitely 20 more ways to improve this email,\" and it continues for 50 more iterations. And it sucks up all your time and engagement. Or do you want a model that's optimizing for your time and productivity and just says, \"No, you need to stop. Your email's great. Just send it and move on with your day\"?\n\n(00:49:59):\nAnd again, just because... In the same way that there's like a kind of a fork in a road between how you could choose how your model behaves for this question, it's like for every other question that models have, the kind of behavior that you want will fundamentally affect it.\n\n(00:50:17):\nIt's almost like in the same way that when Google builds a search engine, it's very different from how Facebook would build a search engine, which is very different from how Apple would build a search engine. They all have their own principles and values and things that they're trying to achieve in the world that shape all the products that they're going to build. And in the same way, I think all the [inaudible 00:50:40] will start behaving very differently too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:41):\nThat is incredibly interesting. You already see that with Grok. It's got a very different personality and a very different approach to answering questions. And so what I'm hearing is you're going to see more of this differentiation.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:50:52):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:53):\nKind of another question along these lines, what do you think is most under-hyped in AI that you think maybe people aren't talking enough about that is really cool? And what do you think is over-hyped?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:51:04):\nSo I think one of the things that's under-hyped is the built-in products that all of the chatbots are going to start having. I've always been a huge fan of Claude's artifacts. And I think it just works really well. And actually the other day, I don't know if it's a new feature or not, but it asked me to help me create an email, and then it just created... So it didn't quite work because it didn't allow me to send the email. But what it created instead was like a little, I don't know what we call it, like a little box where I could click on it and it would just text someone that did this message. And I think that concept of taking artifacts to the next level where you just have these mini apps, mini UIs within the chatbots themselves, I feel like people aren't talking enough about that. So I think that that's one under-hyped area.\n\n(00:51:54):\nAnd in terms of over-hyped areas, I definitely think that vibe coding is over-hyped. I think people don't realize how much it's going to make your systems unmaintainable in the long-term and they simply dump this code into their code bases if this seems to work out right now, so I kind of worry about the future of coding. It's just going to keep on happening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:17):\nThese are amazing answers. On that first point, there's something I actually asked. I have the chief product officer of Anthropic and OpenAI, Kevin Weil and Mike Krieger on the podcast, and I asked them just like, \"As a product team, you have this gigabrain intelligence. How long do you even need product teams?\" You think this AI will just create the product for you. \"Here's what I want.\" It's like the next level of vibe coding. It's just like tell it, \"Here's what I want,\" and it's just building the product and involving the product as you're using it. And it feels like that's what you're describing is where we might be heading.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:52:48):\nYeah, I think there's a very powerful notion where it helps people just achieve their ideas in a much cooler way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:55):\nSomething we haven't gotten into that I think is really interesting is just the story of how you got to starting Surge. You have a really unique background. I always think about these... Brian Armstrong, the founder of Coinbase, once gave this talk that has really stuck with me where he kind of talked about how his very unique background allowed him to start Coinbase. He had a economics background, he had a cryptography experience, and then he was an engineer. And it's like the perfect Venn diagram for starting Coinbase, and I feel like you have a very similar story with Surge. Talk about that, your background there, and how that led to Surge.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:53:31):\nGoing way back, I was always fascinated by math and language when I was a kid. I went to MIT because it's obviously one of the best places for math and CS, but also because it's the home of Noam Chomsky. My dream in school was actually to find some underlying theory connecting all these different fields.\n\n(00:53:47):\nAnd then I became a researcher at Google, and Facebook, and Twitter, and I just kept running into the same problem over and over again. It was impossible to get the data that we needed to train our models. So I was always this huge believer in the need for high quality data, and then GPT-3 came out in 2020. And I realized that, yeah, if we wanted to take things to the next level and build models that could code, and use tools, and tell jokes, and write poetry, and solve [inaudible 00:54:12], and cure cancer, then yeah, we were going to need a completely new solution.\n\n(00:54:16):\nThe thing that always drove me crazy when I was at all these companies was we had a full power of the human mind in front of us, and all the data students out there were focused on really simple things like image labeling. So I wanted to build something focus on all these advanced, complex use cases instead that would really help us build our next generation models. So yeah, I think my background in kind of across math, and computer science, and linguistics really informed what I always wanted to do, and so I started Surge a month later with our one mission to basically build the use cases that I thought were going to be needed to push the frontier of AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:49):\nAnd you said a month later, a month later after what?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:54:52):\nAfter a GPT-3 launch in 2020.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:54):\nOh, okay. Wow. Okay. Yeah. A great decision.\n\n(00:54:57):\nWhat just kind of drives you at this point of... Other than just the epic success you're having, what keeps you motivated to keep building this and building something in this space?\n\nEdwin Chen (00:55:06):\nI think I'm a scientist at heart. I always thought I was going to become this math or CS professor and work on trying to understand the universe, and language, and the nature of communication. It's kind of funny, but I always had this fanciful dream where if aliens ever came to visit Earth and we need to figure out how to communicate with them, I wanted to be the one the government would call. And I'd use all this fancy math, and computer science, and linguistics to decipher it.\n\n(00:55:33):\nSo even today, what I love doing most is every time a new model is released, we'll actually do a really deep dive into the model itself. I'll play around with it, I'll run evals, I'll compare where it's improved, where it's arrest, I'll create this really deep dive analysis that we send our customers. And it's actually kind of funny because a lot of times we'll say it's from a data science team, but often it's actually just from me.\n\n(00:55:54):\nAnd I think I could do this all day. I have a very hard time being in meetings all day. I'm terrible at sales, I'm terrible at doing the typical CEO things that people expect you to do, but I love writing these analyses. I love jamming with our research team about what we're seeing, sometimes I'll be up until 3:00 AM just talking on the phone with somebody on the research team and [inaudible 00:56:12] model. So I love that I still get to be really hands-on, working on the data and the science all day. And I think what drives me is that I want Surge to play this critical role in the future of AI, which I think is also the future of humanity. We have these really unique perspectives on data, and language, and quality, and how to measure all of this, and how to ensure it's all going on the right path. And I think we're uniquely unconstrained by all of these influences that can sometimes steer companies in a negative direction.\n\n(00:56:41):\nLike what I was saying earlier, we built Surge a lot more like a research lab than a typical startup. So we care about curiosity and long-term incentives and intellectual rigor, and we don't care as much about quarterly metrics and what's going to look good in a [inaudible 00:56:56]. And so my goal is to take all these unique things about us as a company and use that to make sure that we're shaping AI in a way that's really beneficial for our species in the long term.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:06):\nWhat I'm realizing in this conversation is just how much influence you have and companies like yours have on where AI heads. The fact that you help labs understand where they have gaps and where they need to improve, and it's not just everyone looks at just like the heads of OpenAI and Anthropic and all these companies as they're the ones ushering in AI, but what I'm hearing here is you have a lot of influence on where things head too.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:57:30):\nYeah, I think there's this really powerful ecosystem where, honestly, people just don't know where models are headed and how they want to shape them yet and how they want humanity kind of like [inaudible 00:57:47] play a role in the future of all of this, and so I think there's a lot of opportunity to just continue shaping the discussion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:52):\nAlong that thread, I know you have a very strong thesis on just why this work matters to humanity and why this is so important, talk about that.\n\nEdwin Chen (00:58:01):\nI'll get a bit philosophical here, but I think the question itself is a bit philosophical, so bear with me. So the most straightforward way of thinking about what we do is we train and evaluate AI. But there's a deeper mission that I often think about, which is helping our customers think about their dream objective functions. Like yeah, what kind of model do they want their model to be? And once we help them do that, we'll help them train their model to reach their north star and we'll help them measure that progress. But it's really hard because objective functions are really rich and complex. It's kind of like the difference between having a kid and asking them, \"Okay, what test do you want to pass? Do you want them to get a high score on SAT and write a really good college essay?\" That's a simplistic version versus what kind of person do you want them to grow up to be? Will you be happy if they're happy no matter what they do or are you hoping they'll go to a good school and be financially successful?\n\n(00:58:50):\nAnd again, if you take that notion, it's like, okay, how do you define happiness? How do you measure whether they're happy? How do you measure whether they're financially successful? It's a lot harder than something measuring whether or not you're getting a high score on the SAT, and what we're doing is we want to help our customers reach, again, their dream north stars and figure out how to measure them. And so I talked about this example of what you want models to do when you're asking them to write 50 different evaluations. Do you just continue them for 50 more or do you just say, \"No, just move on [inaudible 00:59:25] because this is perfect enough.\" And the broader question is, are we building these systems that actually advance humanity? And if so how do we build the data sets to train towards that and measure it? Are we optimizing for all of these wrong things, just systems that suck up more and more of our time and make us lazier and lazier?\n\n(00:59:44):\nAnd yeah, I think it's really relevant to what we do because it's very hard and difficult to measure and define whether something is genuinely advancing humanity. It's very easy to measure all these proxies instead like clicks and likes. But I think that's why our work is so interesting. We want to work the hard, important metrics that require the hardest types of data and not just the easy ones. So I think one of the things I often say is you are your objective function. So we want the rich, complex, objective functions and not these simplistic proxies. And our job is to figure out how to get the data to match this.\n\n(01:00:12):\nSo yeah, we want data, we want metrics that measure whether AI is making your life richer. We want to train our systems this way. And we want tools that make us more curious and more creative, not just lazier. And it's hard because, yeah, humans are kind of inherently lazy so AI software deals are the easiest way to get engagement, make all your metrics fall up. So I think this question about choosing the right objective functions and making sure that we're optimizing towards them and not just these easy proxies is really important to our future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:37):\nWow. I love how what you're sharing here gives you so much more appreciation of the nuances of building AI, training AI, the work that you're doing.\n\n(01:00:45):\nFrom the outside, people could just look at Surge and companies in the space of, okay, cool. They're just creating all this data, feeding it to AI. But clearly there's so much to this that people don't realize, and I love knowing that you're at the head of this, that someone like you is thinking through this so deeply.\n\n(01:01:02):\nMaybe one more question, is there something you wish you'd known before you started Surge? A lot of people start companies, they don't know what they're getting into. Is there something you wish you could tell your earlier self?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:01:11):\nYeah, so I definitely wish I'd known that you could build a company by being heads down and doing great research and simply building something amazing. And not by constantly tweeting and hyping and fundraising. It's kind of funny, but I never thought I wanted to start a company. I love doing research. And I was actually always a huge fan of DeepMind because they were this amazing research company that got bought and still managed to keep on doing amazing science. But I always thought that they were this magical ILR unicorn. So I thought if I started a company, I'd have to become a business person looking at financials all day and being in meetings all day and doing all this stuff that sounded incredibly boring and I always hated. So I think it's crazy that didn't end up being true at all. I'm still in the weeds in the data every day. And I love it. I love that I get to do all these analyses and talk to researchers. And it's basically applied research where we're building all these amazing data systems that have really pushed the frontier of AI.\n\n(01:02:01):\nSo yeah, I wish I know that you don't need to spend all your time fundraising. You don't need to constantly generate hype. You don't need to become someone you're not. You can actually build a successful company by simply building something so good that it cut through all that noise. And I think if I known this was possible, I would've started even sooner, so I [inaudible 01:02:18] that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:18):\nAnd that is such an amazing place to end. I feel like this is exactly what founders need to hear, and I think this conversation's going to inspire a lot of founders, and especially a lot of founders that want to do things in a different way. Before we get to a very exciting lightning round, is there anything else you wanted to share? Anything else you want to leave our listeners with? We covered a lot of ground, it's totally okay to say no as well.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:02:37):\nI think the thing I would end with is I think a lot of people think of data labeling as it relates to simplistic work. Like labeling cat photos and drawing bounding box around cars. And so I've actually always hated the word data labeling because it just paints this very simplistic picture when I think what we're doing is completely different. I think a lot about what we're doing as a lot more like raising a child. You don't just feed a child information. You're teaching them values, and creativity, and what's beautiful, and these infinite subtle things about what makes somebody a good person. And that's what we're doing for AI. So yeah, I just often think about what we're doing as almost like the future of humanity or how we're raising humanity's children, so I'll leave it at that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:27):\nWow. I love just how much philosophy there is in this whole conversation that I was not expecting.\n\n(01:03:33):\nWith that, Edwin, we've reached our very exciting lightning round, I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:03:38):\nYep, let's go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:39):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:03:45):\nYes, so three books I often recommend are, first, Story of Real Life by Ted Chang. It's my all time favorite short story and it's about a linguist learning and alien language, and I basically reread it every couple years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:56):\nAnd that's what the Interstellar was about? Is that...\n\nEdwin Chen (01:03:59):\nYeah, so there's a movie called Arrival...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:01):\nArrival.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:04:02):\n... which was based off of the story,\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:03):\nYes, [inaudible 01:04:03]-\n\nEdwin Chen (01:04:03):\n... which I love as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:04):\nGreat. Okay, keep going.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:04:06):\nAnd then second, Myth of Sisyphus by Camus. I actually can't really explain why I love this, but I always find a final chapter somehow are really inspiring.\n\n(01:04:15):\nAnd then third, Le Ton beau de Marot by Douglas Hofstadter. And so I think Gödel, Escher, Bach is his more famous book, but I've actually always loved this one better. It basically takes a single French poem and translates it 89 different ways and discusses all the motivations behind each translation. And so I've always loved the way it embodies this idea that translation isn't this robotic thing that you do. Instead, there's a million different ways to think about what makes a high quality translation, which makes a lot of ways I think about data and quality in LLMs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:44):\nAll these resonate so deeply with the way, with all the things we've been talking about, especially that first one, if that was your goal after school is like, \"I want to help translate alien language.\" I'm not surprised you love that short story.\n\n(01:04:56):\nNext question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:05:00):\nOne of my new all time favorite TV shows is something I found recently, it's called Travelers. It's basically about a group of travelers from the future who are sent back in time to prevent their [inaudible 01:05:11]. Sorry, I just wrote that [inaudible 01:05:13] section.\n\n(01:05:14):\nAnd then I actually just rewatched Contact, which is one of my all time favorite movies. So yeah, I think one of the things you'll notice about me is that, yeah, I love any kind of book or film that involves scientists deciphering alien communication. Again, just this dream I always had as a kid.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:28):\nThat's so funny [inaudible 01:05:29].\n\n(01:05:30):\nOkay, is there a product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:05:35):\nSo it's funny, but I was in SF earlier this week and I finally took Waymo for the first time. Honestly, it was magical and it really felt like living in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:43):\nYeah, it's like the thing that... People hype it like crazy, but it always exceeds your expectations.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:05:48):\nYeah, it deserves the hype. It was crazy. Yeah, it's absurd. It's like, holy moly. If you're not in SF, you don't realize just how common these things are. They're just all over the place. Just driverless cars constantly going about, and when you go to an event at the end, there's just all these Waymos lined up picking people up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:03):\nYeah. Waymo, good job. Good job over there.\n\n(01:06:06):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you find yourself coming back to in work or in life?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:06:11):\nSo I think I mentioned this idea that founders should build a company that only they could build. Almost like it's this destiny that their entire life, and experiences, and interests shape them towards. And so I think that principle applies pretty broadly, not just the founders, but the people creating, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:25):\nWell, let me follow that thread to unlightening this answer. Do you have any advice for how to build those sorts of experiences that help lead to that? Is it follow things that are interesting to you, because it's easy to say that, it's hard to actually acquire these really unique sets of experiences that allow you to create something really important?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:06:44):\nYeah, so I think it would always be to really follow your interests and do what you love, and it's almost like a lot of decisions I make about Surge. I think one of the things that I didn't think about a couple years ago, but then someone said it to me, it's that companies in a sense are an embodiment of their CEO. And it's kind of funny. I hadn't thought about that because I never quite knew what a CEO did. I always thought a CEO was kind of generic and it's like, okay, you're just doing whatever VPs, and your board, and whatever, tell you to do and you're just saying yes to decisions. But instead, it's this idea where when I think about certain big, hard decisions we have to make, I don't think what would the company do, I don't think what metrics are we trying to optimize, I just think, \"What do I personally care about? What are my values? And what do I want to see happen in the world?\"\n\n(01:07:34):\nAnd so I think following that idea about... Okay, so ask yourself, what are the values you care about? What are things you're trying to shape and not... What will look good on a dashboard? I think that results are pretty important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:49):\nI love how just you're just full of endless, beautiful, and very deep answers.\n\n(01:07:55):\nFinal question. Something that you got quite famous for before starting Surge is you built this map while you were at Twitter that showed a map of the world and what people called, whether they called it soda or pop. I don't know if it's called Soda Pop. What was the name of this map?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:08:13):\nYeah, it was like the Soda Versus Pop dataset.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:15):\nSoda Versus Pop.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:08:17):\n[inaudible 01:08:17]\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:16):\nAnd so it's like a map of the United States and it tells you where people say pop versus soda, so do you say soda or pop?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:08:23):\nSo I say soda, I'm a soda person.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:26):\nOkay. And is that just like that's the right answer or it's like whatever you are, it's totally fine.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:08:33):\nI think I'll look at you a little bit funny. You say pop and I'll wonder where you came from, but I won't score on you too much.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:39):\nThat's how I feel too.\n\n(01:08:40):\nEdwin, this was incredible. This was such an awesome conversation. I learned so much. I think we're going to help a lot of people start their own companies, help their companies become more aligned with their values and just building better things.\n\n(01:08:53):\nFew final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out? What roles are you hiring for? How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:09:00):\nYeah, so I used to love writing a blog, but I haven't had time in the past few years. But I am starting to write again, so definitely check out the Surge blog, surgehq.ai/blog, and yeah, hopefully I'll be running a lot more there. And I would say we're definitely always hiring, so for people who just love data and people who love this intersection of math, and language, and computer science, definitely reach out anytime.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:24):\nAwesome. And how can listeners be useful to you? Is it just, I don't know, yeah, is there anything there? Any asks?\n\nEdwin Chen (01:09:29):\nSo I would say definitely tell me blog topics that you like me to write about...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:29):\nOkay.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:09:32):\n... and then I'm always fascinated by all of these AI failures that happen in the real world. So whenever you come across a really interesting failure that I think illustrates some deep question about how we want model to behave, there's just so many different ways a model can respond, I just oftentimes think there's just not a single right answer. And so whenever there's one of these examples, I just love seeing them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:57):\nYou need to share these on your blog. I'm also... I would love to see these.\n\n(01:10:01):\nEdwin, thank you so much for being here.\n\nEdwin Chen (01:10:03):\nThank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:04):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:10:07):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# How to foster innovation and big thinking | Eeke de Milliano (Retool, Stripe)\n\n## Transcript\n\nEeke de Milliano (00:00:00):\nProcess, by definition, is variance reducing. You're introducing it, because you worry that the variance in your org is too high. You want people to sort of meet a certain standard.\nEeke de Milliano (00:00:13):\nAnd the cost of that is obviously, while you are reducing the standard and bringing folks up to the average, you're also bringing other folks down to the average. And oftentimes, the folks you're bringing down are your highest performers, your most creative thinkers. The folks who, I think actually don't really need process to do their best work.\nEeke de Milliano (00:00:34):\nAnd so, that, I think is always the tension that you have with process. And obviously one of the reasons why companies introduce process much more and more, as companies get bigger, is because it's harder to get all these folks who don't need processing. You actually want to reduce the variance.\nLenny (00:00:52):\nWelcome to Lenny's podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts, to learn from their hard own experiences, building and scaling today's most successful companies.\nLenny (00:01:01):\nToday, my guest is Eeke de Milliano. Eeke is head of product at Retool. Prior to that, she was a longtime PM at Stripe. She was actually one of their very first PMs, where she helped build some of their foundational products like Stripe Checkout, Stripe Connect, Stripe Radar, and Stripe Chargeback Protection.\nLenny (00:01:18):\nI had a total blast chatting with Eeke. We covered Stripe's internal culture and what makes it so unique and innovative. How to foster and protect innovation at your own company. What is the right amount of process by stage of company? How to build a talent portfolio. And so much more.\nLenny (00:01:32):\nI am really excited for you to hear this episode. And with that, I bring you Eeke de Milliano, after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\nLenny (00:01:41):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours and mine. I have a quick request. Head on over to my board at Miro.com/Lenny and let me know which guest you'd love for me to have on in 2023.\nLenny (00:01:56):\nAnd while you're on the Miro board, feel free to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to work closely with your colleagues, to capture ideas, get feedback, and iterate quickly and easily on anything you're working on.\nLenny (00:02:06):\nFor example, in Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, a voting tool. Even an estimation app, to scope out your team sprints.\nLenny (00:02:16):\nYour whole distributed team can come together around a wireframe and draw ideas with a pen tool. Or even put mocks right into the Miro board.\nLenny (00:02:24):\nAnd, with one of Miro's readymade templates, you can go from discovery and research, to your product roadmap, to customer journey flows, to final mocks. You get the picture.\nLenny (00:02:33):\nHead on over to Miro.com/Lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/Lenny.\nLenny (00:02:41):\nThis episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for the launch of each episode.\nLenny (00:02:55):\nNotion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more, into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed.\nLenny (00:03:06):\nAnd not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart. The other day, I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all.\nLenny (00:03:21):\nLearn more and get started for free at Notion.com/LennysPod. Take the first step towards an organized happy team, today. Again, at Notion.com/LennysPod.\nLenny (00:03:36):\nEeke, welcome to the podcast.\nEeke de Milliano (00:03:39):\nThanks so much for having me, Lenny.\nLenny (00:03:41):\nIt's absolutely my pleasure. A bunch of people have told me that I need to have you on this podcast. And actually, a big thank you to Snir Kodesh, who I believe is a colleague of yours, who gave me a bunch of interesting questions to ask you. So, I hope you're ready.\nEeke de Milliano (00:03:53):\nAwesome. Very ready. Snir is the best, so yeah, I'm excited.\nLenny (00:03:57):\nSo you're currently head of product at Retool, but before that you spent a lot of time at Stripe. You spent six years at Stripe. And so, before we get to Retool, I actually want to spend a little time on Stripe.\nLenny (00:04:08):\nTo set a little foundation, could you just talk about some of the things you worked on at Stripe? And maybe some of the things you're most proud of, during that time?\nEeke de Milliano (00:04:15):\nYeah. So when I joined Stripe, I joined Stripe in 2013. It was pretty small at the time, it was around 50 people. And Stripe didn't have any product managers at that time.\nEeke de Milliano (00:04:23):\nAnd I think Stripe was kind of famous for that. And it really wasn't because we were anti-PM in any way. It was mostly just because we were building this product for developers. We had a lot of really talented engineers, who were essentially doing the PM job.\nEeke de Milliano (00:04:36):\nSo I actually joined Stripe as the first account executive, which I think is pretty funny, now that I've seen real account executives do their jobs. Because I really just had no business doing that job. But it also really wasn't your typical sales job, in that most of Stripes volume was inbound. So I was really just spending all of my day talking to customers, helping them figure out how Stripe might work for their particular business flows, and payment models.\nEeke de Milliano (00:05:03):\nAnd a lot of it was, I think, what PMs do. It was just talking to customers, understanding their pain points, and really helping them figure out how the product might do that. And to this day, when people ask me, \"Hey, what's your advice for going into product management?\" I'm like, \"Well, you should go get a sales job. I think it's pretty valuable.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:05:21):\nBut, it's kind of a long story to explain that, at the time there was this one sort of business model, the two-sided marketplace business model, that was just becoming huge. And you can't even really sort of imagine that now, but back then, Airbnb, Lyft, Uber, all those marketplaces, it was quite a new way of doing business.\nEeke de Milliano (00:05:41):\nAnd so, I was talking to all these customers and they had pretty complicated payment needs. So it was like, one payer putting in funds and it's getting paid out to a recipient. So an Airbnb guest and an Airbnb host. Or multiple payers putting funds in and it's getting paid out to one recipient, like a GoFundMe campaign. Or one payer putting in money and it going out to multiple recipients, like with ClassPass, where you get a subscription and then it gets paid out to a bunch of studios.\nEeke de Milliano (00:06:10):\nAnd then on top of that, all these platforms and marketplaces started having all these pretty complex regulatory and compliance requirements that were pretty different, country to country.\nEeke de Milliano (00:06:18):\nSo it was just this really complicated financial infrastructure problem, and Stripe actually didn't really have the right solution for it. And no one else in the market did, either.\nEeke de Milliano (00:06:28):\nSo at the time, this Stripe engineer, Brian Krausz, started poking around at this problem. Because I was talking to so many of these customers, we started talking about this problem together and poking around. And that actually resulted in us launching this sort of evolution of this product that we had at the time, called Stripe Connect.\nEeke de Milliano (00:06:46):\nThat was easily, I think, one of my favorite products I worked on. Not only, it ended up actually being really quite significant for Stripe's business. But also, because it was the first product and I think that's always pretty special.\nEeke de Milliano (00:06:58):\nAnd then, the second product that I think of very fondly during my time at Stripe, was this product, Stripe Radar. So Stripe obviously processes a lot of payments. Wherever there's money, fraudsters will kind of follow.\nEeke de Milliano (00:07:12):\nAnd there were certainly some merchants who were just particularly vulnerable to payments fraud. So, someone's using stolen credit card information to essentially purchase a good.\nEeke de Milliano (00:07:21):\nAnd if you're not in payments, this is going to sound kind of shocking. But if a merchant processes a payment from a customer and that customer used a stolen credit card, the merchant is ultimately on the hook for those funds. So it can be detrimental. The merchant who's trying to run a real business is just losing all of this money, because there are all of these frauds who are buying stuff from them online.\nEeke de Milliano (00:07:48):\nSo I really liked working on that product. So the product at Stripe was essentially, we built a bunch of machine learning models to try and predict when a payment was fraudulent. And then we built a product on top of that, to help customers understand why we were blocking payments, and help them write their own rules around that too.\nEeke de Milliano (00:08:03):\nAnd that was really fun, both from an anthropological perspective. Because we were kind of hanging out in corners of the internet where you wouldn't usually go if you were doing only legal things. So we were trying to understand who these fraudsters were.\nEeke de Milliano (00:08:16):\nBut it was also really cool from a product perspective, because of all the kind of complicated product questions around how humans should interact with AI and models. And I imagine a lot of the folks in the latest movement in AI are thinking a lot about that too. It's like, \"How do you explain a model to humans? How do you let them interact with it?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:08:33):\nSo, both those things were really, really neat.\nLenny (00:08:37):\nI actually use Stripe for my newsletter. It's how folks subscribe. And when I log into my Stripe Dashboard, there's so many products. I don't even know what many of them do. But I've often seen Radar being pitched to me as something I should pay for.\nEeke de Milliano (00:08:53):\nNice.\nLenny (00:08:53):\nAnd I feel like I should probably turn it on. That sounds really useful.\nLenny (00:08:57):\nOne thing, that I want to dig in on... So you said when you joined, there were no PMs at Stripe. How many PMs were there when you moved into product at Stripe?\nEeke de Milliano (00:09:06):\nThat's a great question. I want to say maybe three or four.\nLenny (00:09:10):\nWow. Incredible.\nEeke de Milliano (00:09:12):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:09:13):\nAnd you said Stripe is kind of known for being really late to PM and... I don't know if I want to say anti-PM, but there's a lot of sense of, \"Why do we need PMs? We have amazing engineers who can decide what to build.\"\nLenny (00:09:23):\nIs there anything you can share around that general philosophy of Stripe? And was it effective? Was it good? Because a lot of companies are anti-PM. And I think they always point to Stripe, and Snap is another example of, \"We don't need PMs. Look how far these companies got with without PMs.\"\nLenny (00:09:38):\nIs there something unique to Stripe that allowed them not to have PMs? I think there was like 200 employees probably, by the time they had their first PM.\nEeke de Milliano (00:09:44):\nI think we actually had our first PM at... I want to say at about 100 employees.\nLenny (00:09:47):\nOkay.\nEeke de Milliano (00:09:48):\nBut yeah, no, it was late in the game. And actually, maybe just to pattern match. Retool also didn't really have PMs for a while.\nEeke de Milliano (00:09:57):\nAnd I think actually both in the Stripe case and the Retool case, the thing that both of these companies have in common is, you're building for developers. The people who are building the product are the customers in a lot of ways. So, they get it. There's really no reason why you should have, in some ways, a middle man trying to figure out, \"Hey, who's the customer, and what is it that they need?\" And what are their pain points?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:10:19):\nAnd I think the moment at which it became clear, \"We really do need PMs at Stripe.\" And I think we felt the same way at Retool is, your customer base starts expanding. You start having different kinds of customers. You need to understand the whole market, all of the ICPs that you're going after.\nEeke de Milliano (00:10:35):\nAnd the organization gets more complex. I think Stripe... Gosh, in particular, it's just an extremely matrixed organization in business. Because every time you launch a product, you're having to think about, \"Well, how do we do this in other countries? There's different financial infrastructure. How do we think about the legal side, the compliance side, et cetera?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:10:51):\nAnd I think PMs can really kind of bring that whole story together and make the whole machine move. In addition to understanding the customers, and the value prop, and what the overall strategy was.\nLenny (00:11:04):\nThat's a really good reminder of, engineers and designers can do the work of a PM, but often they don't want to. There's a lot of non-fun parts to it. They're like, \"Oh, I wish we could have someone here do these things.\" And PMs enjoy that work. They're good at it. And so, eventually engineers and designers realize, \"Okay, I see why maybe we should hire a PM.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:11:23):\nI say this often actually, to folks who are thinking about going into product management. \"That's awesome. Just be really, really sure about what you're signing up for.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:11:33):\nIt's kind of the same as, I think a lot of people want to become a manager. But just so you know, being a manager is like, \"Hey, you're doing performance reviews a lot. And you're in one-on-ones a lot.\" You have to really love that kind of work. And I think in the product management case, it's also like, you're constantly working across a lot of different teams. You're trying to influence a lot of people who don't report into you directly, to do a bunch of stuff.\nEeke de Milliano (00:11:54):\nAnd if you love that, that's great. But you've got to be sure you know you're signing up for it.\nLenny (00:12:00):\nYeah, that's a really good comparison. When I first became a manager, I was an engineer, actually. And I was managing engineers. And then, when I moved on to something as an IC engineer, again, I was like, \"I will never manage again. That was no fun at all. Why would I want to do this?\"\nLenny (00:12:12):\nAnd I imagine people get into product thinking they're going to have all this control, power, influence. And then they're like, \"Oh my God, this job is so freaking crazy. What did I sign up for?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:12:20):\nIt's so hard.\nLenny (00:12:23):\nYeah. That reminds me, something that I heard you did at Stripe is, you wrote their internal culture guide. It was like a quick start guide to culture at Stripe, that I think was maybe shared with early employees.\nLenny (00:12:33):\nAnd if that's true, I'm curious what it is about Stripe's culture? If you could just briefly share just what makes Stripe so special. Clearly, it's one of the most successful companies in the world, in history. I know there's been a a slowdown with the market. Everyone's slowed down a bit.\nLenny (00:12:48):\nBut it feels like Stripe has been incredibly successful and continues to innovate like crazy. Hires incredible people. People that are starting amazing companies.\nLenny (00:12:56):\nSo I guess back to my question, what is it that you think makes Stripe's culture unique and special?\nEeke de Milliano (00:13:01):\nYeah, that quick guide to Stripe's culture. I think we wrote it, maybe when we were around 150 people or so. And we actually wrote it to share with candidates.\nEeke de Milliano (00:13:10):\nBecause the idea was like, \"Look, we're kind of opinionated about how we do things here. Most companies struggle to describe what their culture is. Like, how does a fish describe water? But it's worthwhile getting a sense of the things that we feel opinionated about, and that you might like or you might not like.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:13:29):\nAnd actually, when we put out the guide, our metric of success was that, more of the right people would apply to Stripe and fewer of the wrong people. And there was a whole section in there, I was like, \"Hey, look, we work pretty hard here and that is certainly not for everyone. And hopefully you're excited to come and work really hard with colleagues who really care, and that's the reward.\" So, that's maybe one example.\nEeke de Milliano (00:13:56):\nOn Stripe's culture and what's made it so successful. I've really been thinking a lot about, \"Were there one or two pivotal points or decisions for Stripe, that really set it on its path to success?\" And I don't think there are, actually. Every time I'm like, \"Well, if this hadn't happened...\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:14:16):\nI can always reason my way into, \"If these other things would've happened, Stripe would've kind of ended up in the same place.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:14:24):\nSo I think what Stripe was actually particularly good at... And by the way, you should take all this with a humongous grain of salt, because I haven't worked there since 2019. But, at least my experience when I was there, what Stripe was really good at was just making, not just one or two good decisions. It was making a lot of really good decisions all the time, big or small.\nEeke de Milliano (00:14:44):\nAnd that, I think, was quite cultural. There was this humongous respect and enthusiasm for thinking. It was such a part of the culture. One of the values was, think rigorously. Every meeting was very much like, \"Hey, how do we think about this thing from first principle?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:15:03):\nNo one would ever say, for example, \"It's a best practice to do X.\" People would be like, \"Well, why?\" You had to go a few levels deeper. So that was, I think, one piece.\nEeke de Milliano (00:15:14):\nThe other piece... And a lot has been written about this already. Stripe had a very strong writing culture. All communication was along from writing business reviews, strategy memos, product reviews. There was a lot of writing that happened.\nEeke de Milliano (00:15:26):\nAnd I very strongly believe this. I don't think you can be a good writer, unless you're a clear thinker. And if you couldn't write well, I think it was actually pretty hard to be successful at Stripe, at least in the early days. So I think Stripe just cultivated a lot of really good writers, and by input into that, a lot of really good thinkers.\nEeke de Milliano (00:15:44):\nAnd then, I think the last thing that Stripe was really good at, was not overthinking decisions. Because that's kind of the flip side of this really rigorous approach, is that you lock yourself into a room and can't come out for five days. You have to be good at making a lot of decisions, and the right decisions, quickly.\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:01):\nAnd one of the things that we would always sort of kick around a lot was just the idea of, \"Is it a trapdoor decision?\" Which I think is an Amazon concept.\nLenny (00:16:12):\nOne-way door, or two-way door.\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:13):\nIt's like, \"If you make this decision, is it one door, or is it two doors? Can you come back from this decision?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:16):\nAnd I thought Stripe was actually really good at being rigorous... Back to the rigorous point. About what actually was a trapdoor decision.\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:22):\nSo I think a lot of people, for example, think pricing is a trapdoor decision. But actually, it's really easy to grandfather your existing users into some existing pricing model and change pricing for future users. And if you believe that the product's going to be successful, your early users are only going to be a fraction of that pricing model.\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:41):\nAnd if the product's not successful, then Who cares if you change the pricing model? So I think that's a really good example of, people think that's a trapdoor decision, but actually you can move much more quickly on that decision than you think.\nEeke de Milliano (00:16:52):\nAnd then, a decision that definitely felt to us very much like a trapdoor decision, that I think Stripe took a long time being really rigorous about, was titles. I think Stripe's kind of famous for not really having titles.\nEeke de Milliano (00:17:03):\nAnd I think it was right to be rigorous around that decision, because once you've given someone a title, you can't really take it away. So you better be sure about the title you want to give someone.\nLenny (00:17:16):\nYeah, the titles are hilarious. I put together a career ladder doc of all company leveling names across all the big companies.\nEeke de Milliano (00:17:26):\nIs everyone a lead, at Stripe?\nLenny (00:17:26):\nAnd it's like, product manager, product manager, product manager, product manager... Yeah. And there's a lead here and there. Yeah, VPs are basically a product manager or a product leader, something like that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:17:36):\nYep. Yeah.\nLenny (00:17:37):\nHilarious. You talked about this idea of first principles. People talk about that often as, \"We want to be first principle thinkers. We're going to think from first principles.\"\nLenny (00:17:47):\nHow did Stripe actually operationalize that, implement that? Or was that just founder, top-down, continued questioning people, and that trickles down? Or is there anything else that they did to instill that mentality?\nEeke de Milliano (00:17:57):\nI definitely think it's founder, top-down. They were really good about hiring people who thought that way, too. So it's just all that stuff. It just really, really trickles.\nEeke de Milliano (00:18:05):\nAnd actually, to this day, when I'm preparing a memo, or a board deck, or something. I imagine in my head, I'm like, \"What if I had to present this to Patrick?\" And my ideas just get so much better, because I can sort of think about the questions they would ask.\nEeke de Milliano (00:18:23):\nSo, I think that was one. I think the other one was just sort of this writing culture piece. Once you start writing things down, you realize, \"Hey, that actually doesn't make a lot of sense.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:18:33):\nAnd then, I think the third thing actually was, there was just always a lot of questioning about the status quo. So if something had been done in an industry for a long time, people would always be like, \"Well, why was it done that way?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:18:46):\nAnd I think this is actually how Stripe got its start. I think when Stripe started, if you wanted to set up a merchant account, it could take weeks. And everyone just assumed that's what it took. And of course John and Patrick were like, \"Well, it doesn't actually make that much sense why it should take that long.\"\nLenny (00:19:00):\nYou shared some of the values... I don't know if they're just called values, core values, at Stripe. But, is there other ones you can share? You said one is think rigorous, or don't overthink. What are the other values at Stripe?\nEeke de Milliano (00:19:10):\nYeah, think rigorously was one. And I think they might have actually updated these on the website recently, so my recollection is very likely out of date.\nEeke de Milliano (00:19:19):\nAnd Stripe would call them operating principles, actually. Which, I think is actually better. Because values, you can't really tell people what to value. Everyone has their own value set. But you can tell people like, \"Hey, here's how we operate.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:19:32):\nAnother one that I loved was, move with urgency and focus. It was just really this idea that you're biggest compatriot and your biggest enemy as a startup, is time. So you have to move really, really, really fast on it.\nEeke de Milliano (00:19:48):\nCustomers first, was the other one. Or, users first, as Stripe would refer to customers as users. So those are some of my favorites.\nLenny (00:19:56):\nWhen I think back to what made Airbnb special in a similar way, the values... We call them core values. I think were actually really, really important, and turned the company into what it ended up being. And I was actually there around the time they created these values.\nEeke de Milliano (00:20:08):\nOh, awesome.\nLenny (00:20:09):\nI'm curious, at Stripe, do you have any recollection of how they came to these operating principles? Because, as I mentioned, founders are listening. \"How do I come up with these for our company?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:20:19):\nI'm pretty sure Patrick wrote them. Yeah. I think they came from... Patrick and John wrote them.\nEeke de Milliano (00:20:26):\nActually, the other value that I love... I don't think they have it anymore, but it was good, the operating principles. Micro pessimists, macro optimists.\nLenny (00:20:33):\nWow.\nEeke de Milliano (00:20:34):\nYeah. It was just this idea that, \"In the long term, we expect the curve to go up. We very much believe in the upward trajectory of just about everything. But on the day-to-day decisions, on the minutiae, we're quite critical. How do we make sure this thing works?\" And we'd think about all the ways in which it doesn't work.\nLenny (00:20:53):\nSo zooming out a little bit. We've been talking about Stripe. Retool also is a very first principles, innovative company.\nLenny (00:20:59):\nSomething that I think of when I think of Retool is, during the wild market days of long ago, last year. I know Retool was very conservative in how they raised money, and the valuations they raised at. Which, looking back, ended up being a really good idea. While everyone's raising at $100 billion, I think their last round is a few billion. And it's a very reasonable, conservative way to think about fundraising.\nLenny (00:21:23):\nAnd so, I guess just thinking about innovation in general. Why do you think some teams are able to run innovation machines, continue to put out new products, disrupt industries, while other companies kind of plod along and stay conservative?\nLenny (00:21:37):\nIs there anything you've seen, something you bring to teams you work on, to help foster innovation and big thinking?\nEeke de Milliano (00:21:43):\nYeah, I actually think about the extremes of that question. So not, \"Why are some teams innovative?\" But, \"Why isn't every team innovative?\" I feel like no one wakes up in the morning and thinks, \"Yeah, today I want to work on boring, incremental stuff.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:21:57):\nBut, most teams do end up working on pretty incremental stuff. I always wonder, \"What is it that's stopping folks from being creative and thinking bigger?\" And I think it comes down to a couple of things that companies do sort of unwillingly, or not even realizing it.\nEeke de Milliano (00:22:14):\nAnd one is this fear of failure. I think leaders want the upside of innovation, but they're not really willing to deal with the cost of innovation. Which is like, \"Look, if you're going to swing big, you will invariably stumble sometimes.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:22:29):\nSo I think if you want to mitigate that, you have to start shining light on failure. That's really the only way. You have to start normalizing it a little bit. And obviously, if an individual, or if a team is consistently failing and not learning. That, you need to deal with.\nEeke de Milliano (00:22:46):\nBut I think sometimes it's good to fail. And when you do fail, use it as an opportunity. Don't squander that moment to not learn.\nEeke de Milliano (00:22:57):\nBut yeah, one example is, instead of calling something a postmortem, call it a retrospective, so that it's a positive thing. Like, \"Hey, we're learning from this thing.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:23:07):\nAnd then, I think the other way to kind of mitigate the feeling of failure is, you have to figure out how to give folks more at BATS. Because obviously, anything that takes one year to ship, and you haven't gotten any customer feedback, the stakes of that are just going to feel so, so high. If you get it wrong, it's going to be devastating. So you have to figure out how to lower the stakes.\nEeke de Milliano (00:23:27):\nAnd honestly, I think in some ways it's kind of easy. It's like, \"Look, don't put too many resources against these bigger swings. Have them be small teams.\" And then also, just get customer feedback as quickly as possible. Don't wait until the thing is perfect. And that way, you can limit the risk.\nEeke de Milliano (00:23:44):\nSo yeah, I think fear of failure, that's definitely one thing that stops teams from being innovative.\nEeke de Milliano (00:23:49):\nThere's a very practical one. Sometimes teams are just getting bogged down by really urgent work. There's too much tech debt. There's too much product debt. Bugs, instability. It's a massive hierarchy of needs. There's just no way that they're going to be able to focus on the enlightened, bigger, creative stuff if they're just heads-down dealing with incidents all day. So if that's the case, yeah, diagnose it and get your team out of that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:24:18):\nAnd then, I think the last reason why teams aren't always that innovative is because, I think thinking big is really hard. And to some people it comes pretty naturally. But for most of us mortal souls, it's just really, really hard. And it takes time. And when you're at a startup and you're just grinding day-in, day-out, you're treading water just trying to make it through the day.\nEeke de Milliano (00:24:45):\nTaking the time to really think about the strategy, and where things should go, and get creative. It's pretty hard. So I call this... You have to give teams permission to think. So create these moments in your company culture, in your overall business processes, where you're asking people, you're literally saying, \"Hey, this is part of your job to think bigger.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:25:09):\nSo at Retool, we have these team charters and we do team planning. And at the bottom of every team charter we have a section called, Think Bigger. \"With 20% more time, what would you do that isn't on this list already?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:25:21):\nAnd then another really neat tradition that we had at Stripe, and we have a Retool now, too. Is this thing called, Crazy Ideas. So at the beginning of every year, David will send out a blank doc to the org and it's titled Crazy Ideas.\nEeke de Milliano (00:25:39):\nAnd the Prompt is, \"Crazy ideas are ideas that we shouldn't, obviously, do. There's a 90% chance that they make no sense. But in the 10% chance that they do, they will make a 10x to 100x difference for the retail business.\" And then, it's literally just a request for crazy ideas.\nEeke de Milliano (00:25:57):\nAnd the org loves it. It's amazing. The energy around it is so cool. And it's not just product ideas, it's different ways of how we should run our organization. Or, it's really cool marketing ideas in there.\nEeke de Milliano (00:26:12):\nSo, that doc is awesome. And whenever I have a down day, I just scroll through that doc.\nLenny (00:26:17):\nI know that you've launched three different products this year which I want to talk about, which maybe came out of this big thinking. But a couple more questions just to dig into some of the stuff you just shared.\nLenny (00:26:26):\nOne is this big doc of awesome ideas. What's come out of that? Because I think of hackathons, and people have all this energy, and it's exciting. And then they do all these cool things and they don't go anywhere.\nLenny (00:26:35):\nDo things come out of this? Does it lead to actual ideas that people follow up on?\nEeke de Milliano (00:26:38):\nYeah. Yeah, yeah. So every year that we send out the doc, we look at the doc from the past year, and we're like, \"Okay, did we do anything on this list?\" And consistently, we do anywhere between three to eight things on the list.\nLenny (00:26:49):\nWow.\nEeke de Milliano (00:26:50):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:26:51):\nIs there an example of a product that launched, that came from that list, that comes to mind?\nEeke de Milliano (00:26:54):\nActually, at least one, if not two of the three products that we launched this last year were on the crazy ideas list at one point. Like, a year ago, if you'd asked me, \"What is Retool's product?\" I would've told you, \"Retool helps you build internal frontends really, really fast.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:27:09):\nBut if you were trying to schedule a query to run at a later point in time, or have something trigger, or run an ETL task, you couldn't do that in Retool. So that was actually one of the crazy ideas. And that ended up becoming Retool Workflows, which we launched just last year, in November.\nLenny (00:27:28):\nOkay. We're definitely going to chat a bit about that. I want to go back to the two other suggestions you had. One is embrace failure, make it okay to fail. And then two is, don't let people get sucked into urgent stuff, and have time to focus on important stuff.\nLenny (00:27:42):\nIs there an example of just how to help people embrace failure? You talked about retrospectives. Is there anything else that you've found works, either as a tactic, as a process, as a framework, just to help people get out of that?\nLenny (00:27:55):\nBecause I hear that a lot, \"Embrace failure.\" And then people are like, \"Oh, but I failed and I suck.\" So yeah, is there anything else along those lines that you found effective to create that feeling?\nEeke de Milliano (00:28:04):\nTo me, it's always in the follow-ups. So have people talk about the failure in these sort of public forums, where usually you talk about the successes. So have someone actually write a note that's like, \"Hey, here are all my learnings from this thing that we did.\" And send it to the org.\nEeke de Milliano (00:28:18):\nAt Retool we have a shipped email list. If you ship something, you'll always send to that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:28:24):\nHave them send that email to the org. It's just an awesome way to celebrate. Or have them present it all-hands and share what they learned. And it almost always results in, I think, a really positive twist.\nLenny (00:28:38):\nAt Airbnb, I think for a period, there was an award for the biggest failure project and feature.\nEeke de Milliano (00:28:42):\nReally? That's so cool.\nLenny (00:28:43):\nYeah, like a trophy or something. It was a short-lived idea, but it was funny.\nEeke de Milliano (00:28:47):\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\nLenny (00:28:48):\nAnd then, on the second bullet point of urgency, giving people a chance to think longer term. Is there anything there, that you found to be actually effective, to create that culture, and give PMs and product teams a chance to think longer term, and not just be stuck in the fires that they're dealing with?\nEeke de Milliano (00:29:02):\nThere's a couple of top-down things, and a couple of bottom-up things.\nEeke de Milliano (00:29:06):\nOn the top-down, sometimes you just have to be willing to fund someone with something. Like, they come to you with an idea and you're like, \"Look, yeah, take an engineer and go do it.\" And you just have to give folks that sort of organizational buy-in.\nEeke de Milliano (00:29:21):\nActually, I was thinking back to that engineer, Brian Krausz at Stripe, who started poking around on this marketplace model. And I was thinking, I can't remember a moment when someone formally said to him, \"This is now your job.\" I think he just went and looked, and went and dug into it. And at some point, I think a manager was like, \"All right, this is now your job.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:29:43):\nBut yeah, no, I think you have to be able to fund folks' time and give that. Hackathons, I think, are pretty good for that stuff. It is kind of a moment for folks to take a step back.\nEeke de Milliano (00:29:55):\nAnd then, I think more than anything, in people's planning processes, I really like asking folks the 20% more time question. Or the other question was, \"Look, if you doubled the team today, what would you do?\" That shows up in our planning processes as well.\nEeke de Milliano (00:30:08):\nAnd I think it really helps people kind of break out of this... I think you end up planning towards the team that you have and not the team that you should have. So, that's how folks can break out of that process.\nLenny (00:30:20):\nAwesome. I really like the think bigger bucket in your planning docs. Just like, \"What would you do if you had more resources?\" Maybe a quick question there. Is there a bunch of detail that you ask them to put into that, or is it just a bullet point of big ideas?\nEeke de Milliano (00:30:32):\nFolks can just go crazy on it. It's however they want to take it. I've seen folks actually create entire demos.\nEeke de Milliano (00:30:40):\nBut I actually think the trick is less structure, in those cases. Because you don't really want to sort of pigeonhole... Or make it even that intimidating for folks. If someone just wants to write down a few bullets, that's great.\nLenny (00:30:53):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next-generation A/B testing platform, built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments.\nLenny (00:31:07):\nWherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to a waste of time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool.\nLenny (00:31:21):\nWhen I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform, was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more. Delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover.\nLenny (00:31:41):\nEppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and instead, use their North Star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. And Eppo supports tests on the frontend, the backend, email marketing, and even machine learning clients.\nLenny (00:31:55):\nCheck out Eppo at GetEppo.com. Get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\nLenny (00:32:03):\nOkay, so you launched three new products this year. Usually, companies are lucky to launch one product a year. A few questions.\nLenny (00:32:11):\nOne, just tell us what those three were, in case people are interested and want to check them out. Two is, was that a good idea? Is it good to launch three new products in a year?\nLenny (00:32:19):\nAnd then three, what did you do organizationally, to allow for this to happen? Because that feels really ambitious and rare, and I'm curious what you learned from that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:32:28):\nSo the three products we launched, one was Retool Workflows that I talked to you a little bit about. It's like, if you want to be able to, essentially create a workflow. Like schedule an alert, run a task, you can kind of do it in the Retool way. Where it's this visual, sort of easier builder of creating these different sort of workflows. But you can write your own code on top of it, as well.\nEeke de Milliano (00:32:50):\nThe second product is Retool Mobile. So you could pretty easily build incredible web apps with Retool. But there are plenty of folks who don't sit behind their laptop at a desk all day. And for those folks... We had a lot of companies who were like, \"I want a mobile native app.\" And so, we launched that product.\nEeke de Milliano (00:33:09):\nAnd then the third product was Retool Database. So until very recently, if you came to Retool, you could connect your data via your APIs, your database, directly into Retool.\nEeke de Milliano (00:33:20):\nBut what we found is that actually, a lot of folks either don't have access to their database, or they're just trying to build an internal tool and they don't necessarily want to store that data in their production database.\nEeke de Milliano (00:33:29):\nSo we built... Essentially, we spin up a post [inaudible 00:33:32] database for you. And you can just access it via a really nice UI and manage it directly in Retool.\nLenny (00:33:38):\nAmazing. Okay, back to the other two questions.\nEeke de Milliano (00:33:42):\nYes. Okay. So I think your second question was, \"Was this a good idea?\"\nLenny (00:33:44):\nRight.\nEeke de Milliano (00:33:46):\nYeah. You know what? I think in hindsight, if I were to do it again, I think sequencing it would've been slightly better. Just because, I think what we ended up doing is, we ended up launching the idea behind all three of these products at around the same time. And they all ended up maturing at around the same time, and that was just a lot of headspace from the org. Even though actually, the teams themselves were not that big.\nEeke de Milliano (00:34:18):\nIt was just like, we had all these products and we were just waiting for them to launch and waiting for them to launch. Whereas, maybe if we'd sequenced it, I think that would've felt more satisfying to the whole organization.\nEeke de Milliano (00:34:28):\nBut, I mean, it ended up working out. I think that's kind of the crazy thing. It's like, we were able to pull off launching these three products.\nEeke de Milliano (00:34:36):\nAnd by the way, I should caveat that, the further I get along my career, the more I realize I'm just kind of building on the shoulders of giants. And a lot of these ideas, et cetera, were very much in the works and were happening before I came along.\nEeke de Milliano (00:34:50):\nBut yeah, it was really neat to see how we got that all over the finish line in a year.\nLenny (00:34:55):\nAnd then, the last question there is just, what do you think you did to allow for this? Because it's pretty rare you can build so much. And I know the team's not huge. How many people work at Retool, roughly?\nEeke de Milliano (00:35:05):\nToday, we're around 300 people.\nLenny (00:35:07):\nYeah. So how do you structure an org to build three and launch... I didn't realize they launched around the same time. It's like, I'm picturing Elon Musk launching three rockets at once. How do you allow for that to happen?\nEeke de Milliano (00:35:20):\nYeah, I'm sure our product marketing team felt that way. Yeah, a couple of things. We started really small with all of these initiatives.\nEeke de Milliano (00:35:30):\nSo I think I mentioned, we really had one or two people working on each of these products for the first six months. So it was one engineer and one designer, or one engineer and one PM. And they really didn't get funding until it was clear that there was something there.\nEeke de Milliano (00:35:46):\nSo those teams, they spent a ton of time with customers. They spent a ton of time building, a ton of time prototyping. And it was kind of the moment where it was like, \"Okay, they are there.\" That we started bringing more people onto the team.\nEeke de Milliano (00:35:59):\nSo, that was the first piece. The second piece is that, we really treated them like startups. We're like, Retool's the VC, and Retool funds with resources and Retool's existing customer base. Which is obviously quite valuable, because you have all these customers you can market to and promote to.\nEeke de Milliano (00:36:15):\nBut then, the teams really had to prove that ROI. Either in engagement, or eventually revenue, in order to be able to move forward.\nEeke de Milliano (00:36:25):\nAnd then the third thing... And this one, actually I think it can be quite controversial. Is, we were really deliberate about keeping these teams separate from the rest of the org, especially early on. Now, a lot of them, they're very much a part of the overall organizational processes.\nEeke de Milliano (00:36:42):\nBut very early on, they were running on their own. They were meeting quite independently with one, or two, or three folks from the leadership team. And they were also just quite separate from the product itself.\nEeke de Milliano (00:36:56):\nI think Retool Mobile's actually a really good example, where we had a lot of debate about whether or not we should build Retool Mobile out of the core web app builder. Because a lot of the primitives are the same.\nEeke de Milliano (00:37:09):\nAnd we eventually decided that we were going to run it as a separate team, because we wanted the team to be able to move really, really quickly. And we didn't want it to get bogged down in, what are just the realities of running a product that has product market fit, like bugs, yada, yada, et cetera.\nEeke de Milliano (00:37:24):\nAnd I think that was absolutely the right call, because Retool Mobile actually has quite a different target customer. Which, we only really realized maybe like halfway through the project. And I don't think we would've been able to really understand that, or even get broader in that kind of thinking, had we sort of been stuck in the core retail product.\nEeke de Milliano (00:37:43):\nBut yeah, there was a cost to that, too. Which is like, \"Okay, now we have these two products, and we have to...\" I think obviously the strength will be, \"How do all these products interact with each other, and how do they build on top of each other?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:37:52):\nSo, we have to go and invest in that now. But I think it's totally worth it, because your team can just move more quickly, be more independent, and think more independently, too.\nLenny (00:38:00):\nIn the time that you worked at Stripe and Retool... I know we chatted before we started recording. You think a lot about, \"What is the right level of process for companies at different stages?\"\nLenny (00:38:12):\nAnd I'd love to just hear your thoughts, because I know that's a challenge a lot of companies face. \"How much do we put in now? Do we get inspiration from big companies? Do we try to stay lean?\"\nLenny (00:38:22):\nSomething here, that we actually run into. I'll just mention briefly that, there was a huge resistance to process for a long time. And so the product team was just kind of a little crazy for a bit. And then we were like, \"Okay, we need product development process. We need deadlines and specs.\" And that helped a lot.\nLenny (00:38:40):\nSo let me ask again, just how do you think about the right level of process for a stage of company, and what have you learned there?\nEeke de Milliano (00:38:45):\nYeah. What I would really love from companies is just sort of like this time capsule, where you can see what their processes were when they were like 20 people, and 50 people, and 100 people, and 500 people.\nEeke de Milliano (00:38:55):\nBecause when we were at Stripe and we were trying to figure out our planning process, we actually talked to Amazon, and Atlassian, and Apple, and all these companies that we really, really respect and look up to.\nEeke de Milliano (00:39:07):\nAnd I remember taking down notes from these companies and being like, \"Yeah, this is awesome, but there's no way that this will work for Stripe.\" Stripe was so much smaller than any of these companies.\nEeke de Milliano (00:39:17):\nSo yeah, they were showing us where we had to go, but no idea how to get there. And so, yeah, Lenny, maybe you can help us figure out time capsules for companies and what processes make sense.\nLenny (00:39:27):\nYeah. I am working on that, roughly.\nEeke de Milliano (00:39:28):\nOh, nice.\nLenny (00:39:30):\nI'm going company by company, about how they think process and about process. And then maybe I'll check in every couple of years.\nEeke de Milliano (00:39:36):\nCool. I love that. But yeah, to answer your question directly. Process... Yeah, it really gives people a bitter taste in their mouth, I think.\nEeke de Milliano (00:39:47):\nProcess, by definition, is variance reducing. You're introducing it, because you worry that the variance in your org is too high. You want people to sort of meet a certain standard.\nEeke de Milliano (00:40:00):\nAnd the cost of that is obviously, while you are reducing the standard and bringing folks up to the average, you're also bringing other folks down to the average. And oftentimes, the folks you're bringing down are your highest performers, your most creative thinkers. The folks who, I think actually don't really need process to do their best work.\nEeke de Milliano (00:40:21):\nAnd so, that, I think is always the tension that you have with process. And obviously one of the reasons why companies introduce process much more and more, as companies get bigger, is because it's harder to get all these folks who don't need processing. You actually want to reduce the variance.\nEeke de Milliano (00:40:38):\nThis is actually a little bit of an aside, but it's kind of relevant, so I'm just going to mention it. And you can feel free to let me know if it's too much of an aside.\nLenny (00:40:44):\nLet's get into it.\nEeke de Milliano (00:40:47):\nBut, I was just listening to this awesome podcast with Russ Roberts, who's a professor. He hosts EconTalk. I don't know if you listen to it.\nEeke de Milliano (00:40:56):\nAnd he was in interviewing this guy, Ian Leslie, who's this great writer and has just written this article that's... Basically, something along the lines of what it means to be human in the age of AI.\nEeke de Milliano (00:41:07):\nAnd I thought he just articulated this idea well. Which is, we're all really so impressed when we see ChatGPT-3 spit out this piece of writing that feels very human-like.\nEeke de Milliano (00:41:20):\nBut what we're kind of forgetting is that, over the last 10, 20, 30 years, we're actually asking humans to be a lot more robot-like. In that, we're really asking everyone to standardize in a lot of ways. And we're making people a lot more formulaic. If you think about how we teach people to write, it's like, \"Well, there's five paragraphs. And there's your opening paragraph. And you state your topic.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:41:43):\nSo anyway, I think the point is, the more formulaic, the more sort of mass produced you're trying to make something. The more you kind of quench people's creativity, and the further away you get from the really, really high highs. And that, to me, is the cost of process, and rules, and templates.\nEeke de Milliano (00:42:05):\nSo if you're going to introduce it, be really, really sure that you're okay with that cost. And give folks escape hatches.\nEeke de Milliano (00:42:13):\nSo I've started referring to this as the MVP, the minimum viable process. So if I give folks a template, I'm like, \"Look, use the template. But if you want to break out of it, please absolutely do.\" And I've started writing this at the top of templates now.\nEeke de Milliano (00:42:26):\nIt's like, \"If this doesn't work for what you're trying to explain, don't use it. But just know that this is the minimum viable thing. We're setting the bar here, but go higher if you can, please.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:42:38):\nSo anyway, that's my sort of long drive on process. With all that said, I do think that companies, there's just a set of documents that are really, really viable. That every sort of level of the organization should have throughout its lifecycle.\nEeke de Milliano (00:42:54):\nAnd then, I think how sort of involved it is, or how long term it is really depends on how big you are.\nEeke de Milliano (00:43:00):\nBut those documents, to me, are the charter. So, \"What is your mission, your vision and your strategy?\" The goals, \"What are you aiming to do and how are you going to measure success?\" And then the roadmap, \"What is the thing that you're shipping?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:43:15):\nAnd I think the whole company needs these, the whole function. So in product, you need all three of these. And then, within each team you need all three of these.\nEeke de Milliano (00:43:26):\nAnd I've kind of noticed two things about this framework for myself. One, I've actually noticed that teams often work their way from the bottom-up, versus top-down. They start with a roadmap. They're like, \"What are all the things we're going to ship?\" Especially early on. And then they kind of work their way into a charter. But I think it's really, really worth it to start from the top-down.\nEeke de Milliano (00:43:47):\nAnd then, the second thing that I've noticed is that your time horizon really shifts as you get more mature. So if you're very early on, you don't have PMF, you should have a charter, but your charter should be like three months in the future. Because you can't look that much further.\nEeke de Milliano (00:44:01):\nAnd if you're a company that's humming and going, your charter is probably... The horizon's maybe a decade.\nLenny (00:44:11):\nWow. There is so much there. I could go into so many different directions. One thing I wanted to follow up on a little bit, is this idea... Such a great point. That process brings the best people down and kind of averages them out to create consistency.\nLenny (00:44:28):\nAnd I'm curious if there's anything else you've seen succeed in allowing the best and most innovative brains to just do their thing. I know part of it is probably hiring amazing people. But yeah, is there anything else that's an escape hatch of just like, \"Oh yeah, this person, just go. Go figure this out.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:44:45):\nTo me, the unlock for organizations is managers, for this. Because you need managers to both detect the high performers and be like, \"This person doesn't need the process.\" And then you need managers to give that person air cover to be like, \"We're honestly...\" Because what you're doing is, you're giving them some special treatment and you need to be kind of okay with that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:02):\nAnd you also need to be okay with the organizational cost for that. Claire, who used to be the COO of Stripe, would always say, \"Are you willing to break the org for this person?\" And I always thought that was a really nice framing. And you kind of need to decide who you want to do it for, too.\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:17):\nBut yeah, some people are just that good that like, \"Yeah, of course you'll break the org for them.\" They're going to break the org in the best way possible.\nLenny (00:45:27):\nYeah. I love that term. I think Claire's coming on this podcast. She just wrote a book, right? Is that the same person?\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:29):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:45:30):\nOkay, great.\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:30):\nYeah, she just wrote a book. Yep.\nLenny (00:45:33):\nAll right, we just booked her. Come, and maybe we'll spend some time together.\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:36):\nThat's awesome.\nLenny (00:45:37):\nDo you have any other product building philosophies that you found especially useful in your time at Stripe, and Retool, and anywhere else?\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:45):\nI have a couple of, I guess, specific mental models that I use. The first is, build for your best user, not your worst user.\nEeke de Milliano (00:45:53):\nAnd what I mean by that is, I think it's actually really easy to get stuck, or to focus on, \"What if there's abuse of this product?\" Or think about all the ways in which the product won't be used well. And then you end up sort of shaping the product in these really weird funky ways to make up for that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:46:11):\nWhereas in reality, the worst users, they should be a fraction of your users anyway. So you shouldn't really be building for them.\nEeke de Milliano (00:46:19):\nI think a really good example of this is onboarding processes. Where, you're probably going to be building an onboarding process, where you're trying to collect a lot of data. Or trying to figure out, \"Hey, how do I help this user who maybe isn't well suited for my product to be successful?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:46:37):\nReally, you should just be building an onboarding process for the user who's going to jump into your product and get it immediately.\nEeke de Milliano (00:46:42):\nI was thinking about this actually just the other day. Because we were in this product review, and we were talking about this other new product that we're thinking of exploring.\nLenny (00:46:48):\nMore products? It never ends.\nEeke de Milliano (00:46:52):\nYeah, exactly. And we're kind of going down this path of like, \"Oh, well if this gets really big, there's going to be all this abuse of the product.\" And Anthony, our founder was like, \"Wouldn't that be an amazing problem to have?\" And we're like, \"Yeah, that's a really good point.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:47:03):\nSo we kind of put that on the back burner.\nLenny (00:47:07):\nThat's an interesting approach, because usually you're trying to optimize a flow, get more people through it, which are the least good users.You're saying you found more success just focusing...\nLenny (00:47:16):\nIs this more initially, focus on the users that will understand this, and be excited about it, and make that work really well. And then, over time, build on that?\nEeke de Milliano (00:47:23):\nYeah, totally. Yeah, sure. If you're going to look at the end, and you're trying to optimize, et cetera, absolutely. But in that sort of early product development stage, it's just not worth it to be too focused on that.\nLenny (00:47:33):\nGot it. Sweet.\nEeke de Milliano (00:47:34):\nSo, that's one. The other one, our head of design, Ryan, always kind of reminds us of is, build the scooter, not the axle.\nEeke de Milliano (00:47:44):\nSo if you're trying to build the minimum viable product for a car, don't build just the wheels and the axle, build the scooter first. And then from there, you build the bicycle, and the motorcycle, and then the car.\nEeke de Milliano (00:47:54):\nAnd it's always just such a good reminder. You always want to start building the whole thing. But really try and think about the slice that gets the customer to complete value on a smaller thing first.\nEeke de Milliano (00:48:06):\nSo with Retool Mobile for example, there's just so much you could be building there. And we decided very specifically, \"Hey, we're only going to build this for companies that have field workers and they would need to do inventory management.\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:48:18):\nAnd it's a very specific slice, but it helps get through from something that was actually viable, beginning to end.\nLenny (00:48:25):\nGot it. So it's an approach for MVPs, basically. Make something simple and functional, not just something barely... Not actually working, but getting you to some dream product eventually.\nEeke de Milliano (00:48:37):\nYeah. And then the last one is this idea of 70/20/10 split investments. I really think that a lot of product management can sometimes be reduced to funnels and portfolios.\nEeke de Milliano (00:48:51):\nSo the 70/20/10 investments model in my head is just like, 70% of your building time should really be going to your core product, that has product market fit. 20% of your time should be going to strategic initiatives that aren't core, but they're strategic to the company, that you know have to do them. And then, 10% of your time should be going towards bets.\nLenny (00:49:11):\nThat's actually exactly the same heuristic I've always used. One question there is, how do you think about maintenance and bugs within that?\nEeke de Milliano (00:49:19):\nYeah. To me, that falls squarely in the 70%. So yeah, core product, tech debt, sort of the maintenance mode type stuff. And core product, obviously you're also doing a bunch of new stuff there too.\nEeke de Milliano (00:49:31):\nBut yeah, no more than 70% of your resources should be going there.\nLenny (00:49:35):\nWhat did you say the 20% was?\nEeke de Milliano (00:49:37):\nStrategic initiatives that aren't your core, but you just know, based on your strategy, you have to do these things.\nLenny (00:49:45):\nGot it. So the way I break it up is, 20% is where I put bugs and maintenance. And then 10% was big, ambitious bets. So it was similar ratios, but different things go into the buckets.\nEeke de Milliano (00:49:56):\nCool.\nLenny (00:49:57):\nBut, let me ask a similar question. How do you, at Retool, and maybe even at Stripe, think about finding time to do maintenance and bugs? Do you build it into roadmaps? Do you set off time to just fix all the bugs? I know it's probably an evolution, and it goes back and forth. But, any thoughts?\nEeke de Milliano (00:50:11):\nYeah. This, I think, is really one of the trickiest parts of product management, in my mind.\nEeke de Milliano (00:50:18):\nWe don't have a company-wide sort of process on this. It's pretty team specific. Some teams do Friday bug bashes. Other teams are just, as products roll out, will work on them as they go.\nEeke de Milliano (00:50:33):\nI was actually speaking to a product manager at a different company, who mentioned that they just spent the last 18 months doing just product polish and bugs. And I think they landed in a place where they had to do it, because they just had so much debt. But luckily, we're not there yet.\nEeke de Milliano (00:50:54):\nRight now, we let most of the teams just kind of do it themselves and figure out what makes sense for them.\nLenny (00:50:59):\nOkay. Awesome. I wanted to go back to something that I've heard about Retool, that you all are really good at. Which is PM's being really close to customers. And I'm curious what you've done there, or what the team has done there, that it's been really effective?\nEeke de Milliano (00:51:13):\nWell, I do think every good product team figures out how to get close to customers. But just based off of my observations from Retool, and what I've seen at other companies, there are a couple things that are more pronounced at Retool than I've seen in a lot of other places.\nEeke de Milliano (00:51:28):\nThe first is, we have a lot of PMs who used to be in customer-facing roles, at Retool. I obviously am a big fan of that. I think there's just nothing like really understanding the value of your product, at the moment where a customer actually has to put money down. And so, I really like that about PMs, who have had those conversations with customers and they really get it.\nEeke de Milliano (00:51:53):\nSecond is, because the retail product is so technical... And I do think this just depends on what product you have. Our PMs are really, very technical. Everyone has either a CS degree, or has done some sort of engineering in the past.\nEeke de Milliano (00:52:06):\nThird is, we use Slack very heavily to talk to our customers and interact with them. So at this point, I think we have hundreds of Slack channels with customers. Every time we're testing a new product, or a new customer who's somewhat large, comes online. We will work with them in Slack, to get there off-the-cuff feedback, just back and forth. It's really nice. We just have this direct line to them, which is awesome.\nEeke de Milliano (00:52:34):\nAnd then, the fourth thing we do is, we use Retool to build Retool. So our product roadmap lives in a Retool app. And the app that we use to have feature flags for particular features, is a Retool app. So PMs are just in the product all day long, every day. They're their own customers in a lot of ways, and that really helps as well.\nLenny (00:52:57):\nWow, I didn't know that. That is very cool. So you build a task management product using Retool?\nEeke de Milliano (00:53:03):\nOh, yeah. Well, we built many... Basically, all of our internal tooling happens in Retool. Like, our PMs, all their team dashboards are in Retool. All of their task tracking is in Retool. Submitting linear requests or bug requests happens in Retool, and then goes to Linear. So yeah, it's how we run the company.\nLenny (00:53:23):\nYou haven't been able to replace Linear yet? That's cool. I'm a big fan of Linear.\nLenny (00:53:29):\nOkay, two more questions and then I'll let you go. One is around product growth. Which, I don't want to get too into. We've talked about it a bunch on this podcast.\nLenny (00:53:37):\nBut, it's interesting that Stripe was very product-led growth. It was just self-serve PMs, engineers, whoever, just started using it. It grew and became enterprisey down the road.\nLenny (00:53:49):\nRetool, on the other hand, I think people think it's product-led growth. I imagine it's actually sales-led, mostly.\nLenny (00:53:54):\nAnd so, I'm just curious what you've learned about the difference between building product and leading product teams within a sales-led org, versus a product-led org.\nEeke de Milliano (00:54:04):\nI have a couple of insights on that. One interesting insight is that, teams that have one always want the other.\nLenny (00:54:10):\nThat's so true.\nEeke de Milliano (00:54:12):\nWhenever I talk to candidates, I feel like you can always tell what their company has, because they'll be asking a lot of questions about the opposite. If they're probably a growth company they'll be like, \"Well, how are you guys thinking about Enterprise?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:54:24):\nAnd then, if they are more of a sales-led growth company, they're like, \"Well, how are you guys thinking about your self-serve motion, or your product-led growth?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:54:31):\nAnd my main takeaway, just in... And I don't know if I would even use the dichotomy of product-led growth, or sales-led growth, with Retool. I think we do have a lot of product-led growth. But we work with a lot of enterprise customers, and a lot of our revenue comes from enterprise customers, and we have a fantastic sales team.\nEeke de Milliano (00:54:49):\nAnd I think the main thing is that, you just have to really figure out your interaction mechanisms with sales. And that just has to be so, so tight.\nEeke de Milliano (00:55:00):\nAnd it goes in both directions. There's obviously, how you get feedback from them, because they are so often on the front lines talking to customers. Moreso than product managers, even.\nEeke de Milliano (00:55:08):\nBut it also goes the other way. If you are going to ship something, or if you are going to put out a roadmap, like, \"How do you make sure that the sales team has everything that they need...\" The sales, and in Retool's case, the success team and the support team, \"Has everything they need to accurately talk to customers about that?\"\nEeke de Milliano (00:55:26):\nAnd I've always actually found that really hard, because it's really hard to figure out the right altitude. If you're giving a presentation on the roadmap, people are either going to feel like it's too high level. Or, it's too low level for folks who maybe are new.\nEeke de Milliano (00:55:40):\nSo this year, we're actually trying something different. We are doing a science fair. Where, each product team has a little booth. And they get to stand there, and anyone who has questions about the product can come... You know, from the go-to-market side, can come and ask questions, and get demos, and go as deep as they need to.\nEeke de Milliano (00:55:57):\nSo, I'll let you know how that goes. But I'm excited to experiment with it.\nLenny (00:56:04):\nOkay. Are there going to be foam core boards, and will there be ribbons?\nEeke de Milliano (00:56:08):\nThere may be prizes. Who knows?\nLenny (00:56:10):\nOh my God. I can't wait to see a picture of this. Final topic. You have this concept that you call the product talent portfolio. What does that mean, and how have you found that useful in your product leadership life?\nEeke de Milliano (00:56:25):\nYeah. Yeah, it's back to like, all of product management is portfolios and funnels.\nEeke de Milliano (00:56:29):\nI think it's really tempting as a manager, to build a team in your image, because you understand their skillsets and you value those skillsets. And you're going to be able to detect and assess those skillsets better.\nEeke de Milliano (00:56:43):\nBut the best product teams, in my mind, have really figured out how to balance the talent portfolio. So instead of having a bunch of PMs who all spike in one particular area, figure out how you can create complimentary skillsets for the whole PM team, so the whole is much stronger.\nEeke de Milliano (00:57:04):\nAnd one way in which I like to do that is, I really like to balance product teams with homegrown product managers, who really get the product. They've probably been in it. They're amazing culture carriers, often. They really set the tone. But they may not have seen product management at other companies, and they may not have some of the more conventional and traditional product management skillsets.\nEeke de Milliano (00:57:25):\nSo I want to balance that with product managers who've come from other companies, and have done it, and can bring a little bit more of that product manager rigor. Even though they don't have, in the Retool case, the core Retool product management vibe.\nEeke de Milliano (00:57:41):\nSo, that's one example. I think there's others as well. Some PMs are just incredible execution machines. Other PMs are amazing visionaries. You kind of want a little bit of all of them.\nEeke de Milliano (00:57:51):\nAnd you want to also balance within all of your different pillars. So we have three different sort of product pillars at Retool, and there's leads for all those pillars. And I always push the leads to hire people who don't look like them, so that we have balance everywhere.\nLenny (00:58:08):\nI love that. Do you, actively, as you're hiring, \"Hey, well you're strong in these areas. Here's the person we need, here. We want this specific, super strategy minded person.\" Is that actually how you think about this?\nEeke de Milliano (00:58:20):\nYeah. I do a little personal exercise for myself every six months, where I chart out the team that we have today, and write down all of the strengths that we have, all of the weaknesses that we have, as a team. And then I try to hire specifically for those weaknesses.\nLenny (00:58:35):\nAmazing. Any last pieces of wisdom or thoughts, before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\nEeke de Milliano (00:58:42):\nI think that's it on my end.\nLenny (00:58:43):\nOkay. We got through everything I was hoping to get through.\nLenny (00:58:46):\nSo with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\nEeke de Milliano (00:58:52):\nI'm ready.\nLenny (00:58:53):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most, to other people?\nEeke de Milliano (00:58:57):\nBird by Bird: Instructions on Writing and Life by Anne Lamott. It's incredible. So touching. Really, really great. Also, I think product managers should be great writers. So, I love that.\nEeke de Milliano (00:59:08):\nAnd then the other book that I was going to say, but I'm glad you mentioned Claire, is Claire's book, Scaling People, which is coming out. I had a very small hand in ghost writing for her a little bit, in the first draft. So I use a lot of the early chapters from that book still, in management. And I still recommend the tactics in there, so I'm excited for her to get it out.\nLenny (00:59:29):\nWow. I've been hearing about ghost writing as a career recently, and it feels like it could be an option for you down the road.\nLenny (00:59:36):\nI'm excited to read the book. I haven't gotten a copy yet. I think you could pre-order it now, and we'll link to it in the show notes.\nEeke de Milliano (00:59:41):\nNice.\nLenny (00:59:42):\nWhat's a favorite other podcast that you like to listen to, other than maybe the one you're on right now?\nEeke de Milliano (00:59:46):\nYeah, this one's great. I can't choose between these two, though. One is Lex Fridman. And then the other is EconTalk by Russ Roberts. I really like that both of them are... Their agenda is curiosity, which I love.\nLenny (00:59:59):\nTotally resonate there. What is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've enjoyed?\nEeke de Milliano (01:00:04):\nIs it too basic to say White Lotus?\nLenny (01:00:07):\nCool. That's the most mentioned one, which says a lot, right? That just says how good that is, because I love it too. But, that works. Season one or season two?\nEeke de Milliano (01:00:17):\nOh, season two, all the way.\nLenny (01:00:19):\nYeah, same. I'm excited for season three. No spoilers. Favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\nEeke de Milliano (01:00:27):\nTo what do you attribute your success? And you can't say luck.\nLenny (01:00:32):\nInteresting. Because most people look for, do they believe it's luck, versus their innate skill? So you don't even allow them to say luck? Interesting.\nEeke de Milliano (01:00:41):\nYeah. Because I think humble people will always say luck in some way. And I always kind of wanted to know, \"How self aware are you, and how curious are you?\"\nEeke de Milliano (01:00:51):\nAnd I think people who have really gone back and reflected on why are they where they are today, really says a lot about how they think about the world.\nLenny (01:01:03):\nI love that. What are some SaaS tools that you love, or use often, at your current company, or anywhere else?\nEeke de Milliano (01:01:08):\nYeah. Well, first and foremost, it's Retool. And then, the other SaaS tools that we use a lot, Slack, Gong, Linear and FullStory.\nLenny (01:01:18):\nAwesome. Favorite new product that you found, maybe in life, maybe at work?\nEeke de Milliano (01:01:24):\nYeah. Have you heard of Rewind?\nLenny (01:01:27):\nYes, I have it running right now.\nEeke de Milliano (01:01:31):\nNice. Yeah. I mean, I think it's really incredible what they've done.\nLenny (01:01:35):\nMaybe describe it briefly, just so folks know what that is.\nEeke de Milliano (01:01:38):\nIt basically records everything that you're doing on your computer and then makes it really easy for you to search it. Which, it's just incredible. I don't know if you work this way, Lenny. But I feel like nowadays, I don't really go to tabs anymore. I kind of directly search for the thing that I'm searching for. And I think Rewind just fits that user behavior so, so well.\nLenny (01:02:06):\nAmazing. Eeke, this was so much fun. We got through everything I was hoping for, and more.\nLenny (01:02:09):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, see what you're up to? And, how can listeners be useful to you?\nEeke de Milliano (01:02:16):\nDefinitely find me online on Twitter. It's @EekeDM. And, how can they help us? Try out the Retool product and give us some feedback.\nLenny (01:02:25):\nAmazing. Retool.com, right?\nEeke de Milliano (01:02:25):\nYes.\nLenny (01:02:26):\nAwesome. Thank you again, for being here.\nEeke de Milliano (01:02:28):\nThanks, Lenny.\nLenny (01:02:31):\nThank you so much for listening.

You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks, like what is the sure things to get growth. In the age of social media everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks. Oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:21):\nWe're going to start with growth tactics that never work. If you see these items on your roadmap, you should probably not do them. What's number one?\n\nElena Verna (00:00:26):\nWe live in tech. There's always lots of startups and startups obviously looking to grow. There is a huge misconception in the field that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team. To figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it, it's not something that you can outsource to somebody.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:42):\nPowerful words. I'm loving this list already.\n\nElena Verna (00:00:45):\nNumber two, this was my favorite and it might be a little spicy. Never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially of UK marketing site produce good performance results. New CMO comes in designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste, and oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up and it never materializes into anything meaningful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nA lot of contrary intakes here, I love this.\n\nElena Verna (00:01:14):\nNumber three, if every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment that's a problem. It's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:28):\nToday my guest is Elena Verna, my first ever third time repeat guest. Elena is the smartest person that I know on B2B Growth. She's also hilarious. She's led growth at companies like Miro Amplitude, Dropbox, and SurveyMonkey. She's advised dozens of companies on growth including Superhuman, MongoDB, Netlify, Similarweb, Sanity, Maze, so many more. In our conversation, Elena shares 10 growth strategies and tactics that never work yet that she keeps seeing people and companies invest lots of resources into. She also covers her three favorite growth frameworks that help you wrap your head around how to think about growth, and she also does a short dive into the non-traditional career paths that we both went down. If you spend any time working on product growth or lead people or work with people working on growth, this episode is for you.

What an honor Dancing if you're not watching on video. Thank you for being here. I was actually just looking at our first episode, which we recorded almost over two years ago, September of 2022, and someone just today left a comment. People are still finding and watching it, and this comment encapsulates why I love having you on this podcast. This person said, \"Wow, every word from Elena encapsulates years of knowledge. This is one to digest, slowly go back to and put on repeat. Thanks for sharing your experience with the world\"\n\nElena Verna (00:05:23):\nThank you for having me. And my north star metric is insights per minute. That's what I try to use whenever I have any live meetings with people so it squarely fits within what I'm optimizing for. That's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:37):\nThat needs to be my KPI on this podcast, \"Insights per minute.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:05:40):\nI think you have it. I think your insights per minute is pretty high.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:44):\nThat is. I do shoot for that, although I have learned you also needed to feel good and feel their story. There's an interesting combo stuff. You can't just be insight, insight, insight.\n\nElena Verna (00:05:54):\nIt's all about how you present them too. Storytelling is a big portion of it actually to stick.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:06:00):\nAlready insight. That's an insight right there. There's two areas that I want to spend time on with you, and these are areas I know you've been thinking a lot about. One is growth tactics that never work, that people keep spending time on and waste their time on. And I know you have a nice list of things you've seen that just don't work that people keep trying. And then two is growth frameworks, your favorite growth frameworks to help people wrap their mind around how to think about growth and grow their product. We're going to start with growth tactics that never works. Maybe just frame what we're going to talk about, talk about what this list and collection of tactics that we're going to talk about is.\n\nElena Verna (00:06:36):\nGrowth is a fairly new field compared to marketing or product management or engineering. There's a lot of people that are now accumulated that have 10 years or so experience, but there's also a lot of newcomers and because there's ratio of actually newcomers, it's much higher than those people that have five, 10 years of experience of doing growth. You have a lot of renowned interest in growth hacks. What is the sure things to get growth? What is the sure thing to get that metric up? How can I contribute to success with the company the fastest way possible? All of these shortcuts and obviously in the age of social media where everybody and anybody tries to share their tips and tricks and this and that, people are grasping for oftentimes things that are completely out of context or they are very specific to one example and actually do not apply as a pattern or simply not even applicable to their type of business whatsoever.\n\n(00:07:35):\nThere's just a lot of failure happening in growth teams. Actually, I think growth teams are becoming one of those departments that has a higher head of growth firing rate than even CMOs because people are coming in, there's a bunch of expectations, \"Hey, you're ahead of growth or you are a growth pm or you're a growth marketer, you're supposed to drive growth.\" And when that growth does not happen, here comes the axe and people off they go and the recycle and cycle starts all over in order to populate those positions. I think that there's just a lot of misinformation I would say probably out there in terms of what growth actually is and how it should be done in the companies. And today I just want to cover some of the biggest ones that I see as a patterns as I'm advising companies, as I'm operating in companies because it's just so blatant yet there's very few pieces of information on this for people to learn from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:31):\nAmazing. What's number one?\n\nElena Verna (00:08:34):\nNumber one, I have to start with hiring. There's lots of positions open all the time. There's so many from head of growth to growth PM there's a lot of rotation, as I said that is happening in the field. Very few growth people actually stay in the job for over a year or two years. There's a lot of constant churn and constant rehiring. And when you doing hiring, there's a lot of mistakes that are actually happening in hiring that I just want to start off on the list. It's not a roadmap item, but oh my gosh, there's just so much fault that is happening here. And I did write about it on your blog of hiring for growth. There's a little bit of a reference to that and one of the biggest latent issues that I see is hiring too soon for growth.\n\n(00:09:17):\nWe live in tech, there's always lots of startups. Startups are obviously looking to grow and there is a huge misconception in the shield that in order to get growth going, you need a growth team, absolutely not true. In order to get the growth going in the company, a founder and the founding team have to figure out how to make it grow to the first, let's say a million, 5 million, 10 million in ARR. Some of the companies don't even create growth teams until they're a hundred, 200 million in ARR because to figure out your product market fit and how to distribute it's not something that you can outsource to somebody. It's not somebody that with a shiny resume can come over and all of a sudden wave a magic wand and all of a sudden you have viral campaigns and a bunch of signups coming through and everybody's paying and everybody's retaining.\n\n(00:10:09):\nThat just doesn't happen. I see that mistake happening a lot. I really believe that the founder led growth is not being popularized enough that you do not need growth teams until you actually can start running experiments on your user base, which means that you have volume of users that you can learn from and optimize and innovate on, and that first wave of growth has to be founder led.\n\n(00:10:35):\nAnd there's two specific reasons that I incur on, which is before you have growth team, before you would think about growth team first you need to have solid PMF, product market fit, means that you have a solution to a problem and you have customers not only coming in and solving that problem with your solution, but they're also retaining and staying with you. There is a good retention. You can use channel score of how many people would say that they cannot live without your product as well, but there's some sort of PMF. And then number two, you have data growth cannot function without data. If you have 10 users or 10 customers, that's not data, that's a G-sheet with your customers and you don't need a growth team for that. Until you have data that you can actually do an analysis and you can create hypotheses on and you can start applying experimentation, don't even think about growth team.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:32):\nJust to summarize a few of the things you just said, just for folks, you basically have seen startups look for a head of growth to join and solve their growth problem and your insight there is just almost always that is not going to be the solution to your problem until you have strong retention already, have a really high score on the channel score if don't have a ton of data yet and party advice is just the founder should continue to do this for as long as possible. A million ARR is one milestone a lot of people recommend. To your point, a lot of companies wait lot longer.\n\nElena Verna (00:12:06):\nYes. And honestly, the longer you wait, the better it is because that way your entire company will be trained to be responsible for growth as opposed to putting this one island with a growth team and saying, \"They're going to be growing,\" and what is the rest of the company doing? Honestly, the longer you wait, the better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:24):\nAs you talk about this, sales is a part of what you described here, like hiring your first sales person. And I guess how do you think about your first head of growth versus salesperson? Is there anything advice there is? Like for B2B SaaS, you probably don't hire head of growth for even longer, you hire sales first or what's your advice?\n\nElena Verna (00:12:42):\nIt depends on how you're actually going to collect the monies. If your money collection is going to happen through sales team primarily, then you absolutely should be hiring sales way before growth. In fact, in the sales led companies, growth teams are not necessarily needed even that much. You might have a growth marketing team, which is really a demand gen team that is rebranded for growth marketing so they can charge you 20 to 30% more in their salaries, but at the end of the day, sales is doing your monetization. They are doing your activation, they are doing your retention and success efforts. For sales like companies, yeah, higher sales, absolutely. Unless you're starting to do self-serve revenue.\n\n(00:13:23):\nYou're trying to have product sell itself through potentially freemium acquisition, trial acquisition or you actually having product led activation, monetization, that's when you would need a growth person. If you're starting with self-serve monetization, growth hire should be frankly first before sales. Your sales are going to be more opportunistic in nature versus if you sales led company, go ahead, hire sales, wait for growth until you are ready to overlay product-led growth on top of your sales motion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:57):\nThat's an excellent clarification. Basically what I'm hearing, the advice is hire your ahead of growth only when you have clear product market fit and you're a product-led company and beyond a millionaire ARR ideally something like that.\n\nElena Verna (00:14:11):\nRight. And I won't say you're product-led company. You are relying on product-led motion to resolve a lot of the growth levers within you because you don't have to be fully product-led company. But if product, let's say acquires people, let's say with the SEO or SEM, and then its product is meant to activate them and then sales closes them, sales would be obviously important as well, but growth would have to come in a little bit sooner as well. If you have any product-led components where product is responsible for acquisition, activation, monetization or retention, that's where growth comes in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:48):\nWe talked deeply about that specific topic in our first conversation, just for folks, want to go deeper there. There's lot there.\n\nElena Verna (00:14:53):\nI need to bring it back. This is keeps happening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):\nI love that.\n\nElena Verna (00:14:55):\nI need to repeat it. You need to repeat it three times right before it sticks to people. Hopefully this is the third time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:01):\nAbsolutely. I'm only saying that because people may be wanting more of what you're describing and I will point them to our first episode, which gives deep on that one topic.\n\nElena Verna (00:15:09):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:10):\nExcellent. Anything else before we move on to number two?\n\nElena Verna (00:15:13):\nNo, let's move on to number two.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:14):\nLet's do it.\n\nElena Verna (00:15:16):\nNumber two, this is on the other side on the matured company where I see a trend over and over, and it's becoming even more prominent right now of when companies growth slows down, which inevitably happens for a lot of businesses, it happens for a variety of reasons. We're not going to go into the reasons as to why growth can be slowing down and then they hire a shiny growth head to fix the problem, to basically saying, \"Our business is slowing down. We are on the decline. We're going to bring this person, or we're going to put this team together and our growth is going to accelerate.\" That just does not happen. If you have the overall business slowing down, your head of growth is destined to fail because the reason business is slowing down is much deeper than not having a growth team.\n\n(00:16:03):\nGrowth team can optimize, growth can maybe lift it by 10, 15%. Maybe that's enough for you. Even that is on the upper end of what growth team will be able to do if there is a slow-down trajectory. But what's important is that if you have core product and core marketing issues, growth team will not be able to fix them for you. You're going to have to address the big elephant in the room as to why business is slowing down in the first place as opposed to just plopping a growth team on the issue and expecting them to do miracles while the rest of the business continues chugging on the same trajectory that caused the slowdown in the first place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:41):\nWow, I've never heard this point before and it's such an important one and it's very related to your first point. Growth isn't going to build a product people want, they will help you grow it\n\nElena Verna (00:16:53):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:54):\nIf your business is slowing, your product market fit basically might be disappearing and growth isn't solving that problem.\n\nElena Verna (00:16:59):\nDisappearing, it may be degrading, it may be being eaten by a competitor because there's somebody that is stomping on your territory. The point is growth can amplify great product market fit and growth can help you grow faster once you are already growing. But if you are slowing down and you have issues with either your go-to-market strategy or your core product strategy with your core product market fit, growth is going to be absolutely helpless to do anything. And it's honestly, it's a huge waste of money because at those size of the companies, you would make fairly large growth teams in order to tackle every single product flow and interface that is already out there and invented.\n\n(00:17:45):\nIt's a huge expense. ROI on it, maybe at least one to one. What you put into it, you might get that much out of it, but it's not going to be enough to create a J curve of the reacceleration by just relying on growth team. I think it's just like this is where the name growth team plays against it because, \"We're looking for growth. Do you have a growth team?\" No. I don't have a better idea by the way how to name it, but this is where I think it's misunderstood that there's the silver bullet of a perfect head of growth, perfect growth team that can reverse the trajectory of the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:26):\nThen for folks that are thinking about, \"Wow, maybe I should be hiring head of growth,\" when should you hire head of growth? When you're an established company,\n\nElena Verna (00:18:33):\nIf you are declining in your revenue growth or whatever other metric that you're looking at, your weekly active users or whatnot, see at least that you're able to plateau it so you can stop the decline. There is already a visible trajectory that your core product and your core marketing teams are able to at least reverse the degradation of the metrics. Ideally, you would even start to see some immediate signs of life that there is potential in the business, in the pockets, and then you can put growth into it to really blow it up to the full extent. But if you are on a decline, just don't do it because there's going to be very disappointing results in the year or so.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:18):\nAwesome. Great one, let's move on. Number three.\n\nElena Verna (00:19:23):\nNumber three, this is my favorite, and it might be a little spicy because if there's any marketers listening out here, but doing rebrand more specifically, homepage redesign to drive growth. This is what hurts me so much and I've lived through so many of these and never ever once have I seen a rebrand or redesign, especially a UK marketing site, produce good performance results. Now, there's many reasons as to why you might want to do a rebrand, why you might want to design your marketing site because you're trying to enter a new market, new category, your product has evolved and you need to do a full update. But those are almost like it's a logging indicator that something needs to change and you're changing it and then you know that you're going to have to optimize the hell out of it in order to actually bring it even to the previous performance results.\n\n(00:20:22):\nIt's like a stepping stone back, but there is a much bigger room for upside that you can get to, but you are going to have to work to get to that upside. But yet so many companies, there's a story that happens all the time. I hire a new CMO, new CMO comes in, they're like, \"What's inside my house here? My house is not designed to my liking. Let me repaint these walls. I want this shade of blue. Let me put the couches over here.\" And they start almost designing their website or designing the brand as if it was reflection of their personal taste. And oftentimes it's promised with our acquisition is going to go up, our category penetration is going to go up, our education or awareness is going to go up.\n\n(00:21:10):\nAnd it never materializes into anything meaningful because again, if you're doing it as a step towards unlocking new global maxima, sure, I love that. Do it. Go after it. Know that you have a ton of work ahead of you in order to actually unlock that global maxima. But to ever promise a homepage redesign or marketing site redesign in order to drive more acquisition is a failed promise that is going to be led by lots of agency money spending, often a million dollars plus, lots of arguing about which shade of blue your brand color is going to be, and eight to 10 months at the minimum of development and very lackluster results afterwards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:58):\nOh man, I'm loving this list already. This is great. To your point, it may still be worth doing if you're coming into it eyes wide open, this isn't going to drive growth, but we're setting ourselves up for a future brand that's world-class and we know our current brand stinks and our homepage needs to be refreshed. If you're aware, it's not going to drive growth, it might be okay.\n\nElena Verna (00:22:19):\nEvery single time I've seen a marketing site at least rebrand, it's been a step back in performance that then is being treated as a fire drill to fix. Just don't do it if you expect immediate results out of it, or at least educate the team on how long it's going to take to get to the point where you think that there's going to be upside away from your original brand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:48):\nI've experienced this not just with marketing sites, but most redesigns. Redesign of the product.\n\nElena Verna (00:22:53):\nProduct redesign. How much product and engineering work comes into just changing a logo in your product or changing colors? It's insane. With no results ever, there's no results.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:06):\nAnd to your point, it's like, \"We've spent six months redoing onboarding. Everything we've built builds on this new design and experience, we can't not launch it. Every team is working on this new world, we're just going to launch it and then we're going to claw back. We're going to figure out how to get it back.\" That's how it goes.\n\nElena Verna (00:23:26):\nIt's a new starting point and that starting point is going to be much lower than your current optimized experience that you have. Whether it's well optimized or not optimized, it doesn't matter. It's gone through some level of optimization versus rebrand is always a shot in the dark. It might be prettier, sure, but that doesn't mean it's going to perform well. Obviously never say never. Sometimes it might work, and if it worked for you, I am so glad. But that's an outlier and don't treat it as a pattern.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:57):\nAnd I was just going to say, I think everyone listening to this that is working on something like this is probably thinking, \"No, I think we have a good shot at this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:00):\n... is working on something like this is probably thinking, \"No, I think we have a good shot at this. We've really thought deeply about this and it might actually be really positive.\" In your experience, it sounds like you've seen it work occasionally, or is it just never?\n\nElena Verna (00:24:15):\nThe best I've ever seen is that it produced net neutral results and it produced us better ability to optimize towards something bigger. That's the best case scenario. So if you're working on it, my biggest advice is not to say you stop. Just understand that the goal here is not to drive at launch, in the seven-day readout after launch, some increased performance.\n\n(00:24:38):\nThe goal here should be, we will launch, we will probably see a hit, model out and forecast for a hit, and then give yourself two to three months at the minimum, ideally more like six months, to really optimize it back to a good standing where it can potentially outperform. But you need to bake in that three to six months of work after the launch, which is what a lot of companies and teams forget to do because they just move on. Because it's like big initiative, big pop, and off we go to our next project.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:08):\nI love that we're only at number three. This is amazing. Let's do number four.\n\nElena Verna (00:25:13):\nOkay. Number four is obsessing over your competition. Okay, so there's a little bit of a gotcha here. I tear down companies all the time. I have thousands of Gmail accounts that I sign up for any and every product. I go through their entire experience. I look at their monetization strategies. I look at their activation. I do it across direct competition of the company that I'm working with as well. I want to know what I'm playing against.\n\n(00:25:45):\nSo knowing what your competition is doing is extremely important. Being inspired by some aspects of what your competition is doing in their experience is a wonderful place to originate an ideation or potentially try to implement into your product as well. But blatantly saying, \"Hey, we're going to copy all of these best tactics or all of these flows because, hey, they're doing better than us. Let's just rip them and do exactly the same. Why isn't our onboarding looks the same as this onboarding? This company is so successful.\"\n\n(00:26:20):\nThat's where things really go wrong because every single experience is very unique to their customer, to their channel. You don't even know if you're getting their actual experience or you use some tester cell or you're getting some personalized thing based on where you signed up from, who you said that you are. So you don't even know what actually the overall thing looks like most of the time and putting that into your product, it just leads to very subpar results. And there's a lot of drive, especially to have it as a shortcut. \"Okay, we don't want to go through this ideation or user research. We don't want to do user interviews, but we don't want to do A/B testing. It works for them. It must work for us. Let's just go and do it.\" And it fails 95% of the time.\n\n(00:27:08):\nNow, there are certain pieces that I would rightly recommend. I already said inspiration. I use it for inspiration all the time. I'm like, \"Okay, what's cool? What is everybody doing?\" So because I want to just stay in the know on what other people are implementing and hopefully if it's in the control experience, it works and it worked better. I use web archives a ton for locked out pages too. I'm like, okay, how did it look last year? Why does their whole page look this way, or the pricing page? And I analyze that and I try to extrapolate some results.\n\n(00:27:40):\nI also think that there is a lot of patterns you start to notice as you start tearing down all of these companies. You're like, \"Oh, these elements are always the same.\" That means all of these companies are arriving to these things and they seem to be winning elements. And you can take those elements and put them into your product, but you can never skip the ideation, the design, the user research, the customer interview, the experimentation step.\n\n(00:28:04):\nAnd you should always balance it with actually innovating yourself in your product. Because copying competition is like the fastest way to mediocrity because you'll never be a leader if you copied somebody else. Leader is by default is somebody that is able to separate themselves from the pack in something else. And if you are trying to just be, I don't know who is ever trying to be the mediocre middle of the pack, but maybe it's a good starting point, but never the end goal.\n\n(00:28:37):\nThe only other thing that I'll say before I'll stop talking is benchmarks. Benchmarks are also very dangerous here to use because benchmarks are usually done on all of the competition, on all of the softwares out there. And the way people define numbers is so different from company to company. Even if you look as something as simple as signups. Okay, how many signups should you be on average getting? Or your conversion from prospecting visitor to a signup? Or from a signup to activated user? It's so depends on how do you define prospect visitor? Some companies define it as all traffic. Some define it as new traffic. Some of them define it on the new IP address, new persistent id. How Google analytics defines it. How Amplitude defines it.\n\n(00:29:21):\nSo all of these definitions are so different. So taking also any benchmark that is derived from competition and saying, \"This is where we should be,\" is also so dangerous because it might not even be applicable depending on how you define the metric. And one of the things that all of those benchmarking data fails is to actually look at specific definitions. And that's not to say that benchmarks are not extremely valuable data point in your decision making because it's an input that you should leverage to say what it could be possible. But to just blindly it and set it is just a sure way to fail any of your initiatives and efforts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:04):\nYou're telling me that there's no shortcuts?\n\nElena Verna (00:30:10):\nI wish there were. I mean, I've been doing this for over 15 years. If there were any shortcuts, I'd be all over them. There are patterns and there are frameworks, but there's no shortcuts.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:20):\nSo people hearing this, they're like, \"Okay, don't copy the competition. Use it for inspiration.\" It's a little hard to know exactly the line between those two. Is there an example that you can think of where you took really interesting inspiration from someone and it worked for a company you're working with? Or you copied someone and it's just like, \"Oh, that failed. That was a bad idea.\"\n\nElena Verna (00:30:41):\nI use competition to understand the general framework of how people collect some information or resolve certain steps. So, for example, a sharing model so many products like, \"Hey, can you share this with somebody?\" Well, you can go and spend so much time of figuring out how it should look. Or you can go to Slack, you can go to Figma, you can go to Nero, you can go to Notion. Like, okay, Google, how are they doing sharing model? You can look at all of that and say, \"Okay, here's all of the common elements that all of them have. Here's the pieces that I think will apply to my product. Here's things that do not, and here's what I can derive from it.\"\n\n(00:31:19):\nI use it as an input into ideation, but I never use it as a destination for the result, if that makes sense. Because it's very helpful to not start from scratch. The empty start problem is real and competition is a wonderful way to not have that and to have input into it, but never to just say, \"Oh, we can skip the design cycle off we go,\" or, \"Just slap our colors on it. If it works for them, it's going to work for us.\" So I have extensive Nero boards with everybody's onboarding flows, with everybody's pricing pages, their sharing model, their invite colleagues models that I reference all the time.\n\n(00:32:00):\nBut they've never been the exact thing that I would use for any company as opposed to say, \"Hey, I think this is a great starting point for you. Here are the things that I think will work very well for your company and for your product and take these elements. The rest you need to go and do themselves, so at least that way there's a starting point.\"\n\n(00:32:22):\nAnd this is why I also started doing a lot more of my own, almost, prototypes, like skeletons of here's the elements that you should do in these flows. I have one for pricing page, I have one for homepage, but you need to put in your own [inaudible 00:32:36] into it, in order for it to actually work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:39):\nWhat made me realize this back in the day was thinking at Airbnb, especially, thinking about people looking at our flow and being like, they've got it all figured out. We're just going to copy what they've done, so thoughtful and have tested everything. And knowing how that has not happened and how so much of this was guesswork and we hate so much of it. Just thinking about people trying to copy this thinking we know what we're doing. It's like, \"What are you guys even thinking?\"\n\nElena Verna (00:33:02):\nOh my God, I actually had that happen to me. At Dropbox not so long ago, somebody reached out and they're like, \"Oh, I looked.\" It was like some page on activation flow and they're like, \"Oh, I love this page. This is so cool. I love what you've done here. I'm going to go take it to my company.\" I'm like, \"We haven't touched it in 10 years. This page is only visible for small cohort of people. Please don't do it. Please don't copy it. It performs like shit. I know it's out there, but it's not meant to be out there. Nobody thoughtfully put it out there.\" So that's definitely a huge failure point that you can run into.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:42):\nRight, if it's like a fancy company, assume they're just so smart and diligent about every little pixel and decision.\n\nElena Verna (00:33:48):\nIf people only knew of how much craziness is happening in those big companies and how much chaos there is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:57):\nOh man, that's a whole other podcast episode.\n\nElena Verna (00:33:59):\nWhole other podcasts, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:00):\nOkay, number five.\n\nElena Verna (00:34:02):\nOkay, I have this one. It's a little bit Meta, but I see it happening all the time. We love to think that our problems are unique. I'm working in this company and we have this gross problem and we need to go and figure out the solution from the grounds up. Maybe this is a little bit related to the competition point, but I'm very sorry to break it to all of you, but your problem is not unique. I am 99% sure of that. Your problem has been felt by somebody somewhere in probably many, many places and you trying to re-engineer solution is time lost to market and has a huge opportunity cost.\n\n(00:34:49):\nSo my biggest thing that I try to get people is don't think that you have unique problems. You don't. I know we love to. It'd be fun to have something unique to learn, but with so many startups, with so many people in our industry, in your industry, whichever industry that is, your problem has been solved by somebody. Or at least that there's a lot of failures on the problem that you should be learning from. And number one thing that whenever you have an initiative or whenever you have a metric that you need to go and move, to not start from scratch, ever. Do not start from scratch. It's the worst thing that you can do because you can waste so many cycles on trying to do something that probably has already been solved, which means how do you approach this as a result?\n\n(00:35:41):\nWell, you can look at competition and how they're solving the problem. That's one input, for sure. You should go find people that have solved this problem because there are people there and people love to talk about what they do. So take advantage of that human psychology and go find those people and just ask them, \"How did you do it? What did you do? What happened?\" Obviously, not all the time everybody's going to respond, but we have LinkedIn, we have X. Go out there, find the people that you think or ask around in your network of who you think might have similar solutions and just go talk to people. It would be incredible shortcut if you're talking about an actual hack that is a hack to get to an optimal solution.\n\n(00:36:26):\nAnd then the last thing that I would also say is that solving any one problem uniquely is extremely inefficient. We are evolving so fast in our market, you need to be able to patternize your solutions. Patternize, is that a word?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:43):\nLet's make it a word.\n\nElena Verna (00:36:44):\nMake patterns. Make patterns out of your solutions. So more you can stop looking at as a unique data point or unique problem and more as there is, I need to fit it into existing pattern or I need to figure out the framework on how to solve not only this problem but other problems. The faster you'll be able to get at least to like 60% of the solution there. And then you can do very authentic implementation of whatever you want to do. But to go from zero to 60 manually, as a one-off, we do not have time in the industry right now to do it, unless you want to be left behind.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:23):\nBam. Powerful words. Is there an example that comes to mind of you doing this either the wrong way of just thinking this was unique and realizing I should have talked to people, or where you actually realized something was not unique?\n\nElena Verna (00:37:37):\nI'll give you actually an example that I had when I was at Nero. At Nero, we were first trying to stand up community, and I was tasked to do it, and I've never done it before. So I was banging my head around against the wall and I'm like, \"Okay, how do I do it? What software do we use? Where do we acquire users? What kind of content is going to go in there?\"\n\n(00:38:02):\nSo I was approaching it almost like a finding product market fit, and I will fail so much doing it. And I honestly only have a year to get to some sort of traction before this is going to get shut down because company is impatient, company is moving fast. So if this is going to be a failure point, it's either going to be taken away from me, which is fair, or we is going to close the door on it, which would be a huge failure both on my point and for company as a whole.\n\n(00:38:29):\nSo I went and I started talking to a bunch of people that have done communities, and I remember talking to Caroline from Atlassian who has stood up community. I actually hired her as an advisor afterwards and she's like, \"Well, are you talking about a user community or an agency community or a partner community?\" And I'm like, my mind was blown. I'm like, \"I even considering all of these angles because I was just literally thinking about users only.\" And she's like, \"Well, you shouldn't necessarily start with the user community. If you want some results out of it, go to agency or partner communities first.\" She would applying it to me in a structural way for me to grasp my head around it and then implement something that had much better results at the end that I wouldn't even gotten to probably until six, eight months later, if I didn't talk to her.\n\n(00:39:19):\nSo I think it has to come with a place of knowing that you don't know everything and humility to say, \"Hey, I need help,\" and I might have a already fancy title. At that point, I was an interim CMO at Nero and I'm like, \"I don't know how to do this.\" And it actually earns you a lot more credit than you think. And a lot of people are afraid to admit that they don't know how to solve a problem and that's why they start from scratch. But you need to really put your ego aside and get some help faster than trying to hit every single failure point along the way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:02):\nAnd the thing that'll really hurt your ego is failing. And so the more you could do to avoid failing and being successful with this initiative by talking to people, doing research.\n\nElena Verna (00:40:12):\nAnd to be fair, failure is going to be unavoidable. If you talk about growth, growth is about failure. My big motto, life motto on growth is that you have to fail to learn. You can't just constantly succeed. Success is an output of a lot of failures, but the question is, how much time do you have to fail? And a lot of times we don't realize how many failure cycles we're going to have to go through before we get a success, and that company, or even market, has no time for that. So still expect to fail, sure, but the timeline for failures is going to be shortened quite a bit.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:54):\nOkay, so we've gone halfway through your list. There's 10 items on this list, right?\n\nElena Verna (00:40:58):\nYes, yes. There's 10 items. Next one is a good one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:01):\nI'm excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:41:08):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:10):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta, Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:41:26):\nYes, so we just launched OneSchema file feeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:47):\nI can tell you that if team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema and not just to build it, but also to maintain it forever?\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:41:59):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multi-day outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:19):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us and if you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:42:33):\nLet me summarize the first five real quick and then we'll keep going. So the first is, wait longer than you think to hire a head of growth. Wait until you have product market fit, maybe a million, or especially if you're self-serve oriented.\n\n(00:42:45):\nNumber two is if your growth is declining, the head of growth won't solve that problem. First, stop the decline at least. Third is redesigning your homepage, marketing page. Rebranding is not only not going to help you grow, it's going to probably hurt growth and slow things down. And so just go into that wide eyes wide open.\n\n(00:43:07):\nFour is don't just copy the competition and assume they know what they're doing and assume that what they do is going to work for you. Use it as inspiration. On the other hand, look at get inspiration from experts, competition, trends, things like that to help you solve your problem, which you think is no one solved before. It turns out every problem you're solving someone has solved in some way, most likely.\n\nElena Verna (00:43:30):\nYes, especially in growth. I mean, I know this can apply to a lot of product management and to marketing as well, but in growth, when you're talking about how do I lift activation or have a really big drop off between activation and monetization? These things are a lot more patternized than you would expect them to be, so go and find those patterns as opposed to trying to re-engineer it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:55):\nAwesome. Okay, let's keep going. Number six.\n\nElena Verna (00:43:57):\nSo next one. Next one is a little spicy one too, and that is part of growth you owning some channels. A lot of growth teams own acquisition. So owning channels and growth prioritizing SEO, SEM, social, is one of the biggest mistakes I think a growth team can do. Now, obviously, I'm not saying don't do SEO, or don't do SEM, so organic search or paid search. I'm not saying that. However, as a growth team, your number one priority is to create your own or your earned channel. So channel that you've earned and that nobody else can compete in but you.\n\n(00:44:45):\nWhat do I mean by that? When you're doing organic search or paid search, you're making Google richer. Great for Google. Google is an incredible company, but by dumping money into paid marketing, you are paying them and you're paying for their distribution and access to their distribution. If you're doing social too, like you're doing, let's say, Instagram or whatnot, paid advertising in Instagram, that's great, but all of that works on algorithm. An algorithm can giveth, but algorithm can also taketh away at any point. And you have no control because you don't own those channels. You are playing with other players and you're competing against them in somebody else's channel.\n\n(00:45:29):\nNow, on the other side, there can be your own earned channel. What is earned channel? It really goes into the concept of product-led growth acquisition, which means you're relying on virality, on word of mouth, on user-generated content in order to attract new acquisition through top of the funnel. So why is that earned and why do I put that above, let's say organic search, which is SEO, obviously, is wonderful? But again, search just goes to Google. That's great. Versus if you build your own user-generated content in your own community, nobody else can compete with you in that. That is yours. Your competitors cannot buy their eyeballs. Their people are going to be attracting other people.\n\n(00:46:21):\nReferrals from people to people are everything. So, Lenny, if I, let's say I sign up for, say, Superhuman and I invite you into it. That is much stronger acquisition tactic versus you looking for and finding Superhuman, let's say on paid marketing advertisements. And especially with our age right now where search as an interface is changing towards AI interface and the AI interface is giving a lot less credit to all of the content. Content is almost becoming a database and there's a new UI that is being developed on it. Before it was Google was the UI, and now AI is coming in with a new UI, and there's not as much control that you have over this new UI that is being developed.\n\n(00:47:05):\nFocusing on these earned channels that you own becomes the outmost priority. And if you don't have them on your growth roadmap, you are going to be in some really big trouble over the next year to two years because your cost of acquisition is only going to go up. Your competition and those channel is only going to go up. You're constantly going to be praying to algorithm Gods to giveth your way, but again, they can taketh at any point. And it's really one of those fundamental growth team failure points if they don't spend enough time on virality and user generated content to create their own earned acquisition.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:48):\nWow. Okay. This is incredible. This is its own podcast episode in theory that we could do of how to actually do this. We're not going to cover the strategy. Also, this may not necessarily work for every company. Your point is, you can grow other ways, but this is by far ...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:00):\nYour point is you can grow other ways, but this is by far the most powerful, most effective, cheapest, most likely to succeed. If you can figure this out.\n\nElena Verna (00:48:08):\nIt's not cheapest. It's actually cost a lot of product and engineering and even marketing resources to stand up. So it's not the cost of a budget, but it's cost of people that will have to work to create your own channel, so to speak, for acquisition. And you're right, maybe that's not for everybody, but it's actually applicable to more products than people realize. Because, every single product has some sort of team functionality, some sort of roles that they need to do. Every product can drive word of mouth loop... Well, actually, that's not true. Not every product can drive word of mouth loop, but they can drive recommendations and they can create user generated content.\n\n(00:48:46):\nOne of those tactics usually applies to at least one product. So there is an opportunity to create some sort of earned channel, even though it might feel unnatural at the beginning depending on how you reach PMF and how you've scaled in the first couple of stages of it. But if you are not exploring it and if you are not investing into it or at least trying and failing within it, I think that you are really leaving too much of your growth future into the hands of somebody else that you have low control over.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:19):\nSo the advice here is your growth team. It's okay if they work on SEM, pay growth basically and SEO, but most of your effort and investment should be in earned channel, owned channels, specifically virality generated content?\n\nElena Verna (00:49:35):\nDiversify. Just diversify your strategy. So not all of it is reliant on somebody else giving you access to their distribution. Now, for example, a Dropbox, over 50% of acquisition comes through sharing. So I load something into my Dropbox, maybe I need to send it out for signature. Maybe I need to just share this file to transfer it to somebody. Maybe I just need to share this file as a final delivery to my clients that I was working with. Well, that recipient then is now aware of Dropbox, so it solved the brand awareness.\n\n(00:50:09):\nBy that action of sharing, you actually almost activated that recipient too, so you don't need to educate them anymore on how the product works and whatnot. And the percentage of those recipients sign up to become Dropbox users, and that accounts for 50% of acquisition. That is a stable earned channel that nobody can compete with, and it's only for Dropbox to lose, so to speak. And we actually had our own growth pod focused on it. Because to optimize both sender experience and the recipient experience, because it was such a powerful growth and growth engine that driven the company, and every business should have an attempt at one of these.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:51):\nI think this is going to be a really good push for a lot of growth teams to think about what could we do here? Number seven. Four to go\n\nElena Verna (00:50:58):\nNumber seven. We've talked about this at least a little bit in our last podcast too. But I see this as a question that comes up all the time and something that people are afraid of to invest, which is a mistake. Every single company starts with their growth efforts focused either on product-led growth. Hey, I'm going to have everything being done self-serve or on sales in marketing. I'm going to have sales team and then I'm going to have marketing team and they're going to do all of the work and my product is just going to create the functionality. And that's good and fine for a while depending on how long that while is. But not overlaying every single way that you can grow through product, through marketing and through sales as an evolution. Is a huge mistake that a lot of growth teams fail to iterate on and innovate on.\n\n(00:51:53):\nThe way that I best be comparing it is if product has a product-market fit, which is great, that product-market fit is not going to last that product forever. They're always going to have to have a second horizon. They're always going to have to have a product-market fit expansion efforts in order to continue to grab as many people and solve as many people's problems as possible and increasing their team. Well, the same comes with growth. If you have a growth model that works for you, that's wonderful, good for you. Optimize it, grow it, scale it, create a team that will be nurturing it and that will be amplifying it, but you're going to need to evolve it, and that evolution needs to come through overlaying other growth models on top of it. So, A, you are diversified away from just one growth model failing, because a lot of times you're going to get into a situation of law.\n\n(00:52:48):\nI love Andrew Chen's article here. It's called a Law of Shitty Clickthroughs. Where if you over-optimize the same thing over and over again, it has minimal returns, and some growth models have very limited time spans. Some of them are huge, some can grow for sharing loop at Dropbox. It's 17 years in the making and it's still firing. Good for it. That's amazing. But that's very much an anomaly. Most of growth loops spin out their ability to produce meaningful results for you within the first five to six to seven years.\n\n(00:53:21):\nSo continuously overlaying those different growth models, and what I'm specifically talking about is product-led growth, marketing- led growth, sales-led growth, and introducing it into this ecosystem constantly is what really separates companies that can continue growing for a long periods of times versus the ones that can see a really big blip, potentially even unicorn type of growth rates of 70, 80, whatever plus percent, and then it starts to slow down. And don't wait until that slowdown happens. You need to really start thinking about different ways that you can attract people to grow so you are not leaving a gap in the market that somebody else can enter and own. As opposed to you playing in every way in where you can interact with your customer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:13):\nThe way I think about this is the S-curves of every growth model and growth lever, right? Eventually it'll help and then slow down and see you want to find the next S-curve on things that'll grow your business.\n\nElena Verna (00:54:24):\nYes, absolutely. The way that I see it often is that especially when growth teams, they hit a really big result out of some initiative, they just keep trying to focus on that over and over again. And sometimes that focus is warranted. Like I said, our sharing loop at Dropbox has its own growth team against it. Great, but at the same time, a lot that's not warranted for all of the... Or you need to realize that there's not more choose to squeeze out of this thing and then you need to go and you need to move on.\n\n(00:54:57):\nWhich actually brings me to a little bit of a next thing too, is you need to do it every 18 months. Because a lot of them are going to fail. And every five years or so, you for sure need new channel, new growth loops, new tactics, new engines so to speak, to power your growth engine. Whether it's overlaying sales on top of self-serve, whether you're doing a lot of, let's say virality right now in terms of acquisition and you're going into marketing a lot heavier. But every five years something big has to start taking a big portion of your volume. And for that every 18 years you need to introduce something-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:39):\n18 months.\n\nElena Verna (00:55:40):\nSorry. Yeah. Every 18 months you need to introduce something new in order for it to continue evolving.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):\nAnd was that number eight of the list we're going through or that's like a bonus piece of advice?\n\nElena Verna (00:55:52):\nNo, that's just a bonus piece of advice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:55):\nOkay, cool. Okay, got it. And so the advice here essentially is you'll find something that is helping you grow, assume that will slow down at some point, start thinking about other levers and growth models to layer on top of that.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:08):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:10):\nSomething I've seen, let me know if you agree, is usually there's going to be one lever that has most of your growth for a long, long time, and so all other things are not going to be as big, but they are still important.\n\nElena Verna (00:56:20):\nSo the way I think about it is I try to focus 20 to 25% of growth teams time annually. Not every given sprint or not every given quarter, but annually to introduce a new growth loop, or to introduce a new channel, or to introduce something new that can potentially bring us additional umpth to our growth engine. I know that a lot of it is going to fail. None of it is gold on any growth metrics because you cannot goal it immediately, let's say on monetization or immediately acquisition. You're just going to cut it at its knees immediately if you're not going to let it evolve into something that can be monetized, that can be responsible for acquisition. So example on Mirrorverse, which is a user-generated content library of all of the mirror boards that people create, it took us probably 18 months until we started putting metrics expectations on it.\n\n(00:57:18):\nBefore that, it was a thing that we were testing. And it was being used by a lot of people, but we're like, we don't even know exactly quite how this is going to fit all together. And then it started taking off as both engagement engine as well as acquisition engine. But it's important to constantly give your team room to try those new ideas. Otherwise, you're going to find yourself that your growth loops and your growth engine is slowing down and you don't have time to find that second horizon. And that is the worst situation to be in. That's where growth starts to slow down. And to recover out of that is impossible because you need revenue. You need revenue, you need revenue, you need revenue. And these growth loops on average take six months, a year, a year and a half to start producing even visible revenue. So that's why you need to start layering it very soon into your initiatives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:13):\nTo make this even more concrete for people that are starting to like, oh, shit I got to do this. Can you just give us a list that doesn't have to be exhaustive of potential growth loops, levers, methods, engines for folks to consider? You've mentioned a few, but just give a list of people like, okay, got it. Maybe we'll try one of these.\n\nElena Verna (00:58:29):\nI'm really big on creating a growth loop out of user generated content. I think with everything that is happening with AI and SEO at the moment, your biggest claim to fame on content strategy will be harnessing user generated content. Whether it's user generated templates, whether it's user generated case studies, review, whatever it is you need to start investing into it now, creating a library out of it, using it for activation purposes, using it then for acquisition purposes, using community to spark the conversations around it. That can be a really wonderful strategy that everybody should consider of whether there's juice in it within your product. Other ones can be, hey, we're a very, let's say individualistic product, but can we actually create a referral mechanism for it?\n\n(00:59:23):\nFor B2C, that's actually very straightforward. A lot of B2C products thrive on referrals. For B2B, It can be more of invitation of other team members into the product to complete other jobs to be done. Hey, I've done this. I need my manager to see it. Can I create a report to share with my manager? And all of a sudden it starts to spread within the company. So creating additional almost product functionality that then creates these loops potentially for you. So it can be a slew of things. Obviously, I would highly recommend just understanding all of the menus of these earned tactics. I should do a blog post on it actually. And then just see what works for you or not. Because at least ideation step a bit has to happen. If especially you're relying on search engines for your acquisition, start thinking about some of the earned channels as soon as possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:22):\nAnd even though you recommend spend more time on earned channels, owned channels, there's also explore SEO, explore paid growth, right? Sales?\n\nElena Verna (01:00:33):\nAbsolutely. I mean, almost everybody that's paid, arguably almost too soon potentially. There's a point to make that shouldn't be. A company should not be doing paid right now, but SEO, social resellers, all of those are wonderful tactics. Obviously, I skew very heavily towards earned channels just because once you stand that up, that's a gift that just keeps on giving and nobody can take that away from you. But that doesn't mean that other tactics and other channels should not be explored as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:06):\nAmazing. Let's keep going. So we have three to go. Number eight.\n\nElena Verna (01:01:10):\nSo number eight, this one's kind of a doozy and I think a lot of people don't do it. I don't know why they don't do it. I think it's such an incredible ability to propel forward. And that is, what doesn't work, as I said in the previous growth tactics, is trying to think that each problem is unique and you need to solve it on your own. Maybe this is not so much does it work, but not hiring advisors is something that I do not recommend for you to do. You can get access to anybody for one hour a week. Yeah, you'll have to pay them. So nobody's going to volunteer their hour. We're all very, very busy. But hiring advisors is the biggest career amplification and your business amplification can possibly do. Because to create a network of people that have all of these data points and those all of the other patterns that you can do is something that can just propel you so far forward.\n\n(01:02:16):\nThat doesn't mean you have to do everything advisor says. That's not the point. They're not the strategy setter. But they are additional input into your decision-making that you otherwise wouldn't have. You can go and hire somebody from Atlassian. You can go and hire somebody from Airbnb that have been and lived through all of this and they can help you solving your problem. So I think any growth team that does not have an advisor is a growth team that is underperforming. Because even me who I've advised so many companies, I've operated at so many companies, I don't know everything. Every time I take an operator role, I hire advisors for myself. Because that is the fastest way to learn anything, and I often see these teams that just try to figure out everything on their own and not have any advisors on their boards, so to speak.\n\n(01:03:11):\nI'm not even talking like an official board. I'm talking not even an advisory board. But you can hire somebody as a contractor that will be your advisor, I think is a huge mistake, especially in this day and age. Because we have a big asymmetry of information. In our field, there's very little available to learn because we're all very cagey because of competition. But at the end of the day, people know a lot of the stuff and how it worked for them internally, and I highly, highly encourage you to not try to wing it on your own.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:45):\nAlong those lines, there's also advice of just like, don't worry about advisors. You never know if they're going to be useful. There's all these hanger-ons that join your startup and want to help, but they're not helpful. If you give one tip for a founder or team that's interviewing advisors, looking for an advisor to vet them to help them find people that are actually great, what would your tip be?\n\nElena Verna (01:04:07):\nI have actually a good one. Many advisors might not like it though. I think that you should not hire an advisor until you do some sort of workshop with them on the problem that you're experiencing. See them in action. See what kind of information they can provide to you, because any advisor that is cagey about what they know is not the type of advisor that you're going to want to have on your team. You want to have somebody that has lived through it that can talk to you, to your face about it, that is able to have hard conversations. That is able to provide you necessary examples. That is able to give you and connect dots for you for necessary patterns. So instead of just saying, \"Oh, this person looks good, let me hire them as an advisor.\" Say, \"Hey, let's have a workshop first. I have this problem. I think that you can help me fix it.\"\n\n(01:04:57):\nPay them for it, whatever their rate is for that workshop, for sure. See how they actually interact with your team and then hire them on ongoing retainer bases. Because that creates an interview loop that is very practical, that is very quick to understand whether you can work with them, they can work with you, and whether they have anything to contribute to you. And then every single month evaluate whether that advisor should stay with you. Some advisors, they only need to be with the company for three months and off they go, that's fine. Some of them might stick with you for four or five years, but every single month you should go and say, did they add any value? I'm not saying that advisors should have any monetary expectations like revenue attribution, so to speak to them. But did you find value in having conversations with them? Did they offer anything valuable to you?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:49):\nThat was an awesome tip. And I could see why people would be like, \"God damn. Elena, don't say that.\" It makes so much sense. Here we go. Number nine. Here we go.\n\nElena Verna (01:05:59):\nMy last one is also that I see something way too often nowadays on growth teams specifically. This is very, very gross problem. And that is too much risk averseness on growth, where you're starting to test everything. If every single one of your initiatives that you're doing on growth is an experiment, that's a problem and that is something that you should take a look at and say, what am I doing and why do I need a precise scientific measurement for every single thing that I touch in order for it to go to production or to hit the market?\n\n(01:06:47):\nIt's almost like a disease, like a paralyzing disease, that slows down progress, that slows down velocity, that slows down learnings, that creates very terrible consequences to the output that growth teams produce. And it's a little bit counterintuitive, because experimentation is a way to do growth for growth teams and it's their process. Growth teams are meant to experiment, but I also think that experimenting on everything is something that is quite terrible once the team starts to get locked into that state, and it's really hard to get out of because they're then afraid to do any change until or unless that they test.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:39):\nSo where do you find that balance? I imagine people hearing this are like, oh, yes, this makes sense to me, and then they continue to test basically everything. What's kind of some heuristics you'd recommend for knowing, okay, just don't test that. Don't worry about it. You don't need credit for that win.\n\nElena Verna (01:07:52):\nFirst of all, I think that people should trust their intuition a little bit more. Data is good, but data is only good if you have enough of it. So if you have low volume real estate, that is going to take you eight months to reach some sort of answer. Do you really want to test it for eight months? What's the point of it? My rule of thumb, if we cannot collect the sample size in the month, we shouldn't test it, period. Because it's just then it's not fast enough. We should just go and do pre versus post. Pre versus post is pretty powerful. It's also a way to assess your impact and you can still roll back if it doesn't work. But don't think that everything needs a scientific explanation to whether it needs to be moved forward or not.\n\n(01:08:36):\nAlso, experimentation cannot be the way that people make decisions in the company. There's still so much about knowing your user, understanding the market for your brain to connect all of those dots and to know what needs to be an experience that your customers are going to want. That if scientific data, like a very tight determination of the probability that this is a success, it's important, absolutely do it because it might be a really big strategical pivot that you're planning to do. So it's a data point to validate that all of this extra work will be needed. It might be a very high traffic real estate that even 0.1% difference will mean millions of dollars for you.\n\n(01:09:17):\nBut other than that, it should be just go, go, go. Do pre versus post. By the way, I'm not saying just release and move on. Release, do seven day, 24 hour readout, seven day readout, 28 day readout, even come back to it a year later and measure some of the retention or extension data that is associated with it.\n\n(01:09:38):\nBut to test everything is debilitating to growth teams and app paralyzes them in its place. So kind of look at your initiatives and say, where do I need precision? And it's important and I can get it best in that versus where we should just go for it. And yeah, we will fail there too, and that's okay. And we can roll back and we can figure out how to make it better. But failure is going to happen regardless.\n\n(01:10:08):\nIn statistics, six is tricky. Many people take it for face value versus it's just like a directional data point to say there's likely new distribution that has maybe a different mean, and 5% of the chances. If you measure in 95% statistical significance, you might not even be there, and yet really take it for so granted. Oh, it's going to drive this much lift. So I just think that people stop in this age of data, almost rely enough on their element intuition.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:42):\nA lot of contrary intakes here. I love this. Elena, we've reached number 10. And I know number 10 is like a special one where it's more than one. Quick. Fire.\n\nElena Verna (01:10:53):\nSo number 10 is going to be my little fire round. My fire round on little things that I just see people spending way too much time on it. It hurts my heart, because it's not going to drive any results on them. So number one. Color optimizations. Because the love of God, a blue is a blue is a blue. As long as it's accessible and as long as it's bright enough, off you go. You do not need to test the shades of blue or test it against green or so on. Pick a color, move on, please don't spend time on it. That's an early 2000s tactic. It doesn't work anymore. We pass that in technology sector.\n\n(01:11:26):\nNumber two. Third party signups. A lot of times we think, oh, we're going to get so much more acquisition if we add Google Auth or if we add Facebook Auth or Slack Auth or Microsoft Auth, whichever auth you want to add to it. In some cases, it's very important to have third party auth. So for example, if you are a developer product, please have a GitHub auth. It's kind of unnecessary. The developers already have the account there, have them connect with it as opposed to create a new one. However, if you're a productivity product, email is fine for the longest time. Gmail is nice. It's not going to drive more acquisition for you. You're just going to do a makeshift, and two more people...\n\nElena Verna (01:12:00):\n... more acquisition for you. You're just going to do a makeshift and two more people using it. It's not going to create incrementality, it's not going to improve your activation, it's not going to improve your retention. It's not a growth tactic. It's part of you just customer experience that you want to invest into. Number three, on the fire round, one email wonders. We stress too much about this one email that we're going to send to this one customer group. And we're like, oh gosh, how much lift is it going to cost? It'll never cause any lift. You will never work as a one-off email. Too few people open it on average, 25% open rate. At best you'll get 40 to 50% open rate. Too few people click it. One email will never do anything. If you're going to go into email, please think about it as a series about communication, about how it interacts with product communication.\n\n(01:12:48):\nIt's a whole strategy. It's a whole thing. Please don't stress about one-off email. Never test a change in one email. It'll never work. You're going to have to do the whole god damn thing and see how it's going to do. Not just one email, just never going to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:03):\nI'm definitely guilty of this one. That is a really good one for sure. And it's so obvious in hindsight, so I love that you share that.\n\nElena Verna (01:13:09):\nYes. And then the last one, growth teams are often too obsessed about removing friction. Because if we remove the steps, then more people are going to get to the destination. And to an extent, if you cause horrible friction in your product where it's just confusing about what the next step is, I agree, go fix the friction of the cognitive load that it takes to complete a step. That is the friction that you should be working on. However, just removing steps or yanking or simplifying things to an oblivion where you lose an identity of what you even do or what you're capable of doing is a completely failed growth tactic. So simplifying may be an initiative of a different problem that you're solving, but if you ever have a line item on your roadmap that says simplified onboarding, please cross it out. It's not going to work because simplifying onboarding is an action.\n\n(01:14:08):\nWhat is the problem that you're solving? You're never trying to solve a problem of simplifying. You always have a problem of people are confused in it, but people don't know where to go or they get lost in it or they're not educated enough. That is the problem. And simplifying might be a solution, but it can never be a problem on its own. And too many growth teams are just obsessed with this notion that came out I think in early 2000s, like, oh, simplifying is the biggest growth hack that you can do. Do it. It's only a solution to a very specific problem set of too much complexity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:48):\nWow, that was a big one to end on. That I think will help a lot of people avoid wasting time. Again, a whole other podcast conversation probably focus just on onboarding advice that you probably have, that I know you have. We've reached the last item. Is there anything else you want to share about this list before we move on?\n\nElena Verna (01:15:07):\nNo, I think we've spent too much time. We're ready to go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:09):\nNot too much. Just enough time. And kind of on a note, I want to call an audible, and so we were going to talk through all of your favorite frameworks. I like the way this conversation has gone. I don't want people to get overwhelmed with information. So one idea is just list maybe your favorite growth frameworks just for folks to go check these out and not spend too much time on each one.\n\nElena Verna (01:15:30):\nYep, let's do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:31):\nOkay.\n\nElena Verna (01:15:32):\nGreat. So the list of my favorite growth frameworks. And to me framework by the way, it's not a solution, it's a pattern. It's a pattern that exists across almost every single company out there and it's a starting point for your ideation and to figure out how you can almost shortcut to possible list of solutions as opposed to trying to figure out too hard of how to even define a problem on its own. So number one, it's probably expected if anybody has read anything or listened to me talk is growth loops. I think anybody who thinks about growth and anybody who thinks about growth in the funnel fashion versus understanding what the growth loops are is missing out on the ability to create sustainable growth engine. So it's very important to think about action, reaction that generates another action and it's a self-contained flywheel they can spin. A lot of resources on it at Reforge, Brian Balfour and Casey Winters and Andrew Chen wrote a lot about this.\n\n(01:16:33):\nHighly recommend anybody looking into. My next favorite growth framework's actually written by you, Lenny, and Dan, which is a race car framework. Everybody has a really hard time often thinking about what are all of them parts of growth initiatives and which are long-term, short-term, how much are they going to actually produce in results? And race car framework is wonderful because it separates different initiatives into, hey, there's some engines, loops that are just going to keep on spinning. There's some fuel that you're going to need to add into it, potentially like paid marketing dollars. There are some turbo boosts that you may have in your race car that are going to be, let's say big user conferences that you're going to hold as a product or there's [inaudible 01:17:22] and optimizations that you're going to need to do pouring oil into that engine so that actually performs correctly. It's beautiful. I talk about it all the time with everybody.\n\n(01:17:31):\nThe next favorite growth framework for me comes from Bengali and that's adjacent to user theory. I think that was very powerful in terms of thinking about growth evolution. And as we talked about adding different growth models to your growth ecosystem, different growth loops, but also adjacent users which are outside of your ideal customer profiles or ICP, outside of your core user and how growth team can really bring them in and add additional oomph to your product without even expansion of product market fit by just optimizing their experiences. I'm going to stop at these three because I think those are the most powerful ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:09):\nCool. On that last one, [inaudible 01:18:11] Bengali was on the podcast. We'll link to that episode if you want to go deeper on the adjacent using user theory. I love how that was a few minutes on things that could change people's life if they adopt one of these frameworks and learn how to think about growth in this way. It's such a powerful mental model for thinking about all this stuff you've been talking about this entire conversation.\n\nElena Verna (01:18:30):\nYes, those frameworks are like my church in my mind of my system of beliefs of how I think about growth and how I think about it on a strategic level of owning it as a strategy, not just like a tactic or an initiative.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:47):\nThe church of Elena Verna. Amazing. Okay, so before we wrap up, I want to bring us over to Contrarian Corner, recurring segment on this podcast where I like to ask the guest if there's something they believe that most other people don't believe. Contrarian opinion you might say. Is there anything that comes to mind?\n\nElena Verna (01:19:08):\nI do have a very contrarian opinion, although it's not so much related to growth as opposed to maybe your personal growth and my contrarian opinion is that full-time jobs are not the best way to monetize the skill that you have. It's one of the packages that everybody should evaluate and take advantage of, but too many people blindly default to that package and don't explore other options that are both available on the market as well as best suited for their personalities, for their interests, and for their skill set. It's like a default plan that everybody subscribes to that is faulty in itself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:57):\nWow. Okay. Wait, we got to hear more. So what are some other packages? I think we're buying some of these packages, these other options, but I guess what should people be thinking about when you say this in terms of what can they actually do and explore?\n\nElena Verna (01:20:08):\nI'll premise it to saying I don't want to rain parade on full-time roles. They're wonderful on video ability, to learn to get the expertise and depending on which career stage you are at full-time roles might be the absolute necessity for you to move on to and unlock the next level. However, full-time roles boxes into one company that may not be a great fit for us culturally, for our skills, for our ambitions, for our interests. Life is too short for that and ability to really go and figure out your own best monetization model, just like you work on that for your business, you should work for that on yourself without an assumption oftentimes is the only option that you should have.\n\n(01:20:56):\nSo what are the other options? There's so many, obviously the couple known ones. Freelancing, you can be a contractor. I do a lot of advising and consulting because for my brain of how I work and how I like to puzzle solve and pattern match, it works much better to be horizontal across many companies versus vertical on one specific one. But that doesn't mean I still don't take those vertical engagements to deepen my knowledge into any specific topic. But overall it's a lot more interesting for me to pattern match across multiple companies and help them grow as opposed to just focusing on one.\n\n(01:21:34):\nThere's interim engagements where there's a predetermined end date to your agreement. There's fractional engagements where you're working part-time on something as opposed to engulfing yourself completely. There's other ways to create courses, there's a way to create newsletters and monetize them like you're doing such a fantastic job. So there's just so many options and people are sometimes paralyzed by fear of instability, that it creates when you start to explore other options because you don't have that contract with that one company that provides you that paycheck every two weeks to rely on. But at the same time you can create diversification for your career and you depend on when you need to pull that trigger and when is the right time for you to explore. But to spend your entire career only assuming full-time is the only way I think is a complete mistake that a lot of people are doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:33):\nOne of my favorite posts of yours along these lines, which is around increasing... What you want to do is increase optionality and I guess talk about that because I think it's a really powerful piece of advice.\n\nElena Verna (01:22:46):\nSo this advice of career optionality, being the ultimate north star for anybody in their professional journey is something that I'm very strong on because a lot of people have the goal of, I don't know, maybe I want to be a VP or I want to become a CEO. Or I don't know, I want to be a manager and I want to people manage. And this becomes their north star and they start working towards it. But a lot of people when they get to their perceived corporate ladder north stars find themselves extremely dissatisfied, depressed even by how terrible that job is. Could people manage your job? I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy because it's a terrible job if you don't enjoy it and you don't know if you're going to like it until you actually do it.\n\n(01:23:33):\nSo I think setting a title as your goal, which so many of us have titles as goals, is very wrong way to think about it as opposed to saying, \"Hey, my goal professional is actually to have options so I can choose what I want to do. So I can choose what fits my life right now that I can choose what fits my skills and that fits my personality and that makes me happy.\"\n\n(01:23:54):\nAnd to get career optionality, if that's your goal, you start thinking about your progression a lot differently. You're not starting to think about it of what will get me to the next title. You start thinking about what will can I do next year that will increase my option pool? And that's very different than just getting to a higher title. And if you start thinking about evaluating opportunities or whether you should stay at the company, whether you should move at the company from the lens of does it increase my options if I stay at this company for one more year or does it keep it the same or does it actually potentially decrease? That is the right way to find your ultimate happy place and happy job that brings you energy, that brings you happiness versus just going for a title and then being very disappointed with what that brings along with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:48):\nAmazing advice. So important and something I'll add that I think is a balance to what people may be feeling here is like, oh, I'll just bounce around all the best logo companies and create this killer resume. I think you also need to build depth and actual experience that you can tap into if you do any of these things. For example, a lot of people want to jump to like I'm going to be a newsletter person, I'm going to start a podcast, be an advisor before they've done anything real and you have nothing to actually base your advice on and that part is very important.\n\nElena Verna (01:25:16):\nYou have to earn your right to unlock optionality and earning that right does usually lie within full-time jobs. That is a universal truth. But then at some point you should start not just looking at full- time jobs as the only option that you have. You should start to think about when can you start unlocking new ones and testing the market on it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:39):\nThe other point is that you've been a great example of is it's not a one-way door. You can have full-time job, go to something else, go back to full-time job, be an advisor, be an intern person, be a newsletter person. You do that really well.\n\nElena Verna (01:25:53):\nYou should have to do it all. It's all a menu of options and you pick a menu item that fits your best in any given point of your life. It's never say never and never shut the door on anything. Absolutely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:03):\nOh my god, Elena, this was incredible. Before we get to our very exciting lighting round, is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with, maybe a last nugget or thought or not because covered a lot already.\n\nElena Verna (01:26:13):\nNo, I think we've covered so much. I don't want to overwhelm.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:16):\nLet's do it. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nElena Verna (01:26:21):\nYes, I'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):\nFirst question, surprise, surprise. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nElena Verna (01:26:27):\nOkay, so I just finished this book that I love so much, it's not a professional book, but it's Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir. It's the same author that wrote Martian. Martian also was made into a movie. So good, so good. Can't put it down. I think I read it like two days straight. So highly recommend that. And the next one that I also started reading right now is Body Burst. Body Burst is so good. It's actually takes into account AI and how we can upload our consciousness in AI and what can happen with that. So highly recommend that, I think it's actually closer to what potentially can be in the truth for us in the future than not. But I'm a big sci-fi geek, so I read mostly sci-fi books.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:14):\nI have a sci-fi recommendation for you that comes from Noah Smith. I love his newsletters called Noah Opinion and he has a list of his favorite sci-fi books that I've been working my way through. It's called, you may have read it by Werner Vogel, Fire Upon The Deep. Have you heard of this?\n\nElena Verna (01:27:14):\nNo, I have not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:29):\nOkay. It's described as not a sci-fi but space, like a space opera where it's epic, the most epic scale of universe story.\n\nElena Verna (01:27:38):\nI'll download it tonight, it'll be on my list.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:41):\nIt takes a little bit to get into. It's quite unique, but you just keep going and it's incredible and AI plays a big role in it actually.\n\nElena Verna (01:27:48):\nThat's awesome. I'll download it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:27:49):\nThere you go. Okay, question number two. Favorite recent movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nElena Verna (01:27:55):\nYes. I just got to watching Beef on Netflix. It's so good. I'm not going to spoil it for anybody, Beef. You should watch it. It's a limited series. It's so good. It will run through. I love Veep on HBO. So funny. I've probably watched it two times already the entire series and I'll probably watch it more because it just cracks me up every time. I think this is actually how our government works, so I'm very intrigued by that. And then the last one that I really liked that is coming up with the season two now. So you should catch up with season one is Last One of Us. If you don't like zombie movies or zombie shows, don't watch it. But if zombie and apocalypse is your cup of tea, Last One of Us is so good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:44):\nOr the Last of Us? Or Last One of Us? Last of Us.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:44):\nIs it Last of Us?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:48):\nI'm Googling while we talk, Last of Us. I think it's Last of Us. Yeah, the Last of Us.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:53):\nOh, Last of Us. Okay, Last of Us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:56):\nYou're saying there's a third season coming soon. That's exciting. I didn't know that.\n\nElena Verna (01:28:58):\nYeah, it's so good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:00):\nOkay, I love it as well. Great pick. Okay. Your favorite product you recently discovered that you really like?\n\nElena Verna (01:29:08):\nI recently discovered that they make heated shoes and that changed my life. My feet are always cold and they are boots that actually have heated wires through them and I'm obsessed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:22):\nAnd are you like charging it, like USB plugin kind of thing?\n\nElena Verna (01:29:25):\nYeah, I just come in, I plug them in and then I go outside and I'm warm and I think it's magical. I have a jacket, also heated jacket, now I have shoes. I just need my gloves and I'll be all set.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:40):\nI love the USB powered clothing. And we should know you live not in Silicon Valley, you live on the East Coast sort of?\n\nElena Verna (01:29:46):\nCentral. In Central. The coldest it gets is 30s here, but I'm always cold, so this is just my love language is something heated that I can sit on. I'm that cat sits underneath the light all the time. And then I also just got AirPod Max, my headphones. I couldn't connect it to my computer. Still technical issues on that, but I love them. The sound is amazing. That's my new favorite gadget that I'm obsessed about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:14):\nWhat a cool combination, heated shoes and AirPods. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to that you find useful in work and life?\n\nElena Verna (01:30:25):\nYeah, it's really one, progress over perfection. I think that you just need to... The velocity of information is far more important than something that I think is perfect and perfection is an outcome that you get to. But progress over perfection all day, any day.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:47):\nVery appropriate for a head of growth person.\n\nElena Verna (01:30:51):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:51):\nFinal question. You're not only one of the smartest people I've met on growth, you're also one of the funniest people on social media, especially on LinkedIn. If people aren't following you, they should. They will not only learn, they'll also be highly entertained. Is there a favorite meme that you created that you are very proud of that you can describe that we might want to link to?\n\nElena Verna (01:31:13):\nYeah, so I also want to say a lot of people hate me for doing so much memes as well because they think it's not serious. And I actually, I want to rebuttal that really quickly because I think humor is the best way to disarm people and to point out very painful situations that we're facing with every single day or conundrums without putting anybody on defense. Because we can all laugh at the absurdity of the lives that we live in every single day. And a picture's worth a thousand words. And sometimes memes are just the best way to communicate the most complex situations that we are facing within our corporate world. And they help us understand how common all of those situations are. We're not unique. You're not feeling alone by feeling down about what happened. Everybody's going through the same thing. So that's why I love memes because they help connect people on both sides.\n\n(01:32:05):\nEven if you're making fun of one side because they're like, yeah, that is true and this is so funny. So I'm a big proponent of that just because I think it's actually a better way to both unite people and just talk about hard problems that otherwise would be not read if you put it in words.\n\n(01:32:26):\nBut my favorite meme is actually one of the first ones that I've created and I think it's from Family Guy where they have an elephant and the penguin standing and then there's Moses I think, or some biblical character saying, \"What the hell is this?\" Looking at the elephant and the penguin. And the result of it is a child that has a penguin body and an elephant head. And if you think about elephant as product and penguin as marketing, what the hell is this is gross. Which is a byproduct, a weird, weird byproduct, product and marketing merged together that doesn't really fit with either, yet it's its own entity. I don't know. I think that that's the best to describe to people what [inaudible 01:33:14] is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:14):\nSo appropriate. Also, it's hard to describe a meme and make it feel funny. So good job. Thank you for doing that. We'll link to this meme in our show notes. Elena, this was incredible. Thank you again. Thank you for being our first ever third return guest. Hopefully there will be many more episodes of Elena Verna. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nElena Verna (01:33:37):\nFind me on LinkedIn or my Substack. I'm not competing with you Lenny, but I share a lot of my thoughts and everything that I learned on my own Substack. It's just elenaverna.com. LinkedIn is for all of my memes, so go there if you want to laugh, but if you want to learn from what I'm learning, go to my Substack. And how you can be useful? Tell me what problems you're facing now. Don't tell me, oh, how growth is slowing down, what should I do? I can't help you with that, too broad, but if you're having a situation, there's often really good [inaudible 01:34:09] for me to go and write about it or to do more research about it. So I just love to hear what some people's minds, so I can both help them connect their dots as well as learn about it myself.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:20):\nAnd what's the best way for them to do that? Is it like DM me on LinkedIn, any other-\n\nElena Verna (01:34:24):\nDM me on LinkedIn or just reply to my Substack newsletter email. It goes directly into my personal inbox, so I read every single one of them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:32):\nThat's a really good tip. People don't know that when you get an email on Substack, if you reply, just goes straight to the author.\n\nElena Verna (01:34:37):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:38):\nElena, thank you so much for being here.\n\nElena Verna (01:34:41):\nOkay, thank you for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:43):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:34:45):\nThank you so much for listening.
