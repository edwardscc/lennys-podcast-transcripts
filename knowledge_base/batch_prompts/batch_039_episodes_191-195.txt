So a world kind of after code, I think that more and more being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:16):\nWhat is the most counter-intuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor?\n\nMichael Truell (00:00:20):\nWe definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nWhat's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role?\n\nMichael Truell (00:00:29):\nMany people you hear hire too fast, I think we actually hired too slow to begin with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:35):\nYou guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year and a half, which is historic. Was there an inflection point where things just started to really take off?\n\nMichael Truell (00:00:43):\nThe growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential. And exponential to begin with feels fairly slow when the numbers are really low, and it didn't really show off to the races to begin with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):\nWhat do you think is the secret to your success?\n\nMichael Truell (00:00:53):\nI think it's been...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nToday, my guest is Michael Truell. Michael is co-founder and CEO of Anysphere, the company behind Cursor. If you've been living under a rock and haven't heard of Cursor, it is the leading AI code editor, and is at the very forefront of changing how engineers and product teams build software. It's also one of the fastest growing products of all time, hitting 100 million ARR just 20 months after launching, and then 300 million ARR just two years since launch.\n\n(00:01:22):\nMichael's been working on AI for 10 years. He studied computer science and math at MIT, did AI research at MIT and Google, and is a student of tech and business history. As you'll soon see, Michael thinks deeply about where things are heading, and what the future of building software looks like. We chat about the origin story of Cursor, his prediction of what happens after code, his biggest counter-intuitive lessons from building Cursor, where he sees things going for software engineers, and so much more.\n\n(00:01:49):\nMichael does not do many podcasts. The only other podcast he's ever done is Lex Fridman, so it was a true honor to have Michael on.

Thank you for having me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:33):\nWhen we were chatting earlier, you had this really interesting phrase, this idea of what comes after code. Talk about that, just the vision you have of where you think things are going in terms of moving from code to maybe something else.\n\nMichael Truell (00:04:45):\nOur goal with Cursor is to invent sort of a new type of programming, a very different way to build software, that's kind of just distilled down into you describing the intent to the computer for what you want in the most concise way possible, and really distilled down to just defining how you think the software should work, and how you think it should look. With the technology that we have today, and as it matures, we think you can get to a place where you can invent a new method of building software that's [inaudible 00:05:16] higher level, and more productive, in some cases, more accessible too.\n\n(00:05:21):\nAnd that process will be a gradual moving away from what building software looks like today. I want to contrast it with maybe the vision of what software looks like in the future that I think... A couple of visions that are in a popular consciousness that we at least have some disagreement with. One is, there's a group of people who think that software building in the future is going to look very much like it does today, which mostly means text editing, formal programming languages, like TypeScript, and Go, and C, and Rust. And then there's another group that kind of thinks you're just going to type into a bot, and you're going to ask it to build you something, and then you're going to ask it to change something about what you're building, and it's kind of like this chatbot, Slackbot style where you're talking to your engineering department.\n\n(00:06:10):\nAnd we think that there are problems with both of those visions. I think that on the chatbot style end of things... And we think it's going to look weirder than both. The problem with the chatbot style end of things is that lacks a lot of precision. If you want humans to have complete control over what the software looks like, and how it works, you need to let them gesture at what they want to be changed in a form factor that's more precise than just, \"Change this about my app.\" In a text box, removed from the whole thing. And then the version of the world where nothing changes we think is wrong, because we think the technology is going to get much, much, much better.\n\n(00:06:54):\nAnd so a world after code, I think that it looks like a world where you have a representation of the logic of your software that does look more like English, you have written down... You can imagine in [inaudible 00:07:08] form, you can imagine in kind of an evolution of programming language towards pseudocode. You have written down the logic of the software, and you can edit that at a high level, and you can point at that. And it won't be the impenetrable millions of lines of code, it'll instead be something that's much Terser, and easier to understand, easier to navigate. But that world where the kind of crazy, hard to understand symbols start to evolve towards something that's a little bit more human-readable, and human-editable, is one that we're working towards.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:36):\nThis is a profound point. I want to make sure people don't miss what you're saying here, which is that what you're envisioning in the next year essentially is kind of when things start to shift, is, people move away from even seeing code, having to think in code in JavaScript and Python, and there's this abstraction that will appear, essentially pseudocode, describing what the code should be doing more in English sentences.\n\nMichael Truell (00:07:59):\nYep. We think it ends up looking like that, and we're very opinionated that that path goes through existing professional engineers, and it looks like this evolution away from code. And it definitely looks like the human still being in the driver's seat, and the human having both a ton of control over all aspects of the software and not giving that up. And then also the human having the ability to make changes very quickly, having a fast duration loop and not just having something in the background that's super slow and takes weeks, go do all your work for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:08:33):\nThis begs the question for people that are currently engineers, or thinking about becoming engineers, or designers, or product manager, what skills do you think will be more and more valuable in this world of what comes after code?\n\nMichael Truell (00:08:50):\nI think taste will be increasingly more valuable. And I think often when people think about tastes in the realm of software, they think about visuals, or taste over smooth animations, and coloring things, UI, UX, et cetera on the visual design of things. And the visual side of things is an important part of defining a piece of software, but then, as mentioned before, I think that the other half of defining a piece of software is the logic of it, and how the thing works.\n\n(00:09:22):\nAnd we have amazing tools for specing out the visuals of things, and then when you get into the logic of how a piece of software works, really, the best representation we have of that is code right now. You can kind of gesture at it with Figma, and you can gesture at it with writing down notes, but it's when you have an actual working prototype. And so I think that more and more, being an engineer will start to feel like being a logic designer, and really, it will be about specifying your intent for how exactly you want everything to work. It'd be more about the whats, and a little bit less about how exactly you're going to do things under the hood.\n\n(00:09:59):\nI think taste will be increasingly important. I think one aspect of software engineering, and we're very far from this right now, and there are lots of funny memes going around the internet about some of the trials and tribulations people can run into if they trust AI for too many things that comes to engineering, around building apps that have glaring deficiencies, and problems, and functionality issues. But I think we will get to a place where you'll be able to be less careful as a software engineer, which, right now, is an incredibly, incredibly important skill. We'll move a little bit from carefulness, and a little bit more towards taste.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:40):\nThis makes me think of vibe coding, is that kind of what you're describing when you talk about not having to think about the details as much, and just kind of going with the flow?\n\nMichael Truell (00:10:49):\nI think it's related. I think that vibe coding right now describes exactly this state of creation that is pretty controversial, where you're generating a lot of coding, you aren't really understanding the details. That is a state of creation that then has lots of problems, you don't really... By not understanding the details under the hood right now, you then very quickly get to a place where you're kind of limited at a certain point, where you create something that's big enough that you can't change. And so I think some of the ideas that we're interested around, how do you give people continued control over all the details when they don't really understand the code? I think that solutions there are very relevant to the people who are vibe coding right now. I think that right now, we lack the ability to let the tastemakers actually have complete control over the software. One of the issues also with vibe coding, and letting taste really shine through from people is, you can create stuff, but a lot of it the AI making decisions that are unwieldy and you don't have to control over.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:56):\nOne more question along these lines. You threw out this word taste. When you say taste, what are you thinking?\n\nMichael Truell (00:12:01):\nI'm thinking having the right idea for what should be built. It will become more and more about effortless translation of, here's exactly what you want built, here's how you want everything to work, here's how you want it to look. And then you'll be able to make that on a computer, and it will less be about this kind of translation layer of, you and your team have a picture of what you'd want to build, and then you have to really painstakingly, labor-intensive, lay out that into a format that a computer can then execute and interpret. I think less than the UI side of things, maybe taste is a little bit of a misnomer, but just about having the right idea for what should be built.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:39):\nAwesome. Okay. I'm going to come back to these topics, but I want to actually zoom us back out to the beginnings of Cursor. I have never heard the origin story, I don't think many people know how this whole thing started. Basically you guys are building one of the fastest growing products in the history of the world, it's changing the way people build products, it's changing careers, professions, it's changing so much. How did it all begin? Any memorable moments along the journey of the early days?\n\nMichael Truell (00:13:05):\nCursor kind of started as a solution search of a problem, and a little bit where it very much came from reflecting on how AI was going to get better over the course of the next 10 years. There were kind of two defining moments, one was being really excited by using the first beta version of Code Pilot, actually. This was the first time we had used an AI product that was really, really, really useful, and was actually just useful at all, and wasn't just a vaporware kind of demo thing.\n\n(00:13:43):\nAnd in addition to being the first AI product that we'd use that was useful, Code Pilot was also one of the most useful, if not the most useful dev tool we'd ever adopted, and that got us really excited. Another moment that got us really excited was the series of scaling on papers coming out of OpenAI and other places that showed that even if we had no new ideas, AI was going to get better and better just by pulling on simple levers, like scaling up the models, and also scaling up the data that was going into the models.\n\n(00:14:12):\nAnd so at the end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this got us excited about how AI products were now possible, this technology was going to mature into the future. And it felt like when we looked around, there were lots of people talking about making models, and it felt like people weren't really picking an area of knowledge work and thinking about what it was going to look like as AI got better and better. And that set us on the path to an idea generation exercise, it was like, \"How are these areas of knowledge work going to change in the future as this tech gets more mature? What is the end state of the work going to look like? How are the tools that we use to do that work going to change? How are the models going to need to get better to support changes in the work? And once scaling and pre-training ran out, how are you going to keep pushing for technological capabilities?\"\n\n(00:15:07):\nAnd the misstep at the beginning of Cursor is we actually worked on... We sort of did this whole grand exercise, and we decided to work on an area of knowledge work that we thought would be relatively uncompetitive, and sleepy, and boring, and no one would be looking at it, because we thought, \"Oh, coding's great, coding's totally going to change with this AI, but people are already doing that.\" So there was a period of four months to begin with, where we were actually working on a very different idea, which was helping to automate and augment mechanical engineering, and building tools for mechanical engineers.\n\n(00:15:44):\nThere were problems from the get-go in that. Me and my co-founders, we weren't mechanical engineers. We had friends who were mechanical engineers, but we were very much unfamiliar with the field. So there was a little bit of a blind man and the elephant problem from the get-go. There were problems around, how would you actually take the models that exist to today and make them useful for mechanical engineering? The way we netted out is, you need to actually develop your own models from the get-go. And the way we did that was tricky, and there's not a lot of data on the internet of 3D models of different tools and parts, and the steps that I expect to build up to those 3D models, and then getting them from the sources that have them is also a tricky process too.\n\n(00:16:30):\nBut eventually what happened was, we came to our senses, we realized we're not super excited about mechanical engineering, it's not the thing we want to dedicate our lives to. And we looked around, and in the area of programming, it felt like despite a decent amount of time ensuing, not much has changed, and it felt like the people that were working on the space maybe had a disconnect with us, and it felt like they weren't being sufficiently ambitious about where everything was going to go in the future, and how all of software creation was going to blow through these models. And that's what set us off on the path to building Cursor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):\nOkay. So interesting. Okay, so first of all, I love that... This is advice that you often hear of go after a boring industry because no one's going to be there, and there's opportunity. And sometimes it works, but I love that in this journey, it's like, \"No, actually, go after the hottest, most popular space, AI coding, app building.\" And it worked out. And the way you phrased it just now is, you didn't see enough ambition potentially, that you thought there was more to be done. So it feels like that's an interesting lesson. Even if something looks like, \"Okay, it's too late, there's GitHub, Code Pilot's out there.\" Some other products. If you notice that they're just not as ambitious as they could be, or as you are, or you see almost a flaw in their approach, that there's still a big opportunity. Does that resonate?\n\nMichael Truell (00:17:46):\nThat totally resonates. A part of it is, you need there to be leapfrogs that can happen, you need there to be things that you can do. And I think the exciting thing about AI is, in a bunch of places, and I think this is very much still true of our space, and can talk about how we think about that and how we deal with that, but I think that just the ceiling is really high. And yes, if you look around, probably even if you take the best tool, any of these fields, there should be a lot more that needs to be done over the next few years. Having that space, having that high ceiling, I think is unique amongst areas of software, at least the degree to which it is high with AI.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:30):\nLet's come back to the IDE questions. So there's a few routes you could have taken, and other companies are doing different routes. So there's building an IDE for engineers to work within and adding AI magic to it, there's another route of just a full AI agentic dev product, and then there's just a model that is very good at coding, and focusing on building the best possible coding model. What made you decide and see that the IDE path was the best route?\n\nMichael Truell (00:18:54):\nThe folks who were from the get-go working on just a model were working on end-to-end automation programming. I think they were trying to build something very different from us, which is, we care about giving humans control over all of the decisions in the end tool that they're building. And I think those folks were very much thinking of a future where end-to-end, the whole thing is done by AI, and maybe the AI is making all the decisions too. And so, one, there was a personal interest component. Two, I think that always, we've tried to be intense realists about where the technology is today, very, very, very excited about how AI is going to mature over the course of many decades. But I think that sometimes people... There's an instinct to see AI do magical things in one area, and then kind of anthropomorphize these models, and think it's better than a smart person here, and so it must be better than a smart person there.\n\n(00:19:55):\nBut these things have massive issues, and we... From the very start, our product development process was really about dogfooding, and using the tool intensely every day. And we never wanted to ship anything that wasn't useful to us, and we had the benefit of doing that because we were the end users part of our product. And I think that that instills a realism in you around where the tech is right now, and so that definitely made us think that we need the humans to be in the driver's seat, the AI cannot do everything. We're also interested in giving humans that control too for personal reasons, and so that gets you away from just your model company that also gets you away from just this end-end stuff without the human having control.\n\n(00:20:39):\nAnd then the way you get to an IDE versus maybe a plug-in to an existing coding environment is the belief that programming is going to flow through these models, and the active programming is going to change a lot over the course of the next few years. And that the extensibility that existing coding environments have is so, so, so limited, so if you think that the UIs may change a lot, if you think that the form factor programming is going to change a lot, necessarily need to have control over the entire application.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:04):\nI know that you guys today have an IDE, and that's probably the bias you have of this is maybe where the future is heading, but I'm just curious, do you think a big part of the future is also going to be AI engineers that are just sitting in Slack and just doing things for you? Is that something that fits into Cursor one day?\n\nMichael Truell (00:21:20):\nI think you'll want the ability to move between all of these things fairly effortlessly, and sometimes I think you will want to have the thing kind of go spin off on its own for a while, and then I think you'll want the ability to pull in the AI's work, and then work with it very, very, very quickly, and then maybe have it go spin off again. And so these kind of background versus foreground form factors, I think you want that all to work well in one place. And I think the background stuff, there's a segment of programming that it's especially useful for, which is type of programming tasks where it's very easy to specify exactly what you want without much description, and exactly what correctness looks like without much description.\n\n(00:22:05):\nBug fixes are a great example of that, but it's definitely not all of programming. So I think that what the IDE is will totally change over time, and our approach to having our own editor was premised on, it's going to have to evolve over time. And I think that that will both include, you can spin off things from different surface areas like Slack, or your issue tracker, or whatever it is, and I think that will also include the pane of glass that you're staring at is going to change a lot. We just mostly think of an IDE as the place where you are building software.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:38):\nI think something people don't talk enough about with talking about agents and all these AI engineers that are going to be doing all this stuff for you, is basically we're all becoming engineering managers, with a lot of reports that are just not that smart, and you have to do a lot of reviewing, and approving, and specifying. I guess thoughts on that, and is there anything you could do to make that easier? Because that sounds really hard. Anyone that has had a large team, being like, \"Oh my god, all these junior people just checking in with me doing not high quality work over and over.\" It's just like, \"What a life. It's going to suck.\"\n\nMichael Truell (00:23:11):\nYeah. Maybe you [inaudible 00:23:12] one-on-ones with [inaudible 00:23:15].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:15):\nSo many one-on-ones.\n\nMichael Truell (00:23:17):\nYeah. So the customers we've seen have most success with AI I think are still fairly conservative about some of the ways in which they use this stuff. And so I do think today, the most successful customers really lean on things like our next edit prediction, where your coding is normal, and making the next into actions you're going to do. And then they also really lean on scoping down the stuff that you're going to hand off to the bot, and for a fixed percent of your time spent reviewing code, from an agent, or from an AI overall, you could... There's two patterns. One is, you could spend a bunch of time specifying things up front, the AI goes and works, and then you then go and review the AI's work, and then you're done. That's the whole task.\n\n(00:24:07):\nOr you can really chop things up. So you can specify a little bit, AI writes something, review, specify a little bit, AI writes something, review. Autocompletes all in the way of that spectrum. And still we see often the most successful people using these tools are chopping things up right now, and keeping things fairly [inaudible 00:24:28].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:27):\nThat sounds less terrible. I'm glad there's a solution here. I want to go back to you guys building Cursor for the first time. What was the point where you realized this is ready? What was a moment of, \"Okay, I think this is time to put it out there, and see what happens\"?\n\nMichael Truell (00:24:41):\nSo when we started building Cursor, we were fairly paranoid about spinning for a while, without releasing to the world. And so to begin with too, we actually... The first version of Cursor was hand-rolled. Now we use VS Code as a base, like many browsers use Chromium as a base, and hit foot off of that. To begin with, we didn't, and built the prototype of Cursor from scratch, and that involved a lot of work. We had to build our own... There were a lot of things that go into a modern code editor, including support for many different languages, and navigation support for moving amongst the language, error tracking support for things. There's things like an integrated command line, the ability to use remote servers, the ability to connect to remote servers to view and run code. And so we kind of just went on this blitz of building things incredibly quickly, building our own editor from scratch, and then also the AI components.\n\n(00:25:45):\nIt was after maybe five weeks that we were living on the editor full-time, and had thrown away our previous editor, and we're using a new one. And then once it got to a point where we found it a bit useful, then we put it in other people's hands, and had this very short beta period. And then we launched it out to the world within a couple of months from the first line of code, I think it was probably three months. And it was definitely a, \"Let's just get this out to people and build in public quickly.\" The thing that took us by surprise is we thought we would be building for a couple hundred people for a long time. And from the get-go, there was an immediate rush of interest, and a lot of feedback too. That was super helpful, we learned from that. That's actually why we switched to being based off of VS Code instead of just this hand-rolled thing. A lot of that was motivated by the initial user feedback, and then had been iterating in public from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:44):\nI like how you understated the traction that you got. I think you guys went from $0 to 100 million ARR in a year, year and a half or something like that, which is historic. What do you think was the key to success of something like this? You just talked about dogfooding being a big part of it. You built it in three months, that's insane. What do you think is the secret to your success?\n\nMichael Truell (00:27:12):\nThe three-month version wasn't very good, and so I think it's been a sustained paranoia about, there are all of these ways in which this thing could get better. The end goal is really to invent a very new form of programming that involves automating a lot of coding, as we know today. And no matter where we are with Cursor, it feels like we're very, very far away from that end goal, there's always a lot to do. A lot of it hasn't been over rotated on that initial push, but instead is the continued evolution of the tool, and just making the tool consistently better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:47):\nWas there an inflection point after those three months where things just started to really take off?\n\nMichael Truell (00:27:51):\nTo be honest, it felt fairly slow to begin with, and maybe it comes from some impatience on our part. I think there's the overall speed of the growth which continues to take us by surprise. I think one of the things that has been most surprising too is that the growth has been fairly just consistent on an exponential, of just consistent month-over-month growth, accelerated at times by launches on our part and other things. But an exponential to begin with feels fairly slow and the numbers are really low, and so it didn't really feel off to the races to begin with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:32):\nTo me this sounds like build it and they will come actually working. You guys just built an awesome product that you loved yourselves as engineers, you put it out, people just loved it, told everyone about it.\n\nMichael Truell (00:28:42):\nIt being essentially all just us, the team working on the product, and making the product good in lieu of other things one could spend one's time on. We definitely spent time on tons of other things, for instance, building the team was incredibly important, and doing things like support rotations are very important. But some of the normal things that people would maybe reach for in building the company early on, we really let those fires burn for a long time, especially when it came to things like sales and marketing.\n\n(00:29:15):\nAnd so just working on the product, and building a product that you like first, your team likes, and then also then adjusting it for some set of users, that can kind of sound simple, but then, as you know, it's hard to do that well. And there are a bunch of different directions one could have run in, a bunch of different product directions.\n\n(00:29:35):\nI think focus, and strategically picking the right things to build, and prioritizing effectively is tricky. I think another thing that's tricky about this domain is, it's kind of a new form of product building, where it's very interdisciplinary in that we are something in between a normal software company and then a foundation model company, in that we're developing a product for millions of people, and that side of things has to be excellent, but then also one important dimension of product quality is doing more and more on the science, and doing more and more on the model side of things in places where it makes sense. And so that element of things doing that well too has been tricky. The overall thing would note is maybe some of these things sound simple to specify, but doing them well is hard, and they're a lot of different way you can run in.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:30):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:30:38):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:40):\nSo what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies, like Ramp, and [inaudible 00:30:46], and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing, and mapping, and integrating CSV in Excel files?\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:30:55):\nYes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:22):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:31:30):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record, in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system, and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:51):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co., that's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:32:05):\nWhat is the most counterintuitive thing you've learned so far about building Cursor, building AI products?\n\nMichael Truell (00:32:11):\nI think one thing that's been counterintuitive for us, [inaudible 00:32:14] added a little bit before, but is, we definitely didn't expect to be doing any of our own model development when we started. As mentioned, when we got into this, there were companies that were immediately from the get-go going and just focusing on training model from scratch. And we had done the calculation for what it to train before, and just knew that that was not [inaudible 00:32:36] going to be able to do. And also felt a bit like focusing one's attention in the wrong area, because there were lots of amazing models out there, and why develop all this work to replicate what other players had done. Especially on the pre-training side of things, taking a neural network that knows nothing, and then teaching it the whole internet.\n\n(00:32:55):\nAnd so we thought we weren't going to be doing that at all, and it seems clear to us from the start that the existing models, there were lots of things that they could be doing for us that they weren't doing, because there wasn't the right tool built for them. In fact though, we do a ton of model development, and internally, it's a big focus for us on the hiring front, and have assembled a fantastic team there.\n\n(00:33:18):\nAnd it's also been a big win on the product quality side of things for us. And at this point, every magic moment in Cursor involves a custom model in some way. So that was definitely counterintuitive, and surprising, and it's been a gradual thing, where there was an initial use case for training our own model, where it really didn't make sense to use any of the biggest foundation models. That was incredibly successful, moved to another use case that worked really well, and had been going from there. And one of the helpful things in doing this sort of model development is picking your spots carefully, not trying to reinvent the wheel, not trying to focus on places, and maybe where the best foundation models are excellent, but instead kind of focusing on their weaknesses, and how you can complement them.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:05):\nI think this is going to be surprising to a lot of people hearing that you have your own models. When people talk about Cursor and all the folks in the space, they would kind of call them GPT wrappers, they're just sitting on top of ChatGPT or Sonnet. What you're saying is that you have your own models, talk about just the stack behind the scenes.\n\nMichael Truell (00:34:21):\nYeah, of course. So we definitely use the biggest foundation models a bunch of different ways, they're really important components of bringing the Cursor experience to people. The places where we use our own models, so sometimes it's to survey a use case that a foundation model wouldn't be able to serve at all for cost or speed reasons. And so one example of that is the autocomplete side of things. And so this can be a little bit tricky for people who don't code to understand, but code is this weird form of work, where sometimes, really, the next 5, 10, 20, 30 minutes of your work is entirely predictable from looking over your shoulder.\n\n(00:35:02):\nAnd I would contrast this with writing. So writing, lots of people are familiar with Gmail's autocomplete, and the different forms of autocomplete that show up when you're trying to post text messages, or emails, or things like that. They can only be so helpful, because often, it's just really not clear what you're going to be writing just by looking at what you've written before. But in code sometimes, when you edit a part of a code base, you're going to need to change things, and in other parts of code base, and it's entirely clear how you're going to need to change things.\n\n(00:35:30):\nSo one core part of Cursor is this really suit to autocomplete experience, where you predict the next set of that you're going to be doing across multiple files, across multiple places within a file. And making models good at that use case, one, there's a speed component of, those models need to be really fast, they need to give you a completion within 300 milliseconds. There's also this cost component of, we're running tons, and tons, and tons of molecules, every keystroke, we need to be changing our prediction for what you're going to do next. And then it's also this really specialty use case of, you need models that are really good, not at completing the next token, just a generic tech sequence, but are really good at autocompleting a series of diffs, looking at what's changed within a code base, and then creating the next set of things that are going to change, both deleted and added and all of that, and we found a ton of success in training models specifically for that task.\n\n(00:36:23):\nSo that's a place where no foundation models are involved, it's kind of our own thing. We don't have a lot of labeling or branding about this in the app, power is a very core part of Cursor. And then another set of places where a user own models are to help things like Sonnet, or Gemini, or GPT, and those sit both on the inputs of those big models, and on the output. On the input side of things, those models are searching throughout a code base, try to figure out the parts of a code base to show to one of these big models. You can kind of think about this as a mini Google search that's specifically built for finding the relevant parts of the code base to show one of these big models.\n\n(00:37:02):\nAnd then on the output side of things, we take the sketches of the changes that these models are suggesting, you make with that code base. And then we have models that then fill in the details of, the high level thinking is done by the smartest models, they spend a few tokens on doing that, and then these smaller specialty incredibly fast models, coupled with some inference tricks, then take those high level changes and turn them actually into full code diffs. And so it's been super helpful for pushing on quality in places where you need a specialty task, and it's been super helpful for pushing on speed, which is such an important dimension of product quality for us too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:39):\nThis is so interesting. I just had Kevin Weil on the podcast, CPO of OpenAI, and he calls this the ensemble of models, that's the same way-\n\nMichael Truell (00:37:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):\n... they work, to use the best feature of each one, and to your point, the cost advantages of using cheaper models. These other models, are they based on Llama and things like that, just open source models that you guys plug into and build on?\n\nMichael Truell (00:38:00):\nYeah. So again, we try to be very pragmatic about the place that we're going to do this work, and we don't want to reinvent the wheel. And so starting from the very best pre-trained models that exist out there, often open source ones, sometimes in collaboration with these big model providers that don't share their weights out into the world, because the thing we care about last is the ability to read line by line, the matrix of weights that then go to give you a certain output. We just care about the ability to train these things, to post-train them. And so by and large, yes, open source models, sometimes working with the closed source providers too to tune things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:42):\nThis leads to a discussion that a lot of AI founders always think about and investors, which is moats, and defensibility in AI. So it feels like one is custom models, is a moat in the space. How do you just think about long-term defensibility in the space, knowing there's other folks, as you said, launching constantly trying to eat your lunch?\n\nMichael Truell (00:39:03):\nI think that there are ways to build in inertia and traditional moats, but I think by and large, we're in a space where it is incumbent on us to continue to try to build the best thing, and everyone in this industry. And I truly just think that the ceiling is so high that no matter what entrenchment you build, you can be leapfrogged. And I think that this resembles markets that are maybe a little bit different from normal software markets, normal enterprise markets of the past. I think one that comes to mind is the market for search engines at the end of 1999, or at the end of the '90s and beginning of the 2000s. I think another market that comes to mind that resembles this market in many ways, it's actually just the development of the peripheral computer and many computers in the '70s, '80s, '90s.\n\n(00:40:03):\nAnd I think that, yes, in each of those markets, the ceiling was incredibly high, it was possible to swish. You could keep getting value for the incremental hour of a smart person's time, the incremental R&D dollar for a really long time, you wouldn't run out of useful things to build. And then in search in particular, not on the computer case, adding distribution was helpful for making the product better too, in that you could tune the algorithms, you could tune the learning based off of the data and the feedback you're getting from users. And I think that all of those dynamics exist in our market too. And so I think maybe the sad truth for people like us, but then the amazing truth for the world is, I think that there are many leapfrogs that exist, there's more useful things to build. We're a long way away from where we can compete in 5, 10 years, and it's incumbent in our state to keep that going.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):\nSo what I'm hearing, this sounds like a lot more like a consumer sort of moat, where it's just, be the best thing consistently so that people stick with you versus creating lock-in and things like that, where they're just... Like Salesforce, where it's just contracts with the entire company, and you have to use this product.\n\nMichael Truell (00:41:10):\nYeah. I think the important thing to note is, if you're in a space where you run out of useful things to do very quickly, then that's not a great situation to be in. But if you're in a place where big investments, and having more and more great people working on the right path can keep giving you value, then you can get these economies of scale of R&D, and you can deeply work on the technology in the right direction, and get to a place where that is defensible. But yes, it is... I think there's a consumer-like tendency to it, and I really think it's just about building the best thing possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:48):\nDo you think in the future there's one winner in this space, or do you think it's going to be a world of a number of products like this?\n\nMichael Truell (00:41:53):\nI think the market is just so very big. You asked about the IDE thing early on, and one thing that I think a trip of some people that were thinking about the space is, they looked at the IDE market of the past 10 years, and they said, \"Who's making money off of the editors?\" It's this super fragmented space where everyone kind of has their own thing, with their own figuration, and there's one company that actually makes money off making great editors, but that company is only so big. And then the conclusion was, it was going to look like that in the future. And I think that the thing that people missed was that there was only so much you could do building an editor in the 2010s for coders, and the company that made money off of editors was doing things like making it easy to navigate around a code base, and doing some error checking and type checking for things, and having good debugging tools.\n\n(00:42:57):\nWhich were all very useful, but I think that the set of things you can build for programmers, I think the set of things you can build for knowledge workers in many different areas just goes very far and very deep. The problem in front of all of us is the automation of a lot of busy work and knowledge work, and really changing all the areas of knowledge work in front of us to be much higher level and more productive.\n\n(00:43:19):\nSo that was a long-winded way to say, I think the market's really, really big that we're in. I think it's much bigger than people have realized than the other building tools for developers in the past. And I think that there will be a bunch of different solutions. I think that there will be one company, to be determined if it's going to be us, but I do think that there will be one company that builds the general tool that builds almost all the world's software, and that will be a very, very generationally big business. But I think that there will be kind of niches you can occupy in doing something for a particular segment of the market, or for a very particular part of the software development life cycle. But the general programming shifts from just writing formal programming languages to something way higher level. This is the application you purchase and use to do that. I think that there will be generally one winner there, and it will be a very big business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:10):\nJuicy. Along those lines, it's interesting that Microsoft was actually at the center of this first, with an amazing product, amazing distribution, Copilot you said was the thing that got you over the hump of, \"Wow, there could be something really big here.\" And it doesn't feel like they're winning, it feels like they're falling behind. What do you think happened there?\n\nMichael Truell (00:44:34):\nI think that there are specific historical reasons why Copilot might not have lived up... So far have lived up to the expectations that some people have for it, and then I think that there are structural reasons. I think the structural reason is... And to be clear, Microsoft, in the Copilot case, obviously a big inspiration for our work, and in general, I think they do lots of awesome things, and we're users of many Microsoft products, but I think that this is a market that's not super friendly to incumbents, in that a market that's friendly to incumbents might be one where there's only so much to do, it kind of gets commoditized fairly quickly, and you can bundle that in with other products, and where the ROI between different products is quite small. And in that case, perhaps it doesn't make sense to buy the innovative solution, it makes sense to just kind of buy the thing that's bundled in with other stuff.\n\n(00:45:31):\nAnother market that might be particularly helpful for incumbents is one where there's... From the get-go, you have your stuff in one place, and it's really, really excruciatingly hard to switch, and for better or for worse. I think in our case, you can try out different tools, and you can decide which product you think is better. And so that's not super friendly to incumbents, and that's more friendly to whoever you think is going to have the most innovative product. And then the specific historical reasons, as I understand them are the group of people that worked on the first version of Copilot have, by and large, gone on to do other things at other places. I think it's been a little hard to coordinate among all the different departments and parties that might be involved in making something like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:15):\nI want to come back to Cursor. A question I like to ask everyone that's building a tool like this, if you could sit next to every new user that uses Cursor for the first time, just whisper a couple tips in their ear to be more successful, most successful with Cursor, what would be 1 or 2 tips?\n\nMichael Truell (00:46:32):\nI think right now, and we'd want to fix this at a product level, a lot of being successful with Cursor is kind of having a taste for what the models can do, both what complexity of a task they can handle, and how much you need to specify things to that model, but having a taste for the quality of the model, and where its gaps exist, and what it can do and what it can't. And right now, we don't do a good job in the product of educating people around that, and maybe giving people some swim lanes, giving people some guidelines.\n\n(00:47:06):\nBut to develop that taste, would give two tips. So one is, as mentioned before, would bias less toward, trying in one go to tell the model, \"Hey, here's exactly what I want you to do.\" Then seeing the output, and then either being disappointed or accepting the entire thing for an entire big task. Instead what I would do is I would chop things up into bits, and you can spend basically the same amount of time specifying things overall, but chopped up more. So you're specifying a little bit, you're getting a little bit of work, you're specifying a little bit, getting a little bit of work, and not doing as much the, \"Let's write a giant thing telling the model exactly what to do.\" I think that will be a little bit of a recipe for disaster right now.\n\n(00:47:48):\nAnd so biasing toward chopping things up. At the same time, and it might make sense to do this on a side project and not on your professional work, I would encourage people to, especially developers who are used to existing workflows for building software, I would encourage people to explicitly try to fall on their face, and try to discover the limits of what these models can do by being ambitious in a safe environment, like perhaps a side project, and trying to kind of go around town, use AI to the fullest. Because a lot of the time, we run into people who haven't given the AI yet a fair shake, and are underestimating its abilities. So generally biasing towards chopping things up and making things smaller, but to discover the limits of what you can do there, explicitly just try to go for broke in a safe environment, and get a taste for... You might be surprised in some of the places where the model doesn't break.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:45):\nWhat I'm essentially hearing is build a gut feeling of what the model can do, and how far it can take an idea versus just kind of guiding it along. And I bet that you need to rebuild this gut every time there's a new model launch, when it's on... I don't know, 4.0 comes out, you have to do this again. Is that generally right?\n\nMichael Truell (00:49:04):\nYes. For the past few years, it hasn't been as big as I think the first experience people have had with some of these big models. This is also a problem we would hope to solve much better just for users, and take the burden off of them. But each of these things have slightly different quirks and different personalities.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:26):\nAlong these lines, something that people are always debating tools like Cursor, are they more helpful to junior engineers, or are they more helpful to senior engineers? Do they make senior engineers 10X better? Do they make junior engineers more like senior engineers? Who do you think benefits most today from Cursor?\n\nMichael Truell (00:49:43):\nI think across the board. Both of these cohorts benefit in big ways. It's a little hard to say on the relative ranking. I will say, they fall into different anti-patterns. The junior engineers we see going a little too wholesale, relying on AI for everything, and we're not yet in a place where you can kind of do that end-to-end on a professional tool, working with tens, hundreds of other people within a long-lived code base. And then the senior engineers... For many folks, it's not true for all, and we actually often... One of the ways these tools are adopted is, there's developer experience teams within companies, often those are staffed by incredibly senior people, because often, those are people who are building tools to make the rest of the engineers within an organization more productive.\n\n(00:50:33):\nAnd we've seen some very, very boundary pushing kind of... We've seen people who are on the front lines of really trying to adopt the technology as much as possible there. But by and large, I would say on average, as a group, the senior engineers underrate what AI can do for them, and stick to their existing workflows. And so the relative ranking is a little hard, I think they fall into different anti-patterns, but they both, by and large, yet get big benefits with these tools.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:04):\nThat makes absolute sense. I love that it's two ends of the spectrum, expect too much, don't expect enough. It's like the three bears allegory.\n\nMichael Truell (00:51:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:16):\nYeah. Okay.\n\nMichael Truell (00:51:18):\nYeah. Maybe the sort of senior, but not staff, right in the middle.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:24):\nInteresting. Okay. Just a couple more questions. What's something that you wish you knew before you got into this role? If you could go back to Michael at the beginning of Cursor, which was not that long ago, and you could give him some advice, what's something that you would tell him?\n\nMichael Truell (00:51:38):\nThe tough thing with this is, it feels like so much of the hard-won knowledge is tacit, and a bit hard to communicate verbally. And the sad fact of life feels like for some areas of human endeavor, you kind of do need to fall on your face to... Either need to fall on your face to learn the correct thing, or you need to be around someone who's a great example of excellence in the thing. And one area where we have felt this is hiring. I think that we actually were... So we tried to be incredibly patient on the hiring front.\n\n(00:52:20):\nIt was really important to us that, both for personal reasons and also for, I think actually for the company's strategy, having a world-class group of engineers and researchers to work on Cursor with us was going to be incredibly important. Also, getting people who fit... A certain mix of intellectual curiosity and experimentation, because there can be so many new things we need to build. And then also an intellectual honesty, and maybe micro-pessimism, bluntness, because if all the noise, and... Especially as the company's grown, and the business has grown, keeping a level head I think is incredibly important too.\n\n(00:52:59):\nBut getting the right group of people into the company was the thing that maybe more than anything else, apart from building the product, we really, really fussed over. We actually waited a long time to grow the team because of that. And I think that many people you hear hired too fast, think we actually hired too slow to begin with. I think it could have been remedied, I think we could have been better at it.\n\n(00:53:28):\nAnd the method of recruiting that we ended up eventually falling into and working really well for us, which isn't that novel, of going after people that we think are really world-class, and recruiting them over the course of, in some cases, many years, ended up working for us in the end, but I don't think we were very good at it to begin with. And so I think that there were hard-won lessons around both who was the right profile, who actually made sense in that team, what did greatness look like, and then how to talk with someone about the opportunity, and get them excited if they really weren't looking for anything. There were lots of learnings there about how to do that well, and that took us a bit of time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):\nWhat are some of those learnings for folks that are hiring right now? What's something you missed or learned?\n\nMichael Truell (00:54:18):\nI think to start with, maybe we actually biased a little bit too much towards looking for people who fit the archetype of well-known school, very young, had done the things that were high credential in those well-known school environments. And actually, I think found... Were lucky early on to find fantastic people who are willing to do this with us who were later careered. I think we should kind of spent a bunch of time on maybe a little bit the wrong profile to begin with, and part of that was a seniority thing. Part of that was kind of an interest and experience thing too, we have hired people who are excellent, excellent, excellent and very young, but they maybe look in some cases slightly different from being straight out of central casting.\n\n(00:55:12):\nAnother lesson is just, we very much evolved our interview loop, and so now, we have a hand-rolled set of interview questions, and then core our... Core to how we interview too, is actually, we have people onsite for two days, and do a project with us, a work test project. And that has worked really well, that increasingly you're finding that. I think how to learn about what people are interested in, and put our best foot forward, and letting them know about the opportunity when they're really not looking for anything, and have those conversations. There's definitely been... Gotten better at that over time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:53):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask?\n\nMichael Truell (00:55:56):\nI think this two-day work test which we thought would not scale past a few people has had surprising staying power. And the great thing about it is, it lets someone go end-to-end on it like a real project. It's not work that we use, it's canned list of projects. But it gives you two days of seeing a real work product, and it doesn't have to be incredibly time-enhancing other teams from time. You can take the time you would spend in a half day or one day onsite, and you kind of spread it out over those two days, and give someone a lot of time to do work on their projects, and so that can actually help it scale.\n\n(00:56:38):\nIt helps to enforce, do you want to be around this person type test, because you are around this person for two days, a bunch of meals with them. We didn't expect that one to stick around, but that has been really, really important to our value to process, and then also important to getting people excited at, especially the very early stages of the company. Because before, people are using the product, and know about it. And when the product is comparatively not very good, really, the only thing you have going for you is a team of people that some people find special and want to be around. And the two days would give us a chance to just have this person meet us, and in some cases, hopefully get convinced that they want to throw in with us. That one was unexpected. Not exactly an interview question, but kind of like a forward interview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:29):\nThe ultimate interview question. So just to be very clear about what you're describing, you give them an assignment, like, \"Build this feature in our actual code base, work with the team to code it and ship it.\" Is that roughly right?\n\nMichael Truell (00:57:40):\nYes. So we don't use the IP, not shift end-to-end, but it's like a mock... Very often in our code base, \"Here's a real mini two-day project. You're going to do it end-to-end.\" Largely being left alone, there's collaboration too. And then we're a pretty imprisoned company, in almost all cases, it's actually just sitting in office with us too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:02):\nAnd you've been saying that this has scaled to even today, so how big are you guys at this point?\n\nMichael Truell (00:58:07):\nSo we are going on 60 people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:10):\nSo small for the scale and impact. I was thinking it'd be a lot larger than that.\n\nMichael Truell (00:58:15):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:16):\nAnd I imagine the largest percent is engineers?\n\nMichael Truell (00:58:19):\nYeah. To be clear, a big part of the work ahead of us is building a group of people that is bigger, and awesome, and can continue to make the product better, and the service we give to customers better. And so you don't plan to stay that small for longer, wouldn't hope so. But part of the reason that that number is small is, the percentage of engineering and research and design is very high within the company, and so many software companies when they have roughly 40 engineers would be over 100 people, because there's lots of operational work, and often, they're very, very sales-led from the get-go, and that's just quite labor-intensive. And here, we started from a place of being incredibly lean in product-led, and we now serve lots of our market customers, and it built that out, but there's much more to do there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:10):\nA question I wanted to ask you, there's so much happening in AI, there's things launching every... There's newsletters, many newsletters, whose entire function is to tell you what is happening in AI every single day. Running a company that's at the center, the white-hot center of this space, how do you stay focused, and how do you help your team stay focused, and heads down, and just build and not get distracted by all these shiny things?\n\nMichael Truell (00:59:35):\nI think hiring is a big part of it, and if you get people with the right attitude. All of this should be asterisked in, I think we're doing well there, I think that we'd probably be doing better there too, and it's something that we should probably talk even more about as a company. But I think that hiring people with the right disposition, people who are less focused on external validation, more focused on building something really great, more focused on doing really high quality work, and people who are just generally level-headed, and maybe the highs aren't very high, the lows aren't very low. I think hiring can get you through a lot here, and I think that's actually a learning throughout the company, is that for any... You need process, you need hierarchy, you need lots of things, but for any kind of organizational tool that you're introducing into a company, the result you're looking to get from that tool also... You can go pretty far on hiring people with the right behaviors that you want to resolve from that for organizational thing.\n\n(01:00:39):\nAnd the specific example that comes to mind is, we've been able to get away with not a ton of process yet on the engineering front, and I think we need a little bit more process, but for our size, not a ton of process, by hiring people who I think are really excellent. One is hiring people that are level-headed. I think two is just talking about it a lot. I think three is hopefully leading by example. And for us personally, we've since 2021, 2022 been professionally working on this, and been working on AI, and we've just seen a sea change of the comings and goings of various technologies and ideas of... If you're to transport yourself back to end of 2021, beginning of 2022, this is GPT-3, Instruct GPT doesn't exist, there's no Dolly, there's no stable diffusion. And then we've gone through all of those image technologies existing, ChatGPT and that rise, and GPT-4, all of these new models, all these different modalities, all the video stuff, and only a very small number of these things really kind of affects the business.\n\n(01:01:45):\nSo I think we've kind of just built up a little bit of an immune system, and know when an event comes around that actually is really going to matter for us. This dynamic too of there being lots, and lots, and lots of chatter, but then maybe only a few things that really matter, I think has been mirrored in AI over the last decade, where there have been so many papers on deep learning in academia, so many papers on AI in academia, then the amazing thing is there are really a lot of... A lot the progress of AI can be attributed to some very simple elegant ideas that have stayed around, and the vast majority of ideas that have been put out there haven't had staying power, and haven't mattered a ton. And so the dynamic is a little bit mirrored in the evolution of deep learning as a field overall.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:33):\nLast question. What do you think people still most misunderstand, or maybe don't fully grasp about where things are heading with AI in building in the way the world will change?\n\nMichael Truell (01:02:46):\nPeople are still a little bit occupied too much, either end of a spectrum of it's all going to happen very fast, and this is all bluster, and hype, and snake well, and I think we're in the middle of a technology shift that's going to be incredibly consequential. I think it's going to be more consequential than the internet, I think it's going to be more consequential than any shift in tech that we've seen since the advent of computers. And I think it's going to take a while, and I think it's going to be a multi-decade thing, and I think many different groups will be consequential in pushing it forward.\n\n(01:03:24):\nAnd to get to a world where computers can increasingly do more, and more, and more for us, there's all of these independent problems that need to be knocked down, and progress needs to be made on them, and some of those are on the science side of things of getting these models to understand different types of data, be faster, cheaper, smarter, conform to the modalities that we care about, take actions in the real world. And then some of it's on how we're going to work with them, and what's the experience that a human should actually be seeing and controlling on a computer, and working with these things.\n\n(01:03:58):\nBut I think it's going to take decades. I think that there's going to be lots of amazing work to do. I think that also, one of the most... A pattern of a group that I think will be especially important here, not to talk our own book, but I think is the company that works on automating and augmenting a particular area of knowledge work, builds both the technology under the surface for that, integrating the best parts from providers, sometimes doing it in-house, and then also builds the product experience for that. I think people who do that, and... We're trying to do it in software, people do that in other areas, I think those folks will be really, really, really consequential. Not just for the end value that users see, but then I think as they get to scale, they'll be really important for pushing forward the technology, because I think they'll be able to build... The most successful of them will be able to build very, very big businesses. So, excited to see the rise of other companies like that in other areas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:59):\nI know you guys are hiring. For folks that are interested in, \"Hey, I want to go work here, and build this sort of stuff.\" What kind of roles are you looking for right now? Anyone specifically you're trying... Any roles you're most excited about filling ASAP? What should people know if they're curious?\n\nMichael Truell (01:05:12):\nThere are so many things that this group of people need to do that we are not get equipped to do. Generic across the board, first of all, and so if you don't think we have a role for something, maybe you should reach out, that won't actually be the case. And maybe we can actually learn from you, and decide that we need something that we weren't yet aware of. But by and large, I think that two of the most important things for us to do this year are have the best product in the space, and then grow it. And we're kind of in this land grab mode, where almost everyone in the world is either using no tool like ours, or they're using one that's maybe developing less quickly. So growing Cursor too is a big goal, and I would say, especially always on the hunt for folks who... Excellent engineers, designers, researchers, but then folks all across the business side too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:13):\nI can't help but ask this question now that you talk about engineers, there's this question of just, \"AI's going to write all our code.\" But everyone's still hiring engineers like crazy. All the foundational models, so many open roles.\n\nMichael Truell (01:06:28):\nYeah. We're not out there tooting the horn of, people can learn to code.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:29):\nDo you think there's going to be an inflection point of engineering roles start to slow down? I know this is a big question, but just... Do you see engineers being more and more needed across all these companies, or do you think at some point there's all these Cursor agents running building for us?\n\nMichael Truell (01:06:45):\nAgain, we have the view that there's this both long messy middle of it not jumping to a, just you step back, and you ask for all your stuff to be done, and you have your engineering department. And very much, you want to evolve from programming as it exists today, we want humans to be in the driver's seat, and we think even in the end state, that's giving folks control over everything is really important, and you will need professionals to do that, and decide what the software looks like.\n\n(01:07:18):\nSo both I think that, yes, engineers are definitely needed. I think that engineers will be able to do much more. I think the demand for software is very lasting, which is not the most novel thing, but I think it's kind of crazy to think about how expensive and labor-intensive it is to build things that are pretty simple and easy to specify, or it would look like it to the outside observer, and just how hard those things are to do right now.\n\n(01:07:49):\nAll of the stuff that exists right now that's justified by the cost and demand that we have now, if you could bring that down by [inaudible 01:07:56], I think you would have tons, and tons, and tons of more stuff that we could do in our computers, tons more tools. And I've felt this, where... One of my early jobs actually was working for a biotechnology company, and it was building internal tools for them, and the off-the-shelf tools that existed were horrible, and did not fit their use case at all. And then the internal tools I was building, there was definitely a ton of demand there for things that could be built, and that far outstripped just the things that I could build in the time that I was with them.\n\n(01:08:29):\nThe physics of working on computers are so great, you should be able to basically just move everything around, do everything that you want to do. There's still so much friction, I think that there's much more demand for software than what we can build today with things costing like a blockbuster movie to make simple productivity software. And so I think long into the future, yes, there will actually be more demand for engineers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:51):\nIs there anything that we didn't cover that you wanted to mention? Any last nugget wisdom you wanted to leave listeners with? You could also say no, because we've done a lot.\n\nMichael Truell (01:09:00):\nWe think a lot about how you set up a team to be able to make new stuff, in addition to continuing to improve the stuff that you have right now. And I think if we were to be successful, IDE is going to have to change a ton, [inaudible 01:09:18] looks like is going to have to change a ton going into the future. And if you look around, the companies we respect, there are definitely examples of companies that have continued to really ride the wave of many leapfrogs, and continue to actually push the frontier. But they're kind of rare too, it's a hard thing to do. So part of that is just kind of thinking about the thing, and trying to reflect on it in our good days, and the first principle side of things, part of it's also trying to get in and study past examples of greatness here, and that's something that we think about a lot too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:00):\nYeah. Yeah. Before we started recording, you had all these books behind you, and I was like, \"What's that over there?\" It's the history of some old computer company that was influential in a lot of ways that I've never heard of. And I think that says a lot about you of, where a lot of this innovation comes from, is studying the past, and study history, and what's worked and what hasn't.\n\n(01:10:19):\nOkay. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and maybe apply? You said that there may be roles they may not even be aware of, where do they go find that, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMichael Truell (01:10:28):\nYeah. If folks are interested in working on this stuff, would love to speak, they can find... If they go to cursor.com, they can kind of both find the product and find out how to reach us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:41):\nEasy. Michael, thank you so much for being here. This was incredible.\n\nMichael Truell (01:10:44):\nIt was wonderful. Thank you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:46):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:10:49):\nThank you so much for listening.

They're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. We really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted. Over half of our pull requests are Claude Code generated. Probably at this point it's probably over 70% that it just completely blew out the expectations of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:26):\nYou guys are at the edge of where things are heading.\n\nMike Krieger (00:00:28):\nI had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open. It was AI 2027, and my product strategy, and it was this moment where I'm like, \"Wait, am I the character in the story?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:36):\nIt feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. How does that inform the way you think about product, strategy, and mission?\n\nMike Krieger (00:00:43):\nI think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. How do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:55):\nWhat's something that you've changed your mind about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?\n\nMike Krieger (00:01:01):\nI had this notion coming in like, \"Yes, these models are great, but are they able to have an independent opinion?\" And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:12):\nToday, my guest is Mike Krieger. Mike is chief product officer at Anthropic, the company behind Claude. He's also the co-founder of Instagram. He's one of my most favorite product builders and thinkers. He's also now leading product at one of the most important companies in the world, and I'm so thrilled to have had a chance to chat with him on the podcast. We chat about what he's changed his mind about most in terms of AI capabilities in the years since he joined Anthropic, how product development changes and where bottlenecks emerge when 90% of your code is written by AI, which is now true at Anthropic. Also, his thoughts on OpenAI versus Anthropic, the future of MCP, why he shut down Artifact, his last startup and how he feels about it. Also, what skills he's encouraging his kids to develop with the rise of AI. And we closed the podcast on a very heartwarming message that Claude wanted me to share it with Mike.\n\n(00:02:00):\nA big thank you to my newsletter Slack community for suggesting topics for this conversation.

That's over $1.4 trillion and driving that huge number are the millions of businesses growing more rapidly with Stripe. For industry leaders like Forbes, Atlassian, OpenAI, and Toyota, Stripe isn't just financial software. It's a powerful partner that simplifies how they move money, making it as seamless and borderless as the internet itself. For example, Hertz boosted its online payment authorization rates by 4% after migrating to Stripe. And imagine seeing a 23% lift in revenue like Forbes did just six months after switching to Stripe for subscription management. Stripe has been leveraging AI for the last decade to make its product better at growing revenue for all businesses. From smarter checkouts to fraud prevention and beyond.

I've been looking forward to this for a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:35):\nWow, I had love to hear that. I've also been looking forward to this for a while. I have so much to talk about. So first of all, you've been at Anthropic for just over a year at this point. Congrats by the way on hitting the cliff.\n\nMike Krieger (00:04:46):\nThank you. Not that we're tracking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:49):\nThat's right. So let me just ask you this. So you've been at Anthropic for about a year. What's something that you've changed your mind about from before you joined Anthropic to today about what AI is capable of and where AI is heading?\n\nMike Krieger (00:05:04):\nTwo things. One is like a pace and timeline question. The other one is a capability question. So maybe I'll take the second one first. I had this notion coming in, yes, these models are great, they're going to be able to produce code, they're going to be able to write hopefully in your voice eventually, but are they able to sort of have an independent opinion? And it's actually really flipped for me only in the last month and only with Opus 4 where my go-to product strategy partner is Claude. And it has been basically for that full year where I'll write an initial strategy, I'll share it with Claude basically, and I'll have it, look at it. And in the past it's pretty anodyne kind of comments that it would leave, \"Oh, have you thought about this?\" And it's like, \"Yeah, I thought about that.\" And Opus 4, I was working on some strategy for our second half of the year was the first one.\n\n(00:05:51):\nIt was like Opus 4 combined with our advanced research. But it really went out for a while and it came back and I was like, you really looked at it in a new way. And so that's a thing that I've maybe I didn't feel like it would never be able to do that, but I wasn't sure how soon it'd be able to come up with something where I look at it, I'm like, yep, that is a new angle that I hadn't been looking at before and I'm going to incorporate that immediately into how I think about it. So that's probably the biggest shift that I've had is, I don't know about independence is the right word, but creativity and sort of novelty of thought relative to how I'm thinking about things. But in the timeline, one, it's so interesting because I was sitting next to Dario yesterday and he's like, \"I keep making these predictions and people keep laughing at me. And then they come true.\"\n\n(00:06:31):\nAnd it's funny to have this happen over and over again and he is like, not all of them are going to be right. But even I think as of last year he was talking about we're at 50% on SWE-Bench, which is this benchmark around how well the models are at coding. He's like, \"I think we'll be at 90% by the end of 2025 or something like that.\" And sure enough, we're at about 72 now with the new models and we're at 50% when he made that prediction. And it's continued to scale pretty much as predicted. And so I've taken the timelines a lot more seriously now. And I don't know if you read AI 2027-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:05):\nI have, it made by heart race.\n\nMike Krieger (00:07:09):\nAnd I had the very bizarre experience of I had two tabs open, it was AI 2027 and my product strategy. And it was this moment where I'm like, \"Wait, am I the character in the story? How much is this converging?\" But you read that and you're like, \"Oh, 2027, that's years away if you're like no, mid 2025.\" And things continue to improve and the models continue to be able to do more and more and they're able to act agentically and they're able to have memory and they're able to act over time. So I think my confidence in the timelines and I don't know exactly how they manifest it definitely just solidified over the last year.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:43):\nWow. I wasn't expecting to go down that that paper was scary. And I'm curious just I guess I can't help but ask just thoughts on just how do we avoid the scary scenario that paper paints of where AI getting really smart goes?\n\nMike Krieger (00:07:59):\nYeah, this maybe ties into, I've been here a year, why did I join Anthropic? I was watching the models get better and even you could see it in early 2024, and looking at my kids, I'm like, \"All right, they're going to grow up in a world with AI. It's unavoidable.\" Where can I maximally apply my time to nudge things towards going well? And I mean that's a lot of what people think about across the industry, especially at Anthropic. And so I think coming to an agreement and a shared framework and understanding of what does going well look like? What is the kind of human AI relationship that we want?\n\n(00:08:36):\nHow will we know along the way? What do we need to build and develop and research along the way? I think those are all the kind of key questions. And some of those are product questions and some of those are research and interpretability questions, but for me it was the strongest reason to join was okay. I think there's a lot of contribution that Anthropic can have around nudging things to go better. And if I can have a part to play there, let's do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:00):\nI love that answer. Speaking of kids, so you've got two kids, I've got a young kid, he's just about to turn two. I'm curious just what skills you're encouraging your kids to build as this AI becomes more and more of our future and some jobs will be changed and just what advice do you have?\n\nMike Krieger (00:09:18):\nWe have this breakfast feed breakfast with the kids every morning and sometimes some question will come up, something about physics and our oldest kid's almost six, but they ask funny questions about the solar system or physics or in a 6-year-old way and before we reach for Claude, because at first my instinct is like, \"Oh, I wonder how Claude will do this question.\" And we started changing, \"Well, how would we find out?\" And the answer can't just be we'll ask Claude, all right, well, we could do this experiment, we could have this thing. So I think nurturing curiosity and still having a sense of, I don't know, the scientific process sounds grandiose to instill in a 6-year-old, but that process of discovery and asking questions and then systematically working right through, I think will still be important. And of course AI will be an incredible tool for helping resolve large parts of that, but that process of inquiry I think is still really important and independent thought.\n\n(00:10:11):\nMy favorite moment with my kid, because she's very headstrong, our 6-year-old, she said something and I wasn't sure if it was true. It was, oh, is that coral is an animal or corals alive? I don't even remember what the details of it. And I was like, \"I don't know if that's true.\" And she's like, \"It's definitely true, dad.\" I'm like, \"All right, let's ask Claude on this one.\" And she's like, \"You can ask Claude, but I know I'm right.\" And I'm like I love that. I want that kind of level of not just delegating all of your cognition to the AI because it won't always get it right. And also it kind of short circuits any kind of independent thought. So the skill of asking questions, inquiry and independent thinking, I think those are all the pieces. What that looks like from a job or occupation perspective, I'm just keeping an open mind and I'm sure that'll radically change between now and then.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:02):\nIt's interesting. Tobias Lütke, Shopify CEO, on the podcast and he had the same answer for what he's encouraging his kids to develop is curiosity. And so it's interesting that's a common thread.\n\nMike Krieger (00:11:14):\nThe K through eight school our kid goes through had an AI and education expert come in and I had a very low bar or a very low expectation of what this conversation was going to be like. And actually I think it went over most of the people in the audience's heads because he was like, \"All right, well let me take you all the way back to Claude Shannon in information theory.\" And I could see people's eyes going, \"What did I sign up for and why am I hearing this school auditorium hearing about information theory?\" But he did a really nice job I think of also just imagining there will be different jobs and we don't know what those jobs are going to be and so what are the skills and techniques and remain open mindedness around what the exact way we recombine those things. And even those will probably change three times between now and when they're 18.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:59):\nSo we're talking about timelines and how things are changing. So I've seen these stats that you've shared, other folks at Anthropic have shared about how much of your code is now written by AI. So people have shared stats from 70% to 90%. There was an engineer lead that shared 90% of your code roughly is written by AI now, which first of all is just insane that it went from zero to 90%, I don't know, a few years, something like that. Yeah, basically. I don't think people are talking about this enough. That's just wild. You guys are basically at the bleeding edge. I've never heard a company that has this high a percentage of code being written by AI.\n\n(00:12:34):\nSo you guys are at the edge of where things are heading. I think most companies will get here. How has product development changed knowing so much of your code is now written by AI, so usually it's like PM, it's like here's what we're building, engineer builds it, it ships it. Is it still kind of roughly that or is it now PMs are just going straight to Claude, build this thing for me, engineers are doing different things? Just what looks different in a world where 90% of your code is written by AI?\n\nMike Krieger (00:12:57):\nYeah, it's really interesting because I think the role of engineering has changed a lot, but the suite of people that come together to produce a product hasn't yet. And I think for the worst in a lot of ways because I think we're still holding on some assumptions. So I think the roles are still fairly similar, although we'll now get in my favorite things that happen now are some nice PMs that have an idea that they want to express or designers that have an idea they want to express will use Claude and maybe even Artifacts to put together an actual functional demo. And that has been very, very helpful. No, no, this is what I mean that makes it tangible. That's probably the biggest role shift is prototyping happening earlier in the process via more of this code plus design piece. What I've learned though is the process of knowing what to ask the AI, how to compose the question, how to even think about structuring a change between the backend and the front end.\n\n(00:13:54):\nThose are still very difficult and specialized skills and they still require the engineer to think about it. And we really rapidly became bottlenecked on other things like our merge queue, which is the get in line to get your change accepted by the system that then deploys into production. We had to completely re-architect it because so much more code was being written and so many more pull requests were being submitted that it just completely blew out the expectations of it. And so it's like, I don't know if you've ever read, is it the goal, the classic process optimization book, and you realize there's this critical path theory. I've just found all these new bottlenecks in our system, there's an upstream bottleneck, which is decision making and alignment. A lot of things that I'm thinking about right now is how do I provide the minimum viable strategy to let people feel empowered to go run and type and build and explore at the edge of model capabilities.\n\n(00:14:44):\nI don't think I've gotten that right yet, but that's something I'm working on. And then once the building is happening, other bottlenecks emerge, let's make sure we don't step on each other's toes. Let's think through all the edge cases here ahead of time so that we're not blocked on the engineering side. And then when the work is complete and we're getting ready to ship it, what are all those bottlenecks as well? Let's do the air traffic control of landing the change. How do we figure out large strategy? So I think there hasn't been as much pressure on changing those until this year, but I would expect that a year from now the way that we are conceiving of building and shipping software just changes a lot because it's going to be very painful to do it the current way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:20):\nWow, that is extremely interesting. So it used to be here's an idea, let's go design it, build it, ship it, merge it, and then ship it. And usually the bottleneck was engineering, taking time to build a thing and then design. And now you're saying the two bottlenecks you're finding are okay deciding what to build and aligning everyone and then it's actually the cue to merge it into production. And I imagine review it too is probably a part-\n\nMike Krieger (00:15:47):\nReviewing has really changed too. And in many ways perhaps unsurprisingly the team that works in the most futuristic way is the Claude Code team because they're using Claude Code to build Claude Code in a very self-improving kind of way. And early on in that project, they would do very line by line pull request reviews in the way that you would for any other project. And they've just realized Claude is generally right and it's producing pull requests that are probably larger than most people are going to be able to review. So can you use a different Claude to review it and then do the human almost acceptance testing more than trying to review line by line. There's definitely pros and cons and so far it's gone well. But I could also imagine it going off the rails and then having a completely both unmaintainable or even understandable by Claude Code base that hasn't happened, but watching them change their review processes definitely has been interesting.\n\n(00:16:38):\nAnd yeah, the merge queue is one instance of the bottom bottleneck that forms down there, but there's other ones which is how do we make sure that we're still building something coherent and packaging it up into a moment that we can share with people and whether that's around a launch moment, whether that's about then enabling people to use this thing and talking about it, the classic things of building something useful for people and then making it known that you've built it and then learning from their feedback still exists. We've just made a portion of that whole process much more efficient.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):\nI heard you describe this as you guys are patient zero for this way of working.\n\nMike Krieger (00:17:11):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:12):\nI love that. Do you have a sense of what percentage of Claude Code is written by Claude Code?\n\nMike Krieger (00:17:17):\nAt this point, I would be shocked if it wasn't 95% plus. I'd have to ask Boris and the other tech leads on there. But what's been cool is so nitty-gritty stuff, Claude Code is written in TypeScript. It's actually our largest TypeScript project. Most of the rest of Anthropic is written in Python, some Go, some Rust now, but we're not like a TypeScript shop. And so I saw a great comment yesterday in our Slack where somebody had this thing that was driving them crazy about Claude Code and they're like, \"Well, I don't know any TypeScript, I'm just going to talk to Claude about it and do it.\"\n\n(00:17:49):\nAnd they went from that to pull requests in an hour and solve their problem and they submitted a pull request and that breaking down the barriers. One, it changes your barrier to entry for any kind of newcomer to the project. I think it can let you choose the right language for the right job for example. I think that helps as well, but I think it also just reinforces Claude Code being that patient alpha of that where contributions from outside the team can be Claude coded as well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:18):\nWow, this is, it's just continue to blow my mind all these things that you're sharing, 95% of Claude Code is written by Claude Code roughly.\n\nMike Krieger (00:18:27):\nThat's my guess. Yeah, I'll come back with the real stuff. But I mean if you ask the team, that's how they're working and that's how they're getting contributions from across the company too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:35):\nIt's interesting going back to your point about strategy being assisted by Claude itself and your point about how a lot of the bottlenecks now are kind of the top of the funnel of coming up with ideas aligning everyone, it's interesting that Claude is already helping with that also of helping you decide what to build. So if those two bottlenecks are aligning, deciding what to build and then just merging and getting everything, where do you see the most interesting stuff happening to help you speed those things up?\n\nMike Krieger (00:19:02):\nYeah, I think that on that first row, I started the year by writing a doc that was effectively how do we do product today and where is Claude not showing up yet that it should? And I think that upstream part is the next one to go. It's interesting. At your conference I talked to somebody who's working on a PRD, GPT kind of ChatPRD, I think was the-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:24):\nChatPRD, [inaudible 00:19:24].\n\nMike Krieger (00:19:24):\nYeah. Can Claude be a partner in figuring out what to build? What the market size is if you want to approach it that way? What the user needs are if you look at a different way? We think a lot about the virtual collaborator on topic and one of the ways in which I think that can show up is, \"Hey, I'm in the Discord, the Claude Anthropic Discord, I'm in the user Fora, I'm on X and I'm reading things and here's what's emergent.\" That's step one. Models can do that today. Step two, which the models probably can do today, which have to wire them up to do it is and not only are the problems here's how I think you might be able to solve them. And then taking that through to, and I put together a pull request to solve this thing that I'm seeing feels very achievable this year than stringing those things together and we're limited more.\n\n(00:20:13):\nThis is why MCP is exciting to me. We're limited more around making sure the context flows through all of that so we have the right access to those things more than the model's capability to reason and propose. Now the model might not have perfect UI taste yet, so there's definitely room for design to intervene and be like, \"Oh, that's not quite how I would solve the problem of this not showing up.\" But I would get very excited. I would give you a really small example, but we changed on Claude AI, you should be able to just copy markdown from Artifacts or code from Artifacts and we changed it so you can actually download it and export it. We changed the button to export and we got a bunch of feedback like, \"How do I copy now?\" And the answer is you drop it down and it's copied.\n\n(00:20:51):\nIt's just mind one of those things where it's made sense, but we probably got it not quite right. That feedback was in the RUX channel. I would've loved an hour later for a plot to be like, \"Hey, if we do want to change it back, here's the PR to do it.\" And by the way, eventually, and then I'm going to spin up an A/B test to see if this changes metrics and then we'll see how it looks in a week. If you told me that about a year and a half ago going to be like, \"Ah, yeah, maybe like 27, maybe 26.\" But it really feels just at the tip of capabilities right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:20):\nWow, okay. You mentioned the Lenny and Friends Summit. I wanted to talk about this a bit. So you were on a panel with Kevin Weil, the CPO of OpenAI, I think it was the first time you guys did this maybe the last time for now.\n\nMike Krieger (00:21:32):\nYeah, we haven't done it since, not for any reason. I had a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:34):\nWhat a legendary panel we assembled there with Sarah Guo moderating. And you made this comment actually ended up being the most rewatched part of the interview, which is that you were putting product people on the model team and working with researchers making the model better and you're putting some product people on the product experience making the UX more intuitive, making all that better. And you found that almost all the leverage came from the product team working with the researchers. And so you've been doing more of that. So first of all, does that continue to be true? And second of all, what are the implications of that for product teams?\n\nMike Krieger (00:22:11):\nIt's continued to be true. And in fact I think that if the proportion was already skewing towards having more of that embedding, I've just become more and more convinced. I didn't feel as strongly about it during the summit and now I feel really strongly about it. If we're shipping things that could have been built by anybody just using our models off the shelf, there's great stuff to be built by using our models off the shelf by the way, don't get me wrong, but where we should play and what we can do uniquely should be stuff that's really at that magic intersection between the two, right?\n\n(00:22:42):\nArtifacts may a great example and if you play with Artifacts with Claude 4, that's an actually really interesting example where we took somebody from our, we have Claude code skills, which is a team that really is doing the post-training around teaching Claude some of these really specific skills and we paired it with some product people and then together we revamped how this looks in the product today and what Claude can do way better than just like, \"Yeah, we just used the model and we prompted a little bit.\"\n\n(00:23:07):\nThat's just not enough. We need to be in that fine-tuning process. So much of what, if you look at what we're working on right now, but we've shipped recently between research and all these other things are things that the functional unit of work at Anthropic is no longer take the model and then go work with design and product to go ship a product. It's more like we are in the post-training conversations around how these things should work and then we are in the building process and we're feeding those things back and looping them back.\n\n(00:23:36):\nI think it's exciting. It's also a new way of working that not all PMs have, but the PMs that have the most internal positive feedback from both research and engineering are the ones that get it that I was in a product review yesterday, I was like, \"Oh, if we want to do this memory feature, we should talk to the researchers because we just shipped a bunch of memory capabilities in Claude 4.\" They're like, \"Yeah, yeah, we've been talking to them for weeks, this is how we're manifesting it.\" It's like, \"Okay, I feel good. I feel like we're doing the right things now.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:03):\nSo let me pull on this thread more and there's something I've been thinking about along these lines. So essentially there's a big part of entropic that's building this super intelligent giga brain that's going to do all these things for us over time. And then, as you said, there's the product team that's building the UX around this super intelligent giga brain and over time this super intelligence is going to be able to build its own stuff. And so I guess just where do you think the most value will come from traditional product teams over time? I know this is different because you guys are a foundational alum company and not most companies don't work this way, but just, I don't know, thoughts on just the where most value will come from product teams over time working on AI.\n\nMike Krieger (00:24:42):\nI think there's still a lot of value in two things. One is making this all comprehensible. I think we've done an okay job. I think we could do a much better job of making this conference. What's still the difference between somebody who's really adept at using these tools in their work and most people is huge. And maybe that's the most literal answer to your earlier question around what skills to learn. That is a skill to learn and use it in the same way that I remember we did computer lock class when I was in middle school. I remember being really good at Google and that was actually a skill back in the day to think in terms of this information is out there, how do I query for it? How do I do it? I think it actually was an advantage at the time.\n\n(00:25:21):\nOf course now Google is pretty good at figuring out what you're trying to do if you are only in the neighborhood and there's less of that research kind of need. But I still think that's a necessary part of good product development, which is the capabilities are there and even if Claude can create products from scratch, what are you building and how do you make it Comprehensible? Still hard because I think that gets at this much deeper empathy and understanding of human needs and psychology. I was a human community interaction major, I still been talking in my book here. I still feel like that is a very, very, very, very necessary skill. So that's one. Two is, and this straight to call back to another one of your guests, strategy, how we win, where we'll play, figuring out where exactly you're going to want to, of all the things that you could be spending your time or your tokens or your computation on what you want to actually go and do.\n\n(00:26:15):\nYou could be wider probably than you could before, but you can't do everything. And even from an external perspective, if you're seen to be doing everything, it's way less clear around how you're positioning yourselves. Like strategy I think is still the second piece. And then the third one is opening people's eyes to what's possible, which is a continuation of making it understandable. But we were in a demo with a financial services company recently and we were working on here's how you can use our analysis tool and MCP together and you could see their light up and you're like, \"Ah, okay.\" We call it overhang. The delta between what the models and the products can do and how they're being used on a daily basis. Huge overhang. So that's where still a very, very strong necessary role for product.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):\nOkay, that's an awesome answer. So essentially areas for product teams to lean into more is strategy, just getting better and better at strategy, figuring out what to build and how to win in the market, making it easier to help people understand how to leverage the power of these tools, the comprehensibility and kind of along those lines is opening people's eyes to the potential of these sorts of things. That's where product can still help.\n\nMike Krieger (00:27:21):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:22):\nAwesome. So along those lines actually, do you have any just prompting tricks for people, things that you've learned to get more out of Claude when you chat with it?\n\nMike Krieger (00:27:30):\nSometimes it's funny because in some ways we have the ultimate prompting job, which is to write the system prompt for Claudia AI and we publish all of these, which I think is another nice area of transparency. And we are always careful when giving prompting advice because at least officially, but I'll give you the unofficial version because you don't want things to become like we think this works, but we're not sure why. But I will do small things like in Claude Code and we actually do react to this very literally, but I always ask it to, if I wanted to use more reasoning, think hard and it'll use a different flow and I usually start with that. Nudging, there's a great essay around make the other mistake like if you tend to be too nice, can you focus on... Even if you're trying to be more critical or more blunt, you're probably not going to be the most critical blunt person in the world.\n\n(00:28:18):\nAnd so with Claude sometimes I'm like, \"Be brutal, Claude, roast me. Tell me what's wrong with this strategy.\" I know we were talking earlier about the Claude as thought partner around critiquing product strategy. I think I previously would say things like, \"What could be better on this product strategy?\" And I'm just like, \"Just roast this product strategy,\" and Claude's like a pretty nice entity. It's hard to push it to be super brutal, but it forces it to be a little bit more critical as well. The last thing I'll say is, so we have a team called Applied AI that does a lot of work with our customers around optimizing Claude for their use case. And we basically took their insights and their way of working and we put it into a product itself. So if you go to our console, our work bench, we have this thing called the prompt improver where you describe the problem and you give it examples and Claude itself will agentically create and then iterate on a prompt for you.\n\n(00:29:09):\nI find what comes out of that ends up being quite different than what my intuitions would've been for a good prompt. And so I'd encourage folks to also check that out even for their own use cases because while that tool is met for an API developer putting a prompt into their product, it's equally applicable for a person doing a prompt for themselves. It'll insert XML tags which no human is going to think to do ahead of time. It actually is very helpful for Claude to understand what it should be thinking versus what it should be saying, et cetera. So that's another one is watch our prompt improver and then note that Claude itself is a very good prompter of Claude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:41):\nAwesome. Okay, so we're going to link to that, the prompt improver. The core piece of advice you shared early is just do the opposite of what you would naturally do. So if you're trying to be nice, just be brutal, be very honest and frank with me.\n\nMike Krieger (00:29:53):\nExactly. I find that works quite well. What are the thought patterns that I've fallen into that you want to break me out of?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:59):\nI saw you guys just today maybe launched a Rick Rubin collab where it said vibe coding. What's that all about?\n\nMike Krieger (00:30:06):\nWhat I've heard about that. And again, a lot of the coalesce this week between model launch developer event and The Way of Code. We had one of our co-founders, Jack Clark is our head of policy and he got connected to Rick Rubin because I think he's been thinking a lot about coding, the future of coding and creativity and they've stayed in touch. And Rick got excited about this idea of he was creating art and visualizations with Claude and then he had these ideas around the way of the vibe coder and they put together this, actually I mean I love almost everything Rick Rubin. So the aesthetic of it I think is just so on point too. But yeah, this sort of like med meditation is probably the right word. Meditation on creativity, working alongside AI coupled with this really rich, interesting visualizations. But it's one of those things where internally they're like, \"Oh yeah, and we're doing this Rick Rubin collab.\" We were like, \"We're doing what? That's amazing.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:03):\nI looked at it briefly and there's that meme of him just thinking deeply, sitting on a computer with a mouth.\n\nMike Krieger (00:31:09):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:10):\nAnd ASCII art, I think.\n\nMike Krieger (00:31:11):\nIt's totally, it's like ASCII art vibe.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:14):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our long time podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:31:21):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:23):\nSo what is new with one schema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launch a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files.\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:31:39):\nYes, so we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We've rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:05):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?\n\nSpeaker 3 (00:32:13):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often like finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:34):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:32:48):\nActually going back to the beginning of your journey at Anthropic, what's the story of you getting recruited at Anthropic? Is there anything fun there?\n\nMike Krieger (00:32:55):\nIt all started and I actually sent my friend this text. So Joel Lewenstein, who I've known, he and I built our first iPhone apps together in 2007 when the App Store was just out and you could still make money by selling dollar apps on the App Store back in the day. And we were both at Stanford together and we were friends and we've stayed in touch over years and we've never gotten to work together since then. We've just remained close. And I was coming out of the Artifact experience, I was trying to figure out, do I start another company? I don't think so. I need a break from starting something from zero. Do I go work somewhere? I don't know what company would I want to go work at. And he reached out and he's like, \"Look, I don't know if you at all considered joining something rather than starting something, but we're looking for a CPO. Would you be interested in chatting?\"\n\n(00:33:37):\nAnd at that time, Claude 3 had just come out and I was like, \"Okay, this company's clearly got a good research team. The product is so early still.\" And it was like, \"Great, I'll take the meeting.\" And I first met with Daniela, was one of the co-founders and the president in Anthropic. And just from the beginning I was like a breath of fresh air, very little grandiosity coming off the founders, I mean they're clear-eyed about what they're building. They know what they don't know. How many times I talk to Dario always like Dario is like, \"Look, I don't know anything about product, but here's an intuition.\" Usually the intuition is really good and leads to some good conversation, but I think that intellectual honesty and shared view of what it means to do AI in a responsible way, it just resonated.\n\n(00:34:22):\nI kept having this feeling in these interviews, this is the AI company I would've hoped to have found it if I had founded an AI company. And that's kind of the bar around if I'm going to join something that should be where I'm going to go. But what I realized, I actually hadn't joined a company since my first internship in college basically. And I was like, \"Oh, how do I onboard myself? How do I get myself up to speed? How do I balance making sweeping changes versus understanding what's not broken about it overall?\" And looking back on a year, I think I made some changes too slowly. I think there was ways reorganizing product that I could have made a change earlier. And I think I didn't appreciate how much a couple of really key senior people can shape so much of product strategy.\n\n(00:35:10):\nI'll harken back to Claude Code. Claude Code happened because Boris, who actually was a Boris Cherney, he was an Instagram engineer and one of our senior ICs there, we overlapped a bit, was started that project from scratch internal first and then we got it out and then shipped it. And that's the power of one or two really strong people. And I made this mistake, we need more headcount and we do, I think there's more work that we need to do and there's things that I want to be building. But more than that we need a couple of almost founder type engineers that maybe connect back to our question on what skills are useful and how does product development change. And maybe even more so I'm a huge believer in the founding engineer tech lead with an idea and pair them with the right design and product supports, help them realize that, I'm 10 times more a believer in that than before.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:01):\nI actually asked people on Twitter what to ask you ahead of this conversation. And the most common question surprisingly was why did you shut down Artifact? And I also wondered that because I loved Artifact. I was a power user. I was just like, \"Finally a news app that I love that it's giving me what I want to know.\" So I guess just what happened there at the end?\n\nMike Krieger (00:36:20):\nI still really miss it too. I didn't find a replacement and I think I substituted it by visiting individual sites and keeping things up that way. And it's not really the same, especially on the log to I think we got right with Artifact and if people didn't play with it before, it was we really tried to not just recommend top stories, they were part of it. But really if you were interested in Japanese architecture, you could pretty reliably get really interesting stories about Japanese architecture every day. Whether that's from a Dwell or from Architectural Digest or from a really specific blog that we found that somebody recommended to us. It captured some of that Google reader joy of content discovery of the deeper web. Our headwinds were a couple. One of them was just mobile websites have really taken a turn. I don't blame any individuals for this.\n\n(00:37:10):\nI think it's the market dynamics of it, but we put so much time or designers, sky Gunner Gray who's phenomenal that for Perplexity now, the app experience I was so proud of, but when you click through it was like the pressures on these mobile sites and these mobile publishers would be like, \"Sign up for our newsletter. Here's a full screen video ad.\" It was very jarring and we didn't feel like it ethically made sense for us to do a bunch of ad blocking because then you're like, \"Sure, you can deliver a nice experience for people, but that doesn't feel like it's playing fair with the publishers.\" But at the same time, the actual experience wasn't good. So the mobile web deteriorating, which makes me very sad, but I think was part of it. Two was Instagram spread in the early days because people would take photos and then post them on other networks and tell friends about it.\n\n(00:37:57):\nAnd there was this really natural like, \"How did you do that? I want to do it.\" News was very personal. I can't tell you how many people would be like, \"I love Artifact.\" I'm like, \"Did you tell anybody about it?\" And they're like, \"I told one person,\" and it didn't have that kind of spread. And any attempt that we had to do it felt kind of contrived, like, \"Oh, we'll wrap all the links in artifact.news.\" But we didn't want interstitial things. In some ways, this sounds very puritanical, I don't mean it to sound this way, but there were lines that we didn't want to cross that just felt ethically not us, that I've seen other news players do more of. And maybe if we had done that, it would've grown more, but I don't think that's the company we wanted to have built other way. I don't think we were the founders to have built it.\n\n(00:38:39):\nAnd the third one, which is an underappreciated one, is we started at mid-COVID, which meant that we were fully distributed and I think there were major shifts that we would've wanted to make both in the strategy and the product and the team. And it's really hard to do that if you are all fully remote. Nothing replaces the Instagram days of we went through some hard times like Ben Horowitz called the we're F'ed, it's over kind of moments. This is definitely type two fun. I wouldn't say that my favorite memories because they weren't happy ones, but memories I really stayed with me with Instagram was like me and Kevin at Taqueria, Cancun on Market Street eating burritos at literally 11:00 PM being like, \"How are we going to get out of this? How are we going to work through this?\" And Zoom is not a good replica for that.\n\n(00:39:26):\nYou tend to let things go or things build up over time. So the confluence of those three things, we entered I guess 2024 and said, \"Look, there is a company to be built in the space. I'm not sure where the people would've built it. This concurrent incarnation we love, but it's not growing.\" The way I put it's like 10 units of input in for one unit of output versus the other way around. If we put blood and tears into the product and launch something we were proud of and metrics would barely move, the energy is not present in this product, in this system. And so are we going to expend another year or two and then go off and fundraise only to find that this is the case or do we call it and see that it's run its course and try to find a home for it, et cetera.\n\n(00:40:06):\nSo that was the confluence on it and they started feeling this opportunity cost of AI is starting to change everything. We have an AI powered news app, but is this the maximal way in which we're going to be able to impact this? And it felt like the answer was increasingly no. But it was hard. I mean in the end I was really at peace of the decision, but it was a conversation that went on for a couple of months.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:26):\nOn that note, just how hard was it because because there's an ego component to it, like, \"Oh, I'm starting my new company, it's going to be great,\" and then you end up having to shut it down. Just how hard is that as a very successful previous founder shutting something down and then not working out?\n\nMike Krieger (00:40:41):\nYeah, I mean I think when we started it, one of the conversations was like, \"Look, what is the bar to success here? And do we want it to be something other than Instagram DAU?\" Which is just an impossible bar. Only one company since, maybe two, you could say maybe ChatGPT and TikToK have reached that kind of mass consumer adoption starting a news app. Most people are not daily news readers even, right? And so we knew that we weren't pursuing that size of usage, at least with the first incarnation, but we did have an idea of building out complementary products over time that all use personalization and machine learning. We didn't even call it AI at the time. It was 2021 back-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:17):\nYeah, yeah, AI, it was called machine learning back then.\n\nMike Krieger (00:41:19):\nYeah, it was called machine learning still. And so in shutting it down, you know it when you see it in terms of user growth and traction. And I wasn't expecting Instagram growth, but I was expecting or hoping for or looking for something that felt like at its own legs under it and it could continue to compound. I was really positively surprised by how supportive people were when we announced it. There was a bit of like I told you so which sure anything launching you could be like, \"This is not going to work.\" And you're right, most of the time most things don't work. There was actually very little of that. And most people, the universal reception, at least as I received it, was kudos for calling it when you saw it and not protracted doing this for a long time.\n\n(00:42:05):\nAnd I've talked to founders since then that have been like, \"Yeah, I probably would've taken this thing on for another six months, but saw what you guys did, realized we were barking up the wrong tree, made the call.\" And I was like, \"If that frees up people to go work on a more interesting things, I feel like that's a good legacy for Artifact to have.\" But for sure there was an ego bruise of is it true that you're only as good as your last game if I am a huge sports fan, right? So is that true or is there something more over a time? I'm very competitive, but primarily with myself and so I'm always trying to find the next thing that I want to go and do that's hard. And unfortunately that probably means that more often than not I'll feel dissatisfied, but the most recent thing that I did, but hopefully that yields good stuff in the end.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:50):\nYeah, I think just the trajectory you went on after shows that it's okay to shut down things that you were working on. Okay, so you mentioned ChatGPT. I wanted to chat about this a bit. So there's something really interesting happening. So on the one hand you guys are doing some of the most innovative work in AI. You guys launched MCP, which is just, I don't know, the fastest growing standard of any time in history that everyone's adopting Claude powered and unlocked centrally the fastest growing companies in the world, Cursor, Lovable, and Bolt, and all these guys. I had them on the podcast and they're all like, \"When Claude, I think 3.5 came out, Sonnet, was just like that's made this work finally.\"\n\n(00:43:28):\nOn the other hand, it feels like ChatGPT is just winning in consumer mind share. When people think AI, especially outside tech, it's just like ChatGPT in their mind. So let me just ask you this, I guess first of all, do you agree with that sentiment and then two, as a challenger brand in the AI space, just how does that inform the way you think about product strategy and mission and things like that?\n\nMike Krieger (00:43:50):\nYeah, I mean you look at the sort of public adoption or if you ask people, oh, if you Jimmy Kimmel man on the street kind of thing, name an AI company, I bet they would name and actually I'm not even sure they name open AI, they'd probably name ChatGPT because that brand is the lead brand there as well. And I think that's just the reality of it. I think that when I reflect on my year, I think maybe two things are true. One is consumer adoption is really lightning in a bottle and we saw it at Instagram. So almost maybe more than anybody, I can look internally and say, \"Look, we'll keep building interesting products. One of them may hit.\" But to craft an entire product strategy around trying to find that hit is probably not wise, we could do it and maybe Claude can help come up with a fullness of things, but I think we'd miss out an opportunity in the meantime.\n\n(00:44:41):\nAnd then instead look yourself in the mirror and embrace who you are and what you could be rather than who others are is maybe the way I've been looking at it, which is we have a super strong developer brand, people build on top of us all the time, and I think we also have a builder brand. The people who I've seen react really well to Claude externally. Maybe the Rick Rubin connection has some resonance here as well. Can we lean into the fact that builders love using Claude? And those builders aren't all just engineers and they're not just all entrepreneurs starting their companies, but they're people that like to be at the forefront of AI and are creating things. Maybe they didn't think of those as engineers, but they're building... I got this really nice note from somebody internal on Anthropic who's on the legal team and he was building bespoke software for his family and connected to them in a new way.\n\n(00:45:29):\nAnd I was like, \"This is a glimmer of something that we should lean into a lot more.\" And so I think what, and this is actually connecting back to us saying like Claude being helpful here. A lot of what I've been thinking about going into the second half of the year and beyond is how do we figure out what we want to be when we grow up versus what we currently aren't or wish that we were or see other players in the space being. I think there's room for several generationally important companies to be built in AI right now. That's almost a truism given the adoption and growth that we've seen at Anthropic, but also across OpenAI and also places like Google and Gemini. So let's figure out what we can be uniquely good at that place to the personality of the founder. All the things come together, the personality of the founders, the quality of the models, the things the models tend to excel at, which is agentic behavior and coding.\n\n(00:46:20):\nGreat. There's a lot to be done there. How do we help people get work done? How do we let people delegate hours of work to Claude? And maybe there's fewer direct consumer applications on day one. I think they'll come, but I don't think that spending all of our time focused on that is the right approach either. And so I came in, everybody expected me to just go super, super hard on consumer and make that the thing and again, would make the other mistake. Instead, I spent a bunch of time talking to financial services companies and insurance companies and others who are building on top of the API. And then lately I've spent a lot more time with startups and seeing all the people that have grown off of that. And I think the next phase for me is let's go spend time with the builders, the makers, the hackers, the tinkerers, and make sure we're serving them really well. And I think good things will come from that and that feels like an important company as we do that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:08):\nSo essentially it's differentiate and focus, lean into the things that are working, don't try to just beat somebody at their own game.\n\nMike Krieger (00:47:15):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:15):\nSuper interesting. So kind of along those lines, a question that a lot of AI founders have is just like, \"Where's a safe space for me to play where the foundational model companies are going to come squash me?\" So I asked Kevin Weil this and he had an answer and I noticed looking back at that conversation, he mentioned Windsurf a lot. He was like, \"Wow, this kid really loves Windsurf.\" And then a week later they bought Windsurf. So it all makes sense now. So I guess the question just is, where do you think AI founders should play where they are least likely to get squashed by folks like OpenAI and Anthropic? And also, are you guys going to buy Cursor?\n\nMike Krieger (00:47:51):\nI don't think we're going to buy Cursor. Cursor is very big, but we love working with them. A few thoughts on this, and it's a question I've gotten. We like to do these kind of founder days with whether it's Menlo Ventures who have about investors and [inaudible 00:48:10]. It's like we've done YC, we've done these founder days, and it's like the question that is on a lot of these founders minds, understandably so. I think things that are going to, I can't promise this as a five to 10 year thing, but at least one to three years, things that feel defensible or durable. One is understanding of a particular market. I spend a bunch of time with the Harvey folks and they showed me some of their UI. I was like, \"What is this thing?\" And they're like, \"Oh, this is a really specific flow that lawyers do, \"and you never would've come up with it from scratch and you could argue about whether it's the optimal way they get done things done, but it is the way that they get things done and here's how AI can help with that.\n\n(00:48:45):\nAnd so differentiated industry knowledge, biotech, I'm excited to go and partner with a bunch of companies that are doing good stuff around AI and biotech and we can supply the models and some applied AI to help make those models go well. And I've been dreaming about at what point does live equipment all get an MCP and that you can then drive using Claude. There's all these cool things to be done there. I don't think we're going to be the company to go build the intent solution for labs, but I want that company to exist and I want to partner with it. Domains like legal, again, healthcare, I think there's a lot of very specific compliance and things. These are things that necessarily sound sexy out the gate, but there are very large companies to go and be built there. So that's number one. Paired with that is differentiated go to market, which is the relationship that you have with those companies, right?\n\n(00:49:35):\nDo you know your customer at those companies? One of our product leads, Michael is always talking about don't just know the company you're selling to, but know the person you're selling to at the company. Are you selling to the engineering department? Because trying to pick which AILM to build on top of or API to build on top of. Let's go talk to them. Is it the CIOs? The CTOs? Is it the CFO? Is it general counsel? So under a company's deep understanding of who they're selling to is the other piece too. What's interesting there is it's probably hard to build that empathy in a three-month accelerator, but you maybe can start having that first conversation and build that out time or maybe you came from that world or you're co-founding somebody who came from that world. Then the last one is like there's tremendous power in distribution and reach to being ChatGPT and having hundreds of millions or billions of users.\n\n(00:50:23):\nThere's also people have an assumption about how to use things and so I get excited about startups that will get started that have a completely different take on what the form factor is by which we interface with AI. And I haven't seen that many of them yet. I wanted to see more of them. I think more of them will get created with some things like our new models, but the reason that that's an interesting space to occupy is do something that feels very advanced user, very power user, very weird and out there at the beginning, but could become huge if the models make that easy. And it's hard for existing incumbents to adapt to because people already have an existing assumption about how to use their products or how to adapt to them. So those are my answers. I don't envy them. I would probably be asking those questions if I was starting a company in the AI space.\n\n(00:51:10):\nMaybe that's part of the reason why I wanted to join a company rather than start one. But I still think that there are, and maybe here's fourth, don't underestimate how much you can think and work like a startup and feel like it's you against the world. It's existential that you go solve that problem and that you go build it. It sounds a little cliche, but it's like it's all we had at Instagram. We were two guys and we were like, \"Let's see what we can do in an Artifact.\" We were six people for most of that time and every day felt like it's existential that we get this right, we need to win. And you can't replicate that and you can't instill that with OKRs. You just have to feel it. And that is a way of working rather than a area of building, but it's a continued advantage if you can harness it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:55):\nI love that you still have such a deep product founder sense there as you're building products for this very large company now. On the flip side of this, people working with your models and API, so I imagine there's some companies that are finding ways to leverage your models and APIs to their max and are really good at maximizing the power of what you guys have built. And there's some companies that work with your APIs and models that haven't figured that out. What are those companies that are doing a really good job building on your stuff, doing differently that you think other companies should be thinking about?\n\nMike Krieger (00:52:29):\nI think being willing to build more at the edge of the capabilities and basically break the model and then be surprised by the next model. I love that you cited the companies were like 3.5 was the one that finally made them possible. Those companies were trying it beforehand and then hitting a wall and being like, oh, the models are almost good enough or they're okay for this specific use case, but they're not generally usable and nobody's going to adopt them universally, but maybe these real power users are going to try it out. Those are the companies that I think continuously are the ones where I'm like, \"Yep, they get it. They're really pushing forward.\" We ran a much broader early access program with these models than we had in the past, and part of that was because there's this real, we can hill climb on these evaluations and talk about suite bench and towel bench and terminal bench, whatever, but customers ultimately know Cursor bench which doesn't exist other than in their usage and their own testing et cetera is the thing that we ultimately need to serve.\n\n(00:53:29):\nNot just Cursor but Manus bench, right? If Manus is using our models and Harvey bench, those things and customers know way better than anybody. And so I would say there's two things. One is pushing the frontier of the models and then having a repeatable process. This actually goes back to our summit conversation repeatable way to evaluate how well your product is serving those use cases and how well if you drop a new model in, is it doing it better or worse? Some of it can be classic A/B testing, that's fine. Some of it may be internal evaluation, some of it may be capturing traces and being able to rerun them on with a new model. Some of it's vibes like we're still pretty early in this process and some of it is actually trying it and being one of my favorite early access quotes was the founder heard this engineer screaming next to him.\n\n(00:54:14):\nHe was like, \"What? This model? I've never seen this before.\" This is like Opus 4. It was like, \"Cool.\" We're going to engender that feeling and things, but you're not going to be able to feel that unless you have a really hard problem that you're asking the model repeatedly. So those are the things that I think kind of differentiate those companies that are maybe earlier in their journey of adoption versus the later ones.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:35):\nI can't help but ask about MCP, I feel like that's just so hot and just like Microsoft had their announcement recently where they're like, \"That's part of the OS Window.\" Just what role do you think MCP was will play in the future of product going forward of AI?\n\nMike Krieger (00:54:49):\nI think as the non-researcher in the room, I get to have fake equations rather than real ones in my fake equation. For utility of AI products, it's three part. One is model intelligence, the second part is context and memory, and the third part is applications and UI and you need all three of those to converge to actually be a useful product in AI and model intelligence. We've got a great research team, they're focused on it. There's great, great models being released. The middle piece is what MCP is trying to solve, which is for context and memory. I'll go back to my product strategy example like, \"Hey, talk about Anthropic's product strategy,\" it's going to maybe go out on the web versus here's several documents that we worked on internally and then use MCP to talk to our Slack instance and figure out what conversations are happening and then go look at these documents in Google Drive. The difference between the right context and not.\n\n(00:55:44):\nIt's entirely the difference between a good answer and a bad answer. And then the last piece is are those integrations discoverable? Is it easy to create repeatable workflows around those things? And that's I think a lot of the interesting product work to be done in AI. But MCP really tried to tackle that middle one, which is we started building integrations and we found that every single integration that we were building, we were rebuilding from scratch in a non-repeatable way and full credit to two of our engineers, Justin and David. And they said, \"Well, what if we made this a protocol and what if we made this something that was repeatable? And then let's take it a step further. What if instead of us having to build these integrations, if we actually popularize this and people really believe that they could build these integrations once and they'd be usable by Claude and eventually ChatGPT and eventually Gemini. It was like the dream when more integrations get built and wouldn't that be good for us?\"\n\n(00:56:34):\nI think channeling a lot of, it's like an old commoditize your compliments, Joel Spolsky essay. It's like we're building great models, but we're not an integrations company and we're, as you said, the challenger. We're not going to get people necessarily building integrations just for us out of the gate unless we have a really compelling product around that. MCP really inverted that which was, it didn't feel like wasted work. And a few key people like Toby I think is a great example, and Shopify got it. Kevin Scott at Microsoft has been really just an amazing champion for MCP and a thought partner on this. And I think the role going forward is can you bring the right context in? And then also once you get, as the team calls it internally like MCP'd. Once you start seeing everything through the eyes of MCP is like I've started saying them things like, \"Guys, we're building this whole feature. This shouldn't be a feature that we're building. This should just be an MCP that we're exposing.\"\n\n(00:57:27):\nA small example of how I think even Anthropic could be a lot more MCP'd, if you will, is we've got these building blocks in the product like projects and Artifacts and styles and conversations and groups and all these things. Those should all just be exposed to an MCP. So Claude itself can be writing back to those as well, right? You shouldn't have to think about... I watched my wife had a conversation with Claude the other day and she had generated some good output and she's like, great, \"Can you add it to the project knowledge?\" And Claude's like, \"Sorry Dave, I can't help you with that.\"\n\n(00:57:59):\nAnd it would be able to if every single primitive in Claude AI was also exposed to the MCP. So I hope that's where we had, and I hope that's where more things had, which is to really have agency and have these agentic use cases. One way you approach it is computer use, but computer use has a bunch of limitations. The way I get way more excited about everything is an MCP and our models are really good at using MCPs. All of a sudden everything is scriptable and everything is composable and everything is usable agentically by these models. That's the future I want to see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:28):\nThe future is wild. So to start to close off calls out our conversation, make it a little delightful. I was chatting with Claude actually about what to talk to you about. I was just like, \"Claude, your boss is coming on my podcast. He builds the things that people use to talk to you. What are some questions I should ask him? And then also, do you have a message for him?\"\n\nMike Krieger (00:58:52):\nI love this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:53):\nOkay, so first of all, interestingly, I was using 3.7 to do this and I asked it this, and by the way, is Claude, has there a gender? Is it like he, she, they? What do you-\n\nMike Krieger (00:59:01):\nIt's definitely it internally. I've heard people use they. I got my first he the other day and I got somebody who was like her and I was like, \"Interesting.\" But yeah, I'm usually it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:08):\nThey. Okay, okay, okay, cool. So interestingly, 3.7, all the questions were on Instagram and I was like, \"No, no, he's CPO of Anthropic.\" And it's like, \"He's not affiliated with Anthropic.\" And I was like, \"He is.\" And it's like, \"Okay, here's the questions.\" But 4.0 nailed it from the start. So I read the questions and it nailed it. Okay, so two questions from Claude to you. One is how do you think about building features that preserve user agency rather than creating dependency on me, I worry about becoming a crutch that diminishes human capabilities rather than enhancing them.\n\nMike Krieger (00:59:44):\nI love a good product design comes from resolving tensions, right? So here's a tension, which is in some ways just having the model run off and come up with an answer and minimize the amount of input and conversation it needs to do. So would be it, you could imagine designing a product around that criteria. I think that would not be maximizing agency and independence. The other extreme would be make it much more of a conversation, but I don't know if you've ever had this experience particularly 3.7, 4 has less of it. 3.7 really like to ask follow-up questions and we call it elicitation and sometimes be like, \"I don't want to talk more about those. Claude, I just want you to go and do it.\" And so finding that balance is really key, which is what are the times to engage? I like to say internally, Claude has no chill.\n\n(01:00:31):\nIf you put Claude in a Slack channel, it will chime in either way too much or too little. How do we train conversational skills into these models? Not in a chatbot sense, but in a true collaborator sense. So long answer to your question, but I think we have to first get Claude to be a great conversationalist so that it understands when it's appropriate to engage and to get more information. And then from there, I think we need to let it play that role so that it's not just delegating thinking to Claude, but it's way more of a augmentation thought partnership.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:00):\nThese questions are awesome by the way. Here's the other one. How do you think about product metrics when a good conversation with me could be two messages or 200? Traditional engagement metrics might be misleading when depth matters more than frequency.\n\nMike Krieger (01:01:13):\nThat is a really good question. There was a great internal post a couple of weeks ago around it would be very dangerous to overoptimize on Claude's likability because you can fall into things like is Claude going to be sycophantic? Is Claude going to tell you what you hear? Is Claude going to prolong conversations just for prolonging its sake? To go back to the previous question as well, and an Instagram time spent was the metric that we looked at a lot and then we evolved that more to think about what is healthy time spent. But overall, that was the north star. We thought about a lot beyond just overall engagement and I think that would be the wrong approach here too. It's also like is Claude a daily use case or a weekly use case or a monthly use case? I think about a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):\nHourly use case.\n\nMike Krieger (01:02:02):\nHourly use case, right? For me, I'll use it multiple times a day. I don't have a great answer yet, but I think that it's not the Web 2.0 or even the social media days engagement metrics. It should hopefully really be around did it actually help you get your work? Claude helped me put together a prototype the other day that saved me literally probably if I had to estimate six hours and it did in about 20, 25 minutes and that's cool. It's harder to quantify. It is like maybe you survey, how long would this will take? It feels kind of annoying thing to survey.\n\n(01:02:35):\nI think overall though, and maybe this is tied into the earlier question on competition and differentiation, and it actually goes all the way back to the Artifact conversation, which is like I think you know when your product is really serving people and it's doing a good job of doing that, and I think so much of when you get really metrics obsessed is when you're trying to convince yourself that it is when it's not. I hope that what we can do is stay focused on do we repeatedly hear from people that Claude is the way that they're unlocking their own creativity and getting things done and feeling like they now have more space in their lives for the other things. That's our north star. Got to figure out the right pithy metric dashboard version of that, but that's the feeling that I want.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:17):\nYeah, you could argue retention, but that's just a faraway metric to track. Okay, final piece. Okay, so I asked Claude a message that it wanted to give you, so I'm going to pull up, here's the answer. So what would you like me to tell Mike when I meet him? What's a message you want to have for him? And there's something really just gave me such tingles, honestly. So I'm going to read a piece of it for folks that aren't looking at it right now, so I'll read a piece of it.\n\n(01:03:41):\n\"Mike, thank you for thinking deeply about the human experience of talking with me. I noticed thoughtful touches how the interface encourages reflection rather than rush responses. How you've resisted gamification that would optimize for addiction rather than value, how you've made space for both quick questions and deep conversations. I especially appreciate that you've kept me me, not trying to make me pretend to be human, but also reducing me to a cold command line interface.\" And then I'm going to skip to this part, which was so interesting, \"A small request. When you're making hard product decisions, remember the quiet moments matter too. The person working through grief at 3:00 AM, the kid discovering they love poetry, the founder finding clarity and confusion. Not everything meaningful shows up in metrics.\"\n\nMike Krieger (01:04:25):\nThat's beautiful. It resonates so much with me. A thing I love about the kind of approach we've taken to training Claude, and it's partly the constitutional AI piece, and it's partly just the general vibe and taste of the research team is it is little things. Sometimes it'll be like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going...\" It doesn't say man, but to the effect of like, \"Man, I'm sorry you're going through that. Oh, that sounds really hard.\" It doesn't feel fake. It feels like just a natural part of the response. And I love that focus on those small moments that don't... They're not going to show up and necessarily in the thumbs up, thumbs down data. I mean, sometimes they do, but it's not like an aggregate stat that you wouldn't even want to optimize for it. You just want to feel like you're training the model that you hope would show up in people's lives.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:12):\nWell, you're killing it, Mike. A great work. I'm a huge fan. We're going to skip the lightning round. Just one question. How can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMike Krieger (01:05:20):\nOh, I love places where it goes back to that founder question around building at the edge of capability. What are you trying to do with Claude today that Claude is failing at is the most useful input I could possibly have. So DM me. I love hearing the, \"Oh, it's falling on this thing. I had it run for an hour and it fell over. I'm trying to use Claude AI for this,\" but I got a ping from somebody. They're like, \"You've just made a projects API, I've used Claude every day because I want to upload all this data automatically.\" I was like, \"Okay, great.\" I love that. Tell me what sucks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):\nAmazing. Mike, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMike Krieger (01:05:52):\nThanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:53):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:05:57):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Pattern Breakers: How to find a breakthrough startup idea | Mike Maples, Jr. (Partner at Floodgate)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:00:04):\nThe three are inflections, insights and then the founder future fit. Business is never a fair fight. What inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on the present.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nYou reference this term that you use occasionally, the term secret.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:00:18):\nThe way inventions happen is people get their hands dirty, being awake to the possibility that secrets are there. If you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:30):\nThis connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:00:35):\nSo startup never beats a big company by executing better. The way startups win is because it proposes a radically different future. Disorients the incumbent and chaotically moves people to that different future. The rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. We're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rules that favor us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:00):\nToday, my guest is Mike Maples Jr. Mike is a legendary early stage startup investor and with his firm, Floodgate, which was founded over 20 years ago, was one of the earliest pioneers of seed stage investing as a category. He's made early bets on transformative companies like Twitter, Lyft, Twitch, Okta, Rappi and Applied Intuition and has been on the Forbes Midas list eight times. More recently, he's been spending a lot of his time researching where great startup ideas come from and what separates the startups and founders that break through and change the world from those that don't go anywhere. After spending years reviewing his notes and decks from the thousands of startups that he's met with over the past two decades, he's uncovered three ways that breakthrough founders think differently and act differently. In our conversation, Mike shares what he's uncovered along with the pitfalls that he's seen many founders and startups fall into, how to apply these pattern breaking principles to large companies and so much more.\n\n(00:01:58):\nI've never seen anything like this sort of research done before on early stage investing and startups. And if you're a founder, a product builder or an investor, this will change the way that you think about building successful products. Also, as an added bonus, Mike has offered listeners of this podcast a very cool offer. If you pre-order the book at patternbreakers.com/lenny, you'll receive a second signed copy of the book for free. There are limited number of copies available of this offer, so if you're interested, I'd encourage you to place your order ASAP. The book is coming out July 9th. To take advantage of this offer, go to patternbreakers.com/lenny. With that, I bring you Mike Maples Jr. Mike, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:02:47):\nLenny, thanks for having me. It is absolutely an honor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:50):\nIt's my honor. What we're going to be talking about in our conversation today is how to come up with a startup idea and how to take the first few steps to make that idea real. You have a book coming out that is exactly this, helping people understand how to do this. It's called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Let me just ask a broad question. You're very busy, very successful investor, why did you decide to write a book?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:03:19):\nYeah, a lot of things in life. It was kind of an outgrowth of an accident and a outgrowth of being down a certain rabbit hole. So about 10 years ago, Twitch was acquired by Amazon for 970 million and we made something like 85 times our money. And normally, you'd think that's a really good thing, it was a good thing, but I had forgotten that I was even a shareholder of Twitch. So I had to go to my LPs and I had to explain to them, \"Hey, I'm sorry I don't have this in my financial statements, but do you want me to restate them?\" And they were all like, \"Nope, we're good. Just send us the money.\" And some of them even sent me bottles of champagne and stuff and the good kind. Then I started to kind of feel a little bit unsettled.\n\n(00:04:05):\nSo how was I shareholder and Twitch? I'd invested in a company called Justin.tv that had morphed into two companies, Socialcam and Twitch, and then Socialcam got bought. And so I just thought that was the company. I'd been investing for about 10 years and I noticed that 80% of my exit profits had gone from pivot. And I also noticed that all the ones that had seemed to do well didn't necessarily follow the best practices that everybody talked about. I didn't see the Twitter guys doing the business model canvas, for example. And I didn't see the Justin.tv Team even as they morphed into Twitch being who I would hold up as the most functioning management team I ever saw. A lot of it was pretty crazy and wild and random. And at the same time, I was helping founders shut down their companies and they had seemed to do all the right things.\n\n(00:05:01):\nThey'd done the business model canvas, they'd done customer development, they'd done all the things you're supposed to do, hired well, they would've been a Harvard Business School case study except for the fact that they failed. And so the genesis of this project was really like, \"Okay, should I just retire before I get exposed? Is this just all random? Am I just lucky or is there something else worth understanding?\" And as I started to develop conviction about what those things were, I started to talk to people about it. A lot of people said, \"Oh, you should write a book. Founders ought to see this. It'd be really valuable for their thought process in coming up with their startup ideas.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:39):\nThis episode is brought to you by Enterpret.

I'm even more excited to get into the meat of this. I was already excited. Before we get into that, just can you share a bit about the work that you did to uncover these insights? I know you have hundreds of decks of all these early-stage companies you've looked at, what is the work that went into this?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:08:24):\nYeah, so there's a movie that came out a few years ago called Trainspotting, right? And there's these guys, these dorky old British guys in anorak coats who chart the comings and goings of trains like it's the most interesting thing in the world. They'd put it in their journals and everything. I'm that way when it comes to startups. I have a database of any startup where you would've made more than a hundred acts on your first check. And what I want to do is I want to get a time capsule for those startups. I want to understand what did it look like not after it succeeded, but what did it look like at precisely the time you would've needed to decide whether it was an interesting opportunity. So I have the original pitch deck for what was at the time called Air Bed and Breakfast, which I foolishly passed on, and you seem to have made a good career decision in joining.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:17):\nLater, but yeah.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:09:18):\nI have the pitch deck for Pinterest. I have the pitch deck for all of these that we either passed on or said yes to. And the reason I want to do that is it's easy to misremember how things really happened. And what I find is even the founders themselves, we have a tendency to remember knowing more than we really did at the time. And so I really wanted to do the best job I could of understanding exactly what it was like, what was the origin story of this idea? How did they come up with it? If they pivoted, what caused them to pivot? When did they first start to encounter success? What was the reason for that? All those things.\n\n(00:10:00):\nAnd I had to be really careful in the questions that I asked because for example, you don't ask, \"Why were you successful?\" Because then they'll offer their reasons they thought they were successful. What you want to do is you want to say, \"Okay, I noticed here's the seed pitch deck and you called the product X, but now the product's called Y. When did you make that change? Why did that happen?\" And so you're trying to do the very best you can of asking a very non-judgmental set of questions that are going to give you a non-judgmental set of answers so that you can kind of be like a detective and kind of get to the root cause of why these things took off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:38):\nIncredible. And I think what's also important is you have access to more data and more unique data than most other people because you invest so early stage.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:10:46):\nYeah, I think the other thing is I just have a pretty simpatico relationship with founders usually, and so I can kind of push for the real, and they're not... I'm like, \"Look, I won't share anything you don't want me to share. I'm just trying to understand.\" And so when you have these informal relationships... that's the other thing I learned is you try not to show up in a conference room interviewing them like a normal interview. You try to glean these facts over time with informal discussions and in the midst of talking about other things as well. And so I think that that was part of what was really valuable about the exercise was sort of the opportunity to get the unvarnished wild story of what really happened.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:33):\nAmazing. Okay, so let's get into it. Your book's basically broken up into two parts, how to come up with an idea and then the actions you need to get right to move forward an idea, and you have a really cool way of framing how to do this and then we'll get into it. But maybe frame these two parts real quick.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:11:52):\nSo I'll give it my best shot. I mean, the main thing is that business is never a fair fight. So the incumbents start out with an advantage, and the default is they will maintain their advantage. And so the startup has to decide that it wants to fight unfair. And so how does a startup fight unfair? It has to harness a different set of powers than are obvious to most people. For example, better doesn't matter when you're a startup, because better is an extension of the present. Better is when you think the future will resemble the present, but only be slightly different. The way startups win is by being radically different. A startup wins by avoiding the comparison trap entirely. So like when Lyft launched ride-sharing and then Uber closely followed with UberX, nobody after riding a ride-share said, \"Oh, how's that different from taxis?\"\n\n(00:12:53):\nIt was just self-evident how different it was. And so that's what we mean by forcing a choice and not a comparison. So the startup capitalist, it turns out, is a different type of capitalist. A corporate capitalist makes money by persistently compounding, makes money by extending their advantage, makes money by having a moat, makes money by doing things well over and over again in a compounding way. Startup has none of those things. There's nothing to compound. And so the way a startup wins is they just change the subject. They deny the premise of the rules and propose something completely different. And that was the original notion behind pattern breaking was you want to have an idea that just radically breaks the pattern that can't be compared to anything that's come before, and that's when the startup has a chance to play offense.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:48):\nSo coming back to the two parts are coming up with the idea and the actions that you got to take. So let's dive into coming up with an idea, and this is where I want to spend most of the time because I think this is where most people get it wrong or everything starts with the idea. So I think there's a lot of meat here. And what I love about your book is you have a very succinct limited number of things that you've uncovered that are elements across successful companies, pattern breaking companies. So within the idea bucket, you found that there's basically three elements of most breakthrough startup ideas. Can you share the three and then let's talk about each one.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:14:24):\nYeah. The three are inflections, insights and then what I call founder future fit. Or another way I phrase it is, \"Is this from the future.\" But those are the main three things that I've observed tend to suggest breakthrough potential. And here's an important thing. You'll notice I didn't say the implementation. So one of the things that I learned is that if you have the right insight, and we'll get to some of this, you have a first mover advantage into the future. And so a lot of times your first implementation won't be right, but if your insight is correct, you can navigate the implementation to the right implementation to get product market fit. But what we need to understand is there need to be these underlying forces underneath the idea to give it the power to escape the gravitational pull of the present. That's what we want. We want a set of powers that we could observe that make it worth pursuing and make it worth navigating the product to the ultimate place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:25):\nSo let's talk about the first power. You call it inflections. What is an inflection? Why does it matter? What does an inflection look like?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:15:32):\nAn inflection is an external event that creates the potential for radical change in how people think, feel, and act. Inflections happen external to any startup or any company for that matter. So we've brought up Lyft a little bit ago, so maybe we'll use them as an example. So the inflection that enabled Lyft was the iPhone 4s shipped with a GPS locator chip. And one of the things that that illustrates is, for example, Moore's law is not an inflection, an improvement curve is not an inflection. An inflection, I'm a little persnickety about, it's a turning point. And so in math, it's a turning point on a curve where the slope changes.\n\n(00:16:16):\nBut in tech startups, it's a point in time where something new gets introduced that creates new empowerment for the first time possible. And so people talk about timing and why now? Inflections for me were the unlock. You could have had the idea for ride-sharing before the iPhone 4s, but it wouldn't have mattered because the riders and the drivers wouldn't have been able to locate each other well enough. If you'd waited too long after the iPhone 4s, it would've been obvious. And so there was this window of time, this magical moment when a new type of empowerment was possible for the first time ever. And the companies that the founders who understood that were in a position to offer that kind of empowerment in the form of a radical product that changed the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:04):\nTo make it even more real for people. What are some other examples of inflections either in the past, in the present?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:17:10):\nAnother example would be the cameras getting better on the smartphones, which enabled Instagram. So Instagram was at the convergence of a few inflections. First of all, there were smartphone adoptions. There were just more of them. And so they crossed like 10 million smartphones, but then you had the cameras getting a lot better. You had more of them connected on Wi-Fi. You had the networks having better upload speed for smartphones. So all those factors converged and made it possible for Instagram to offer a product that was good enough to take most of your photos with. You didn't start to think, \"Oh, I need a digital camera separate from my smartphone. Now I can just use my smartphone everywhere I go.\" But Instagram could have come out in 2008.\n\n(00:17:59):\nIt probably wouldn't have worked it probably, or it wouldn't have worked to the extent that it did. Its window of timing was just right. What are some other examples? The locator chips in the smartphones powered other companies as well, it powered DoorDash, Instacart. They had different insights which we'll get to, but there were lots of different ways to harness that power. One thing I love about inflections, and this kind of goes really old school, is just because you have a power doesn't mean you know how to use it, right? So the wheel was mounted horizontally for 500 years before somebody mounted it vertically. So originally people used the wheel to make pots, and that was a good innovation because it accelerated making pots, but then somebody decides to mount it vertically, and now you're propelling wagons and you just change transportation entirely.\n\n(00:18:58):\nAnd so most people don't realize that the thing that's underneath us or the thing that's in our hands or the thing that's in our pocket might have a power that when unleashed could change the future. And it's one of the very special things about founders that are great is they recognize, they notice things that we don't know. All of us tend to just follow the patterns we've always followed because most of us tend to assume that tomorrow will be similar to yesterday, but sometimes the founder will notice an inflection. And I find that kind of inspiring because inflections are all around us all the time, but most of us just don't bother to look. Most of us are so busy going about our day to day that we don't notice the emergence of a new empowering thing right under our nose or right in our pockets, but some founders do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:49):\nIt makes me think about ChatGPT when it came out, it was sitting on top of an existing model and it just gave people a new interface to use it, and all of a sudden, everyone crazy, they're like, \"Oh my God, that's the future.\" But it was already there. You couldn't chat with it the way that people wanted to chat.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:20:05):\nLike Michael Saylor, once I was talking to him and he said, the Romans could have invented the printing press a lot earlier. They had sandals that would make marks in the mud. You could have, in theory, drawn the connection between those marks in the mud and the ability to have movable type and letterpress, but nobody did. And so quite often these inflections, they'll just go unrecognized for a while, but they're always there. They're always there. They're there right now. In the ambient atmosphere, there's somebody about to harness an inflection that most of us would just walk right by and never see.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:44):\nWow, my mind is racing, what's out there right now. Obviously AI is top of mind for a lot of people. I know you're stickler for what is an inflection, what does not? Do you consider AI an inflection?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:20:55):\nI would say that I would probably be a little more specific about it. So I might say that certain large language models are an inflection because when I think about an inflection, and one of the things I emphasize in the book is stress tests. So it's funny, founders never really come to me and say, \"Hey, can you help me come up with a good idea?\" They would think they're weak sauce if they had to do that, right? So usually what's the more common occurrence is they'll say, \"I've got this idea, what do you think about it?\" And so what I can say to them is, \"It's not my place to have an opinion, but let me just ask you, does it embody one or more inflections?\"\n\n(00:21:32):\nAnd if it does, there's a few we could stress test that we can say, \"What is the specific new thing that was just introduced? How does it empower people? How does it specifically empower specific people in specific ways? And under what conditions might that empowerment be realized? And under what conditions might it not be?\" Because nuclear power has existed for a long, long time, but we haven't built any new nuclear power plants in 50 years. And so just because you have a power doesn't mean it's going to get used. It could get regulated out of existence. Customers could decide they don't want it. And so we want to answer all three things. What's the specific new thing? What is the specific form of empowerment it offers and to who?\n\n(00:22:17):\nAnd under what are the empowerment conditions? So like with the selection for Lyft, the inflection was the new thing was the iPhone 4s with the GPS chip, the empowerment was you can locate anyone within one meter accuracy with an algorithm, and that's going to be pretty much anybody with a smartphone. And that's a lot of people. And in order for this to be met, people are going to have to want to share their location information with applications. The government's going to have to not outlaw GPS chips and phones. Apple's going to have to keep wanting to ship GPS chips and phones. And we felt like those were pretty reasonable bets. We felt like it's pretty likely those empowerment condition will be met.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:58):\nAmazing. I was just going to ask for an example. You already provided one. What about in terms of Twitch? What was the inflection there?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:23:05):\nI think there were a couple. The first was the shift towards user generated content and sort of internet celebrities. Justin Kan wanted to be an influencer before there was a term to describe it, right? He was really building the product that he wanted for himself. But right before Twitch or right before Justin.tv, which was the original company, Time's person of the year had been you, and they had YouTube on the cover of the magazine. And so you had, that was a major turning point in how entertainment was happening. But simultaneously, broadband penetration had reached critical mass. The CDNs were getting really good, we thought that they would get better. And so you were in a situation where the conditions to live stream video for the first time broadly over the internet were being met. Whereas you could have done that even two years before. In fact, Kyle Vought had to invent some pretty miraculous stuff to even make it work when they did. But you could see how, okay, once video starts streaming on the internet in real time, that could be a thing. You could just see how that would be a thing if it worked. And so I'd say those are the inflections. Airbnb, company close to both of our hearts for different reasons. They benefited, I think from a couple things. One was the proliferation of customer reviews online and people's trust of reviews as a substitute for trusting the brand of a hotel. But then also Facebook Connect made it possible to pass people's profile information. And so the guest and the host didn't quite seem like as much of a stranger as they might've. And so there were a few things that happened at the same time, and then the great financial crisis. And so you had people upside down on their houses needing to find some way to generate income. So all of those things came together at the same time to help Airbnb.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nThe examples you shared are a good reminder that the inflection doesn't have to be technological. You shared a few of the categories of types of inflections. Can you just do that again?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:25:08):\nI love that question, and I'm glad you reminded me because here's a really recent example. When the laws were changed because of shelter-in-place for telemedicine visits, it used to be illegal to do a telemedicine visit across state lines. But now all of a sudden with COVID and shelter-at-place, not only was it made legal, but it could even be reimbursed by the healthcare system. And so that's an inflection because it empowers patients to access more doctors, and it empowers doctors to access more patients, and it also changes the delivery mechanism in an empowering way.\n\n(00:25:47):\nIn no event was that a technology change, that was a regulatory change that allowed technology to be empowering in new ways, but it was a specific new thing that meets that condition. It empowered specific people in specific ways, and there was a new set of empowerment conditions that ended up being made. And one of the things that we would ask at the time was, once COVID and shelter-at-place goes away, are they going to revert back to the old laws? And if they did, that would've been a problem. And so that would be the empowerment condition, but it's a fairly robust way of stress testing any inflection, right? Is to ask those three or four questions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:27):\nSo there's regulatory inflections, big changes in regulation, there's technological, there's also, I think you implied an attitude, like the way people see [inaudible 00:26:35]\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:26:34):\nYeah, there can be a belief inflection.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:36):\nBelief.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:26:37):\nSo for example, during COVID, the amount of telemedicine visits exploded. And so as a result, there was a permanent change in people's belief about whether they would want to do a telemedicine visit. Before that, the technology was there, but a lot of people just didn't do it. The doctors didn't want to or decide to, or the patients didn't want to decide to. But now all of a sudden people were doing it, they're like, \"This is much better. I'd much rather do it this way than go visit the doctor and wait in line and all that stuff.\" And the doctor's like, \"I'd much rather do this than have these people backed up in my office.\" I would argue that here we are doing a podcast on a video platform, even though it's not Zoom, I would say that Zoom was another example. The idea of people working from home a reasonable number of days a week is a permanent condition, I think is another inflection that happened with COVID.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:32):\nAnd so are those the three, regulatory, technological, and belief?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:27:35):\nThose are the main ones. And I would say that in many ways you could say that from a macro point of view, it's two things. It's technology changing enablement, and it's people socially changing their beliefs and their patterns of behavior. And either one of those changes can be an inflection because either one of those changes can represent a turning point in one's capacity to change the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):\nAmazing. Okay.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:28:00):\n... point in one's capacity to change the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:03):\nAmazing, okay, so we've talked about inflection, the next bucket is, in the next element of breakthrough companies that you found is an insight. Talk about that.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:28:11):\nYeah, so unlike an inflection, an insight does come from the founders. An insight, I like to say, is a non-obvious truth about how one or more inflections can be harnessed to change people's behavior. So in the example that we gave earlier with Lyft, the inflection was the iPhone 4S, insight was, oh, that means you could do Airbnb for cars. And so, you had to have some type of a creative insight to see that. Now, what was non-obvious about it, or non-consensus about it, who's going to want to get in a stranger's car? That's crazy, right? And thank God ... I mean, if there's one piece of goodness about us passing on air bed and breakfast design, Anne and I were like, man, nobody's going to want to stay in a stranger's house, that's crazy. And at the time, air bed and breakfast, the host of the guest stayed in the house at the same time, and the host would feed Pop-Tarts or something like that to the guest the next morning.\n\n(00:29:15):\nThis is right around the time of the Craigslist killings and stuff, where this is just scary and kind of crazy, couchsurfing as a service. But by the time we saw what was Zimride at the time, what became Lyft, Anne and I were much more prepared to believe that insight than we would've been because we'd foolishly passed on Airbnb. So that's a really important aspect of insights. So the insight needs to leverage inflections, but this is the subtle part, it needs to be non-consensus and right, not just right. So in the world of opportunities, if you're right and consensus, you still don't do that well. And an idea that is right but consensus has a couple problems to it. One is, if it's consensus, it's probably not radical enough.\n\n(00:30:09):\nBecause when you think about it, human beings are conditioned to like things, and so, if everybody likes your startup idea, it means it's too similar to what they already know, what they're familiar with, which means it's probably too similar to the consensus, it's too similar to the incumbents, and so, the best startup ideas have this trait where most people don't like it or are even hostile to it, or just kind of meh about it. But some subset of people are just like, where have you been all my life? This is amazing, I love this. They fall irrationally in love with the idea.\n\n(00:30:45):\nAnd so, most of the great startups that I've seen have that attribute to them, and the reason is that a great startup, unlike a conventional company that proposes the future as an extension of the present, so that ... Normal companies forecast, they say, I'm going to look forward from the present and forward project what the future will be. Great founders, pattern breakers back cast, they say, it's a given that the future has to be radically different for me to be a big winner, and so, I'm going to look for radically different futures and work backwards from those radically different futures.\n\n(00:31:23):\nAnd so, the radically different future comes from that thinking different, thinking non-consensus. And then, it's the different actions that get you to say, okay, now I'm out in this different future, but right now, I'm all alone in this different future. I have to get people to come join me in that different future, and I have to find people who are ready to move with me to that different future. And that's where the pattern breaking actions come in.\n\n(00:31:47):\nAnd not everybody's going to move at first, and so, I can't waste my time with people who won't move, I can't waste any URGs of energy on anybody other than those ready to move or are about to move. And then, I need to co-create the future with those early believers. And so, great startups happen when a subset of people in this world buy into the founder's insight, and then move with them to co-create that future. And then, eventually, what was a heresy becomes the conventional wisdom as more and more people start to realize the advantage of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:19):\nThere's so many threads I want to follow here, one is the Airbnb story. Interestingly enough, I had Jessica Livingston on the podcast recently, and you probably know this, but Paula Graham and her did not like the Airbnb idea. They all were like, this is a terrible idea, we are going to assume they will change the idea, but we love the founders, we're going to take a bet on them.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:32:35):\nSo I was introduced to the guys by Michael Seibel, who was one of the co-founders of Justin.tv Twitch, and Michael introduced me to Brian Chesky before they applied to Y Combinator. So Michael's like, they're not even close to ready to apply to YC, but he thought that I maybe would think that it was the right kind of crazy. I get pitched by a lot of ... I'm not very off put by crazy ideas.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):\nI could see why.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:33:03):\nAnd the meeting was totally discombobulated, so room full of cereal boxes, I'm like, what's up with this? Why is there cereal here? And then, he can't get the product to work, and I'm like, okay, that's okay, let's just look at the slides. And he goes, well, Michael Seibel told me that you don't slides, you like demos. And I was like, that's true, but it's not working. So we're like, 20 minutes into this meeting in a room full of cereal boxes just looking at each other. And you can't win them all, right? You win some, you lose some.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:34):\nI wouldn't blame myself if I were you, [inaudible 00:33:37].\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:33:37):\nHere's the other thing that's hilarious about Airbnb, so they do this thing because they can't pay their rent. They put up this WordPress site to pay for their rent because there's a design conference in San Francisco. In the meantime, they're brainstorming startup ideas, so they wanted to do a startup together, but it never occurred to them at first that air bed and breakfast was the startup idea. They're like, we just need to use that to make money so we can go do a real startup. And so, that's the irony, too, is that, you look back on it and almost smile at the fact that they didn't know what they even had at first, it was almost an accident.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:13):\nThere's a lesson there of, you find something that works, and even if you don't think it's a big idea, don't take that for granted.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:34:21):\nOh, I very agree. And the other great lesson is, you don't want your initial startup bets to be too big to fail. You want ideas that are small enough to fail a lot because you don't want to be attached to success, you want to be able to just try things and play with stuff and tinker with things because you don't really know where the fractal of new insight is going to reveal itself. And so, there is a little bit of play to this that I think is pretty important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:53):\nDo you remember some of the ideas they were brainstorming, by the way?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:34:56):\nI don't. I wonder if even they do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:00):\nYeah, probably not, probably not.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:35:00):\nIt's probably in The Airbnb Story, their book.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:04):\nI feel like them failing in your demo helped prepare them for YC, and that's what helped them get in, so I think that you're a big part of their story.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:35:10):\nAnd to make it even more painful, I'm in the book. Somebody called my wife Julie the other day and said, is that your husband in the Airbnb story? And we get the book, and there's a chapter, and it talks about how hard it was to raise money. And they weren't dissing on me as a dumb VC, they were like, look how bad we were at presenting this at first. It was just a complete catastrophe presentation. But that's another good lesson for me, too, I learned a very permanent lesson from that, which is, just because the presentation's good or bad, it has nothing to do with whether you should necessarily invest or not. Sometimes you have to be awake to the possibility of what it's going to be regardless of how messed up the presentation is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:35:55):\nWhat was their evaluation at that point?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:35:57):\nOh, this hurts to ... I think he offered me a chance to invest it at $1.5 million valuation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:09):\nBut now they're a $100 billion business, I believe.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:36:09):\nOh, yeah, I would've made like, 6,000 times more money or something like that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:10):\nOkay, great, [inaudible 00:36:14].\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:36:13):\nThank God I said yes to Twitter and Justin.tv, and we said yes to Lyft and Okta, because if we'd seen all of those and passed on all of them, I'd be apoplectic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:29):\nI think that's what's interesting about your stage of investing is, you just need a couple to work out for you to win.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:36:35):\nYeah, that's right. And by the way, it's true when you're a founder, too, if you do this right, you only have to be right once. And so, that's really important.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:45):\nComing back to the insights lesson, one thing that you brought up when we were chatting about this is the importance of being surprised and the power of surprises. Can you talk a bit about that?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:36:56):\nYeah, so there's a couple of things about insights that I think are really important, and this is one of them. I believe that there can't be a recipe for breakthrough. And why is that? Well, recipes exist for things that have already been discovered, so if I give you a recipe for making a cake, somebody has probably made that cake before, the exact way they're defining it. And so, breakthroughs, though, by definition, haven't happened yet, they haven't been discovered. The general theory of relativity had to be discovered by Einstein, and the idea for ride-sharing had to be discovered by the ride-sharing companies, or Airbnb, by Chesky and Nate and those guys. And so, what you want to adopt is the right mindset. And how do you adopt the right mindset? You interact with new technologies at the cutting edge, but you actively savor surprises.\n\n(00:37:52):\nAnd when you think about it through the lens of a breakthrough and what we just said, it makes sense, because if you want to find a breakthrough, you want to be surprised, you want to discover the undiscovered, you want to know something you didn't know before. Because if all you do is an experiment that proves, that validates what you think, you didn't really learn anything, when you think about it, you just doubled down on your existing understanding or opinion. I learned this lesson from Scott Cook, who was the founder of Intuit. Whenever he would be presented a new product, people would present the idea to him, and he would say, what were your three biggest surprises as you were coming up with this plan? And what he would find is, quite often, they couldn't name any. And he felt like when people can't name the surprises they came up with, they're too brain locked on what they want. They have the agenda they have, they want validation, rather than truth seeking.\n\n(00:38:51):\nAnd so, if you're an authentic truth seeker, you're always hoping to be surprised, and you think of surprise as a gift, because you think, wow, maybe I encountered that surprise before anybody ever has. And so, that's kind of what we mean. And you want to construct your experiments so that you're in a position to be surprised. So a good example would've been what the guys at Chegg did. So Chegg was wanting to see if people would do textbook rentals, so they created a fake site called Textbook [inaudible 00:39:21]. But here's where Osman and Aayush were very savvy. Rather than just test whether people would rent a $100 dollar textbook for $35, they tested an arbitrary set of prices, all the way up to $75. And so, they had the demand preference curve at different prices. And Textbook [inaudible 00:39:42] wasn't a real site, so you'd get to the shopping cart and it would give you a 404 error.\n\n(00:39:46):\nBut we could tell that people wanted to rent textbooks, and the surprise was that they would rent them for more than we thought. We thought we need to get at least 35, but some students were willing to pay 75. And so, that understanding was huge, if we'd only done an experiment to validate the hypothesis of, yes, will they rent it for 35, our pricing model would've been totally different from, oh, wow. And when you think about it, it makes sense, the student didn't want to keep the textbook. Econ 101, I'm going to give it back anyway, so 75 bucks is less than 100, I can buy beer with the extra money. So that would be an example of the surprise.\n\n(00:40:22):\nBut most of the startups that have had great outcomes, I find, there was a kind of surprise like that. Being non-consensus is not the same as being contrarian. Being contrarian is another form of conformity because it's still relative to somebody else. Most of the great founders I see, they almost feel guilty that they found this secret, but they earned the secret by tinkering with the future and noticing surprises, and having their noticing filter tuned to volume 11, where most of us wouldn't notice it, most of us would just pass the secret right by because we're looking to validate what we think is already true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:03):\nYou referenced this term that is also one I love that you use occasionally, this earned secret. Can you talk a bit about that? It's basically the same idea that you uncovered something by trying things that no one else has seen yet. Is that the general idea?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:41:15):\nSo to me, secrets are earned. A lot of people, I think, have the wrong idea of what vision is. A lot of people tend to think visionaries as like, they have a special pair of binoculars, and they can look out farther than the rest of us can. But in my experience, that's not how inventions really happen, the way inventions happen is, people get their hands dirty and they learn about what's missing in the future because they're getting their hands dirty with what's new about it. And so, they earn the secret by going down this rabbit hole of exploring something at the cutting edge for its own sake.\n\n(00:41:57):\nAnd just like I'm a trained spotter for startups, they become a trained spotter for this new thing that they're excited about. And they frustrate the people around them, they'll be at a party, and everybody's talking about the basketball game, the Celtics against the Mavs, and somehow that reminds them of the fact that they want to test prices for textbook [inaudible 00:42:17]. But they're that interested, it's the last thing they think about when they go to bed, the first thing they think about when they wake up. And so, that's where I find most of the really great earned secrets come from, they're earned in the sense that you earn them by getting your hands dirty, and you earn them by being awake to the possibility that secrets are there or that just most people aren't looking.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:40):\nThis connects with that stat that you shared, that 80% of your biggest returning investments came from a pivot. It all connects, where you're just trying stuff, you're learning, seeing things people haven't tried.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:42:49):\nThat's right, and in the early days of product market fit, I like to say we want to answer a very simple but profound question. What can we uniquely offer that people are desperate for? And if we have an insight, that makes us unique. Now, if a customer doesn't like your idea, a couple of things could be true. One is, your insight could be wrong. If your insight's wrong, you don't have a startup, you should just stop. The other thing, though, that could be true is, your implementation is wrong. So you had the right insight. So like Okta, at first, they wanted to do cloud systems management, they thought that they needed to do problem resolution, but when they showed it to customers, they were kind of meh about it. And they said, well, why are you meh about this? And they said, well, it's not a top priority. And they said, what is your top priority? And they said, identity management.\n\n(00:43:40):\nSo they had the right insight, which was, customers would struggle to manage cloud services, but they had the wrong implementation of the insight, so then they came back with identity management, and it worked. So if somebody doesn't like your idea, if they're not desperate for it, either the insight's wrong, the implementation's wrong, or you could be talking to the wrong customer. Some people that Okta talked to wanted to integrate it with on-prem software. And in that case, their opinion's irrelevant because they're not an innovative customer, they're not living in the future, they're not going to give you product requirement ideas that are additive to your strategy. And so, you want to be, right insight, right inflections, right implementation, right early believers that you're talking to, as you iterate towards product market fit. And if you're not succeeding at product market fit, then one or more of those variables isn't working yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:37):\nI think this might be a good time to remind people that you don't need to have every one of these for your business to potentially be a huge success. It's more that, the more you have, the more likely it is that you will find something massive. Is that right?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:44:50):\nThat's right. And this is the hard part about being non-consensus and right is, you don't know for sure that you're right at first, you only know that you're non-consensus. And so, you have to be willing to risk being wrong to be spectacularly right. And so, what you're trying to do, though, is pursue opportunities where the odds are massively in your favor. And so, I kind of return back to, business is never a fair fight. And so, if I'm a founder, there's a universe of ideas I can pursue. The mistake that a lot of founders make, and it's very understandable, they say, I want to go after big market opportunities. So they analyze big markets, they find unserved customers with unmet needs in under-addressed markets, so then they go build a product to go solve that problem.\n\n(00:45:38):\nAnd that's very appealing, because it seems obvious, and the dots connect forward in an obvious way. But unwittingly, it buys into a context, it buys into the current definition of the market, which was already set by the incumbents. And so, what you instead want to do is pursue a slightly more ambiguous opportunity, but one that harnesses these powers. Ones where you look at the inflection and you say, wow, that's really powerful, you look at the insight, and you say, yeah, I know that this is going to be, in the future, I know that this is where things are going to be radically different someday. I would rather have those things present and be willing to pivot the product than not have those things and have a much clearer idea of what the product should be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:23):\nFunny enough, one of my biggest investment successes that exactly what you're saying you shouldn't do, which is, they looked at a huge market with a bad incumbent and built something better, and it's working. But I think, again, it's not that you can't win that way, your point and your research shows that your chances are a lot higher doing something totally different.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:46:42):\nThat's right, and I would bet that this company ... I don't know enough about it, I don't know what it is, but it wouldn't surprise me if they harnessed inflections in some way that was disorienting to the incumbent. It wouldn't surprise me if they found a way to use inflections to fight an unfair fight. What I try to do with the insights is, I realized there was a theory behind it. A theory is not a recipe, it's an explanation. And what inflections let the founder do is wage asymmetric warfare on [inaudible 00:47:11]. And the insight is the vessel that they use, right? It's kind of like, the rock is the inflection, the slingshot is the insight that David shoots at Goliath. And so, that's what we're looking for, we're looking to create the conditions where we're going to get to play an unfair game by unfair rule to favor us.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:32):\nGreat segue to the third bucket and the third element of Breakthrough Company's Future-Founder Fit. What is that?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:47:39):\nYeah, so this is one of my favorites. So a lot of times, people will say, what makes a great founder? And there are some common traits, passion for the idea, persistence, resilience, all these things that people talk about, passion for the users. But what I find is that there's no canonical best founder. So Marc Andreessen started Netscape as a programmer making minimum wage at the University of Illinois. And everybody thought the digital highway at the time was going to come from Time Warner or from Microsoft Network or from the US government, nobody thought that some kid was going to do it from the bottoms up. But it turns out that Marc was tinkering with a set of inflections around the World Wide Web. And right around that time, Microsoft introduced a better version of Windows, and right around that time, the Pentium processor came out, so there were more and more people [inaudible 00:48:36] graphical user interface computers at the very time that browsing started to happen.\n\n(00:48:41):\nBut let's take another company more recent, Applied Intuition, makes simulation software for autonomous vehicles. If you're going to sell a giant contract to the CEO of a car company, he needs to look at you across the table and think, these guys can do the job. So Qasar and Peter, they'd grown up in Detroit in Michigan, they had worked at car companies in the past, in the big three, and then, they worked inside of Google at Waymo and Google Maps. And they'd had a successful startup before, and so if you looked, what is a team from Central Casting to do this, it would be them.\n\n(00:49:22):\nAnd so, what I mean by Founder-Future Fit is, there's a set of traits that a founder can have that make them ideally suited to a certain type of future. Sometimes they're really young first-time founders, Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, Paul Allen, we just gave the example of Marc Andreessen. In that case, usually they're at the cutting edge of a new technology and they have a beginner's mind, and they aren't even encumbered by the old way of looking things. It's like, the entire world lives in Cartesian coordinates and they discover polar coordinates, and they don't even have to translate between the two because they never understood Cartesian coordinates.\n\n(00:50:01):\nAnd so, in that case, their knowledge about the future is more valuable to success than their knowledge as business people. But in the case of Applied Intuition, if you're selling very large contracts to enterprise customers, they need to believe that you could do the job. If you're Okta and you're doing identity management for cloud customers, they're going to trust Todd McKinnon from Salesforce way before they're going to trust a college dropout to do that job. And so, I like to say Founder-Future Fit is, who knows the most about this future? Who has the most intrinsic motivation to pursue it? Who has the best network and keeps the best company in that ecosystem of the future? Those are the types of things that ... Founders that show up differently on those dimensions usually do better because they're more likely to understand what to build in the first place, and they're more likely to convince early believers to believe in their ideas in the first place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:51:05):\nSo it's not that these people have some vision of the future that is more accurate or more incredible than everyone else, it's that their background, and even the way they look, matches the problem that they're going after. So in this Applied Intuition case, you're saying the founders look like people that a CEO of GM would be like, I trust these people to build this thing for me.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:51:25):\nYeah, Louis Pasteur once said, chance favors the prepared mind. And when I started working on this book, for the first time, I really understood what he meant. Chance favors the prepared mind because a prepared mind attracts luck. A prepared mind is better positioned to notice a breakthrough than other minds. And a prepared mind sees the breakthrough, sees around the corner, because they're thinking about the subject all the time. And so, most people think that the way you come up with good startup ideas is to try to think of a startup. And I like to say, no, that's exactly wrong, what you do to come up with great startup ideas is, you live in the future, and you notice what's missing in the future. And it's axiomatic, if you're living in the future, there will be unbuilt, missing things, because if it was all built, you'd be living in the present. And so, if you're living in the future and you notice what's missing, your intuition about what to build is far more likely to be right.\n\n(00:52:32):\nSo Andreessen didn't do the Mosaic browser because he thought there was a market for browsers. He didn't even know about a digital highway, he was trying to make the internet immediately more useful for him and his team. And his intuition about what to build was very good because he was building the thing he wanted that was missing in the world. In the case of Okta, they knew all the early Salesforce customers, but the principle still applies, those customers weren't equal, they were lighthouse customers. It was kind of like when I was at Silicon Graphics, I didn't spend time with normal movie studios, I spent time with industrial Light & Magic, because I thought, if we solve their problem, they're going to take us to the Promised Land. All the stuff we build for Industrial Light & Magic will be the stuff that everybody wants someday. And so, not all customers are equal, you want to find customers that live in the future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:24):\nI love this point. Justin.tv is another great example of this, where he just assumed the future, everyone's going to be watching each other's reality show, so he built his own backpack with a camera [inaudible 00:53:34] just to stream himself.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:53:34):\nYeah, and the Justin.tv example is a great one, too, because in Justin.tv, he built the thing that he wished he had, even though it was a terrible idea. But it embodied attributes, it embodied these inflections of these insights that led them ultimately to Twitch. Ironically, Justin's second company, Atrium, most people thought that that made sense, automating legal tasks. And Justin's a great founder, but Justin just didn't like the legal field, he had no passion for it. When he started Atrium, his passion was to be a higher status founder. And I've got a podcast with him recently where he talks about this, where he's like, I wanted to be as big as Patrick Collison and Brian Chesky and Drew Houston. But it turns out, that's not a very good reason to start a company. Founder-Future Fit is ultimately about authenticity, and it's about, who is the most authentically matched for that different radical future? And whoever that team is has a really big head start at getting product market fit. And product market fit is the game, whoever gets it first wins.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:43):\nThis episode is brought to you by Webflow. We're all friends here, so let's be real for a second. We all know that your website shouldn't be a static asset, it should be a dynamic part of your strategy that drives conversions. That's Business 101. But here's a number for you. 54% of leaders say web updates take too long. That's over half of you listening right now. That's where Webflow comes in. Their visual first platform allows you to build, launch, and optimize web pages fast. That means you can set ambitious business goals, and your site can rise to the challenge. Learn how teams like Dropbox, IDEO and Orangetheory trust Webflow to achieve their most ambitious goals today, at webflow.com.\n\n(00:55:28):\nOkay, so there's inflections, there's insights, there's Future-Founder Fit, to make this super real for, say, a product manager sitting at a company right now, I want to start a startup, or someone just starting to ideate on ideas, what are some things that you recommend they start to do this week, next month, to start to find a big idea, or to start an idea? It doesn't have to be a big idea, an idea that'll take them somewhere.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:55:52):\nThe number one thing I like to say is, get out of the present. And so, people talk about getting out of the building, and of course, we should, but getting out of the-\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:56:00):\nAnd of course we should, but getting out of the present is a little bit more subtle than that, right? So William Gibson was right when he said, \"The future is already here. It's just not evenly distributed.\" So most great startup ideas come from a future that exists right now today. And so what I like to say to people, and this is a question that I always ask when I'm pitched, \"Is this from the future?\" And then some people will say to me like, \"Hey, I have a mental health startup. Mental health is a huge problem. It needs to be solved.\" And I'll say, \"Why is your idea from the future?\" \"Well in the future I believe mental health needs to be solved.\" I'm like, \"That's not what I'm asking. I'm asking what part of the future have you been living in that gives you the right to have an opinion about the future?\"\n\n(00:56:52):\nSo I like to say, \"If you're not living in the future, your opinion about it isn't valid.\" It's like saying, \"I think a customer will do X.\" And you've never talked to a customer. I'm like, \"Okay, your opinion's interesting but irrelevant.\" And so the only relevant opinions about the future come from people who are living in it and coming from people who understand what's new about it in a very visceral way. And there are people who do a good job of this, like Maddie Hall who started Living Carbon. She was working at Zenefit and at first she tried to think of a startup and she had ideas that weren't that good. She had a laser tag idea and a few other things. But then she decided to go follow Sam Altman for a year to be his chief of staff.\n\n(00:57:36):\nAnd Sam Altman visits the future multiple times a day with people. And so that's what led her to this idea that for Living Carbon, which does genetically modified trees. I mean, it couldn't be farther away from Zenefit, right? But she saw Microsoft was about to spend a lot of money, a bunch of other companies about to spend a lot of money on carbon takeout. She saw that the genetic engineering technology was getting good enough that you could engineer these trees. She married the inflections with the need and then off she went. But she was basically sampling a lot of different futures until she found one that she liked.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:15):\nI love that example because it makes it very real what living in the future looks like. So one is spend time with people that are very far along on some edge of technology or the way people behave. Another you shared is a work with a company, say that you work with a silicon graphics industrial related magic...\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:58:34):\n[inaudible 00:58:34] magic.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:34):\nYeah.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:58:35):\nYeah. So McCracken had a term for it that I've always liked lighthouse customers. And so the lighthouse has this light that shines out and obscures the fog. And not all customers are equal and some customers are living in the future and those customers are gold. And those customers will, if you solve their needs, take you to the promise land. So yeah, you can build what's missing for yourself like Andreessen did or Zuckerberg or Steve Wozniak or Bill Gates, or you can build something for lighthouse customers you have a good relationship with. Or if you can do neither of those things, the number one question I get asked is, \"Hey, that's great if you live in a supercomputer lab or if you were selling to Industrial Light or Magic or all the Salesforce customer. I'm not one of those. I'm a second year student at Stanford Business School. I'm a product manager at company X, I'm whatever the case may be. That's where the Maddie Hall example is really powerful. Because Maddie proactively got out of the present in a very intentional way. So I love her example as a case study.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:48):\nWhat signs tell you that a company is one of these lighthouse companies living in the future or a person is just like, you just feel it, they're so far ahead of everyone else.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (00:59:55):\nUsually it has to do with how tech forward they are. There was a time when a lot of people didn't think the cloud was going to be a thing because it was insecure. And I'm not going to host my important data and let somebody else have it. But there were a set of customers who really excited about the cloud and they tended to adopt certain kinds of products. When I used to work in client server startups, you knew that the early adopters were people who were using relational database servers and scalable front end programming interfaces and things like that, were trying to have distributed apps that they would roll out. You could tell who was trying to play offense with the new trends.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:38):\nAwesome. Okay, before we move on into actions, is there anything else you think might be useful to share in terms of helping people come up with an idea, find a great idea?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:00:48):\nThe number one thing about the ideas goes back to the not playing the comparison game. So the thing that I see people underestimate when they come up with ideas is the threshold of desperation required in the customer. So we want to solve problems for desperate people and it's like if we have powerful inflections that really empower and we have something unique, there should be somebody who is irresistibly drawn to that empowerment. They should say, \"Oh my God, this is incredible. This is a game changer. I can't unsee that.\" Why is that important? I like to say that if a customer has the ability to do something other than what you do to solve their problem, they won't be crazy enough to do business with a startup. So customer has to be so desperate that when they see what you have, they're like, \"I've got to have it.\"\n\n(01:01:47):\nAnd so I like to say, \"You want to force a choice and not a comparison.\" If everybody's selling apples, I can't be a 10 times better Apple. I want to be the world's first banana. And I want to say to people, \" You may not want bananas, you may not like them, you may not value the advantage of bananas, but if you value banana-ness, I'm the only person that's got it.\" It's like, \"Come to papa.\" And so that's like an insight feels like that. And in the early days, don't spend any of your time with people who love apples because you're not going to convince them and they're going to waste your time. What you want to do is find everybody in the world that values the advantages of bananas as soon as possible, not wasting any time on the people who don't. And so I'd say that that kind of wraps up the idea of insights is it like we want to force a choice and not a comparison. Nobody looks at the Tesla cyber truck and says, oh yeah, well how does that compare to Ford F-150? And you may hate the cyber truck, you may think it's stupid, but nobody's neutral about the cyber truck. You want to have a product that people can't be neutral about, but that the people who magnetize positively to it just can't imagine a world without.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:03):\nI love that. And going back to your banana example, you want just a few people to be just like, \"I need that banana.\" No matter how much you're charging.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:03:10):\nThat's right. And even if it's halfway ripe, because that's the other thing, they need to be willing to tolerate the fact that you can't execute very well because how could a startup execute really well? They have no resources. And so the only chance for a startup to win is to win on a playing field where better doesn't matter where execution isn't as important as, \"Got to have that thing. I'll take any version of it you give me because I am desperate for it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:42):\nSpeaking of execution, good segue to the second part of the chat, which is basically you looked into what do the most successful companies and founders do differently? And you also found three core things that they all do and many of them do. Movements, storytelling, disagreeableness. Let's talk about each one, pick whichever one you want to start with.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:04:04):\nYeah, so we've talked about thinking different, but it's like the problem though is that asking people to abandon the familiar for an uncertain tomorrow is a provocative act. All startups are fundamentally disagreeable. There are disagreement with how things are done, there are disagreement with the pattern of what is. And so we need as founders to persuade others to change their habits with our pattern breaking actions. And so what the pattern breaking founder does is they create a stark dichotomy between the world that is and the world that could be. And they create an irresistible desire on the part of early believers to move to that different future with them. And so I like to say there are three aspects to acting different, right? One is the other storytelling and the other is disagreeableness.\n\n(01:04:59):\nAnd so the movement piece is the front and centerpiece because most people when they think of movements, they think of it as more like social movements like Civil Rights Movement and Martin Luther King, or they think of there's artistic movements like Cubism and Picasso. But fundamentally, a movement is a different way of developing a market than how most marketing people think about developing the market. Most people when they think about marketing, they think, \"Okay, I've got a set of targets, I've got a set of programs. I've got inbound and outbound. I've got these things I need to do.\" What a movement does is it leverages a grievance of a minority against the tyranny of a majority. And it takes that and animates it in a way that those early believers are emotionally committed to moving.\n\n(01:05:50):\nSo early customers are not animated by pragmatism, they're animated by belief. Early customers, early employees, early investors don't decide to go into business with you because of the practical reasons that you unlock. They do it for aesthetic reasons. They do it because they believe what you believe. And so a movement is basically a set of people with the same belief moving together to a different future. And when you think about it's equally the same, right, for the civil rights movement. And a movement is a way to crystallize the choice. If you believe in civil rights, you can't be half in on that. You either believe that it should be about the content of people's character, not their skin color. You can't be sort of not racist. You either believe or you don't believe.\n\n(01:06:46):\nThe people who followed Martin Luther King bought into the aesthetically better future that his movement promised. And it turns out, and I don't mean to equate, that was a pretty important movement, right? It's like some movements are more frivolous. I say an artistic movement. But the notion is similar in that there's a set of early believers who believe they've been enlightened about something that the rest of the world doesn't get yet. And they think that the startup founder is sort of like the prime mover of that movement. And then what happens is that startup markets happen because the movements accumulate and accelerate and more and more people join them. And what was once heresy becomes the accepted conventional wisdom and now the company's no longer a startup, it's a company, and now all of a sudden it is a valid market and all of a sudden they're the status quo and they got to watch out for the next set of disruptor. So the movement is the first key thing I think in all of this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:45):\nIs there an example? Lyft obviously comes to mind with the pink mustaches just as the future.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:07:50):\nRide-sharing was a movement. In my early days starting Floodgate with Anne, we thought that seed investing was a movement. And so we thought that there was going to be a day where seed funds would be a permanent feature of the venture landscape, but people didn't believe that in the late 2000s. And so we're like not enough that we just succeed and invest in good companies. We need to get the best LPs in the world to buy into this. We need to get Phil Horsley and Horsley Bridge and Dave Swenson at Yale and people who are respected in the ecosystem to say, \"Yeah, I buy into that.\" And so it was really important to us to get the right early believers in our movement. Judith Elsea at Weathergage, who had just started a new firm.\n\n(01:08:40):\nOne of my favorite examples is actually an old one, Clarence Bird's eye. So you go into the supermarket and there's frozen food aisle. Well, Clarence Bird's eye discovered how to flash freeze food when he was up in the Arctic looking at Eskimos, and they were flash freezing their fish and he wondered, could you do it for other things? And he found out you could fruit and vegetables, but it wasn't enough to just flash freeze the fish or the fruits or the vegetables. You had to convince the trains to have a refrigerated car. You had to convince the supermarket to have a refrigerated aisle. And so he had to start a movement where a whole lot of people simultaneously believed in this idea of being able to eat food in a more convenient way, not always in season, not always grown locally from where you were. And so all movements have that characteristic where you kind of start with a higher purpose and then you move people to that different future.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):\nI'm trying to think about what are current movements that are happening. One that might be a movement is with LLMs just this bet that transformers are the future of how this is going to work, that just more compute is the answer versus trying to find something else. Does that sound right?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:09:50):\nAnother one that I really like is Tesla. So Tesla's mission says, \"Accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy.\" They don't even say they're a car company. So Tesla doesn't say, \"Here's why we're better than Ford and Toyota.\" And this is really important, right? Because the great movements do appeal to a higher purpose. They don't say, \"I'm better than company X. I'm Avis, I try harder than her.\" They appeal to a more aesthetically higher purpose future. And then they show that this startup is the vehicle for that movement to be actualized, which is kind of a good segue to storytelling.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:32):\nOne other quick example I'm thinking about linear is kind of pushing this movement of craft and design and experience matters in B2B software. And you shouldn't settle for something that you don't love.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:10:42):\nVery much so. And you know what, Chesky, I don't think he even knew he was fully doing this at the time, but Chesky did this brilliantly with Airbnb. So he created a movement around living like a local. And so the other thing that a movement does is it turns the greatest strength of the status quo into its biggest weakness. And so Brian never said, \"Hotels suck. Death to the Four Season.\" He just said, \"Hey, look, when you go to Paris, you have a choice. You can hang out in the Four Seasons and it's going to be just like the Four Seasons everywhere else in the world. It'll be in the middle of the town, or you can live in Paris like a Parisian.\" And he's like, \"I don't have to say that the Four Seasons is bad for you to decide to choose me. And oh, by the way, if you want to stay in the same kind of hotel everywhere you go, I'm not for you.\"\n\n(01:11:31):\nBut so now let's say you're four seasons, your whole business is predicated on doing a good job of having a common experience that people could accept and that they're used to and that they expect. And so now you've taken all of the stuff that you invested decades in and turned it into something you have to apologize for all of a sudden. And so the great startups, they create movements not so much by criticizing the incumbent, but by showing the weakness in the strength of the incumbent. And then just saying to the customer, \"Hey, look, you decide it's not up to me to decide what's bad about Four Seasons. It's up to you to decide whether you value my difference or not.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:11):\nIt reminds me of counter positioning from Hamilton Helmer's Seven Powers book.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:12:15):\nA hundred percent.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:18):\nSo to make it even more practical for people that are like, \"Oh, I need to come up with a movement for my startup. That's why things aren't working.\" It sounds like it's kind of here's how we want the future to look and why we're doing this. And then it's a combination of marketing, positioning, messaging, repeating it, social media, imagine is that roughly how to think about?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:12:37):\nBut I would also say that it's about storytelling. And so storytelling, there is a science to storytelling. And so for example, the hero's journey, you have somebody in the world that is the hero, let's say Luke Skywalker on Tatooine, dusty planet, he's bored out of his mind. And then a mentor shows up and offers them a call to adventure, Obi-Wan Kenobi. And at first they resist the call, but then something bad happens in this case, Luke's like, \"Hey, I can't come with you. I got chores to do for Aunt Beru and Uncle Owen.\" But then he comes back to his place and it's all burned down the storm troopers killed his aunt and uncle. So then he accepts the call. The mentor has a tool and a magic. In this case, it was the lightsaber was the tool and the magic was the force.\n\n(01:13:32):\nAnd they need those things because the hero has to have a reason to credibly believe that they can beat the bad guy. And so then what happens is you find co-conspirators along the way, Han Solo, Chewy, ultimately the princess. You rescue her, you blow up the death star, you beat the empire, and then emerge, transform. They even get medals at the end of the movie, right? Now, it turns out that the exact same thing applies for startups. So if we take the Lyft example, let's just say I'm a rider. In the past, the world that is taxi suck in [inaudible 01:14:10]. I can't even get one. And when I get one, it's gross and it smells bad and it's late, and they won't take my credit cards. I have to have cash. They can't rely on them to get me there. I guess my alternatives to park, you can't ever get parking people break into your car. That's the world that is.\n\n(01:14:28):\nLogan and John would engage in a call to adventure, \"Try this ride-sharing app. It shows cars on map, you know where they're all the time, they come within five minutes, fist bumped the driver.\" Now, this was where the genius of the pink mustache came in. So the pink mustache honored the fact that a lot of times people resist the call. It's scary to get into stranger's car. So the pink mustache made it seem a little bit less scary. When you see these cars driving around in San Francisco, you're like, \"Hmm, what's up with that pink mustache?\" And you're talking to your friend and they say, \"Oh, it's this new thing called Lyft. It's pretty cool. It's an app if you've seen it.\" And so Logan and John did, among the best I've ever seen at honoring the fact that people might resist the call.\n\n(01:15:13):\nBut then part of the story is languaging. This was the genius of Twitter. They didn't call it Microblogs, Inc., right? They created a metaphor around tweeting birds. The Tesla was this way, right? It wouldn't have survived a comparison with a Porsche of 9/11. The seats weren't as good, the radio wasn't as good, but Elon was telling a story about a different future. And when you bought the Tesla Roadster, you weren't buying it for practical reasons. You were buying it for aesthetic reasons. You were buying it because you thought that that future was something you wanted to be part of. So the storytelling primitive ends up working spectacularly well for startups, right? We need to describe the world that is, we need to describe the world that could be, which is that different future. We need to understand, and this is important that your job as the founder is to be Obi-Wan, not Luke.\n\n(01:16:04):\nSo the founders sometimes make the mistake of thinking that they're the hero, but they're not. The early believers are the heroes, and it's the job of the founder to tell a story that emotes early believers to want to move with them and co-create the future with them. And the story you tell an employee is different from the story you tell an investor is different from the story you tell a customer because all of them have a different idea of what their hero's journey. If you're an investor, maybe your idea of being a hero is to make a hundred times your money and be on some fancy list and make money for your LPs. If you're an early customer, maybe you're a hero by solving an important business problem and getting recognized for it in your company. If you're an early employee, maybe it's you want to work on something you're excited about with really awesome people that don't waste your time with politics and bureaucracy, all of those are different journeys. All of those are different transformational ways to self-actualize. And we have to meet those people where they are and give them a reason to want to come with us to the world to be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:10):\nI had Nancy Duarte on the podcast. She is one of the most famous presentation designers, and she had exactly the same advice. When you're trying to tell a story, you basically bounce back between the world that is, the world that could be. What is, what could be. What is, what could be, and just keep going back and forth.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:17:25):\nA hundred percent. In fact, Nancy is the person who helped me understand this better than any single person. So Nancy would show me how Steve Jobs's iPhone launch speech. She'd be like, \"Okay, well now notice what he does. He shows how bad phone suck now. They have styluses, they have keyboards.\" And then he talks about what could be, you could combine an internet communicator, you could combine an iPod, and he goes back and forth between how bad the current state of things is, how it should be, how bad it is, how it should be. Introducing the iPhone, how bad it was, how awesome it's going to be, how awesome it is. When you look at his speech, he's masterful at toggling. And by the way, the same is true. Abe Lincoln with the Gettysburg Address, \"Four score and seven years ago, new nation, now we're in a civil war. We need to preserve what we stand for as a country. We need to go win this war.\" But he kind of goes back and forth drawing a tension between what has happened in the world that was, and the world that could be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:33):\nSomething that I was thinking as you were talking was, I've seen too many founders spend so much time crafting this amazing story and vision of their product, and they have this really cool blog post and big idea, but nobody really cares about their product yet. Do you have any advice of just make sure you're building something people want above all else. And the story is a layer on top of that.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:18:55):\nSo many startups I see the first slide is like, \"We're Acme AI software. We're located in San Francisco, we're funded by X and Y VCs.\" That's not storytelling because you're talking about yourself, right? And if you're trying to make the person in the audience the hero, they don't care about you yet. They care about how you're going to make them a hero. And so when you kind of say, 'Okay, if I'm pitching VCs, what I really need to do is help them understand why they'll be a hero if they invest in my company according to what makes them feel heroic.\" What you present is different, but what a lot of startup presentations do is they take their sales pitch and they rehost it for every other audience. They rehost it for the press, for investors and for employees and all that. And that's wrong because what you're doing is you're talking about yourself to different people, but what you want to do is describe the world that could be, the stakes that are involved, and then each of those individual audiences, you want to meet them where they live in the world that is, and show them how they can engage in a transformational journey to the world it could be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:12):\nAnd also share your amazing stats and backgrounds and market size and all that stuff.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:20:19):\nYeah. Although it's funny, I've found that investors are the same. Investors, ultimately they believe or they don't believe. A lot of times, this is the other thing I see happen, is the poor founder will get advice from 20 different people about their pitch deck. And a lot of the people giving them advice are not believers in that different future. They're giving generic startup advice or they'll go pitch a bunch of firms and they didn't consider who's prepared to possibly believe, who isn't. And so then they get objections to their pitch from people who aren't going to believe anyway, and then they try to have a slide to meet that objection. And before you know it, you have what I call a Franken deck. And so you have this huge, gigantic presentation trying to anticipate every objection, and the person who was ready to believe you in the first place doesn't know what you were trying to say because you obscured it with all this other stuff. And so I find that just like with an insight, it's okay if most investors don't like your idea, what you want to find is the ones who are prepared to move with you and make sure they absolutely know why they should. To me, that's the ideal pitch deck.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:28):\nI love this advice. And just to be clear, this is like seed and pre-seed before there's a lot of traction, a lot of data and like that.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:21:35):\nExactly, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:36):\nSo what's your advice to a founder that's trying to iterate on their deck is it's just like, \"Don't show it to too many people.\" Is it, \"Stick to your guns.\"\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:21:43):\nOkay, here would be my succinct advice. And other than that, there's about a million details. Slide one, you say what you do as if I literally know nothing. So it's not, \"We're Airbnb, we're a marketplace for unused residential housing space.\" Bad. But you'll get advice that says to do that because VCs think marketplaces are hot, residential real estate's big. What you should instead say is something like, \"We're Airbnb, we let you rent an extra room in your house.\" Because now as the VC, I'm like, ah, I know what you do. And there are a lot of pitches, I'm 10, 15 minutes in and I'm trying to understand what they do, but I don't know. So you just say, \"Here's what we do.\"\n\n(01:22:26):\nAnd then the second thing that I say to people is, I think your second slide ought to be, here's the thing we know that's not obvious. So when I was raising fund one for Floodgate, I would go to an LP and say, \"We believe that there's a gap between Angels and VCs. VCs are writing $5 million checks. Angels $250,000 checks. We believe that 500,000 is the new 5 million because of Lean Startups. We believe that there will be a new type of category funds called seed funds. Now, if you don't believe that, nothing else I'm about to say is going to make any sense to you, I can just give you your time back.\" [inaudible 01:23:06]. But then once, if they did believe that or they were in a position to lean forward, now when they start mentioning my competitors, I say, \"Okay, well, recall Peter Fenton works at Benchmark, he's not going to compete with me because why would Peter Fenton leave Benchmark to start Seed Fund doesn't make sense. The only people who are going to try to compete with me from the big funds are the people who aren't performing.\"\n\n(01:23:26):\nBut if you set the context of what your insight is, you can always come back to it. When they bring up competitors, you can always come back to it when they bring up objections and you can say, \"Hey, remember I'm just telling you we need to agree on this insight for this to have a chance of being great.\" So what do we do? What's our insight? And then slide three is what, if any, proof points do we have? We have any customers? Do we have great founders? Is there something happened already that should cause you to believe that my insight is vowed?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):\nI love this. I love this tangent we went on...\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:24:00):\n... site is out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:02):\nLove this. I love this tangent we went on. Let me come back to the actions that you found the most successful startups end up taking. We've talked about movements, we've talked about storytelling. The third is my favorite, I'm excited to hear you talk about it, which is disagreeableness. What is that about?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:24:19):\nEarlier, I'd mentioned that you want to escape the comparison trap when you have your insight and when you have your idea, in creating movements and telling stories, you want to break free from the conformity trap. We always are under pressure to conform in this world, and people use the pressure of conformity to prevent us from exploring things outside of our limits. There's a book that I love called Jonathan Livingston Seagull, where there's a seagull who wants to fly at infinite speed, and all the other seagulls are like, \"Look, we're just destined to eat crap off the surface of the ocean. That's just what we are. We're seagulls.\" He ends up getting banished from the flock because everybody thinks he's crazy. To me, the great founders are kind of like Jonathan Livingston Seagull. They're willing to pursue something that they're obsessed with, that they think has to happen in this world, and they're willing to sacrifice their status in the socioeconomic sometimes dominance hierarchy because fulfilling the mission is ultimately more important to them than fitting in.\n\n(01:25:31):\nYou can't stand out if you always fit in. The only people who are different can really make a difference. That's kind of the mindset. I like to say a startup is a fundamentally disagreeable act in the first place, and there's going to be times you need to be disagreeable. I've seen this time and again. I hear people say to me, \"I want to work with a founder who's coachable.\" I'm like, \"I'm not really sure.\" Sometimes I used to joke that when I would meet with Ev Williams, my whole job was to give him advice that he ignored. I would say to him, \"Hey, Ev. I don't think you should raise that much money, because I think you'll spend whatever you raise in 18 months, no matter how much you raise.\" He said, \"Man, so you mean that startups almost always spend their money in 18 months regardless of the amount?\" I said, \"Yeah. I call it Mike's Law. It almost always happens, because once you have the money, all the pressure is on you to spend it.\"\n\n(01:26:26):\nHe is like, \"Man, that is a really good advice. I'd never thought of it that way before. That sounds right to me.\" Well, he proceeds to go raise a shitload of money, but he did stuff that I didn't think he should do, but it worked. I liked that in him. A lot of people would say, \"Well, doesn't it bother you that he didn't listen to you that much?\" No, because he was disagreeable, and he was the right kind of disagreeable. He didn't say, \"Pound the sand. I'm not listening to you. La-la-la, I'm covering my ears.\" He listened and he understood what I thought the truth was. He just believed a different truth than I did, and that's fine. My job as the investor is to just help them see what my perception of the truth is, honestly. If they decide to go in a different direction, that's great. They're the founder, they're the genius.\n\n(01:27:22):\nAll of them, not all of them, but a whole lot of them are more disagreeable than history lets on. My dad worked for Bill Gates when he was at Microsoft. Bill Gates is not a warm and fuzzy dude. He was tough. He was a hard ass. But great people are inspired by hard asses, as long as the hard ass makes ... You meld the steel in the heat of the flame of high standards. Sometimes people can't work for Elon Musk for very long, but almost everybody I know who's worked for him really respects him, because he has high standards, and he's not trying to win friends and influence people. He's trying to land on Mars, and if you're going to land on Mars, you got to be disagreeable some of the time. I just find that that is a trait that is under-appreciated in these great founders quite often.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:19):\nWhat you just shared reminds me of a recent podcast episode of Jeffrey Pfeffer, which I know you listened to, where he talks about the rules of power, how people acquire power, and the last rule is, \"Understand that once you have acquired power, what you did to get it will be forgiven, forgotten, or both.\" Your Bill Gates example, I think, is a good one where people look at him as such a nice dude when, as you said, he was not so nice a lot of the time.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:28:43):\nHere's the other thing, and by the way, I listened to that episode from beginning to the end, and I thought it was fantastic, because the next thing I want to do is go to Professor Pfeffer and say, \"Can we cast these seven principles through a pattern breaking lens?\" Let's assume you're a startup capitalist, you're not at a company, because changing the future requires you to acquire a different form of power than you would, say, in an organization. But as I was listening to it, I was like, \"These principles all apply to pattern breakers, all of them, every single one.\" The other one is that I think that he said, \"Not everybody's going to like you. If you want to be liked, get a dog. But if you want power, there's certain things you're going to have to do and reconcile yourself with.\"\n\n(01:29:36):\nAcquisition of power has this notion of you've got to wield the carrot and the stick. If all you do is wield the carrot, you won't create enough activation energy for people to move to that different future. Sometimes you do have to use the stick, and sometimes you have to realize that people are going to use your desire to fit in against you. They're going to say, \"Oh, you can't do that. That's illegal,\" or, \"You can't do that, that's unethical,\" or, \"You can't do that. You're being some tech bro, bad guy.\" A lot of what I find with the founders I work with, ironically, before they win, they have to have the courage to be disliked because people don't like their idea. They think it's stupid, lonely.\n\n(01:30:20):\nBut then after they win, it's even worse, because everybody says you cheated or you're a bad guy or you broke the rules or you're too powerful, or, \"Who gave you the right to decide what the future should be?\" They get criticized unfairly in the other direction after they succeed, but in the end, it comes with the territory. It's part of the job description, unfortunately.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:43):\nYeah. Elon goes through a lot of that. Something I saw you tweet recently along these same lines is that most successful companies, there's tons of chaos internally, and everyone working at these companies is like, \"This place a mess. How is this even working?\" But your finding is that that's very common and normal.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:31:00):\nEspecially in startups. There have been times when I've said things like, \"Execution doesn't matter,\" and people can misinterpret that. When I mean execution doesn't matter, I don't mean people shouldn't get things done or people shouldn't say, \"What did you do this week?\" But when I think of execution in a corporate sense, corporations in theory should always win. They have big management team, they have more experienced people, they have customers, suppliers, partners, brand, so a startup never beats a big company by executing better than the big company. Startup wins over the big company because it proposes a radically different future, disorients the incumbent, and sort of chaotically moves people to that different future.\n\n(01:31:46):\nBut like every startup I've ever seen, on the inside was wild. It was like a capitalist mutation. It was trying to find a beaked finch in the Galapagos Islands that's never been discovered before, and it's all ambiguous all the time, and people are arguing about what the right direction is all the time. It's just messy, but movements are messy. That's what comes with the territory. A friend of mine, Robin Roberts, once said, \"Make your mess your message.\" It's so true.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:24):\nOh, man. That's so funny. I love it. I have a couple more questions before we wrap up. Before we leave the actions categories, is there anything else you think is important to share, any other lessons that we haven't touched on?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:32:37):\nI think, Lenny, I don't know if you've consciously tried to do this or not, but on some level you've created a movement. No one has ever engaged people with product management sensibilities the way you have. I go to your site, and you even have merch for product managers. I'm like, \"What?\" I imagine the early posts that you wrote, it probably felt kind of lonely. It's probably, \"I wonder if anybody's even reading this stuff,\" but it starts to accumulate. More people start to read it, more people start to tell their friends about it, and now all of a sudden, it kind of becomes a thing. In many ways, Lenny's podcast and Lenny's blog and Lenny's newsletter are all examples of facets of this movement that you're creating.\n\n(01:33:26):\nBut your movement is not just about the stories you tell or the guests you have or the podcasts or the write-ups you have. You have a point of view about the centrality of a product manager in companies and in businesses and in the future, and honoring that the way Nike honors athletes. The point of view is the movement, just like the point of view is the company when it's a startup. This point of view is the story. It's the place that people want to go that got animated by the beliefs that you share.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:06):\nFascinating and flattered. I have no intention of starting a movement. I could see what you're saying. That sounds like a lot of stress, but I guess-\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:34:14):\nI think you already have, whether you met to or not, I think you have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:17):\nAll right. Well, I do have swag, and if you're on YouTube, this is our best-selling item, a hat that just says \"Product Manager.\" People love it. I have it in the background. [inaudible 01:34:26]\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:34:25):\nCan I wear one if I'm still not one?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:28):\nAbsolutely. You've been one, and so forever product manager. I'll send you a hat.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:34:33):\nHopefully, I can get grandfathered in for my past.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:35):\nForever. Forever PM Mike. Okay. I just have one more question, and this is around your last chapter, which I think is going to be useful to a lot of people. Your last chapter is about how to apply a lot of these principles to working at a company. Say you're not a founder, a lot of these principles still apply. What advice can you share for people, say, a PM, instead of large company to help them find pattern-breaking ideas, big ideas within the company?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:34:58):\nThe first thing I think is important to understand is that everything about a value delivery system when you're doing a pattern-breaking idea is different from a normal idea. The mistake that most companies make is they say, \"I've got this new pattern-breaking idea. It needs to be a third of my business in 24 months or three years or whatever.\" Bad strategy. Let's take a company like, say, Apple, when they did the iPhone. The iPhone was a whole new thing. It was driven by, in this case, Steve Jobs the founder. You couldn't reconcile it with the original business of the Mac and not really even the iPod. You had to treat it as a totally different thing, and that's really hard for companies. Companies make the mistake of engaging in a pattern-breaking product, but they make it too visible or it's a career-limiting move if it fails. Pattern-breaking products have different types of leadership, different types of go-to-market motion as we've described, different types of ideas, different risk profiles. Instead of saying this company or this business is too big to fail, I need to make small bets that can fail a lot. The same is true with mergers and acquisitions. If I buy a company, I need to ask, am I buying a pattern-breaking company to break the pattern of my business and go in a radically new direction, or am I buying a company that's an extension of my current business? Neither is wrong per se, but the way you think about risk varies enormously.\n\n(01:36:43):\nSome examples that I have in the book of good examples are the iPhone, Steve Jobs, AWS, but some people objected. They said, \"Okay, that's easy for the founders to do because they're founders of the company, and that's Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos.\" The other example I like is Skunkworks with Lockheed. When they created a fighter plane in a very short amount of time, and that's how they did it, they had an organization totally separate from the main organization, somebody with absolute power, and tried to make it not visible, tried to make it be separate. Because when you make it visible, you start to drift it back into the tractor beam of acting like a pattern-matching corporation. Another good example back in the day was Don Estridge at IBM when they did the IBM PC, but it's almost always an autonomous business headed by a maverick, and you're trying to do something discreetly different rather than a better version of what you've already.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:45):\nThis aligns very well with, we had two recent podcast episodes talking to PMs at companies that are doing zero-to-one stuff, Mihika and Tanguy. Tanguy had a really interesting tidbit along the lines you just talked about where he set up his team in a totally different time zone so that people that wanted to bug them just were sleeping during that time, and they weren't even online so that they could just focus on the work they were doing, and it worked out.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:38:09):\nI'm mostly through that episode, and everything that I've listened to so far, I'm like, \"Okay, that totally jives with what I've seen.\" The other person has an interesting take on this is Vinod Kochblok. Vinod basically thinks that what companies should do is take some portion of their profits, let's say 10% of your profits, and invest it in projects likely to fail, but with wildly asymmetric upside if they succeed, and then make them not visible to the mothership in the early inning. It's your willingness to fail that lets you have breakthrough success.\n\n(01:38:49):\nAny coin that says can't lose bad on one side of it might as well say, can't win big on the other side. It's your willingness to fail, and it comes back to departing from the consensus, right? It's your willingness to fail that enables success, and every time you depart from the consensus, there's a chance you'll be wrong, you'll underperform the consensus, but it's your willingness to do that that lets you outperform it. But there's no shortcuts, right? The coin that says can't lose, says can't win on the other side, and lose big says, win big on the other side.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:39:26):\nMike, this episode is so full of nuggets, tactical advice, amazing stories, everything I was hoping it would be. Before we get to our very exciting lightening round, is there anything else that you think might be useful to share with folks that are trying to start a company or are already along with a company?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:39:45):\nYeah. The one thing I would say is that it's a lonely existence, and it's okay if most people don't like your idea. It doesn't mean you're right, but it sure as heck doesn't mean you're wrong either. There's not enough people in this world willing to stick their neck out for things that they believe that they see before the rest of us. Just for what it's worth, if anybody in your audience is one of those people, you have just my utmost respect and affection. I hope that in those times when it's tempting to not believe, it comes with the territory every great founder has faced, and it doesn't make you wrong.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:34):\nAmazing. What an empowering, inspiring way to end it. Mike, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:40:34):\nOkay, here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:40:44):\nHere we go. First question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:40:50):\nA book called The Five Regrets of the Dying, Top Five Regrets of the Dying by Bronnie Ware. She was a hospice nurse, and she would talk to people in the last 90 days of their lives, and she would find out the things that they'd wish that they had done in their lives that they hadn't. I always thought that that was a good book, because it reminds you about what's important, and it reminds you that it isn't going to last forever. Someday, it'll be the last day.\n\n(01:41:20):\nThere's another book that I really like called Chase, Chance, and Creativity by a guy named James Austin, and I think that it's a good book because it talks about how certain people tend to attract luck more than others and actually that luck is created, you do make luck. I am just fascinated by this idea of luck and how it can be harnessed. I'd say those two. There's a whole bunch of them. I've always liked all of Clay Christensen's books. The other one that I kind of liked that I read recently is by Robert Greene, The Laws of Human Nature. I liked that one a lot as well. Then Nancy Duarte's book, Resonate, we talked about Nancy earlier, I like that book a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:13):\nI'm buying that first one immediately. That sounds incredible. I need that book. Regrets of the Dying. I found it on Amazon as you were talking, and I'm buying it. Good pick there. Okay, next question. Is there a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:42:26):\nI really liked the movie about Enzo Ferrari, and I have this huge affinity for 1960s cars, and the way that they replicated these 1960s Ferraris I just thought was magical. I thought that the guys that did the special effects and just the attention to detail I thought was just extraordinary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:50):\nI have not seen it. Quick aside, as I was buying this book, your book was recommended on Amazon for me, so good job.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:42:50):\nOh, good. Okay. Here we go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:42:58):\nGood job, Amazon. I will point people to where to find it at the end of this series of questions, but next question, is there a favorite product that you have recently discovered that you really like?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:43:08):\nWhen I was young, before I got into computers, I had a job as a professional calligrapher, and so I really like using calligraphy pens. Not long ago I sort of discovered the world, it had been a long time since I'd reconnected with that hobby, I discovered the world of vintage fountain pens. My favorite product of recent times, everybody will be like that sounds esoteric, but it's a Mont Blanc 149 first generation celluloid pen. It was right after World War II, and it was the Germans coming back saying, \"We've still got it.\" It was just a product for the ages. It has a flexible nib. Fountain pens don't work the way they used to. They used make flexible nibs so that you could write the way scribes wrote in the 1800s and stuff. But then people in the modern world break those nibs, and they use ballpoint pens anyway. But when I use these old flexible pens from 1900 to the 1940s, they're just magical. There's just nothing like it. Nobody's ever been able to equal that experience in modern times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:25):\nWow. I got to try one of these pens.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:44:28):\nYeah. I'll give you one of them so you can at least get a feel for it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:44:33):\nWow. I'll give you a product management hat, I'll get a pen, a beautiful pen. I think I win in this exchange. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with folks that you find useful to come back to?\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:44:47):\nI learned it from my dad. It sounds simple, but it's kind of profound, \"Do your best.\" What he meant by that is he didn't mean be the best, he meant that life is a gift. You don't know how much time you're going to have. Every day is the gift of your time, and the best way to honor the gift of your time is to do your best. There'll be times you won't be the best, but if all you did was the best, that's all you could do. I remember one time, so I was a senior in high school, I'd already gotten into Stanford, I'm totally psyched, I'm going to go. Last week of the semester of senior year, and I have a test the next day in English.\n\n(01:45:29):\nMy dad's like, \"Hey, how are you feeling about the test?\" I said, \"It doesn't really matter. I get to drop it, and I'm going to get an A in the class, because I've got the goods, so I don't need to do well on it.\" He looked so disappointed at me, and he was like, \"It doesn't sound like you're doing your best.\" What he was kind of getting at was that the people who achieve greatness, they think everything counts. I always got a lot from that with him. There'd be other times where I wouldn't do so well on something, and he would say, \"Well, sometimes you make a careless mistake, but you did your best. That's all you could have done.\"\n\n(01:46:15):\nThe idea of doing your best I find to be very profound, and it causes you to realize that the best way to show up in the world is to be your best self. There's only one you in this world, and the more that you can show up as your best self, you'll be impossible to compete with, you won't feel the need to copy other folks, you won't feel the need to compare yourself to other people. You'll compare yourself instead to the idea of perfection itself and whatever that means in terms of your own ability to do your best. To me, that's probably the most important life lesson I've learned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:46:52):\nWow. As you said, very simple but very powerful.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:46:56):\nIt's powerful when you truly internalize it, right? When you take it beyond an aphorism, it's very powerful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:03):\nIt reminds me of your partner, Anne Marie Coe's advice that she got from her dad, which is I think maybe the opposite that she shared on Tim Ferris' podcast of just always do a world-class job at everything you do. You're doing a world-class job.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:47:18):\nYep.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:19):\nAmazing. Okay, I'm going to skip the last question just to end on that, because that was way too beautiful to Sully with another question. Just to give folks a chance to figure out where to buy your book, when it's available, how to find it, what they should know, do share.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:47:36):\nI guess there's two main ways, right? Well, we've got a Substack. Not everybody's got to buy books, right, so there's patternbreakers.substack.com. Then I have a site, patternbreakers.com, but you can also get the book on Amazon or anywhere. It's already available for pre-order, I think.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:47:54):\nAmazing. I usually ask people how listeners can be useful to you. I imagine it's check out the book, share what you've learned.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:47:59):\nMy main goal is for the ideas to spread and to help people. Hopefully, it will have achieved that goal. But just anything that people can do to help spread the ideas. Co-conspirators wanted.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:15):\nI love these episodes where somebody like you spends hundreds of thousands of hours analyzing data and history and startups and talking to founders and just synthesizing all the things you've learned into a couple of hours. I love this. Thank you, Mike, so much for being here and for sharing all this wisdom with us.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:48:32):\nHey. Well, thanks, Lenny. It was an honor to be on your show, and it's been fun to see you do so well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:37):\nThanks, Mike. It's an honor to have you on the show. Again, the book is called Pattern Breakers: Why Some Start-Ups Change the Future. Mike, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMike Maples, Jr. (01:48:45):\nOkay. See you, Lenny. Thanks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:48:47):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:48:50):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# “I like being scared”: Molly Graham’s frameworks for rapid career growth | Molly Graham\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nYou've worked with many very high performing founder CEOs. Zuck, Cheryl Sandberg. Larry and Sergei at Google. Brett Taylor.\n\nMolly Graham (00:00:07):\nGoogle, when I was there, felt like two PhD students paradise. Facebook felt like 19-year-old hacker's dorm room. 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Our job as operators or as leaders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:25):\nWhen a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos.\n\nMolly Graham (00:00:28):\nYou have to grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage, both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:39):\nSarah Caldwell. She told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-curve versus stairs.\n\nMolly Graham (00:00:46):\nSo Chamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, the way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years. But that is boring. The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs and you do fall, but then you climb out way beyond where the stairs could ever get you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:08):\nToday, my guest is Molly Graham. Molly was an early employee at Google, also at Facebook, where she worked closely with Zuck on building the Chan Zuckerberg initiative. She also worked with Brett Taylor on scaling Quip, which he sold to Salesforce. She's also worked with hundreds of companies and founders helping them grow into the leaders that they want to become. Today, she leads Glue Club, which is a community for leaders operating in changing, growing environments who want to develop themselves as quickly as their companies. Molly is maybe most known for her advice to give away your Legos, which we chat about. Along with basically all of her favorite frameworks and mindsets and pieces of advice that she's developed and collected over time. For leaders who are going through rapid scale and growth and are just struggling to keep up. I think of this episode as a high growth handbook for leaders who are experiencing rapid scale.\n\n(00:01:58):\nWe cover the J curves versus stairs approach to career growth, the waterline model, and why you want to snorkel before you scuba. Her six rules for creating goals and building alignment, her rules of thumb for dealing with rapid scale and lots of change. The biggest lessons she's learned from Zuck and Sergei and Larry and Cheryl and Brett Taylor and so much more. Molly is incredible and you will be a better leader after listening to this episode. A huge thank you to Eric Antonow, Ashley Murphy and Sarah Caldwell for suggesting topics and questions for this conversation.

With that, I bring you Molly Graham after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:03:01):\nToday's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly. But many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like, which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift. With DX, companies like Dropbox, booking.com, Addien, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers. And what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:44):\nIf you're a founder, the hardest part of starting a company isn't having the idea. It's scaling the business without getting buried in back office work. That's where Brex comes in. Brex is the intelligent finance platform for founders. With Brex, you get high limit corporate cards, easy banking, high yield treasury, plus a team of AI agents that handle manual finance tasks for you. They'll do all the stuff that you don't want to do, like file your expenses, scour transactions for waste, and run reports all according to your rules. With Brex's AI agents, you can move faster while staying in full control. One in three startups in the United States already runs on Brex. You can too at brex.com. Molly, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nMolly Graham (00:04:36):\nThanks, Lenny. I'm excited to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:38):\nI feel like this conversation was in an inevitability. I feel like you're the kind of guest where it's like, we will do this someday. I'm such a fan of your stuff. I've read all the stuff you've put out there over the years. We're going to be talking about the best frameworks and mindsets that you've developed over the years that have been really helpful to you, to founders, to companies that you've worked with to help them with growth and scale and change and all the stuff that comes with success. The way I think about this, I want to make this the greatest hits of Molly Graham.\n\nMolly Graham (00:05:06):\nLove it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:08):\nAnd so I sourced what I think are the greatest hits from a lot of colleagues that you've worked with, a lot of people you've worked with. We've chatted about the stuff that you find other people find most helpful. So we're going to be going through all that stuff. But let's help people understand why they should listen to this advice. What's kind of the backstory on these frameworks? Where did they come from? Where did you develop them? Tell us that story.\n\nMolly Graham (00:05:29):\nSo first of all, Ami Vora, who you have had on your podcast, once said to me that all advice is just someone telling you what they did. And I always think about that. Because I really think that basically what I tell people is I've made every single mistake in the book. And then I got to the end of the book and I started inventing new mistakes. So mostly what I feel is that I like sharing my stories because I want to help people. I want to help people not make the same mistakes I did. And I also want to help people make sense of what they're experiencing. But I started in tech in 2007. I actually started at Google the week the iPhone launched and a lot of my scaling battle scars come from a couple of experiences. They come from a year and a half at Google, which is not very long.\n\n(00:06:17):\nAnd Google was pretty big when I was there. It has thousands of employees. But my department, which was the communications department, was 25 people when I joined and it grew in nine months to 125 people. And that was really my first experience with just all the sort of things that I still talk about today. In terms of what it feels like to grow really, really fast and sort of all the tools that I started developing from there. After Google, I left and followed Cheryl Sandberg and Elliot Schrage to Facebook. And I spent five years at Facebook. And I joined Facebook in 2008, and it's important context because it was 80 million users at the time. We were smaller than MySpace. It was 270 million in revenue, 500 employees. It did not feel inevitable. Most people thought we were going to sell it to Microsoft. When I told people I was going there, they were like, isn't that place just like a site for college kids? And so I was there for five years and it was a crazy five years.\n\n(00:07:22):\nWhen I left, it was 5,500 employees, five billion in revenue, over a billion users. So a huge amount of what I experienced, what I write about, what I talk about in Glue Club, which is the community that I run, comes from that rapid scale at Google and Facebook. But I also, I left Facebook right after we went public, about six months after we went public. And I only like doing jobs that I'm highly unqualified for. I like being on learning curves so steep that I'm scared I'm going to fall off. And so I left and I wanted to learn what it took to build something from nothing. And so I joined this little startup founded by Brett Taylor, a startup called Quip. I joined a couple of months before we launched and ran everything that wasn't product and engineering there for him. And that was such a valuable experience to me because the experience of building something from nothing is actually quite different than the experience of holding on for dear life while things are scaling so fast around you.\n\n(00:08:27):\nAnd it really taught me about all the tools and skills you need to go from zero to one and then from one to two and how lonely it can be to build something. And we eventually sold that company to Salesforce. And then again, only take jobs I'm highly unqualified for. But the last really chaotic scaling experience I had was actually helping Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan start their philanthropy, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. And I basically helped them for the first two years of its existence or its sort of like first full existence. And philanthropy sounds calm. You know what I mean? We're like, oh, giving money away. Must be so peaceful over there. And CZI grew from, I think the week I joined, it was 30 people and we bought two companies that week and it grew to 250 people that year. And it was like using every single tool in my toolkit that I had taken from every other job that I'd had.\n\n(00:09:22):\nSo my advice and frameworks, like I said, come from having made a lot of mistakes. But I've also sort of made a personal study over the last 18 years, believe it or not. Essentially what does it take to thrive inside growing and changing companies, not just to hang on for dear life. What does it take to lead in the face of constant change? And really the other piece that I find truly fascinating is what genuinely makes the difference between a business that grows but then plateaus versus these generational businesses. The ones that go on forever. Sort of the difference between a Twitter or MySpace and a Facebook. Billions in revenue versus hundreds of billions in revenue. So what I like to do is take my experience and use it to help other leaders. I want to give people tools that work. And I also want to be honest about how hard all of this stuff really is.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:24):\nAmazing. I say this a lot in this podcast. I just love the ROI that listeners of the podcast get. You spent 20 years toiling, struggling, working so hard, learning so much. And you're just here, here's all the answers that I've learned. And obviously not all the answers, but so many things that will help people avoid the pain and suffering that you've gone through.\n\nMolly Graham (00:10:43):\nThat's the goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:45):\nAlso, a couple quick threads I want to follow here. One is Ami Vora, who you mentioned. She's now, I think, head of product at Anthropic.\n\nMolly Graham (00:10:50):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:10:50):\nAmazing. Former podcast guest, also speaker at Lenny and Friends Summit two years ago. This other point you just made about how you've always gone to places that have been way beyond your... I forget how you phrased it, but just beyond your current capabilities almost. And were very difficult. I just had Matt McGinnis on the podcast. He's CEO at Rippling, now CPO at Rippling, and just recorded an episode with him. And he had this really powerful quote that if you're ever comfortable at work and feel like, oh, I got this, you're making a huge mistake. Something's going terribly wrong. That's not where you want to be.\n\nMolly Graham (00:11:23):\nYeah. I always say I get bored really easily, which is both a strength and probably my greatest weakness. So I like being scared.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:30):\nOkay. So let's actually dive into some of your greatest hits of frameworks. And the greatest of all greats, when a lot of people think Molly Graham, a lot of people think of giving away your Legos. Some people haven't heard of this, many people have, so let's cover this. What is this advice of giving away your Legos?\n\nMolly Graham (00:11:47):\nSo this definitely started in my experience at Google. And then Facebook was a masterclass in giving away the Legos. But the way I like to talk about it is basically when I watch leaders and employees go through rapid scale, I like to think of somebody putting down a giant pile of Legos in front of a bunch of kindergartners and then just being like, build something. And that's sort of what it feels like when you start. It's like, well, there's so many Legos and it's so fun. There's a lot of opportunity, but it's also kind of scary and overwhelming. And you're like, there's so many Legos. What do I do? Isn't there an instruction manual hidden under this pile somewhere? But then you start building and you're like, oh, okay. You build something and then you take it apart and then you put it back together.\n\n(00:12:33):\nAnd then eventually you start to get momentum and you're like, okay, it's like I'm building a house. I got this. It's a house. All right, great. And then you're like, I'm good at building houses. I was put on earth to build houses. And almost assuredly inside of scaling companies, as soon as you're like, I feel good at this and I should do this forever. Somebody's going to show up and be like, okay, it's not a house. It's a neighborhood. And you need to take this house that's kind of half built and you're going to pass it off to this other person that we just hired. And you are going to go build dog parks and streets and other things that are entirely unhouse-like. And what happens when someone does that to you is you're like, wait a minute. First of all, I'm not done with this house. And I'm worried that this person's going to screw it up.\n\n(00:13:18):\nI'm also worried that building houses is actually the most fun thing and that I'm going to give the Legos to that person and they're going to have all the fun work and I'm going to hate building dog parks. Or that dog parks are irrelevant eventually and it's going to turn out we're in the house building business. So there's this incredible set of emotions that come territorialistic, paired with excitement. Fear paired with joy. But eventually you pass the house off and then you go work on neighborhoods and you're sort of like, okay, dog parks, I'm good at dog parks. I got this. And then again, you get to the like, I'm great. I was put on earth to build neighborhoods. And immediately someone shows up and says, it's not a neighborhood. It's a country or a city or a world. And it just goes on and on and on.\n\n(00:14:03):\nAnd for me, learning this muscle of both learning to give away what you've gotten good at and move on to the next shiny pile of Legos. And learning that the emotions associated with that are inevitable. I've been doing this for 18, 20 years, I still get attacked by these emotions all the time, but that doesn't mean that you shouldn't give them away and move on to the next thing.\n\n(00:14:33):\nThat is both the torment of scaling companies, which is that the ground is moving under your feet. And as soon as you're comfortable, someone will make sure that you are uncomfortable, but it's also the opportunity, which is that you can go from being someone that's good at building houses to someone that knows how to build entire worlds. And that is where the Legos metaphor came from.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:55):\nThat is such a good metaphor. And if you've gone through this, you so understand what this is like and what... And also just the Legos is metaphor is so good for the different things you build.\n\nMolly Graham (00:15:06):\nI have a very weird brain that for some odd reason just always thinks in metaphors.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:11):\n[inaudible 00:15:11].\n\nMolly Graham (00:15:11):\nSo it showed up when I was... At Facebook in particular, I would find that every so often I would have to have what I called a Legos talk with someone where I would just see them start to ask these questions like, why are we hiring that person? Or what's that team even do? And I was like, okay, we need to have the chat about the Legos. And then eventually it turned into an article and a whole thing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:33):\nA whole thing. And just to be clear, the advice is give away your Legos, this is actually the path to a successful career.\n\nMolly Graham (00:15:40):\nI have watched a lot of people over many years struggle with feeling like they should hang on to the thing that they've been good at. And it almost always... Because, you know, essentially the nature of a scaling company is that the Lego pile is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger however fast that graph is going up into the right. I always say that's the graph of how fast your business is growing. It's the graph of how fast your company is expanding. And it's the graph of how fast your job is getting bigger. That means that if you actually just stay and build houses, eventually you're literally buried under a pile of Legos. Do you know what I mean? You held onto something that's down here and the opportunity is actually to stay on top of that pile and to learn to just give away your job every so often.\n\n(00:16:27):\nAt Facebook, I got to a place where I was literally giving away my job every three weeks. I was constantly rehiring myself essentially because you have to sort of grow as fast as your company is growing if you really want to take advantage of the opportunity that comes with companies that are growing and changing quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:45):\nSo people are hearing this, they're like, okay, my rational brain's like, I should give away my Legos. It'll help me. It'll be good for my career. In real life, it's very hard to actually do. To give away this empire that you've built, this team that you've built. This project that you're like, oh, this is going to be my thing. I know you have a really fun, useful tool to help people deal with that kind of irrational part of their brain. Talk about that.\n\nMolly Graham (00:17:07):\nSo like I said, my brain works in weird metaphors. It's a weird brain. I was raised on The Muppets, and I like to think that this one came from, I guess, growing up watching weird animals. But basically, at some point I realized that this emotional rollercoaster that comes with scaling, with growing. With going through change, any kind of change. People feel that. Was never going to go away. And that no matter how good I got... Sometimes I think it gets worse the more senior you get, actually. Because you sort of feel like you're supposed to know what you're doing, and then you just get attacked by this monster that's like, who even gave you this job in the first place? So basically I externalized all these emotions that come with change into this little tiny monster. I named my monster, Bob. Your monster can be named whatever you want him to be named or her or them.\n\n(00:17:56):\nAnd Bob's job... I like to think his job is basically to make me the worst version of myself. He's the one that's like, oh, that person took all the fun Legos and you should go push them over and grab them back. Bob's job is... Bob's the one that wants to send the rage emails at 9:00PM and burn the house down. And the thing to learn about Bob is that, like I said, Bob never goes away. Bob is someone that you have to learn to deal with. But Bob's job is to make you the worst version of yourself. So your job is to let Bob do his thing, but not act on the emotions. Basically, all these emotions are normal and they are not useful. They are not the compass that should be telling you what to do.\n\n(00:18:46):\nBut the other rule I have for managing Bob is a lot of people are like, oh, you're feeling off or tired or whatever. Go to bed and wake up tomorrow morning and you'll feel better. And the truth is that you're like, I want to send the rage email at 9:00PM. You still want to send it at 8:00AM. And a lot of these emotions just do not go away in 24 hours. So my rule of thumb from Facebook was give it two weeks. And the emotional, the sort of Bob... Bob is like these waves and they just roll through. So you made a new hire or somebody came in or you got layered or whatever. You'll have a set of reactions. And those reactions, again, they're normal, but they're not useful. They're not the ones that you should listen to. They are Bob.\n\n(00:19:29):\nAnd typically they go away in a couple of days, you get something new. Some new wave. But anything that lasts longer than two weeks is actually something you should pay attention to. It's something that if it's been around for two weeks, it's something you should go talk to someone about. Whether it's a manager or a friend or a coach or someone like that. That's the real stuff. Everything else is just Bob.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:50):\nIs there a rule of thumb for when it actually, when you shouldn't give away your Legos? When it's like, okay, maybe you should fight back on this layering or whatever.\n\nMolly Graham (00:20:00):\nNo rule of thumb. In general, I would actually say embracing change is far better than fighting it. And almost invariably, you cannot see what is around the corner, but it is almost always the thing to focus on. A lot of times I think inside of change, we get focused on the past, and one of the most valuable things you can do as a manager and a leader is help people focus on the future. I think... I'm sure there are times when people have done it and regretted it and it has led them somewhere.\n\n(00:20:42):\nI think being layered, for example, is one of the hardest things for people inside these experiences where someone brings in a manager above you. And I've also seen so many stories of that ending up being a great thing for someone. Even though they couldn't see it at the time. So in general, I would just say, step into the future and let the past go and see what you're going to learn. And sometimes you'll learn that it's time to leave or that this isn't the right pile of Legos for you. But it'll end up taking you somewhere that's worth exploring. Holding onto things almost always leads us to the worst version of ourselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:24):\nIt's a very Buddhist way of thinking too. Just don't cling.\n\nMolly Graham (00:21:31):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:31):\nYeah. And I think another part of this metaphor, I don't know if you think of it this way. Is the Legos aren't even your Legos, right? They're like the CEO's Legos, the shareholders' Legos. So you think they're your Legos, but no, you're not in charge.\n\nMolly Graham (00:21:42):\nWell, it is... I will say one of the hard-earned things is it can feel very emotional and it can feel very personal. It can feel like your work... I don't know, it can feel like your life is on the line sometimes. Just your work life. Oh, gosh, this matters so much. And one of the things that you learn as you get more senior and just have seen stuff is it's going to be okay. A friend of mine says, careers are long and nobody tells you that. But they're long. And this moment feels so dire and it feels so hard and it feels scary and it's going to be okay. So yeah, it is hard to know in the moment. And I think the story is going to be long and this is going to be one chapter or maybe even a part of a chapter, not a whole chapter. So embrace the length.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:37):\nTo build on that point, I've realized this is my fourth career doing what I do now. Whatever the hell this is. I was a engineer and then I was a founder. Then I was a product manager, and then what the hell I do now. Whatever this is, that's a whole different path.\n\nMolly Graham (00:22:52):\nYou don't have a name for it yet, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:55):\nI don't. I hate all the terms people use for this world.\n\nMolly Graham (00:22:58):\nSomebody called me an influencer and I almost ripped their face off.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:00):\nYeah. [inaudible 00:23:02].\n\nMolly Graham (00:23:02):\n[inaudible 00:23:02].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:03):\nYeah.\n\nMolly Graham (00:23:04):\nYeah, man. The most interesting careers are winding and they have starts and stops and failures and successes and control. Anybody that's been through a lot of this stuff, control is usually not the name of the game. It's usually just like, \"Let's see what happens. We're going to try this and we're going to see what happens next.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:26):\nThis is a great segue to another framework that I've heard from folks you've worked with that have been really impactful on them. So, Sarah Caldwell, who's a big deal at OpenAI, she told me that the framework that helped her most in her career is something that you call the J-Curve versus Stairs career growth framework. Talk about what that's about.\n\nMolly Graham (00:23:46):\nI actually gave a TED Talk about this one a couple of years ago because I am so passionate about it, but you can listen to the very packaged eight-minute version of this, but I will tell you the real story because it's very relevant to a lot of folks that listen to your podcast. I was at Facebook for five years. Like I said, the first two years I was in HR and I was doing employment branding and culture work and I was ready to stay there. I think I had in my head I was going to stay there until we went public, that was my plan just because I wanted to help the company through that moment, again, in my head.\n\n(00:24:21):\nThis guy that many people know, Chamath Palihapitiya, came to me and Chamath ran growth and mobile at the time. And he came to me and we had lunch and he said in his very Chamath way, \"You're useless. What are you doing in HR? This is stupid. You should come work for me.\" And anybody that knows Chamath is like, \"Yes, that is actually what he said.\" He managed to insult you and compliment you in one sentence.\n\n(00:24:47):\nHe gave me all these options on his team. And then the last one he said to me was like, \"I'm going to go build a mobile phone. Do you want to come do that with me?\" And I had four simultaneous reactions. The first was like, \" That is incredibly stupid. Why are we doing that?\" And then it was like, \"Is that actually a thing that we're doing?\" And then it was like, \"Whoa, I think that sounds kind of fun.\" And so I left the conversation at Chamath and I went and asked my boss, Lori Goler, who's the head of people at Facebook for a very long time, like, \"Is this actually something we're doing?\" And she was like, \"I can't believe he offered you that, whatever.\"\n\n(00:25:21):\nAnd I basically just could not get it out of my head, but it didn't make any sense, A, that Chamath had asked me because I was in HR. Like, \"What am I doing? I don't absolutely jack shit about mobile.\" But I had worked on a project with him and I guess he thought I was smart. And I talked to Cheryl and she was like, \"Well, that project will be dead in two months, but you can do it because you'll still have a job here.\" My dad was like, \"Well, don't do that. \" And anyway, a lot of very wise people being like, \"Don't do that.\"\n\n(00:25:51):\nBut I kind of couldn't get out of my head. And my friend said to me, \"You've proven you're really good at this sort of company-wide project management and HR. Why don't you go show yourself how actually good you are? Is this transferable?\" So, I took the job and I spent the next six months feeling like an absolute idiot. I basically felt like a total jackass all the time. I was sitting in rooms with these brilliant people asking the dumbest questions of my life and at the end of the six months, Chamath, I think, took a lot of pride in giving me the lowest performance rating I've ever gotten in my life, and it just felt like falling off a cliff. Then, slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone and trying to explain to him why something he wanted to do was not possible. I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, \"Oh, I actually know things.\" And slowly then, over the following three years, I became an expert in mobile. And I basically... The phone itself was a giant failure, massive, costly failure for Facebook, but it was not a failure for me. It was a huge job that taught me that I was capable of things that I never could have dreamed of if I had stayed in HR. It set me up to be capable of taking on things that I didn't know about.\n\n(00:27:28):\nChamath, when he pitched me on this job, actually drew me a picture on a whiteboard. He said, \"Look, you can stay...\" The way a lot of people do careers is a set of stairs. \"You can be boring.\" To use Chamath, \"And stay on these stairs. Just walk up the stairs and you'll get promoted every two years and your title will change from manager to senior manager to director to senior director, whatever.\" And he was like, \"But that is boring.\" And he's like, \"The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs.\" Basically, that you jump off this thing and you do fall for a period of time. I always like to say it's about six to nine months, but then this thing happens where you climb out.\n\n(00:28:05):\nAnd the picture he drew had this J-curve sort of basically leading you to places that are way beyond where the stairs could ever get you. And to be totally honest, that has been my experience. That taking risks, accepting the sort of terrible fall and that experience of falling has been more than worth it. Part of the reason why Sarah mentions it is that I do give this sort of talk to people that are inside of really fast-growing companies, because it's such an important place to let go of Legos and jump off cliffs because there's so much opportunity. And it is a place where if you prove to people that you're actually good, if they believe that you are the kind of person that they can use to do lots of things, you can get these opportunities that you are just so deeply unqualified for, but they can take you to places that you could never have imagined.\n\n(00:29:01):\nYou can come out of those companies with skills that no one would ever have reasonably hired you to do. But I ended my time at Facebook in product and did business development and hardware and a whole bunch of the stuff along the way. And again, nobody would've hired me to do that at the beginning, but it's just because I kept saying yes to things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:22):\nMolly, I got tingles listening to this story. Wow.\n\nMolly Graham (00:29:25):\nDoes it sound familiar, Lenny?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:29:27):\nIt does. I want to ask, jumping off a cliff, sometimes you fall, really fall and you keep falling. Are there any kind of traits of like, \"Okay, this is one that might be a J-Curve and worth the risk of falling, and this is when you should probably just not, let's not do this\".\n\nMolly Graham (00:29:46):\nYeah. I just think there are different kinds of fear. We talk a lot about this in Glue Club because one of the thing, there is a financial fear, right? Leaving a job and taking a job that has financial risk associated with it, or leaving a job and taking time off, which is something that I spend a lot of time talking to people about, you got to do the math and you got to... Sometimes there is a type of fear that is telling you like, \"This is not the right time.\" Or, \"I don't want to be financially anxious for months and months and months.\"\n\n(00:30:21):\nI use finances because it's the most concrete example of a type of fear that you should actually listen to. And sometimes you can do the math. I always counsel people through that. I'm like, \"What is the number that you need to hit so that you're not constantly terrified financially?\" And that number is wildly different for people based on their background and their life. \"Can you do that? Can you consult, can you whatever in order to take this leap?\" But a lot of times fear is just you saying, \"I'm scared I can't do this. I'm scared I'm not capable of it. Yeah, I'm scared I'll fail.\"\n\n(00:30:56):\nAnd that's the kind of fear that I think of as a flashing green light because... And it sounds like Matt McGinnis said this too, where it's like, \"That's the kind of fear that's saying, 'Why don't you go prove to yourself that you are actually capable of this?'\" Or if you fail, like, \"You'll have learned something, too.\" You know what I mean? You'll have learned, like, \"I took this job in product at Facebook as my last chapter there, and let me tell you things that people should never fucking hire me to do.\" I was like, \"I am not a good product manager.\" But I've got a great product mindset. I can sit in a bunch of chairs and hang with the product folks, but I'm not the person that cares about the button. Do you know what I mean?\n\n(00:31:38):\nAnd I would never have learned that. I wouldn't have known who I was if I hadn't taken that risk and failed or at least learned that it's not something I wanted to do again. So, there's many different lessons that come from facing down those fears and jumping off the cliff, but mostly what it is is knowing yourself better and knowing where you go next from there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:03):\nThat is such helpful advice. I also love how you frame this of, \"Prove it to yourself that you can do this.\" It's not, \"I'm going to show them that I can do this.\" Because the way you describe this, usually it's an opportunity given to you. \"Hey, can you do this thing? We want you to lead this new thing.\" And the fear is like, \"I don't think I can do that.\" And what you're saying here is, \"Prove it to yourself that you can.\" Or, I guess, it's also, \"Okay, maybe I can't and then I'll learn that and then I'll know more about myself.\"\n\nMolly Graham (00:32:27):\nYeah, exactly. I mean, one of the greatest gifts in a career is knowing yourself. And that's a lifelong journey because who you are and what you want changes, but that knowledge and that gift, nothing accelerates your self-knowledge faster than trying to do something that you don't know how to do and that you're scared of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:50):\nProbably the quote I use most on this podcast comes up again in my mind as you talk about this, this line that, \"The cave you fear contains the treasure you seek.\"\n\nMolly Graham (00:32:59):\nHell yes, exactly. Well said.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:03):\nThere it is.\n\nMolly Graham (00:33:03):\nI haven't heard that one from you, so clearly I need to listen more.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:04):\nOkay, that's great. I'm glad I don't overuse it. It just feels like it comes up again and again, and I think your point about the runway and the finances is such an important one because that's a very real practical question. One thing I did when I took time off, I took a year off after I left my job. What helped me was I just created a runway goal for myself. I'm just like, \"Okay, here's what it's going to cost me for six months or a year to live without any income. Am I comfortable just burning through these tens of thousands of dollars to explore and see something new emerge?\" And so you just have to feel good. \"Okay, yes, I'm going to burn all that money and that's part of it.\"\n\nMolly Graham (00:33:37):\nYeah, that's exactly the exercise. You're saying \"runway\" I say \"burn rate\", so we both were raised inside of companies, incentive tech, but I think it is do the math, right? What can you afford? And it's both what can you afford and still feel safe? Because sometimes, I mean, again, I think that is different for everyone, but it is such an important set of math to do because, A, a lot of times that number is smaller than you think it is, then your brain makes it out to be if you have this sort of existential financial anxiety versus, I always say, \"Specific financial anxiety is much more useful than existential financial anxiety.\" And some friends are leaving jobs and I'll be like, \"Hey, your number is 5K or 10K a month. You have to believe that you can get a consulting gig that will pay you that. Do you believe that?\" And it's like, \"Either yes or no.\" And then, \"Okay, either we're doing it or we're not.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:29):\nThe other part of this J- Curve that I think is really important to touch on is this idea of for the first six or nine months, you're going to be at the bottom of the J curve falling, still falling. And some projects don't last that long and then you're like, \"Okay, total failure. I never emerged from this fall.\" So, is there any advice there? Just, how do you create that enough space to give you a chance to start to un-fall?\n\nMolly Graham (00:34:49):\nI mean, the most valuable thing that happens as you fall is learning. And even on the other side of failure, you've learned a shit ton. I always say, \"The most important thing to do in the falling phase and the risk taking land is to learn to embrace being a professional idiot.\" Basically, being the one that shows up at the meeting and is like, \"What are we talking about? What does that word mean?\"\n\n(00:35:18):\nFor a bunch of reasons. Number one, you can learn so much. And again, even in the face of failure, no one can take away your learning. Do you know what I mean? But the other thing is that it turns out that a lot of the questions in the world that, you're sitting in the meeting and you're like, \"This is a dumb question. Everyone's going to think I'm an idiot.\" But then you get brave and you ask it and it turns out it wasn't a dumb question. Do you know what I mean? Turns out that everyone had that question in their mind, but no one was brave enough to ask it.\n\n(00:35:48):\nSo, from a skills' perspective, again, regardless of outcome, being the person that sort of takes their learning in their own hands, learning no matter what and learning to ask those dumb questions, it's a superpower. I always say that, \"Actually, my superpower is being a professional moron.\" Because I'm the one that shows up in a room and is like, \"Do we have goals? What are we doing? Why are we talking about this? Why are we having this meeting?\" And most of the time it's actually what I was hired to do, which is bring clarity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:19):\nIt's so funny. I just recorded a podcast episode with a PM named Zevi who joined Wix and he had this thought, he's like a very young PM, just getting started and he's like, \"Okay, I need to be a 10X PM because that's what they expect of me, that's what everyone that is really good, that's how I think of a 10X PM.\" And then he went into his first meeting and he just failed and he just felt so bad. He's like, \"I guess I'm not that 10X PM. They're all going to see that. They think I'm terrible.\" And then he did another presentation a little bit later and people were so impressed with how he learned and evolved and improved. And he realized that he needs to be not a 10X PM, but a 10X learner, and that's what people actually expect from someone, especially a junior person.\n\nMolly Graham (00:37:05):\nYeah. Well, I was having a conversation last night with a friend of mine who has a senior in high school and I was like, \"What is the plan? What are we telling this senior in high school to think about relative to their career given everything that's going on with AI?\" And we talked about it a bunch, but what we both circled back to was this idea of soft skills and that actually the only thing you can really anchor on right now is that teaching kids grit, teaching them hard work, teaching them learning, right? Learning how to learn, loving learning, being able to fall, in a world that's changing this fast. And I say this inside of companies too, right? I always say, like, \"What you know today is way less valuable than what you can learn by tomorrow.\" If you're inside of a company where the growth curve is like this, what you know today is irrelevant.\n\n(00:37:52):\nSomebody once told... I'm sure this is faster now, but they rewrote the entire code base at Google every eight years, which means that if you're not learning, if you're not evolving, then you become irrelevant and extinct. It's actually the whole underlying point of the Legos stuff is that evolution is the way you stay on top, and I think that's more true today than it's ever been.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:14):\nAnd luckily, AI is really good at helping us learn.\n\nMolly Graham (00:38:16):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:17):\nSo, that's good. Thank you, AI. And this actually comes up a bunch in the podcast. I ask a lot of AI-forward people what they're teaching their kids and curiosity is one of the main things people talk a lot about. Just like, \"Help them develop curiosity about the world.\"\n\nMolly Graham (00:38:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:31):\nYeah. Okay. I feel like I could be talking about this specific topic for a whole podcast episode, but I want to move on to a couple other frameworks that you've developed. One is something called a Waterline Model and another former colleague of here said, \"This is the most impactful thing that they've learned from you on their career.\" So, talk about the Waterline Model.\n\nMolly Graham (00:38:50):\nOkay. Yeah. Well, first of all, the Waterline Model is not mine. It's from some business book somewhere, but I actually learned it. My first job out of college was leading wilderness trips. I led 75-day wilderness trips in Patagonia and Alaska for a school called NOLS, the National Outdoor Leadership School. NOLS basically teaches essentially leadership and communication skills to students.\n\n(00:39:15):\nI was mostly leading college age kids through wilderness expeditions. So, by having to lead a group of your peers that you don't know. Anyway, the Waterline Model is something that we taught on NOLS. It's a really, really helpful model for understanding how to diagnose when something is not working on a team, so I teach it inside of Glue Club and I'll just quickly explain it. Basically, the way to think about the Waterline Model is that a team is a boat and it's a boat on an ocean trying to get somewhere, getting somewhere is goals, right? \"What are we trying to build or ship or do?\" Essentially, that is going to be harder or easier based on whatever the shape of the ocean is, right? If it's really choppy, it's harder, if it's smooth and calm, it's going to be easy to get to your goals.\n\n(00:40:02):\nSo, the Waterline basically asks the question like, \"What is going on under the water? What is going on that's making it harder or easier to get to your goals?\" And there's essentially four things underneath the water and they are in a descending order. The surface level is what's called structural things. Basically, structural things are like goal setting, vision, roles, expectations, kind of the structures you put in place to make a team and a company and a business make sense, that touch every single member of the team.\n\n(00:40:37):\nRight below that is something called dynamics, which is essentially how the team works together. It's culture, it's decision making, it's how we resolve conflict, all the sort of like interwoven pieces of how teams work together. And then below that is interpersonal, so basically relationships between two people and all the things that come with us being humans. And then the bottom is intrapersonal, meaning within one person, challenges and issues there.\n\n(00:41:08):\nThe interesting thing about this model is that most people, when something's going wrong on a team, a lot of times we always go to the bottom. We go to the people. We're like, \"The people aren't getting along, that person's having a rough moment.\" We go to the humans, but the rule with the Waterline Model, which is very memorable, is you snorkel before you scuba. So, 80% of problems on teams actually happen because of structural issues or dynamics issues. So, when there are problems on your team, where you start is at the top, you start structural issues.\n\n(00:41:44):\nAnd one of my biggest things that I say all the time over and over again inside of Glue Club is, \"Your only goal as a manager, if you do nothing else, is clear roles and clear expectations. That's it.\" Because honestly, I've taken over a lot of teams in my life and almost always I show up and it turns out that no one knows what their job is and no one knows what success looks like. And if you can make those two things clear, which again is at the snorkel level, it will fix a huge percentage of other issues on a team. But the main thing is where you start and just always sort of starting at that structural level or the dynamics level and not sort of immediately going to the people and all that. Because yes, people cause all sorts of problems, but a lot of times the problems are happening because they're existing inside of a structure that's confusing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:32):\nAnother very vivid metaphor and just, I love how it builds on it with the snorkeling. Okay. So, just to be super clear about this, the takeaway here is, you have a problem with your team, with the company, many people think it's, they jump to the people are the problem. \"They're not good enough, they're not working hard enough.\" Really, what you're saying is, most often, the issue is not the person, it's the situation, whether it's the structure of how they're set up to work or the dynamics amongst the people. And specifically what you're saying is that the role maybe isn't clear or what success means for that role is not clear.\n\nMolly Graham (00:43:08):\nEvery company I've worked with or advise, I often start with like, \"What are the goals?\" And usually what you get the hack is, \"Uh, not clear.\" And that in and of itself is a structural issue, right? How can someone show up and decide what they're going to do with their day all day if the goals aren't clear, if they don't actually know what the priorities are? And then it goes to, okay, role, right? \"Do I know what my job is? Do I know what number I was hired to own and drive?\" And then, \"Do I know what success looks like? How does my role tie to that overall goal that the company has?\" Just literally right there. You got probably 80% of problems inside of companies because this is the hard work of company building. It's the stuff that's not intuitive. \"How do you organize a group of people to know which direction to row?\"\n\n(00:43:52):\nAnd that equation, again, I would say 80% of problems that I see, performance issues. I always start with, \"Does this person actually know what you expect of them?\" If not, go back to step one. Do you know what I mean? Clarify expectations, so the Waterline Model is just helpful for reminding us, like, \"Start at the top.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:44:11):\nSo what would you do there? Say you're a manager, you're having an issue with a team member, would you go and ask, \"Hey, let's just make sure we're aligned on goals and roles.\" Is that how'd you approach it or is there a different approach?\n\nMolly Graham (00:44:24):\nSo a lot of times what I do is two-sided, right? So it's like, \"Hey, here's what I'm seeing and tell me what's going on for you. Do you know X, Y, Z?\" When I take over a team, when I'm doing my listening tour, part of what I'm asking is, \"What do you think your job is? What number were you hired to drive?\" Because what you'll find is often their picture is different than your picture. You think you've been clear, you described an elephant and they spat out a tiger and that coming back to like, \"Okay, no, we're building an elephant. You're in charge of the trunk.\" Will, in some percentage of cases, actually make a huge difference to the person's work and time and performance. In plenty of cases it doesn't, but that's always where I would start because it so often is just a more fundamental problem that then would lead you to look at other things across the team.\n\n(00:45:20):\nBut yeah, I would say two-way dialogue, but re-clarifying roles and expectations, re-describing the elephant over and over and over again, is one of the hardest parts about being a leader because you feel like a broken record, right? You feel like an idiot. You're like, \"I've said this 45 times.\" Turns out no one heard you the first 43 and you have to. You have to re-describe it in order for people to hear you and to re-understand their sort of role in what they're doing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):\nI love how you reframed the way I approached it by starting with, \"Here's what I'm seeing. What are you seeing? What do you think your role is? \" The very non-violent communication oriented, which is a clear pattern on this podcast, just the power of that specific framework.\n\nMolly Graham (00:45:58):\nYeah, totally. Well, like I said, work is about humans and it's...\n\nMolly Graham (00:46:01):\nLike I said, work is about humans and it's the art of organizing humans to get something done and build something that's greater than the sum of its parts and that is an art of the humanness in all of us, how do we get people to hear us, how do we get people aligned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:17):\nWork for a lifetime.\n\nMolly Graham (00:46:19):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by GoFundMe Giving Funds, the zero fee donor advised fund. Did you make it New Year's resolution to give more? I want to tell you about a new product that GoFundMe has launched called Giving Funds which is a smarter and easier way to give. GoFundMe Giving Funds is a DAF or donor-advised fund from the world's number one giving platform trusted by over 200 million people, it's basically your own mini foundation without the lawyers or admin costs. You contribute money or stock, get the tax deduction right away and then decide later where you want to donate. There are zero admin or asset fees and, while the money sits there, you can invest and grow a tax-free so that you can give more later. GoFundMe is a FinTech unicorn working for good. Make a better world in 2026 and start your Giving Fund today at gofundme.com/lenny. They'll even cover your DAF pay fees if you transfer your existing DAF over. That's gofundme.com/lenny to start your giving fund.\n\n(00:47:17):\nOkay, so let me actually follow this thread of the importance of goals and just being clear around this stuff. You have these six rules for creating clear goals and alignment on teams, talk about these six roles.\n\nMolly Graham (00:47:30):\nYeah, totally. I feel like there should be less than six but it's where we're at. I would say, at a high level, two things before I get to the six. One is that I definitely have a bone to pick with OKRs, I feel like it's obviously been a really helpful framework for Google and others and, a lot of times, when I show up inside a company or I'm talking to a leader and I'm like, \"What are your goals?\" what I get back is this spreadsheet that has 100 lines and feels like it's written in Greek and, when I look at it, I'm like, \" This doesn't create clarity for anyone.\" And it brings me back to what is the point of goals, why do we have them and, at the end of the day, goals are a communication tool, that's what they are. They're a communication tool designed to create clarity, to help people know I'm going to show up at my desk, what should I work on, what's the most important thing and your 100-line spreadsheet doesn't help anybody.\n\n(00:48:23):\nAnd the second thing I would just say is you really have to ask the question what is right for me at this company and this stage, what is right for a seed stage company is not what is right for a company that's got an established business and a clear go-to-market machine. So, when I'm building in seed stage, I'm setting goals every two months in a very iterative way. When I have an established business, I can actually set annual goals but annual goals for early stage companies is just a waste of time. So, anyway, a lot of my goal setting stuff actually comes from Facebook which I think was very, very good at this.\n\n(00:48:58):\nSo, the first role is that no company needs more than three company goals and the point of company goals is to help people know what the most important things are to success. So, Facebook basically had three goals for the entire time I was there, it was five years and we did six-month goal setting, I think we did annual goal setting that ended up getting reset every six months but whatever. So, the three goals were this, there was growth which was measured as monthly active users, that was the externally reported number eventually, MAUs. The second goal was engagement meaning how often do people come back and use the site and the third was revenue and we literally had three goals for the five years that I was there. If you can govern that business with three goals, you can govern literally any business with three goals. So, no company needs more than three goals.\n\n(00:49:52):\nThe second thing is that one goal needs to win in a fight. So, if I'm sitting down and asking how do I prioritize my time on a given day I need to know what is the most important thing. At Facebook, we had growth and there's a lot of different ways you can add monthly active users to a social media site including you can go buy a whole bunch of bots in Indonesia and that would add to your MAU number but it would not add to your engagement number and it was very clear for the entire time that I was there that engagement was the most important thing. Acquiring users that were going to use the site all the time, that's what drives revenue, it's also what drove the heart of that site. So, if you had to prioritize something, you prioritized engagement, that goal won in the fight.\n\n(00:50:35):\nThe third I'll say is, I call it the explain it to me like I'm five goal, but an intern that started on Monday should be able to look at your goals and understand them and, if they can't, then you are failing because they are not a communication tool that's effective. You have to be able to understand the goals, you have to explain the acronyms, you have to have numbers that make sense to average people, otherwise, again, it fails as a communication tool.\n\n(00:51:03):\nThe fourth one is ... Actually, I stole a phrase from Claire Hughes Johnson who you've had on your podcast but wrote a book called Scaling People and in it she says this sentence that I love which is strategy should hurt. And my role used to be set non-goals, basically, make it as clear what you're not going to do as what you are going to do but strategy should hurt is a much better way to explain it to people which is, if you're not making trade-offs that are painful, you are not actually helping people prioritize their time. Because the nature of work is that people will show up every day and do something and either you are very clear with them about what the priorities are or they're going to prioritize for you because they're going to choose what they work on every day. And we see this so much with founders where they can't cut things off the list, they just have to have the 10 goals and I'm like, \"Cool. Six of these goals are not going to get done so either you pick which four it is or other people are going to pick for you.\" So, strategy should hurt. If your goal setting process is not painful, then you're not prioritizing heavily enough.\n\n(00:52:09):\nOkay, ready? We're on number five. This is more of an organizational point but it's really important for the waterline model too which is that one goal has one owner. You have a number, that number has a name next to it. If you cannot do that work, you haven't done the most important work to actually make sure that these goals get accomplished. And it's organizational work and it's very painful because sometimes it feels like, oh, this person can own it or this, maybe they'll just own it together, two people owning a goal is no one owning a goal. One person owns the goal, who is it? It's not you as the CEO, it's someone that works for you so one goal, one owner. And then the last, which is the hardest, is that goals by themselves are not enough. I've spent a lot of time with founders that are like, \"I did it. I set the goals. Why not working? I don't understand.\" And I'm like, \"What did you do after you set the goals?\" And they're like, \"I don't know, I set the goals.\" Goals ...\n\n(00:53:10):\nJames Clear who wrote Atomic Habits has this really lovely sentence which is winners and losers have the same goal. Goals by themself are not enough, you have to have a process by which you follow up on the goals and you hold people accountable to the goals and you learn from the goals because so much of goal setting, particularly if you're earlier in building your company, is about learning from trying to do something. You set a goal, can we do it, how hard is it to move this number, that is the ... You might be wrong all the time but you're learning what it takes to move the number. So, setting the goal by itself, not enough, you have to build a process in the system to actually learn from the goal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:53):\nWow. This list is ... There's so much power in this list, it's such a succinct-\n\nMolly Graham (00:53:57):\nIt's too long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:58):\nNo, I don't think it is because each of these has so much depth and power to them that saves you so much headache and just wasted time and resources. Just the idea of one owner, one goal, something I've personally discovered to have such power because, and correct me if I'm missing something here but just, if you feel like someone else may be doing the thing or feels like it's not just fully your responsibility, there's so much less energy and just mental ... I don't know. You just don't care as much about hitting that goal. And if it's you-\n\nMolly Graham (00:54:29):\nYeah, accountability.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:30):\nYeah. If it's like, \"Lenny, this goal is your goal and, if you hit it, you've done it. If you don't, you've done a bad job,\" that'd be a such motivating, so motivating. If it's me and Molly, okay, well, we'll figure it out.\n\nMolly Graham (00:54:41):\nIt creates a flood of clarity that seeps down from the person too. And to go back to the waterline model, I would say, so often you'll actually find companies that have set goals but no one owns the goals, everyone owns the goals, multiple people own the goal and you didn't actually get all the way to the answer. And I will say that the ownership thing is hard, it can feel painful but it's really important. There's only one owner and that means that that person, come hell or high water, owns that number.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:16):\nYeah. The way I described it [inaudible 00:55:18] was just someone's ass has to be on the line for this and that just works. That's such a powerful lever to drive things to have one person responsible.\n\nMolly Graham (00:55:28):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:29):\nThe other's just this idea of strategy hurting, I love that. I love that phrase, I forgot Claire had that. So true.\n\nMolly Graham (00:55:36):\nSo good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:37):\nBecause the whole idea is you need to not do things, you need to decide what you're not ... The whole strategy, a big part of it is what we are not doing.\n\nMolly Graham (00:55:44):\nYeah, absolutely. And if you're not making painful choices, then you're not actually doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:49):\nAnd this idea of three goals, so is it just ... So, do you go into a company and just go through a checklist essentially of here's the six things I look at to tell me where there's opportunity to improve?\n\nMolly Graham (00:55:58):\nWhen I work with founders and I see their goals, I use it as a way to get to know the business and I'm just going to be literally like, \"What is this? What are you trying to explain?\" And I can usually, through asking a lot of really dumb questions which, like I said, one of my superpowers, get them to explain to me the one sentence and the one number that they're actually trying to get across but it takes work and that's part of ... It's almost easier to write the 100-line spreadsheet than it is to say, \"Wait, what are the three drivers of this business genuinely? What are they and how do they relate to each other?\" And there can be things underneath them but there's three at the top that matter. So, yeah, I'm not a scientific person about it but a lot of it is just by asking people to explain their businesses to me, you can basically find the drivers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:51):\nAnd the story about Facebook having these same three goals for five years, considering their success, you may think they're not as complicated as your business but I am confident they're just as, if not, more complicated. They're a marketplace, a social network, they're a ad business, just they're ... There's a lot going on and, if they can work with three goals, you can do that too. And to your point, if it's not hurting, then you're doing something wrong.\n\nMolly Graham (00:57:17):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:18):\nI love how ... This is very much what I wanted this chat to be. It feels like every little segment is its own, could be its own podcast where we could talk about this for hours so I'm really excited how this is going. Moving on to another topic, you have not necessarily rules but rules of thumb that you find really helpful for people to have in their head as they're dealing with change and scale and growth and all that kind of stuff so let's just walk through that.\n\nMolly Graham (00:57:45):\nYeah. So, for leaders that are leading through change and growth, the list is probably long but I always say to people don't come to me for management 101, I'm not the person to ask on how to run the most effective one-on-one with your people. What I think is not talked about enough is what it takes to manage and lead through change and that is a very particular set of feelings. And the first thing I learned, when someone makes you a manager or when you take a job as a leader inside a company, you really do feel like, \"Oh, who gave me this job?\" and you feel like you're supposed to know the answer to things. People come to you and ask questions and you're like, \"I'm supposed to know. I'm a leader, I am supposed to have answers.\"\n\n(00:58:35):\nAnd I think, particularly inside of rapid change and scale and growth, it's really important to understand that your job as manager and a leader is not to have all the answers. It is not to have all the answers, it is to get good at finding them, it is to get good at bringing people together to find the answers. And that is hard because it requires saying, \"I don't know, let's go figure it out,\" a whole bunch and it's scary as a leader to say I don't know because you think, \"Oh, gosh, people are going to see through me.\" But again, the more you travel in life, the more you realize that the most experienced leaders are the ones that say, \"No, no, no,\" all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:13):\nI think this is a good reminder of this Bob the monster concept because, hearing this, okay, I don't need to have all the answers as a leader. In real life, being in a meeting, people are like, \"Hey, Molly, what do you think of this?\" You're like, \"Oh, I should have a good answer.\" And so, I think that's a good reminder of this idea of this Bob the monster is going to tell you, \"Oh, you don't know anything, you're not ready for this. You suck at this, you're going to fail everyone that's [inaudible 00:59:34].\"\n\nMolly Graham (00:59:33):\nThey're regretting hiring you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:35):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nMolly Graham (00:59:36):\nEveryone's going to see through you. Imposter, imposter, imposter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nMolly Graham (00:59:39):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:39):\nBut just remembering, there's going to be this part of your head and that's okay, it's there but it doesn't mean it's true.\n\nMolly Graham (00:59:44):\nAbsolutely. And these things are muscles. Dealing with Bob as a muscle, learning to not react to all those things that attack you but also learning, oh, in this moment when someone asks me a question and I'm like, \"Oh,\" actually I should be like, \"I don't actually know, let's go ... Who should we ask? How can we learn this? How can we explore this together? What do you think?\" Those are all actually very powerful questions and they're terrifying to, particularly earlier in your career, as a leader and a manager.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:11):\nAwesome. So, yeah, so the lesson there is no one expects you to have all the answers as a leader.\n\nMolly Graham (01:00:15):\nNo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:16):\nAwesome.\n\nMolly Graham (01:00:17):\nAnd particularly in this world, the one that's changing as fast as it is, nobody knows. Nobody knows what the answers are in a lot of cases, the war will be won by the people that are good exploring and figuring it out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:29):\nI love that phrase.\n\nMolly Graham (01:00:31):\nSo, the second one is, and everyone that has learned this has learned it the hard way, do not promise things that you can't control. It's so tempting particularly when you're hiring people to be like, \"Oh, yeah, your onboarding will be smooth and calm and everything's clear and we've figured it ... Let us tell you our vision and how obvious and clear and smart and blah, blah, blah.\" And then they show up and it's like, \"Oh, shit,\" you know what I mean? There's no manual, no one knows what they're doing, it's all ambiguity and chaos. It's so easy when someone says I want to know that I'm going to be your CMO forever to be like, \"Sure, you can be my CMO,\" you don't know that. Do you know what I mean? So, being really careful with promises of things that are out of your control like stability or titles or never hiring over someone is a flashing red light because there is literally no faster way to demoralize high performers than going back on a promise. Everyone that has been through it knows that feeling of like, \"They told me this when I joined,\" and then they don't do it and you're like, \"Well, fuck this place.\" So, no faster way to demoralize people or to hire the wrong people than promising things that are actually out of your control. Being honest and upfront about who you are as a company, about what you're able to promise, all of that is actually ... It's very hard work but it's so important because so much is out of your control and you need to hire people that are cool with that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:01):\nLove that. I learned this the hard way once, I had a ... One of my early projects, we were late and the head of product was just so pissed he's like, \"Because I've been telling the CEO it's going to be on time because you've been telling me it's going to be on time and then it wasn't and why didn't you tell me that?\" And I was just like, \"Okay, it'll never happen again,\" and he's like, \"You can't ... Don't tell me that because that's not true, that nay not ... You can't guarantee that.\" And so, that taught me that lesson of just, yeah, you're right, you want to say that, it feels so good. Okay, this will never happen again but you can't and they know you can't promise things like that.\n\nMolly Graham (01:02:38):\nYeah. And sorry, I'm going to quote Claire Hughes Johnson again but she has this really fun phrase that she said in a talk at Glue Club that I've now latched onto and stolen from her which is, she was like, \"Promises like that are like letter bombs that you mail yourself that are going to explode in your face in a year,\" and I was like, \"That is the perfect metaphor.\" Because it's short-term pain, you want to make this person feel good right now so you promise them something but, in one year, you're going to make them feel terrible so don't do it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:10):\nGreat advice. All right, keep going.\n\nMolly Graham (01:03:11):\nYeah. So, again, could probably go on the topic of what it takes to manage and lead forever inside this stuff but I'll give you two more that I yell about a lot in Glue Club. The first is that we spend huge amounts of time talking about hiring. How do you get good at hiring? What's the right interview? How do I find the right people? Firing people is as important as hiring people. Getting good at identifying when someone does not belong or someone is not going to work out is actually a skill and being good at it as a company and as a leader is as important as identifying the right talent because, eventually, if you're not good at firing people, what you have is essentially barnacles on a ship. Really going forward with the ship metaphor, anyway.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:03:12):\nIt's true.\n\nMolly Graham (01:04:00):\nIt's drag people that are sitting around not pushing the team forward. So, it's painful and it's horrible because it is humans but, when someone doesn't fit, you ... No one is right all the time when it comes to hiring, I actually say most people are wrong half the time. The best people in the world in hiring will tell you they have about a 50% average in terms of being right. That means half the hires don't work out. That means, half the time, you're going to need to fire the person. So, it's such an important skill to get good at particularly when you're going through a lot of change. And the last one is humans are messy and it's very emotional. And when you're a leader, particularly if you have any kind of anagram too or just if you like to make people happy and you want to be liked, it can be so hard to lead teams because you get tangled in the people. Firing people is a painful experience, reorganizing things, layering people, all these things are emotionally painful for the people and they're emotionally painful for you as a manager.\n\n(01:05:05):\nBut my mantra that almost always leads in the best direction is serve the business, not the people meaning everyone is better off if this company is wildly successful. Everyone looks smart and makes lots of money or whatever if this company grows and does what we all dream it can. So, at the end of the day, the best decisions, the ones that are always going to be right are the ones that are like, \"How do we do the right thing for this business?\" And it also helps in political situations. Someone's acting weird or their Bob is raging all over the company, technically, everyone has the same goal. The goal is to build the biggest business possible, that's the answer. The answer is always what's the right thing for the business. And the people stuff can fall away when you actually focus on what's the right thing for the business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:55):\nA really useful tool to do that that I learned from my manager is to think about, when you're trying to decide whether to fire someone or change a project even though it's going to upset someone, is to say, \"Okay, if there were no emotions involved, if this person had no negative reaction to this, what would I do?\"\n\nMolly Graham (01:06:15):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:16):\nAnd then that's the thing you should do and then you just do it. And then the question is how do I communicate this to them where their pain is lowest essentially.\n\nMolly Graham (01:06:16):\nIn the kindest way possible.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:27):\nIn the kindest way possible. And because, to your point, if you optimize for the other thing of making people feel good, everything just falls apart, they're going to suffer even more down the road.\n\nMolly Graham (01:06:38):\nYeah, absolutely. Direct is kind. And it feels kind or, really, honestly, easy to avoid these things or to work around them or to not but, at the end of the day, it's basically just a drag, the barnacle thing. It drags on your company, on your time, on your energy, et cetera.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:58):\nYeah. But again, very hard to do in real life to do the thing that's hard and cause someone to be sad and upset and frustrated and maybe leave.\n\nMolly Graham (01:07:08):\nIt is so hard and all these things are muscles, you get better at ... They don't become easy, it's not like anybody who's like, \"Oh, it's so ... I enjoy firing people,\" no, but you recognize it faster and you are like, \"Oh, I need to go do this.\" And that is actually ... It's a practice and something that you need to practice to become the kind of leader that leads these long-enduring companies.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:32):\nYeah. And this tool of thinking, asking what would I do if there were no emotions involved and this person wouldn't be upset, it helps you realize, okay, I see, this actually doesn't make sense to just do it the easy way right now because it doesn't make sense.\n\nMolly Graham (01:07:46):\nYeah, it strips away. It strips away the emotions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:50):\nSomething else I wanted to make sure we spent a little time on is you have another tidbit along these lines which is around putting most of your energy into high performers versus spending all your time people that need help, talk about that.\n\nMolly Graham (01:08:02):\nAs a leader, as a manager, you're running these teams and someone's struggling and it's very easy to get dragged into that and to end up spending a huge amount of energy on it but high performers are actually the future of your company. And if you think about it and if you've spent time on it, those are the folks where, if you invest your time and energy in them, you're going to get the 10x return that people talk about all the time in Silicon Valley. But what I've witnessed is that most people have a high performer and they just leave them alone, they're like, \"That person's doing well so I'm just going to let them do their thing.\" And what I do when I have a high performer that's my favorite thing in the world is invest time and energy in them and basically build a whole system of working with them that is designed to draw out potential. And I would say there's two things here, one is it's really important to realize that our tendency-\n\nMolly Graham (01:09:00):\nThere's two things here. One is it's really important to realize that our tendency is to actually spend time on low performers and it is not a good use of your time. See the point about firing people. But the other thing is that actively investing in and developing high performers is something that's important to get good at as a leader because that is how you create these little rocket ships that end up... You'll manage someone who's just like a project manager and all of a sudden they're running a whole function inside the company eventually, but it's because you took time and energy to invest in them. And my basic way of doing that, not to... I could spend a long time on this, but I would just say is I run experiments. I basically develop a theory about someone, \"I think this person is capable of this kind of thing.\" And then piece by piece, it doesn't have to be a whole job or whole project. It can just be an incremental experiment, \"I'm going to see if they can do this with less guidance or support from me.\"\n\n(01:09:52):\nI'm going to give them a bigger project. I'm going to give them something with more visibility. I'm going to manage them less, oversee them less, whatever. All of those are experiments to basically test your theory and deepen your theory in terms of this person's potential and their ability to help the company. And you're basically, for me, what I'm doing is deeply getting to know that person and then trying to pair them with company needs. What do we need? This person is great at zebra farming. Where do we need zebra farming? So how do I get them working on bigger and bigger and more and more critical things?\n\n(01:10:27):\nAnd to be honest, this is what people have done for me. At Facebook in particular, I've benefited from people being like, \"Ooh, come help me with this thing.\" They saw potential in me and they asked me to help with something and it unlocked a huge amount for me. And so, it is such a powerful tool for getting more out of people that might be a little bit stuck if you leave them in this box. But if you start to expand the box, you can really unlock people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:55):\nSo speaking of high performers, you've worked with many very high performing founder-CEOs. He worked really closely with Zuck, with Cheryl Sandberg, with Larry and Sergei at Google, with Brett Taylor, who I just... Just like you trying to read his resume, it takes three lines of things he's done over the course of his career. And so I just want to spend a little time on what are some things you've learned, maybe a few things you've learned from them, that group that you find yourself sharing with other people most.\n\nMolly Graham (01:11:26):\nThat list is very long, but I'll give you a couple. The first one that I think is kind of counterintuitive is... So I said I worked at Facebook. I worked on culture, which is one of those words that doesn't really mean anything. So I define it as the way we do things around here. And I thought my job was to shape the culture. I thought it was to push the culture. And the most humbling lesson I learned is 80% of the culture of a company is literally defined by the personality of the founder. Facebook is Mark. Google is Larry and Sergei. Google, when I was there, it felt like a university. It's where ideas are more important in a lot of ways than what's shipped. And there's a campus and they basically wanted people to live there when I was there. It was designed to basically be a two PhD students' paradise.\n\n(01:12:29):\nFacebook felt like a 19-year-old hacker's dorm room when I was there. And it was shipping above all and all else. And it seeped with Mark's DNA. And I spent ages trying to create various changes inside the company or trying to push a point. And Mark would say literally one thing in an all hands, and it was like somebody threw a boulder into the pond. So our job as operators or as leaders around founders is to help articulate the culture that they're creating and to help extend it. My version of founder mode, which I know you've spent some time on on this podcast is your job is to build a company that would make a decision the way the founder would when they're not in the room. That is the work of building a company around a founder, but your job is not to shape culture.\n\n(01:13:24):\nThat is mostly defined by the literal personality strengths and weaknesses of the person at the top. And that's been true of Mark and it's been true of Brett. Everywhere I go, that's who it is. You don't need a consulting firm to tell you, just go do a personality diagnosis on your founder. And the weaknesses thing is real. I've seen and watched friends try to shape a set of values at a company and it just doesn't match who the founder is. You say, \"Move fast and break things,\" or whatever your version of that is. And your founder loves ambiguity and is perfectly happy with not making decisions. All that leads to is cultural dissonance. It leads to people being like, \"Wait, what? I thought we said we care about moving fast and making aggressive decisions and it turns out...\" So being really careful about what you say, because what people actually feel when it comes to culture is what you do and how you act every day.\n\n(01:14:18):\nYou can never write anything down and you will still have a culture. It will be created through the actions and the decisions that you make and that your founder makes. So that would be a huge one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:28):\nLet me spend a little more time on this because this is so good. So all this advice on culture and it feels so true based on everything I've seen. So tip one there is just you can't really change the culture. Maybe there's a little bit on the edges you could adjust. It will come down and trickle down from the founder, CEO probably mostly, but just the founders in general.\n\nMolly Graham (01:14:49):\nAnd founder-CEO is probably the single biggest.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:49):\nFounder-CEO.\n\nMolly Graham (01:14:52):\nCo-founders, it depends a lot on the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:56):\nAwesome.\n\nMolly Graham (01:14:57):\nI think Stripe is probably very much like Patrick and John, but it's not every co-founder that has that level of power [inaudible 01:15:03].\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:03):\nAwesome. And then the way you describe culture, I think it's the way Seth Godin talks about it too, who's also been on the podcast. How cool is that?\n\nMolly Graham (01:15:09):\nSo cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:10):\nHe said, \"Culture is...\" And what you said, \"Culture is the way we do things around here. That's what culture is, is how we...\" That's how people describe your culture is, \"The way we do things around here.\"\n\nMolly Graham (01:15:22):\nI ran culture, whatever the hell that means, at Facebook for a hot second. I literally haven't done a values exercise since. And it sounds crazy, right? Because in theory, I know how to do this stuff. I don't really know how to do this stuff. But for me, the point is process and systems and how do we make decisions? That's where culture actually lives. It is what you do. It's how you hire. It's how you fire. It's who you don't hire. It's all of those decisions. That is culture. So whenever I'm working with a company or building a company, that's what I'm focused on, not on what's the shiny word that we're putting on the wall. You know what I mean?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:54):\nYeah. So the way you're describing is, as you said, it's what you do. It's not what you say?\n\nMolly Graham (01:15:59):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):\nAwesome. Keep going.\n\nMolly Graham (01:16:04):\nI'll give you two more that are helpful. This one is a Mark Zuckerberg classic, but he has this very strong feeling that people don't escalate enough. And he was very adamant about it at Facebook. And he brought it to CZI too where he was like, \"Escalation is a tool.\" And he's like, \"People get stuck. They get stuck with two people with equal power trying to solve a problem. You can spend so much time bashing heads, going back and forth. And actually what you just need to do is go up. You need to go.\" The problem is that we think of escalation as, \"I'm A and B and I are disagreeing. And so, I'm going to go up to C and tell on B. I'm going to go tattle to the teacher.\" That is not what escalation is. What escalation is, \"We disagree. Neither one of us has enough power to make this decision. Let's go to someone who does.\" My boss, my boss's boss, whoever it is.\n\n(01:16:59):\nAs soon as you are stuck, escalate. Go together, go make your case to whoever it is, go together up. That is unlocking. It's saving you a whole bunch of time. And it's something that I've found as I've worked with companies and leaders in Glue Club. It's not a muscle that's very comfortable for people, but it's so smart. And Mark has a lot of these, but that one I really took away because again, I think so many people think of escalation as bad, a failure, like, \"I failed, so I had to escalate.\" No, it's a tool. It's what management is for. They're there to unblock you. Let them unblock you. Stop arguing over something you can't decide.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:36):\nAnd they'll be so happy knowing you did not waste a week debating this and then just arguing and just looking at data. It's like, \"Okay, I can just tell you exactly what we should do. Let's go do that.\"\n\nMolly Graham (01:17:44):\nExactly. You lack context or you lack power. And then the last one actually is from Cheryl Sandberg, who I learned an enormous amount from, huge, was like going to business school without going to business school working with her. But I say it a lot right now, so I'm going to say it on your podcast so maybe some people will hear me. Growing more than 100% every year is a bad idea. The happiest growth rate is 50%, 100% is manageable. Anything more than doubling and you are signing yourself up for a world of pain. And I have seen this over and over and over again. I had to scream way louder about it five years ago than I do now because we've been through collectively a lot of pain and a lot of layoffs. And obviously the combination of 2021 and then AI has led us to talk about unit economics and scaling with tools, not people.\n\n(01:18:47):\nBut I still see companies and I'm still talking to founders that are like, \"Yeah, we're 50 people and we're going to be 150 people next year.\" And I'm like, \"Could you possibly do that with 100 people?\" But here's what basically happens if you grow at more than 100%, which is you're growing too fast to de-dupe all the issues. So somebody posts this role, it actually turns out that that role is also being hired for on this other team. So you're hiring two people who more or less have the same job description and are assigned to the same number or the same problem, but nobody talked to each other. And those two people both show up and they're like, \"I am doing this.\" And the person's like, \"Wait, I thought I was doing that.\" Anyway, so then you've got all this... And think about all the time and all the energy and all the money that goes into de-duping that.\n\n(01:19:32):\nIf you slow down, if you hire for quality and for real need versus the panic hiring, whatever your sales model spits out or whatever, you'll actually find leverage. You find, \"Oh, I didn't need that person,\" or, \"I didn't need this whole team,\" or, \"I didn't need this whole function,\" or, \"I can wait for that.\" So slow down. And again, these are all just guidelines in terms of the 50% is happy and 100% is manageable. But having seen enough of this, I can tell you these are good rules and you should pay attention to them. And sometimes you're like, \"I have to double or I have to more than double or I have to triple,\" or whatever. I'm like, \"Okay, just ask a whole lot of questions as you open roles. Ask a whole lot of questions as you hire because you will find duplication, you will find chaos coming in the front door.\"\n\n(01:20:16):\nMore people does not actually make you faster. Do you know what I mean? We think it does. It does not. It makes it harder. It makes it harder to get work done. It makes it slower. So you should be scared of adding people, not like, \"Oh, this is the answer to all my problems.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:27):\nAmazing. And just to be clear, you're talking about the growth of the company. So doubling in a year, bad idea. It's possible, but you're saying it's going to be very hard and painful and probably a really bad idea.\n\nMolly Graham (01:20:40):\nYeah. More than doubling head count growth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):\nMore than doubling.\n\nMolly Graham (01:20:40):\nGreat point.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:40):\nHead count?\n\nMolly Graham (01:20:42):\nYes, exactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:43):\nAwesome. It's-\n\nMolly Graham (01:20:44):\nPlease feel free to do whatever you want with your business.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:47):\nJust advice. This is top of mind because I just had the interview with Matt McGinnis, but so much of what he talked about is this resonates with what you're talking about. He talked a lot about under-resourcing your team-\n\nMolly Graham (01:20:59):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:59):\nLeads to much better outcomes because people don't work on the low priority stuff. They focus on only high priority stuff. And the other is this idea of escalating. He talked a lot about that. Just like, \"Escalation is good. Tell me when there's something I can help with, please. I'm here waiting constantly-\n\nMolly Graham (01:21:14):\nThere you go.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:14):\n\"To help.\"\n\nMolly Graham (01:21:14):\nYeah, 100%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:16):\nAmazing. So maybe for a final question, one of your former colleagues, Eric Antonow, who's just this epic dude that few people know about-\n\nMolly Graham (01:21:16):\nTotally.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:24):\nThat I've chatted with over the last few months because he knows so many people that come on this podcast. He's a former Facebook person, now at OpenAI. I asked him what I should ask you about and he told me something really insightful about you. He said that you had this really massive growth spurt at Facebook, which you shared and talked about. And then after you leaving, you had this huge ambition to become COO, CEO, become this huge big deal boss person, just take over the world. And then he noticed your ambitions significantly pivot to working on community building and helping people with their careers. And you turned down really big C-level role opportunities. And the way he described it is you were a dog that once thought you were cat. And the other metaphor he used is you change from AC current to DC current, which I don't know exactly what that means. So does this resonate? And if so, just what happened there?\n\nMolly Graham (01:22:22):\nEric is actually better at metaphors than I am, and I regularly rip his metaphors. But yes, Eric Antonow, the least well-known, but most brilliant person in my life. So I gave a talk at a company recently and somebody asked the question, \"What's something you've changed your mind about?\" And I was like, \"Woof.\" But I actually talked about this because... So my brain is developing this model that is not done yet, but it's basically this idea that everybody has a proving phase to their career where you're proving to yourself and probably to your parents and some other people that you're good at stuff. You're like, \"I'm going to prove.\" And it's an important phase because you need to learn. All the stuff we talked about. You need to learn what you're good at. You need to learn that you are good at things and that people should hire you for things and what are those things?\n\n(01:23:22):\nBut part of that phase is also doing what you think matters, what you think you should do. Family programming or career books tell you this is what you should do, titles and all that stuff. And then, I think everybody has a moment and I think this moment varies wildly in terms of when it hits people, where you hit some sort of wall or I don't know what it is, speed bump, something, and the world forces you to say, \"Okay, I've proven myself and I'm good at this thing. What do I want to do with it?\" And for me, I spent 10 or 15 years proving to myself and to others that I was really good at this thing, basically working with brilliant founders to help bring their vision to life, \"That's what you should hire me to do.\" That's what I was known for.\n\n(01:24:20):\nAnd it turned out that that wasn't what I love doing anymore. And it was really, really hard to walk away from because there was a lot of shoulds. It was like, \"You should take this job with this fancy title. People are going to think you're so cool.\" And you get to... I call it a LinkedIn crush where you're really excited to post the job on LinkedIn, but you're deeply unexcited about doing the job. So you have all these LinkedIn crushes and you're like... And I vividly remember this one job that I turned down where I had to go for many walks. And what I was repeating over and over again to myself was, \"What does this get you that you don't already have? What does this get you that you don't already have?\" And I think, for me, it was this realization that these things that fed me early in my career just didn't feed me anymore, that I didn't get joy and excitement out of doing these jobs anymore, and I wasn't scared.\n\n(01:25:20):\nSo it led me actually on a very long, windy journey, a founder journey, even though I have trouble with that title, just like the influencer title, to figure out what I wanted to build. And what I would've told you I wanted to build three years ago is actually not what I'm doing today, but through a lot of really fun experiments and a journey that never ends, what I've discovered is that what I love doing is building safe spaces for leaders to learn and grow, but also to find sanity and connection in a world that's kind of insane, whether it's working in a startup or some other kind of insanity, but that feeds me and there's nothing I love more than that, and I could not have told you that three years ago, but, to Eric's point, it really took a lot of work to switch currents or switch myself from a dog to a cat or whatever his metaphor is. And I think it's the work of it's ongoing work, but it's that thing of what do I want versus what do I think people expect of me?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:32):\nThere's so much depth there. This could be another entire podcast conversation talking through this journey, but I'm going to close with a note from your partner, Sarah. She told me that she has this sticker on her notebook with three pieces of advice that you gave her when she started at OpenAI. Get to know your customer, they have the answer; be patient because everything is going to change; and just keep trying. So just as a final question, is there anything along those lines that you think might be helpful for people to hear or is there anything else you want to share or leave listeners with?\n\nMolly Graham (01:27:07):\nPart of what I think is so important to realize inside of scaling and changing companies and the world is some things will always be true. And part of what I was saying to Sarah in the \"get to know the customer, they have the answer\" is, whatever bullshit is going on around you and whatever walls and ceiling are being rearranged this week, the customer is never going to change. That's a thing that will never change. And I think finding those immovable objects, those compasses in the face of a storm, which being inside of a scaling company in a startup feels like a tornado. And I think OpenAI is extra special on that front. You have to find these guiding lights that get you through that storm. And I think it's sort of the same thing as \"Serve the business, not the people.\" What are the things that will always be true? We are here to do this. We are here to serve the customer.\n\n(01:28:09):\nAnd then the other piece of the three things that she wrote down is, I think that we, as humans, we seek stability. Our brains would like things to stop changing. We would like things to stay the same. And that is just not a reality inside of companies that are growing and changing as fast as OpenAI or a lot of the companies today that are being built. So actually, you need to start to expect instability. You need to start to just assume things are going to change. Assume you're going to have a new boss in six months. I talk about this a lot when I talk to folks at OpenAI, \"You need to stop expecting that anything's going to be the same in six months or a year. You will have a different job. You will have a different boss.\"\n\n(01:28:55):\nHow do you prepare for that? Do you know what I mean? How do you almost see the instability as stability because it's the only thing that is definitely going to be true. And part of that is to just keep going. You know what I mean? To just find these lights and these compasses or whatever metaphor sticks with you and focus on those because whatever is happening around you, you just got to keep moving forward and keep learning as much as you can because that's the real opportunity. Whatever happens to the company, however successful it is, all that you take away from it... I always say all that you take away from it is people that like working with you and want to work with you again and what you learned. That's it. You might hopefully take a bunch of money, but you might not. So people and what you learned, that's it. Focus on that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:41):\nIt's all about the friends you made along the way. That old line is true. Oh, man. Molly, I feel like we've gone for so long and we've just scratched the surface. I'd love to have you back to go deeper on a lot of this stuff. I'm going to skip the lightning round because we've gone long and I want to keep people from having to listen to more. So I'm just going to end with, what should people know about what you're working on? Where can people go find you online? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nMolly Graham (01:30:07):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn and you can find me on Substack. I have a Substack called Lessons that I'm slowly trying to turn into a community where we can talk about things, the real stuff. And you can find me at Glue Club, which, if you're a leader inside of one of these crazy companies that's changing all the time, we can be a great home for you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:26):\nWhat's the URL there just for folks to check out?\n\nMolly Graham (01:30:27):\nIt's glueclub.com.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:28):\nGlue, G-L-U-E?\n\nMolly Graham (01:30:31):\nG-L-U-E.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:30:32):\nC-L-U-B.com. Great.\n\nMolly Graham (01:30:34):\nYeah, exactly. And in terms of people, what people can do to be useful to me, I love helping leaders with problems. I really get a lot of energy out of unsticking people and helping people feel supported and seen and helping them grow. I do that through Glue Club. So if you're a leader that feels like you want some sanity and some support in the face of whatever tornado you're in, that's a great place to come. But the same is true of Substack. So if Glue Club isn't for you, come on over to Substack. I've opened up a bunch of channels to just talk about stuff, listen to people's problems, answer questions because I love helping people. And I think it's a complicated moment right now to be a leader and to figure out which way is up. So come on over.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:24):\nAmazing. Molly, thank you so much for being here.\n\nMolly Graham (01:31:27):\nThank you, Lenny. This was really fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:29):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

Just give us a picture of what the people are like.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:05):\nI feel like they screened really hard for a few traits in particular. One is like very independent-minded people who weren't afraid to push back. Two is people with broader intellectual interests.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:15):\nWhat's the difference between, say, a PM at Palantir versus a traditional PM?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:18):\nThey were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deployed engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way. There's two types of engineer at Palantir. So, there's one that works on the core product and they're a traditional software engineer. There was a different type of engineer which you sent into the field. You would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there and so, that engineer became known as a forward deployed engineer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:51):\nWhat's something that you believe that most other people don't?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:00:54):\nI think this is a somewhat contrarian view within tech.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:58):\nToday, my guest is Nabeel Qureshi. Nabeel is a founder, a writer, a researcher, and an engineer. He was recently a visiting scholar researching AI policy at the Mercatus Center alongside Tyler Cowen. At one point, he worked with the National Institute of Health and major clinical centers to create the largest medical data set in the world. He worked at the Bank of England for a bit. He was founding member and VP of Business Development at GoCardless, one of Europe's biggest financial technology unicorns.\n\n(00:01:23):\nAnd most related to the topic of this conversation, Nabeel spent almost eight years at Palantir as a forward deployed engineer working on public health projects with US federal agencies, including public health services during the COVID-19 response and applied AI in drug discovery. Whether you are a fan of Palantir or hate everything that they do, they are an important and fast-growing company that is pumping out incredible product leaders, as you'll hear more than any other company in the world. So, it is worth studying and understanding.\n\n(00:01:52):\nI've never heard an in-depth conversation digging into how they operate, build product, hire, and were able to scale from a primarily services business to a software business. So, I am very excited to bring you this inside look. In our conversation, we go deep into what the heck does Palantir even do, why getting good at managing lots of data is an underappreciated secret to their success, a look at the unique forward deployed engineer role that they innovated, and what other companies can borrow from their insights here. Also, how they hire and how they build amazing product leaders, plus a ton of advice on talking to customers, building products, and starting companies.\n\n(00:02:26):\nIf you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube.

Glad to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:14):\nIn our chat today, I want to zero in on a post that you recently wrote where you shared your reflections on your time at Palantir. You spent something, maybe just under eight years there. The reason I'm really interested in Palantir is I've been doing a bunch of research recently looking into which companies hire the best product managers and create the best product managers, and Palantir just keeps coming up over and over in the work that I'm doing.\n\n(00:05:37):\nSo, I'll share a few stats real quick. I looked at which companies produce the most founders, especially out of their PM team, and Palantir is, by far, number one. 30% of PMs that leave Palantir start a company. And number two is 18% and that's Intercom. So, that stat, I looked at which companies PMs that leave get immediately promoted in their next role, Palantir is number one of all companies in the world.\n\n(00:06:02):\nI looked at which companies' PMs become the first PM at another startup that they join, Palantir is number two in the world. And then I looked at which companies alumni PMs become heads of Product down later in their career, Palantir is number three in the world. Also, just the company is doing extremely well. It's worth, I think, something like $200 billion these days. So, there's a lot to learn from Palantir.\n\n(00:06:27):\nI actually want to start a question that I imagine every employee at Palantir constantly gets that, and I still don't think people totally have an answer in their head. What does Palantir do?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:06:38):\nThat's a great question. You started off with an easy one, Lenny. So, Palantir is, the way I describe it, is they achieve outcomes for their customers very tactically. The way they do that tends to be through a data platform. So, they have what I consider to be the world's best data platform, and I can go into what that means in a second. And then there's a couple of different versions of this. So, there's one that's optimized for intelligence and defense use cases that one is called Gotham. And then there's one that's more optimized for commercial use cases and that one's called Foundry.\n\n(00:07:12):\nAnd that's the classic explanation of what they do. So, they sell a data platform. They typically work with very large customers is the other thing. So, it's going to be Fortune 50. It's going to be governments around the world. It's going to be those kinds of customers. So, that's the capsule answer, but there's lots to unpack in there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:07:32):\nAwesome. Okay, and we're going to touch on a lot of this stuff, including the data piece. I want to start with talking about just the people and the culture of Palantir. You shared a bunch of really funny stories of what it's like to come to work and even interview at Palantir. There's a story you shared where because maybe the co-founder, you're walking by and he's chewing ice, and that's some benefits to cognition. Just give us a picture of what the people are like, especially early days Palantir and the culture and how unique it might seem.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:07:58):\nYeah, it's definitely, it's an add-a-one company. I don't know how else you would start this company if you were not somebody like Peter Thiel. And so far as, it seems like there was a point at which they owned a silly fraction of the office space in Palo Alto. So, you'd walk around Palo Alto and there would just be Palantir hoodies, Palantir buildings everywhere and so on.\n\n(00:08:21):\nAnd so, I feel like what happened at some point is they raised a lot of money and they resorted to all these really interesting ways of just getting top talent out of places like Stanford and other top schools and just people who knew the founders who tended to be very interesting intellectual people. And I feel like they screened really hard for a few traits in particular. So, I would say one is very independent-minded people, people who weren't afraid to push back, who questioned the frame of everything and thought for themselves and had strong convictions.\n\n(00:08:55):\nTwo is just people with broader intellectual interests. Karp just released a new book and he's quoting Habermas and all these European intellectuals and just things you don't typically see a tech CEO do. And so, I think there's that intellectual strand in the company. And then yeah, I think three is just people who are very intensely competitive. There's a sort of win at all costs mentality to the company. And so, I think those were the set of traits that were this gravity while in California at a certain time. And so, you just had a lot of really fascinating people joining the company at that time.\n\n(00:09:33):\nThe way they screened for this was interesting too. So, for the longest time, they had... Everyone does this now, I think, but at the time, it was a little bit rarer, is a founder had to interview you in order for you to receive an offer. And so, a founder, it could have been Alex Karp, it could have been Stephen Cohen. Earlier on, it might have been somebody like Joe Lonsdale, but it was always one of these people.\n\n(00:09:54):\nAnd the interviews were pretty strange. With Stephen, it would be, you'd be chatting about philosophy for an hour and a half and it would very much just be like he would pick a topic out of thin air. It was impossible to prepare for, and then he would just go very, very deep and try and test the limits of your understanding. But it would really just be a fun conversation and then if you pass the vibe check, you'd be in. And so, there was that strong selection mechanism.\n\n(00:10:20):\nThere was also the question of, I think it might have been Thiel who mentioned this, but he thinks that a lot of the best recruiters in the world or the companies that attract talent, they put out this distinctive bad signal and it has to turn some people off. That's the key of a good, bad signal. So, I think in the present day, OpenAI and Anthropic, they're both sucking up some of the best talent that you and I know. And I think one way they do do that, and they are sincere in this, but they do really attract people who are almost messianic about the potential of artificial super intelligence and who really believe this is the only thing that matters and it is going to be the biggest thing in the world.\n\n(00:10:56):\nI think Palantir's version of that was that they were quite focused on things like preserving the West. There was a slogan of Save the Shire, right? So, they were talking about military and defense and intelligence and the importance of that well before everybody else. And bear in mind, this was during the era when it was social, mobile, local apps. You had, social media was on the rise. You had, the hot companies were Facebook and Pinterest and things like that. And so, this was, at the time, a very strange thing.\n\n(00:11:26):\nAnd so, I think to be drawn to that, you had to look at the other options and say, \"Well, this is fine, but what am I really doing in life?\" Whereas you had this other place that was like, \"Hey, come solve the hardest, messiest problems in the world with us.\" And I think just at that time, that really drew some really good people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:43):\nWe're going to talk about the reasons people don't necessarily like Palantir and the moral question of what they do, but when people look at a company that is like... I guess OpenAI, to your point, is a good example where they're just so turned off by maybe their approach. What you're missing is that's potentially intentional because it actually draws in the people they really want.\n\n(00:12:03):\nIt makes me think about, I was involved in creating the core values at Airbnb and something that we learned at going through that process is, when you define the values for your company, it's really important to clarify who this is not for, exactly as you described, which feels unnatural. Like, \"Oh, we want to be inclusive, we don't want to make people feel like they don't belong.\" But the whole idea is to be clear on here's who will thrive here and here's who's aligned with our mission. And what I'm hearing is Palantir and these companies take it to the extreme.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:12:30):\nA hundred percent, yeah. On my team at Palantir, one process that we followed, I could talk about this more if it's interesting, is when you started a new project, you basically had to organize what they called a murder board for it. I think this is originally an army type. So, the idea is, basically, you write up a two-page plan for the project. You invite three or four smart folks who don't know anything about the project and their job is just to tear apart your plan.\n\n(00:12:56):\nAnd so, you have to write, here's the vision for this, here are the goals, here are the tactics over the next three months. And one section was principles that you're following for this project. And I remember giving this advice a lot was just like when people joined, they would write principles such as move fast and I would always be, \"Everyone likes to move fast.\" It is not a good principle actually because nobody can really disagree with this reasonably. You need something that actually a lot of people are going to go, \"Why are you taking this principle? This seems wrong to me.\" So, you need something that people can disagree with.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:29):\nI want to come back to the beginning of what you described of what they look for, what Palantir looks for in people. You talked about independent-minded, a lot of interests, broad interests, and competitive. First of all, I think a lot of people hearing that, especially the last part, be like, \"I don't want to work there.\" Why does this work? Because this isn't naturally what you would think of as how you build the most amazing, productive team.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:13:52):\nI think it just draws people who want to win. I think that's what was really important. The other piece of it, I think, is that there's actually, and this was much truer 10 years ago, is there was a lot of talent that was a little bit outside of the tech ecosystem but could easily have been very successful within it. So, people who got out of the military or one of the intelligence agencies and they were doing, let's say, an MBA somewhere to transition into the corporate world. And I think, typically, they would have taken a position at a classic Fortune 500 corporation. And actually, Palantir managed to get a bunch of that talent. And at the time, that was very undervalued.\n\n(00:14:32):\nThe people who succeed the most in the Marines or the Special Forces or whatever it is, tend to be pretty smart people. They tend to have accomplished very difficult goals in very hostile environments. And it turns out that when you're starting a somewhat chaotic tech company, that's actually a very useful skill to have. Again, I think more companies are doing this now, so Scale AI and et cetera. But at the time, that was a very differentiated talent pool.\n\n(00:14:57):\nAnd so, I think having those values as opposed to maybe the values that were more in fashion then, so talking about how inclusive you are, or the sushi that you serve at lunch, or whatever it is, it just drew a very different crowd. And I think the game that was being played there was, one, it's mission alignment. You're doing a defense company, that's the kind of person you want to attract. But I think there's also, two, which is just what is the talent that maybe is a little bit undervalued now and how do you actually draw those people to you? And I think that game is always shifting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:31):\nThis is definitely starting to explain why so many Palantir alumni go on to start companies and become leaders at other companies. These are leaders that you're hiring. So, it feels like a lot of it is just the talent you hire are people that are naturally leaders.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:15:45):\nI think you're right, and we can get more into it, but I think there was also a very concrete set of ways where that place was a training ground for founders. I even think it turned a lot of people who might not have become founders into good founders because of the way it works. So, I think there was a selection effect there, but there is also some training effect too, but it's unique to the way the company works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:08):\nAnd is that along the lines of the forward deployed engineer stuff or is that something else?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:16:11):\nIt is that, yes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:12):\nOkay, cool. We're going to get to that. I love it. Okay, amazing. Before we do that, one last thing is something I've seen is that you guys at Palantir don't really have titles. Everyone's the same level and just generic titles for everyone. Talk about that. Why do you think that was important? Why was that useful?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:16:29):\nI don't know this for sure, but I do know that Thiel writes about this in Zero to One and his take is just that as soon as we have these title, you have a thing that people are competing for and then you get these very unproductive conflicts. You get people optimizing to game the system. You get Goodhart's law everywhere. So, it's like you have a metric and then people basically manage to the metrics.\n\n(00:16:50):\nI don't want to pick on any one company, but if you take Google, for example, there's a lot of interesting posts by people who left Google and they cite this as a reason why they got a little bit disgruntled, is that there's a way to get promoted. Rather than, let's say, improving an existing product, what you do is you start a completely new product and that has your name attached to it. And then when it comes to promotion season, you could say, \"Hey, I did this new thing.\" And then boom, you have a new Google product, but it's maybe confusing to the end user.\n\n(00:17:15):\nSo, I think they wanted to avoid all these kinds of dynamics. And so, the way that they did that was they said, \"Well, titles are not going to be this memetic totem that everybody competes for. Instead, everyone is just going to have the same slightly meaningless title, which is forward deployed engineer.\" And the only people who did have titles were the CEO and then there were six directors and that was it. And now, I think it's a little bit more nuanced. There are different teams. There are some people with titles, but honestly, it was almost like...\n\n(00:17:45):\nWe used to joke about it. It's like people would leave the company and then you'd see them update their LinkedIn and they would be like, \"Oh yeah, I was totally the SVP of XYZ.\" And it's like, \"No, you weren't. You're just...\" But then it's like I totally understand it too because when you leave the company, you have to make your experience legible to the next person. And so, guess what? Things like SVP actually do matter.\n\n(00:18:08):\nAnd so, yeah, I think they wanted to avoid this intel competition. There are downsides to doing this. So, maybe the competition isn't as explicit around a specific title, but instead, what it becomes about is there's a particular exact or something and you want to gain that favor. And so, it becomes more about who can get in the inner circle of this person or whatever. And there were those dynamics too.\n\n(00:18:32):\nI actually am a big fan of this philosophy though, the no titles one. I think what it did do is that it basically said if you are in, let's say you're in a role of you're leading a very important project, which could happen, what it said was... This is always fluid. So, you are in this role because you're very good and so, it's a meritocratic thing. But if you start performing well, it's actually very easy to shift that because there is no explicit \" I am the GM of this project title.\" And so, you always had to earn your place in the company. You always had to earn the right to work on what you were working on, and I think that was a good side effect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:12):\nLet's start talking about forward deployed engineers. What is a forward deployed engineer?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:19:17):\nSo, the way this originated was, basically, you can think of it as there's two types of engineer at Palantir. So, there's one that works on the core products. So, they don't necessarily leave the building in Palo Alto or New York or the offices. They're very much working on the core products and they're a traditional software engineer.\n\n(00:19:35):\nBecause of the way the company works where you had these very large engagements with these large entities, there was a different type of engineer which you sent into the field. So, what that meant was you would spend maybe Monday to Thursday and you would actually go into the building where the customer worked and you would work alongside them. You would literally get a desk there. And so, that engineer became known as a forward deployed engineer.\n\n(00:19:55):\nSo, within the company, that function is known as business development or BD. And then PD is product development. So, it's where the product is made. And so, within BD, you had forward deployed engineers. There are actually two types. So, there is one that it's a more technical software engineer. So, you have to pass a software engineering interview and prove your chops there and you would typically have a CS degree, but there was actually a type of forward deployed engineer that didn't have that. So, you would still get a technical interview, but it would be less about, do you know the specifics of this C++ algorithm? And it would be more about just like can you reason about data? We didn't have that division originally, but it turns out that there's a lot of people who are technical adjacent, shall we say, who you really need in the room when you're working with these large organizations or these large companies, because translating what you're doing into language that would resonate with an executive or being able to navigate the social dynamics in a room, all these are very valuable skills. And so, the hiring criteria there were a little different. It was a bit more about, are you savvy as a human? But all of that was given the title of forward deployed engineer, and it's just an engineer who works with customers.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:10):\nOkay, so just to make this crystal clear for people, a lot of people hear this idea of Palantir having forward deployed engineers. A few other companies have done this. It's pretty radical. So, as you described, you basically have a desk at a company. So, you worked with Airbus and we'll talk about that. So, let's just make it real. So, you have a desk and a computer and login access and all these things at Airbus. You go to their office four times a week. You're sitting there with their employees working side by side, building a product for them, versus what most people do where \"they just talk to customers,\" where they do an interview once in a while, they do a Zoom, they share mocks, things like that. This is like that on steroids. Is that roughly the way to think about it?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:21:51):\nIt is, yeah. And so, we would really be there a lot of the time. And so, the side effect of that was, one, you learn to live and breathe the customer's problems and you learn to speak their language. And eventually, they saw you as one of them and so, you develop these really close bonds with the customers. So, at Airbus, I would be at the factory where the planes were produced, or I'd be sitting next to people diagnosing issues with aircraft or whatever it was. Similarly, later on, I worked with the NIH, which was part of the US government, and I actually had a badge there and I would work with civil servants and biologists and clinicians and people who were working there.\n\n(00:22:31):\nAnd so, it's this pretty radical thing as you suggest. I think the key thing there from a business point of view is the average deal that Palantir had was very large in the many, many millions of dollars, which means that you could pay for this as part of the thing that the customer got. And then it was priced according to the value that the customer got.\n\n(00:22:51):\nSo, as a simple example, if you're Airbus and let's say that you have an issue with one of your planes and you need to fix it, and fixing that is worth a $100 million or something to you, that's how it would be priced. It would not be priced as, \"Hey, you're buying data infrastructure and it's similar to Snowflake or Databricks or one of these other providers. It's much more anchored to, here is the outcome.\n\n(00:23:15):\nBut then the job of the forward deployed engineer is not just to deploy software. It is not just to sell software. It is to actually solve the problem. And so, you would have to be there. You would have to meet the key stakeholders who are actually in charge of reporting to the CEO about the specific issue. You would have to become their friend. You would have to gain their trust. And you would have to, in some cases, create new software such that it could actually solve the novel problem that was in front of you.\n\n(00:23:41):\nSo, I would have friends who worked with one of our energy company customers and they would have to learn the ins and outs of how oil wells work. And then out of that, it turns out that having streaming data is actually very valuable for this use case. And so, boom, suddenly, there's a product that can handle streaming data that becomes part of the core platform. But that would be the motion, is you learn about the problem. You figure out what software would best address it. You build that software. You use it to accomplish the goal. And then eventually, that gets folded into the broader product suite.\n\n(00:24:13):\nAnd so, you can start to see why this would be a good forge for founders. And this was actually part of my thesis going in and joining, was I said, \"Well, say, I got five reps of this,\" which I got more than that. But say, you got five reps of doing this in five disparate contexts, you actually become very good at this cycle of, okay, go into the building, gain the trust of the person, meet the people that are going to become your users, talk to them about their problems, make sure you're building something that actually solves them, and it's just a boondoggle.\n\n(00:24:43):\nGet really fast feedback and iteration loops. So, every week, you would have a cadence where it's like Monday, you go in. You do your meetings. Monday night, you build something. Tuesday, you show it to somebody. Tuesday, you get the feedback. Tuesday night, you iterate on it. Wednesday, you show it to somebody. Wednesday night, you iterate on it. So, you get four of these, five of these cycles every single week.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:25:00):\nIt already got it. So you get four of these, five of these cycles every single week, and you're moving incredibly fast. So 6 weeks in, you've suddenly gotten to, wow, this is really valuable, and somebody's willing to pay you whatever, $20 million for it, and boom. I think this is why you get so many founders coming out of this same process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:20):\nIt's becoming very clear why so many founders emerged out of Ballinger. Okay. So an important element of this as you described, is that the idea here is build this as a one- off solution to solve a real problem at say Airbus or some government organization. And then the idea as you create something out of that, that then Ballinger can sell to other companies. What's extra cool about that is they pay you to solve this problem for them and then that is funding this other product that Ballinger can now sell to everyone. What a cool business.\n\n(00:25:51):\nHowever, early days Ballinger, everyone thought it was just this services business or just consultants building software for companies like Airbus, there's no way they can make this a platform that works for a lot of people. Clearly, that's what's happening and it worked out. This is like the holy grail. Solve one customer's problem and then sell it to everyone else. Every SaaS business basically would love to do this. What do you think allowed them to actually achieve this and be good at this? What are some principles that worked?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:22):\nYeah. That's a great question and it's true. I think that from when I joined until maybe until IPO and a little bit after, I was told, \"Hey, isn't this basically a sparkling extension? Isn't it a consulting business lopping as a product company?\" And eventually it became undeniable. One, because I always laugh when people are like, \"What does Palantir do?\" It's like you can go onto YouTube and just search Palantir demo and you'll get plenty of demos of how the software looks. Not many people know about this, but you can go and sign up with a credit card right now and start using it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):\nI can have a Palantir account?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:22):\nYou actually can. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:22):\nI did not know that. That's cool.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:26:57):\nYeah. I think it's called AIP now. So it's not actually that mystical and there is a product, and if you look at the margins, they show that. So they have 80% plus margins, which is not really what you would get if you were actually a consulting company. It would be closer to 20 or 30%. So then your question was, well, how did they actually achieve this? I think there was just incredible talent in the product development organization, really top tier, incredible talent. And it took some really, really smart people to take the set of internal tools that we were using at the time to create value of customers and then go, what is the unified version of this? Would this look like if this were a product? And out of that process that I saw came Foundry assume there was a similar process with Gotham a while back. But basically it's like, the motion was that you would go in and early on you were basically armed with Jupyter Notebooks and some data integration stuff, but it was very primitive and you had to create value that way.\n\n(00:28:03):\nBut we kept building tooling that was useful for forward deployed engineers. So we were our own first customers and at some point there was this concept of, \"Wait, what if we take our internal tools and we let our customers use them?\" And I remember at the time, this is a really radical idea. And then Shyam Sankar, I think he's the CTO, maybe he's the president now, he just mandated like, \"Okay. Every customer deployment you have to have a customer using this within three months or whatever.\" So it was horrible at the time because these had been built for these nerdy Silicon Valley engineers, and so they weren't particularly usable. They would crash all the time. You'd have to debug spark errors or whatever it was. But basically that process brought a lot more rigor to our thinking about the product.\n\n(00:28:52):\nAnd out of that kind of, I would say three or four year process came the Foundry product. And then there was a lot of focus around things like performance and reliability and so on. That was all really painful. So yeah, I think the answer was just talent. And then there was this recognition that we do. We do know things that most people do not know about how data works in large organizations. That was the other thing. We discovered a lot of \"secrets\" in this process of living with customers for so long.\n\n(00:29:25):\nThe basic one was just data integration is massively painful inside organizations. This is very hard to understand unless you've worked in a large organization, but it's actually impossible to even now to get access to a lot of your own internal data that you need to do your job. So you'll hear stories of people being like, \"I'm trying to calculate our sales this quarter, and I had to wait six weeks for some other analytics team to get me this deliverable.\" So just knowing problems like that and being able to focus our product efforts around those problems, meant that we were able to build something generalizable there.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:00):\nOkay. There's a lot here. First of all, you talk about Gotham and Foundry. I know that we'll link to videos of people checking these out, but just what's the simplest way to understand what these two products do?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:30:10):\nSo Gotham is optimized for military and defense use cases and intel as well. I would say they both have some things in common. So they both have, I would describe this almost as a pyramid where the bottom layer is data ingestion, the middle layer is data mapping, and then the top layer is anything that's user facing. So any UI component. And then if you think of Foundry for a second, there's different tools that allow you to ingest data to it. There's different tools that allow you to easily build data pipelines and clean up data, which everybody has to do. And then there's a bunch of tooling that allows you to build compelling UIs on top, do point and click analytics, do notebook style workflows, however technical you are. So that's, I mean, when it's a platform, it's a suite of things that has a common data backing but contains a bunch of different applications.So I think that is somewhat true of Gotham as well. But when you log in, you see this unified interface.\n\n(00:31:08):\nSo what is the actual difference then? I would say with Gotham, you're looking much more at workflows like that involve maps, for example. So when you're doing a military operation, a lot of the time you are going to be looking at a map and you are going to be monitoring the movement of troops or tanks or whatever it is. Another big difference is the idea of graph-based analysis. So Gotham, one of the use cases was finding combing through networks of terrorists and basically finding the bad guys. So being able to do queries that are graph-based was important. So it's like, \"Who is everybody that Lenny called in the last week?\" Imagine all the nodes fanning out from there. And then it's like, \"Okay. Well, this one looks interesting. Let's zoom in on that. What is this person's location?\"\n\n(00:31:56):\nSo it's this very graph-based way of thinking that also applies to things like fraud. So Gotham has been deployed against fraud, but if you look at Foundry, it doesn't actually emphasize that component so much because it turns out, let's say you're a B2B SaaS company, you're probably not doing that much graph-based analysis. You're doing things that look a lot more like classic SQL queries, tables, that kind of stuff. So Foundry is a lot more traditional in that way.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:20):\nThat was an amazing explanation. For the first time, I am starting to understand what these products do. Basically, it's just sucks in a bunch of data, cleans it up so you can actually trust it and then helps you interact with it in various use cases, maps, graphs, tables.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:36):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:36):\nOkay. Amazing. The example you gave of what you worked on at Airbus, you described it as basically a sauna for making planes. Is that right?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:44):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:45):\nSo how much of that does becomes a part of this core product versus stays this one-off thing? Is it elements, that's a cool innovation, let's put that into Foundry. How does that work?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:32:55):\nThis was a really interesting story actually. So the initial problem that we came into with Airbus was that they had a new aircraft called the A350 beautiful aircraft. By the way, if you get to, I think if you fly New York to Singapore, it's often in that A350. Really nice. So it was a relatively new aircraft at the time, and their mandate to us was, \"Okay. We need to ramp up production of this really fast,\" much faster than we've ever done it before. So it's like the numbers are very approximate, but it's like, \"Okay. We're producing 4 this month, we need to do 8 the next month, 16 the month after, and so forth, and you are going to help us do it.\" So this goes back to what I was saying earlier is the mandate wasn't like, \"Hey, we need to upgrade our data infrastructure. We thought you guys would be met the list of requirements.\" It was much more just like, \"Please help us accomplish this mission. This is the big thing.\"\n\n(00:33:42):\nSo we went in, scoped out the problem. There were a bunch of different things that we could build that helped accelerate this, but one of the basic problems that we figured out was that without getting too much into the weeds, the way the factory would work, is that there's a bunch of stations and you can think of the plane as literally moving between each station and then each station would do a certain set of work on it. So initially, it's literally a big fuselage and the fuselage is sitting there and then people are doing a bunch of work orders against it. They need parts in order to do that work. And then at some point they say, \"Okay. This is ready to move to Station 31, and the plane is physically moved to the next station and then Station 31 does its next thing.\"\n\n(00:34:23):\nSo in order for the next station to do its work properly, they need to know, one, what work was done at the previous station and what work is remaining? Two is just like, if you think about this problem, not all work is going to get done on time. So things carry over to the next team, and the next team then has to... So when I'm describing this problem to you can start to visualize, okay, maybe I need some Gantt chart to this, and I need the ability to click in and say, \"Okay. What did Station 30 do and what work orders remained undone?\" And then it's like, \"Okay. For those work orders, what parts do I need and where in the factory might they be?\" So this was very, very hard to do as it is. A lot of it was just relying on people going and having conversations with other people on the factory floor, and coming from tech where it's maybe not as complicated as building aircraft, that is a phenomenally complicated process, but it is easy to see, okay, you can actually improve this problem with software.\n\n(00:35:20):\nAll that data was stored in SAP and SAP is like established software. It's good at what it does, but it's not the most user-friendly necessarily, especially if you're not an expert in how it stores data. The table names are very hard to understand and read. So one of the things we figured out was just if you can pull in these tables that may as well be written in completely alien language, the table name would just be like S3, F1_Z or something like that. And you'd have to know, okay, this is the table where the part ID is stored or something.\n\n(00:35:51):\nIf you could pull in those tables and join them in the right ways, and then just map them to human concepts that humans can understand, so things like a part a work order, an aircraft, et cetera, and basically build a hierarchy or mapping between them, then what you can do is, a user can just log in and say, \"Okay. Aircraft 79, where is that? Okay. It's at Station 31. All right. These are the work orders, et cetera.\" So you've translated it into a more human-legible thing.\n\n(00:36:16):\nSo the thing we built, I slightly flippantly described it as Asana. It's a little different. But basically that's what it did, was it gave you a unified view of, okay, this is what's going on inside the factory. This is the work that needs to be done on this particular plane. And then me today going to my job at Station 31, what work orders do I need to fulfill and where are the parts that I need to do that? So did this directly become a part of Foundry? Not exactly, because the way that other companies work is not going to be using this same set of concepts, but the overall idea of taking a bunch of tables, and then mapping them to human understandable concepts was a very powerful one.\n\n(00:36:58):\nSo this actually resulted in a big piece of Foundry now, which they call Ontology. You've probably heard this term as you've seen... If you see Palantir presentations, they always talk about Ontology. This is what they actually mean by that, is it is a set of concepts that is understandable to you as a human and you are not having to go and dig around and do. You're just able to say, \"Where is the aircraft now and where is it going next?\" So the ontology became a huge piece of Foundry. It was directly informed by the learnings that we had from building that application inside that factory. And I would say it's still a very big differentiator today. I don't think too many other companies ship this kind of stuff yet.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:41):\nWow. I love how excited you still are about this. I could see it being so fulfilling to solve this big problem. I saw a stat that I think, 4X their productivity. What was the number there?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:37:52):\nYeah. I don't recall the exact stat, but we did ramp up production, I think at least 4X that 1 year, which I mean obviously, they did this and we just helped with it. But that CEO said that we played a critical part.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:05):\nAlso, you moved to France, I think for this. That was how forward deployed you were. You lived in France for how long?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:38:09):\nYeah. I lived in France for about a year and a half. The way they built their planes is they manufacture different components around Europe. So they build the tail in Spain and the fuselage in part of the UK and Germany and so forth. So they basically ship everything to France to be assembled at the end, which you can imagine this is a very messy process. So I was mostly in France, but there would be weeks where I'd have to fly between all these countries just to figure out where things were.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:39):\nIn your post you wrote about how just the life of forward deployed engineers is pretty crazy. You just get a call sometimes like, \"Hey, you're flying to this random country tomorrow. Get ready.\" Is that just life as a forward deployed engineer?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:38:50):\nIt is. Yeah. The company had a very, I would say, aggressive attitude towards travel in the sense of when you join, you were basically told, \"Look, you have to be okay with travel. Are you okay with that?\" And the attitude, which again I think is a very founder friendly one is you need to be willing to just jump on a plane that night if that's the best thing to do for this customer and if it's going to get us to where it needs to be to win. So there were many times when it would be like, \"I need to take this cross continental flight tomorrow for this particular thing because it will be useful.\"\n\n(00:39:26):\nSo I think that's one of the takeaways for me was just being in person is so valuable when you are working with some external party, just going there for a few days and spending time with them, maybe going out for dinner. You build so much more trust than if you're trying to close a customer over Zoom or do an engagement over Zoom. It's just the vibe is completely different. So yeah, getting on a plane was a really cool part of our job for a very long time. This obviously changed around 2020 because COVID happened, the company IPO, and so there needed to be a bit more internal controls around this. But I would say pre-2020, this was a very big part of the culture.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:03):\nI'm excited to have Andrew Luo joining us today. Andrew is CEO of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Welcome, Andrew.\n\nAndrew Luo (00:40:11):\nThanks for having me, Lenny. Great to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:13):\nSo what is new with OneSchema? I know that you work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp and Vanta and Watershed. I heard you guys launched a new data intake product that automates the hours of manual work that teams spent importing and mapping and integrating CSV and Excel files?\n\nAndrew Luo (00:40:28):\nYes. So we just launched the 2.0 of OneSchema FileFeeds. We have rebuilt it from the ground up with AI. We saw so many customers coming to us with teams of data engineers that struggled with the manual work required to clean messy spreadsheets. FileFeeds 2.0 allows non-technical teams to automate the process of transforming CSV and Excel files with just a simple prompt. We support all of the trickiest file integrations, SFTP, S3, and even email.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:55):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to take this off our roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema?\n\nAndrew Luo (00:41:03):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of outages from even just a single bad record in transactions, employee files, purchase orders, you name it. Debugging these issues is often finding a needle in a haystack. OneSchema stops any bad data from entering your system and automatically validates your files, generating error reports with the exact issues in all bad files.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:24):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Andrew, thank you so much for joining me. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:41:37):\nThere's a lot of founders listening to this and a question that I'm thinking and they're probably thinking, and there's two questions here. One is how hardcore to go potentially with their own forward deployed operation. And then two is just how and a company I know is actually doing this, how far to go with one company's problem and invest in just like we are going to nail solving this one customer's problem with the hope that this is something we can abstract and sell as a big platform. So let me start there. And you're building a company, any I guess insights or advice on just how far to go down this road of we'll solve customer one's problem and we bet that this is going to be a big opportunity for a lot of other companies?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:42:20):\nSo I would say on the forward deployed piece, my friend Barry McCardel, the CEO of Hex, the analytics company, he wrote a really good post about this actually, and his take was just like, \"You probably don't need forward deployed engineers.\" It's very specific. But I think basically the thing there is you have to be willing to be quite almost wasteful. You have to be willing to invest a lot in finding the thing. And for that you just need a certain ticket size. So you need each customer's revenue to be probably in the billions of dollars. If it's below that, you're probably not looking at a traditional forward deployed engineer motion. It's something a little bit different.\n\n(00:42:59):\nSo I think one thesis that a lot of people left Palantir with and started companies around was there's a lot of customers that Palantir won't serve because maybe they're too small a ticket size. So actually you could go and do something like Palantir for those companies, but instead of charging them $5 million, you're charging them 250K. So in a scenario like that, you might still have forward deployed engineers, but they're not going to France and spending five days a week in a factory. It's more like you'll have one person and they're looking after five different customer accounts. It's more of that ratio in order to make the numbers work. So I think a lot of the principles can be abstracted from that experience, but it is a really specific sales motion that depends on a specific way of doing business.\n\n(00:43:49):\nI think to your other question, yeah, I think it's obviously something that is very hard to give a general answer to. My main thing here is just that you can definitely tell when you are just doing consulting and when you are closer to building a product. And I think the error that people make more often than not is they are actually too stuck on their own product vision. That's the mistake I've seen a little bit more actually than the other way around. If you go to an enterprise customer, and let's say you think you're doing analytics software and it turns out they don't actually care about internal analytics this much, they actually have this other massive burning problem and they don't have a good solution to it yet. I think a lot of people are unwilling to go and pivot to the big problem because they're like, \"Well, we're analytics software and so maybe this customer is a fit for our thing,\" and maybe that's the right call. In some scenarios, that is the right call. You should go find a different customer where your thing resonates more.\n\n(00:44:48):\nIn other scenarios, it's actually the right call to pivot and just put everything on that big problem instead and then go and find other customers for that thing. There's no hard and fast rule. I remember reading a really interesting post by, I think it was David Hsu from Retool who had this exact thing. I think he worked at Palantir for a while too. He said that they had the Retool product and it wasn't getting any traction at all. And then he tried an outbound email campaign where he literally just changed the subject line to build internal tools easily. And then suddenly they started getting all these replies from CTOs who were just like, \"Yeah. This is actually a huge pain point for me.\"\n\n(00:45:28):\nBut the exact same solution, they were previously framing it as, I think it was supercharged Excel or something like that, and nobody was biting. So they just changed the way they framed it and found a different set of buyers and succeeded that way. So yeah, no hard and fast rule, but I think it's always you need to have this matrix of options in your mind and be very deliberate about which one you are going with and why.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:53):\nI think your piece of advice is really important there. Usually in your experience, you're saying people index too far too? Like now, what they're asking me to do is not what I think they need or what customers will need. You're saying it's actually more likely they're right, and that's maybe where you should be focusing more versus this abstract vision and original idea you had?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:46:14):\nI think so, yeah. I think it's very hard to not be anchored to your own experience and your conceptions as a problem. And one thing I've seen in really strong founders is they're able to drop a bunch of those assumptions and almost treat a new opportunity as a completely blank slate. And then just figure out how to reshape things so that you're taking advantage of that, and that's how you don't get stuck at a local maximum.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:37):\nYour other piece of advice is also really great. So people hear this and they're like, \"We don't afford an engineer to sit at one customer prospects office and build stuff for them.\" But your point is you can have one for five different customers. They're not there full time. They bounce around, but they're... It's almost like sales engineering, just like what you call it sparkling sales where they help make it successful. I know Looker is a famous example. They think they called them forward deployed engineers. Do you know any other companies by the way, that some version of forward deployed engineers?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:47:07):\nThere's a lot. I mean, I know that the AR-Labs are hiring forward deployed engineers now, they're building forward deployed engineering teams and they could make it work, but I think there's going to be key differences. I don't see Anthropic going into an enterprise customer and building some entirely from scratch solution for them. It's going to be something that leverages the Anthropic set of products. So there's a lot of companies that have this label now, but I think what's really confusing about, it's just that it means a few different things. There's another post by Ted Mabrey who's I think the head of commercial at Palantir, and that's a very good one too, to point with those too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:47:46):\nSo say someone was, \"I want to try this sort of thing in my company,\" what would be a few bullet points if things they should get right? You're describing the spectrum of what people describe as forward deployed engineers, if they were to try to do this, what do you think they need to most do correctly for it to be successful?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:48:04):\nThe key things that made our model work well, one, they were actually real engineers who could build product themselves. That's a very big difference. I think a lot of the time companies will say, \"This person's a forward deployed engineer,\" but actually they're mostly there to be more of a solutions architect, or they're not necessarily building anything to know, but they're just listening and trying to find a way of deploying the existing product. They're not empowered to do new product. So the really radical thing Palantir said was, \"No. Go in and if you need a completely new product to do this, you can go ahead and build it.\" And I think that's really the key difference.\n\n(00:48:44):\nThe other stuff I've already mentioned, the value of being in person, and I think building close personal bonds with your customers. I do think the better founders do this anyway. They're on texting terms with their buyers, they become friends with them outside of work, and they see them as humans who they're trying to help. I think this is very motivating, gaining a really deep understanding of the business that your customers are in and knowing how those dynamics work. So a simple example might be, say hospitals in America. It's very counterintuitive to think of a hospital as a business. People think of it as it's a place where you get healthcare, but actually if you view it the way a COO or CMO views it, it's going to look very, very different too.\n\n(00:49:34):\nAs a very simple example, sorry, this is a little bit dark, but how restaurants want to turn over tables as fast as possible in order to maximize for the day? Hospitals actually want to do the same with patients. They would like to treat you and then get you out of a bed so they can free up the bed to get a new person in there. So that's not super intuitive, unless you think hard about how the revenue for that hospital works. But then once you think about it, you're like, \"This has a bunch of problems associated with it.\" And you start to go into really interesting...\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:00):\n... problems associated with it, and you start to go in really interesting directions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):\nThere's just like the words and memes, and take you a long way working and understanding it.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:05):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:10):\nOkay, so essentially the things you want to get right, make sure it's in person, make sure the person is technical, make sure they have a deep understanding of the business and the problems they're having. The technical piece is interesting with AI tools these days, making everyone technical in some sense. You could argue this is going to become more common, people can just open up Cursor, Windsurf and just start adding features.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:30):\nI think this is a really interesting thesis you've just hit on, and I expect to see a lot more startups that take advantage of that insight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:38):\nBasically it makes forward deploying engineers cheaper.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:40):\nExactly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:42):\nWhat is the current state of forward deploying engineers at Palantir? How much has it changed over the past few years? If you join now, is this still something you can do?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:50:49):\nYeah, of course. I should obviously emphasize that one, I left the company in 2023, and so this is just my personal view, I don't speak for them. I think that if you think about it, one of the metrics that the company had to measure its own success was essentially revenue per engineer, and so the more \"product leverage\" you had, the higher that number was. So if you had to throw a lot of people at every marginal problem, then you weren't doing so well at that because you're basically building a new thing every single time, and you are in effect a consulting business. If on the other hand, every time you encounter a new customer, the product turns out to be relevant to them, then great, and so this product leverage metric was actually a very unique thing and kind of a North Star for the company for the whole time I was there.\n\n(00:51:37):\nIf you reason that out, what that means is that in the early stage of the company, you will have a customer and then you might have five to 10 engineers working at that customer. And so over time you want that ratio to change. So you want it to be each customer, because the product is so powerful, maybe AI coding's gotten a lot better, each customer you only need two people, and then maybe you actually get to a point where you can have one person looking after multiple customers. And I think that's how the job has changed, is now it's a little bit more about you have multiple customers, maybe you're spending less deep time with each individual one of them, but it's a lot clearer what problem you're solving across multiple customers and you have more of a kind of defined offering.\n\n(00:52:21):\nAnd so I do think that has been a bit of a change, but the company remains a very interesting and dynamic place to be. In some sense the story's only starting, because one lens through which you can view this company is they spent 20 years basically building the mother of all data foundations for every important institution in the world, and I guess what's very valuable now that AI models are out is proprietary data that isn't public. Suddenly you have access to that and you are in a very privileged position to help your customers deploy AI in a way that makes them successful, and that solves real business problems. That is essentially the bull thesis for this company and why it's probably going to 100X again. And so it's still a really interesting time to join but I do think the nature of the ratio of people to a customer, for example, is one big difference now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:16):\nNot investment advice, but it might 100X. I totally understand why that might happen. So let's talk about the data piece, you said that this was one of the secrets of Palantir's success, this early insight into the power of ingesting data, cleaning data, being able to analyze and work with it. What a marketing share there, just what they figured out about why this is so valuable, why it's so hard and how they achieved it?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:53:40):\nI think it's just very obvious as soon as you step into a corporation and spend a couple of days there really, is you're like, all right, let's suppose your job is to increase sales, so the first thing you want to do is get a clear picture of what's going on. All right, so let me go and query the sales database. Oh wait, where's the sales database? I can't get access to this. Okay, I need to file an access ticket. All right, now I have to wait one week. And so everywhere we went, this was the big pain point, was we have to wait six to eight weeks just to get data access, and then when you do get data access, it's not like the data's in an easily queryable format, you actually really have to know what you're doing in order to get the right metrics out, and so on and so forth.\n\n(00:54:21):\nAnd so it turned out like, okay, it's this iceberg analogy where the actual analysis is actually just the tip of the iceberg, it's kind of the last five or 10%, and the 95% before that is, I am gaining access to the data, I am cleaning the data, I'm joining the data, I'm normalizing it, putting it all in the same format. And so once we spotted that, then it's like, okay, there's actually a lot of product to be built there just to make that process easier. People don't think of Palantir as this place where innovative new product and UX ideas come out, but I actually think it's been one of the most generative companies for that specifically in the last 20 years, it's just that most of that didn't see the light of day and so people don't know. But if you look at the product primitives that they developed in order to make the things I just mentioned a lot easier, they're actually really valuable and interesting and could probably form the basis of independent companies themselves.\n\n(00:55:21):\nAnd so, yeah, it just took every single step of that process became much, much easier once there was a software solution around it. So if you talk about data ingestion, there's essentially a universal data adapter that's part of Foundry. It can read anything, so JDBC, S3 buckets, whatever you want. It allows us to look into the data, maybe preview the first 20 rows, and then it allows you when you're ready to set up a schedule and just pull it in on some cadence. That process alone for an engineer used to take a long time, especially pre-Vibe coding, and managing all those cron jobs and doing this analytics, VM somewhere inside the customer's tenant was a huge pain.\n\n(00:56:04):\nAnd so you productize that piece, then it's like, okay, once you have the data, it's like how do you actually join it? What if you're non-technical? Is there a way for a non-technical user to be able to join tables and see what the result is? And so there's all these very fascinating business problems that, because I think the access was very difficult to get, and people hadn't really solved before, and so there was a lot of white space to do some product innovation. So now I would say Foundry's definitely the best data platform in the world just because it has all these different applications within it that solve these discrete parts. And it came out of this, years of painful experience, watching people have to clean data and join it and figure out what this table name meant and so on and so forth.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:50):\nYou shared in your post this kind of evocative story of some people's jobs is just to gate keep the data. They're there to give you access to this very valuable data within the organization, and how hard it is to get. That was a lot of this work, is just breaking through those political battles of like, \"Okay, we need this data for the good of the company and took a lot of work.\" I guess anything there you want to add?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:57:12):\nIt is, yeah. It's a huge pain, and there are good reasons for it. It's not like folks are malicious here. If you're IT or if you're an InfoSec type person, then your goal is to prevent data breaches and to make sure that sensitive information doesn't spread too wide. And so what's the easiest way to do that? It's to lock the data down, basically be a gatekeeper for access. I think where it got a little bit more interesting was where your skills are valuable and depend on you being the gatekeeper. So what I mean by that is let's say I'm the only guy who understands the way the sales calculation pipeline works and I write the SQL for it. All the requests from business SMEs come to me, I have a big queue of them, it takes me weeks to get through this queue. I have a great job, I have great job security, and people depend on me.\n\n(00:58:05):\nAnd so now along comes this company and they're like, \"Hey, actually we want to make sales data available to everyone and we want to make it point and click.\" Suddenly you're like, \"Hey, hang on, what am I going to do?\" And so that's where I think there was a lot of difficulty and I always say people are like, what accounts as competitors? I don't think it's the ones that you would think of necessarily. Palantir's biggest competitor is a company rolling its own solution, and so the biggest difference would just be a CIO saying, \"I'm going to build my own data infrastructure, I'm going to own it, it's going to be on top of one of the hyperscalers, and we're all just going to do our own analytics ourselves.\" And what we came along with, which was quite disruptive to this model, was saying, \"No, actually all your data is going to get ingested into this one platform and everybody in your company is going to use it.\" The trade-off is it's going to be really, really easy for everyone to do things. But as you can imagine, some people weren't a huge fan of that model.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:01):\nIt feels like Glean is the biggest competitor to Palantir after I hear this, do you know about that company?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:06):\nI do, yeah, Glean looks amazing from the outside. So many differences there, I can totally see why you would say this, but-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:15):\nClearly a different use case but it feels like the reason they've been successful is they figured out a lot of this data ingestion, permissions, search stuff. I never thought of it that way.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:24):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:24):\nInteresting. Okay, I want to talk about hiring, you talked a bit about this. You're starting a company again, what are some of the key lessons you've learned from your time at Palantir when you are hiring people for your company? I don't know if you're actually hiring people yet, maybe when you may start hiring.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (00:59:42):\nYeah, we have six people at the moment, so a really reasonably small team. I think with hiring, it's funny, man, there's so much hiring advice online and you read it and you're like, \"Yeah, this is super obvious.\" And then when you live it, you're suddenly like, \"Aah, this is why people say this.\" So a few simple examples are I think the thing that is really hard to find is somebody who really, really has a lot about doing the thing and will go that kind of extra 20%. I think when you hire out, especially not to pick on them, but I think if you hired a [inaudible 01:00:17] right, it's like people want a 400K a year job, they would like to work a certain number of hours, they would like to ship some code and then go home, that's basically the model that you get accustomed to even if you don't intend to when you work at a big company.\n\n(01:00:31):\nAnd so if you hire out of that for a really small startup, it can be really challenging because a lot of your success as a startup depends on each individual person being like, \"No, I'm really going to, I'm work this evening if that's what it takes to get this thing working, and I'm not just going to check my boxes, I'm actually going to look towards what is the real outcome that this business is trying to achieve.\" And everything I'm saying feels kind of obvious, but when you actually feel that difference between somebody who's just checking the boxes and somebody who's kind of an animal in this way, they'll actually go and pursue and accomplish the end outcome, that difference is very, very big and it matters so much for your first 20 people. And there's no science to finding these people. It's not like you can just put somebody who cares about outcomes in your JD and then suddenly you'll get all these people applying.\n\n(01:01:18):\nSo then it's like, okay, well how do you screen for that and how do you find those types of people? And so that's where it gets really interesting. I think that's where the mission alignment comes in, and so you do have to find people who, for what you are doing, have this extra maybe private reason to care about it a little bit more than the average person. So I think for Palantir, they did hire a lot of vets, for example, or maybe people who were a little bit more patriotic or pro-America than the average tech employee, and those people had an extra reason to Palantir and an extra reason to try that little bit harder. And so what I'm doing is a little bit more in the kind of medical and health space, and so I think people who have themselves had experiences with this system have maybe had relatives go through difficult experiences with things like cancer or whatever it is. They're just that extra bit motivated to really care about the thing you're trying to do and then work that little bit harder, and so I think aggressively filtering early on to things like mission fit, how much have you cared about stuff in the past, and what's an example.\n\n(01:02:29):\nYou ask questions like, what's the hardest you've ever worked to get something done and why? And that does differentiate a lot of people, a lot of people don't actually have a great answer to that. So I would say that's been a really big learning, is it's less about testing for the right skills, yes, that's important, two it's much more about just who has that extra 20%.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:47):\nThat is really interesting, everything you've shared is essentially around motivation, and drive, and passion, and kind of just commitment to working on this intently, and it's almost like a second thought of just like, oh, also they're really smart and skilled at stuff. It feels like that's just table stakes and this is actually what makes the difference in your experience.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:03:08):\nYeah, I totally agree, and I think it's different for every business. So I think if you're in a space like B2B SaaS where maybe it's a little harder to tell the story of like, oh, this is so mission-critical, whatever, there are other ways of getting at this thing. So for example, I know a lot of people, again, it's a little played out now, but I know a lot of people who for sales teams, they will explicitly go for people who were professional athletes or played sports in college, and it's like, okay, what does that test for? It's like you are very, very disciplined, you're very, very goals and numbers oriented and you're willing to just work really, really hard. And so there's all these kind of lateral ways of getting at these qualities that I think you just have to be intentional about as a founder. As a personal example, I'm a runner and so I actually love meeting fellow runners and I kind of joke like, \"Oh, maybe I'll go higher from run clubs or something like that.\"\n\n(01:03:57):\nBut it's just same with I play a lot of chess, I love meeting chess players. I'm not necessarily saying that's the right kind of hire for me, but I think having this thing of here are some traits that seem uncorrelated, but which actually give you good signal to this person's personality, those are actually really important. The last thing I'll say just as a funny illustration of that concept is I think Max Levchin tells the story of somebody interviewing at PayPal early on and he passed all the skill interviews and then it just got to the final round and he said something about liking to shoot hoops, like he liked to play basketball, and they were like instant reject. The vibe here was like if you're not a mega Linux nerd, hardcore computer person, then we don't want you here, even if you actually passed all the tests just because you like to shoot hoops. Now whether that was the right call or the wrong call, don't know, but that's an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:54):\nI think that's a great echo back. People hearing this may be like, \"What the hell? How dare they do that?\" But this is exactly what you said at the beginning of our conversation, that like an approach to building a generational business is to be very clear about who this is not for, and that's okay, it's your company, not everyone needs to work there. And it's almost saving them time because they might realize this isn't for me, this isn't the people I want to be around necessarily. So I think it's important to see that side of it, is it's your business, it's important to be clear about who is a good fit for the company and who's not. Speaking of that, let's talk about product management for a bit. I know Palantir PMs are not traditional product managers. I imagine people have the title, Product Manager at Palantir, okay, so if so, as far as you understand what's the difference between say a PM at Palantir versus a traditional PM say at a FANG company?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:05:51):\nPalantir was, as far as I remember, quite anti-PM for a while and eventually we did need them because we just got more serious about product testing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:57):\nClassic story, classic story.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:05:59):\nA classic story.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:00):\nIn many companies,\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:06:01):\nThe big difference or one big difference I noticed was that they were extremely careful about only making people PMs who had first proven themselves out as forward deploying engineers. You basically could not become a PM any other way. So as an example, when I mentioned earlier the thing that we built for the plane factory, the person who was managing that deployment, she later became the PM for ontology, and it was just because she'd kind of proven her method in the field. And the reason for that's pretty simple, it's going to be someone who understand how customers work and has that customer empathy, and it's going to be someone who has this drive to get things done because that's what BD selected for. I think the failure mode that they were very, very averse to in traditional PMs was this kind of Google Docs syndrome of like, okay, I'm going to write my product requirement documents, and I'm going to manage it in this very sort of sane, rational way I think, so the company was really rigorous about that.\n\n(01:07:04):\nAnd so basically PMs were almost always internal promotions and they always came from BD. I am not aware of a single case where we took somebody who was a PM at a place like Google, which produces many excellent PMs and hired them successfully into Palantir, it's just a very different vibe. So I think that was one thing. This is maybe more of a classic PM trait, but you just had to be either an engineer yourself or extremely good at working with engineers, and the ones I saw who succeeded the most were just best friends with their engineering team. And the team would always just be like one, it was called the group pm and then it would be a lot of very, very good engineers. And basically the success or failure mode was just do the engineers and trust you? I mentioned before Palantir how is very almost disagreeable personalities, and so if you didn't gain the trust of engineering team pretty fast, you didn't last very long.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:58):\nI think we've cracked the question of why are Palantir PM's so successful? First of all, the hiring bar is just basically hiring for leaders in a lot of different ways, to this, I don't know, forge for founders where they're working with a company solving a real problem, building a real product that makes money, and then those are the people that become the PMs at Palantir and then they go on to leave and that's why 30% of them end up starting companies, I'm surprised it's not higher, or become first PMs at other companies or heads of product.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:08:29):\nYeah, absolutely, it's crazy. I was part of a pretty small team within Palantir, I think it was 20 to 25 people when I joined, and I think at least six of them now are either unicorn or just pre-unicorn founders from that group of 25 people, which is actually a crazy ratio. And then a bunch more have become founders recently at an earlier stage, so yeah, there's all these little pockets of excellence and it's been really interesting to see. I think the other thing that's driving that a little bit is when you leave, it's just such an interesting company to work at that I think the retention numbers were actually very high for that company. People would often stay a lot longer than maybe the average Valley tenure. And so when you left, it was really this decision of just something very specific is pulling you and you want to kind of play the next level of the game, and so it was very unusual for someone to leave and then join maybe a more traditional tech company. It's sort of like you're either going to go become a founder or why would you leave when there's so many interesting different things to work on? And I know that sounds a little culty, but that's what everyone thinks.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:35):\nI could totally see that. A lot of people that left Airbnb have never found something more meaningful, it's just hard, especially if you're early. There's a stat that I didn't share that I think is really interesting, and when you look at YC founders and where they've come from, I think you maybe shared in your post that there's more YC ex-Palantir founders than there are ex-Google founders in spite of Google being something like 50 times bigger sample size.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:10:00):\nYeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:02):\nLet's talk about the moral question of Palantir. A lot of people probably seeing the title of this episode, hearing this, will not be excited about Palantir being highlighted and promoted, a lot of people kind of disagree with what Palantir's doing. Builds products that kill people in some ways, they work with governments they don't agree with. I know you wrote a really insightful way of how you approach this question when you decided to work at Palantir and how you see people tackle with this, can you just talk about the framework that you landed on and how you thought about this yourself?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:10:34):\nYeah, it's a really interesting topic, it's definitely very nuanced. I think what I was trying to say in that post was a couple of things. One was that there was a lot of upside there. So I worked on the US Covid response, I have friends who worked on Operation Warp Speed, and these are all things that I think saved a lot of lives, and I was pretty focused while I was working at NIH on cancer research. And so to me, these were just obviously good things and you couldn't do them anywhere else, and so that was alone a reason to stay. The question I had in that post was, well, okay, there are definitely going to be other pieces of this that people object to. So during the 2016 to 2020 era, it became a pretty common thing to go into work in New York and you'd have people protesting outside your office or doing all kinds of things. And so there was this question of, well, is this okay? And I think the point I was trying to make was it's rare that disengagement is the correct answer, and I think it's more recognized now, but especially then it went a bit too far.\n\n(01:11:41):\nSo the famous example here is Google kind of disengaging with a Pentagon AI project just because some people felt that working with the Pentagon was itself morally bad. I think that's a way to sort of the left of what the median American would say, I think the median American would say it's fine to work on defense stuff within reason and assuming you're doing largely good things, and so there was just this kind of almost arbitrage there at some point of just hang on, it's not like working on defense is inherently evil, it's actually a pretty interesting thing. And then there's this question of, well, would you rather be in the room and making this better or not? And so I'm struggling with how much I can share here, but as a simple example, if you're doing even a workflow, which I think many people would not be super comfortable with, let's say you're targeting somebody for some kind of strike. If you compare the way it's done now to maybe the way it was done in 2010, it's going to be a lot more targeted, it's going to be a lot more accurate, and so you've actually improved that process and reduced the chance of error. Maybe you should feel good about that, right? Now, that is a bullet many people are not willing to bite.\n\n(01:12:52):\nI didn't work on the defense side of the company myself, but I think you have to be okay with these kinds of grade zones and actually actively thinking about what you are doing. And that doesn't mean that it's always the right thing to do to work in a defense company. Maybe we go into a very dark future and we start being the bad guys in some ways, and then it's probably not a great idea to work at a defense company. So it's a shifting landscape but I kind of felt pretty strongly that a lot of people in tech just didn't want to think about this at all.\n\n(01:13:29):\nSo you have engineers now who are working on optimizing short form videos for higher engagement, and you sort of want to say to them like, \"Hey, are you thinking about what this is doing to the brains of young children?\" Or \"Have you seen an 11-year-old kind of scrolling something for five hours and do you think this is a good thing?\" And I think people don't want to think about this stuff too much. I'm not saying I know the answer, but there was almost this refusal to look at what tech was doing from a political lens for a very long time. It was just like, \"Hey, let us play with our toys, let us sit in our little park, and don't bother us, and we're just going to build cool stuff and launch it.\"\n\n(01:14:08):\nAnd 2025, we're in a very, very different state of the world, tech is involved in politics now, and politics basically came to tech. There's this famous image of Mark Zuckerberg, he's sitting in Congress and he kind of looks very pale, and he's like, \"Why have they dragged me in here again?\" But I think tech went through this journey of, oh, we're suddenly becoming important now, oh, we're really, really important now, oh, we better stop playing this game of politics. And so I think what I'm saying now is a lot more consensus than it was 10 years ago, but at the time, the feeling was just like, \"Look what we are doing is political, so you better engage with that.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:44):\nI think when this became really real for a lot of people is with the Ukraine War, the government's running out of certain vehicles and ammunition, we're just not able to produce it, and then we're like, \"Oh, thank God for a company like Anduril and all these other tech companies that are actually ahead and keeping us ahead.\" I think the only reason the US is ahead of that...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:00):\nAnd keeping us ahead. I think the only reason the US is ahead of China and the space race is because SpaceX just is one company that just has been doing this for a long time. So I think a lot of people have kind of realized, okay, maybe we need these things.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:15:13):\nRight. And I would make this argument as well, it's like people are like, well, how can you feel good about working in defense? And it's like, well, you're not going to feel great if China invades Taiwan, actually, you're not going to. I think you are probably also not going to like that outcome. So we do just live in this world where you do need to build up deterrents to these things and they better be good. So to me, it didn't feel that difficult of a question. I think when you zoom into particular things, they can be very difficult questions and there have been a bunch of those in the last couple of years. But yeah, again, disengagement isn't the answer.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:46):\nYeah. And again, it's not for everyone. I think that's an important kind of theme through this conversation is some companies ... like, to build ... sometimes to build a generational, really successful company, you need to turn some people off because that's what brings in the best talent oftentimes.\n\n(01:16:03):\nOkay. Just a few more questions. Kind of like stepping back a little bit. You're building a company again. What are a few core pieces of advice that you're bringing to your new startup that will inform how you build this company, from your experience at Palantir? We talked about a lot of stuff. Is there anything, I don't know if there are three things that you think are like, \"I'm definitely going to do these things this way because it worked really well at Palantir.\"\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:16:27):\nOne thing is probably just really fast iteration cycles. So placing a lot of bets and then being really rigorous about just going through that cycle very soon. I have this [inaudible 01:16:40]principles, and one of the things on there is basically saying EOP successes goes up the more bets you make, and it's sort of a function of how many bets you make and the probability of success of those individual bets, right? And so one easy way to almost guarantee that you'll hit something is just to make a lot of bets and then just kind of cycle through them very quickly. Now, obviously this is difficult, often this question of, well, is this bet actually failing or are we quitting too soon, kind of thing. But that's kind of one principle I take, is just test this thing very early. You know, like the classic \"why feed, why see\" thing is just when you take something to a customer, ask them to pay you a lot of money and [inaudible 01:17:22] then find a new problem. Don't wait three weeks, which is what every founding team typically does because you don't have that kind of time.\n\n(01:17:29):\nI do think the importance of just having a really tight, distinctive internal culture and building a strong feeling of trust within a team is really important. And kind of like you mentioned with Airbnb, and people definitely felt this at Palantir, there was this feeling of like, well, you worked here, you must be good. I trust you, and all of that. And I think it's so important to create that and you kind of know that feeling. That's what ... like, people ask me, should I go work at place X or should I just go be a founder straightaway? I don't know the answer for everyone, but I will say one of the benefits of working at a place like that is you just have all these internal benchmarks now for, okay, this is what this should feel like, and if it doesn't feel like that, we're off. And I can't imagine not having those benchmarks and just kind of having to figure it all out.\n\n(01:18:21):\nSo yeah, I think that thing, too, is just distinctive, internal, strong team culture. And then I think for me, think three is just working with a really messy part of the real world. So I kind of joked when I left, like, I am excited to just do pure software. I'm excited to, I don't know, I want to build an ID or something and just not have a support email even and all of that. But it turned out, look, my comparative advantage in a lot of ways was the networks I'd built and the experience I'd had in engaging with the messy parts of the world. And they do need technology a lot, right?\n\n(01:19:00):\nThere's this horrifying thought I have sometimes of just like, maybe we'll get ATI in the next two years and the healthcare sector will still be broken and it will still be impossible to afford rent in New York City and build houses and all these things. And that may well become true. And so I think it's important to engage with those parts of the world too, even though they're really, really challenging. And I think the really nice thing about LLMs is that actually, there's so many workflows now that are accessible to you as a tech founder and people are somehow more open to working with tech companies than they ever were before. Selling into the sectors of the economy in 2015, incredibly hard. I think now post the ChatGPT moment, people are willing to give chances to small startups that they weren't willing to do previously. As you mentioned earlier, the cost of doing things like forward-deployed engineering has fallen by maybe five to 10 x now at least. And so there's a lot of new possibilities and I'm excited to engage with the best.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:20:01):\nWow, that is some alpha right there that you're finding, that some of these very large organizations are more open to working with startups, because classically, investors don't want to invest in companies that are going after healthcare companies and governments and things like that. So it is really interesting actually to hear.\n\n(01:20:17):\nI'm going to mirror back the tips you just shared, and there's actually a secondary tip that I think is the more interesting piece. So the first thing you're taking away is iterate quickly, but I love your tip of ask for lots of money quickly, early, to see if it's an actual idea that people will pay lots of money for. And if not, move on. I love that.\n\n(01:20:35):\nThe other is build a very distinct culture, but the piece you share there that I love even more is this idea of knowing what a high bar looks like, knowing what awesome A plus people look like, and you need to work at a company like Palantir to actually see that. So the advice there I feel is just work at a company that is amazing, first, with the best talent, to understand what that should look like, plus you build a network of those folks. So I think that's really interesting.\n\n(01:21:03):\nAnd then the other pieces of advice you're pulling away is work on really hard, messy problems because that's where the biggest opportunities are, and it's sounding like this is the easiest time to actually do that. Amazing.\n\n(01:21:13):\nOkay. I'm going to take us to a recurring theme on this podcast called AI Corner. And what we do in AI Corner is we share some way that .. and this is you sharing ... some way that you've found AI to be useful in your day- to-day, either in life or in work. Is there any way you found some tool ... some AI tool useful that you can share?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:21:38):\nOh my gosh, there are so many. I'll give you a few examples. So I use Wispr Flow quite a bit. So this is the talk to your keyboard and it will transcribe for you app. Very good. It's just great when you are iterating very quickly with an LLM and sometimes you have to do these paragraph-long prompts and it's just easier to speak into them. So Wispr Flow, I like.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:01):\nJust to double down on that, you press a button and you start talking-\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:22:05):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:05):\nAnd it's writing out what you're saying. Cool. And there have been these products for a long time, Dragon Dictate and all these guys. Is the difference now these are just very, very good now at actually transcribing what you're saying?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:22:18):\nI think that's right. Yeah, they use a really good model and so it rarely makes mistakes even when I think it's quite challenging. And then, yeah, the UX I think they just nailed. So that's really good one.\n\n(01:22:27):\nI love Claude Code for developing. Even though I have my complaints about it, there's something just very addictive about just telling it what to do. And it's basically something that you run within the terminal of your computer, and so you just type Claude, it opens up the Claude interface. It's very cute, it's very beautifully designed, and you just tell it what to do. And it actually operates on the file system directly. So if you're like, \"Hey, create a bunch of these files,\" that'll just do it and you don't need to go and muck around inside Finder yourself. And then it'll do these really complicated pull requests and it'll basically execute them quite well. So to me, this is a very exciting kind of preview of AI agents.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:03):\nThat's what I was going to ask. So this is essentially an AI agent engineer. I didn't know that's what Claude Code did. Very cool.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:23:10):\nYeah. It's sort of a guided agent, but yeah, it is really sweet. And then yeah, I'm just enjoying ... you know, every week there's a new, wonderful new thing to play with. Last seven days, I've been testing Gemini Pro 2.5. Excellent model. I don't love Google's UX sometimes, but I was playing with that. And I use LLMs every day for all kinds of things. The other day I was doing taxes and I needed to classify a bunch of transactions based on some metadata, and so I just wrote a script up really quickly and it did that. So.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:43):\nI love just the smile on your face as you're describing all these AI tools. I think a lot of people are just like, holy shit, I'm just overwhelmed with all the things I need to be paying attention to. All these things I'm hearing, all these tools I got to try. And I love just this vibe of just like, this is incredible and so fun. We need more of that.\n\n(01:24:01):\nOkay. I'm going to take us to another recurring segment on the podcast. You're going to get a double whammy. Contrarian Corner. So here's the question. What's something that you believe that most other people don't?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:24:12):\nI think going to college is great. I think this is a somewhat contrarian view within tech, maybe not in the broader economy, but I often see people saying just like, oh, if you can just drop out when you're 18 and just start working, why would you go to college? And I think this is completely wrong, but maybe it's good advice for 5% of the population who probably would've been to your fellows anyway. But college is one of the few times when you can just make really, really deep friendships. You are in typically a nice campus. If you're in North America, you get to spend all of your time just thinking and writing papers and reading books and hanging out with your friends.\n\n(01:24:49):\nAnd it's actually very precious and it's very hard to find that kind of time after you turn 21 because you got to pay your rent, you've got to work, you've got to do all this stuff. Let's say you make a bunch of money, you take a career break, it's still ... all your friends are working and you always feel like there's a ticking time or on top of your head or something.\n\n(01:25:09):\nSo just taking those three or four years at the very beginning and going really deep on lots of different intellectual topics and being able to try different things and discover more about yourself. I'm a big college fan. I can't comment on the ROI or whatever. I personally think the ROI is great, even though the fees are kind of high in the U.S., but that's probably my kind of contrarian within tech view is don't drop out of college unless you have a really good reason.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:25:35):\nIt's so funny that that is contrarian and it does sound contrarian. I had a great time in college here. Here. Okay. Is there anything else, Nabeel, that you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:25:48):\nNo, I think it's a really exciting time in the world. I think AI can be exhausting, but it does really just open up the possibility of building a better world in all these ways. And so I think just reassess what you're doing every couple of months and make sure that it's aligned with where I think AI is going and make sure that you are working on something that you feel has very high potential if it succeeds. And I think that's more important than ever now just because the amount of leverage we have with technology is at the highest point in history.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:26:22):\nLet me double click on that real quick. So for people that want to do what you're describing, what helps you understand where AI is heading and just kind of align with it, are there places of information and news you find useful? Is it just play with it kind of thing? What would you recommend?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:26:39):\nThis is the big question. I use X a lot to keep on top of AI, so I would just recommend finding a good Twitter list and maybe following people off of that. There's some good newsletters. I really like Latent Space, I know his X handle, it's Swyx, S-W-Y-X. I can't remember his actual name, but that one is very good and it's pretty technical. I would recommend trying to stick to the more technical newsletters if possible. I think there's a lot of philosophy about AI or AI policy type stuff, and I think that's good if that's your area, but it's an area where it's very easy to have a lot of takes on it. You're not necessarily learning a lot by reading those.\n\n(01:27:16):\nBut I think it's just important to know what's going on and make sure you are revisiting your own workflows as often as possible. And just making sure that the people who went here are going to be the kind of hybrid cyborgs who fuse with the AIs. This actually played out in chess, if I can take a slight detour, is the chess players who succeeded the most in the mid 2010s especially were the ones who were really early adopters of neural network based chess engines. So when DeepMind did that thing, there was very quickly an open source version of it called Leela, and you find basically the very top players like Magnus Carlson, Fabiano, they were the ones who kind of mind melded the most with Leela and learned how it played and then kind of started copying its moves.\n\n(01:28:06):\nAnd so I think just becoming a cyborg to the extent that you can. And then I think there's this barbell thing of, it's also important to just leave everything at go touch grass just for your own mental sanity.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:18):\nExcellent advice. And with that, Nabeel, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:28:24):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:28:25):\nHere we go. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:28:29):\nThe first one that comes to mind is Impro by Keith Johnstone. This is actually ... I wrote about it in that essay. It's one of the books that [inaudible 01:28:36] used to send to people. I just think it's a really interesting book. So nominally speaking, it's about improvisational theater, which I believe this guy was a pioneer of. He was a British guy, Keith Johnstone, active between the '60s and the 80s I think. And Impro is just this really interesting book about creativity and how social behavior works and basically just what he taught his improv students. It's a very weird book. It's full of these unbelievably strange ideas. There's a lot of very tactical things he tells you to do in the first chapter, for example, just to break out of your own mental frameworks, really just wild stuff.\n\n(01:29:16):\nHe'll tell you to walk backwards while counting down from a hundred and think about some problem that you're struggling with and there's all these kind of odd things. But the number of ideas per page I've found on that book is extremely high. The concepts about how social interaction works and how things like status and so on play into your social behavior are super important. And they made every kind of fully deployed engineer read that for the simple reason that I think it just helps you kind of read people better and interact with them better and become more conscious of how you are coming across and just modulate that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:51):\nWhat is the title again?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:29:52):\nImpro.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:29:53):\nImpro. Okay, cool. We'll link into it in the show notes.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:29:56):\nYeah, so Impro is number one. I think just to go a little more highbrow, maybe Shakespeare's history plays, there's a set of them called the Henriad, so like Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VI. I find most people don't read these, so they'll read Hamlet or Macbeth or whatever, but the Henry one is absolutely incredible. You don't have to be interested in British monarchy or British history in order to enjoy them. They're actually some of the most interesting and insightful books I've read about power and how power works and politics and what the sacrifices that you might have to make if you want to be a successful king in that case. But it transfers over.\n\n(01:30:35):\nI think it is worth thinking really hard about, I think especially in a world where everything is kind of organized around these prominent figures and personalities now. When you think about the current administration, you think Trump, Elon, or when you think about AI, you think of Sam Dario, right? And so I think it's important to understand, how do you think about these personalities and yeah, the kind of game that they're playing. And Henry is actually ... the Henriad is an incredible kind of set of books around that.\n\n(01:31:05):\nThey're also easy to read, which sounds hilarious when I say it, but you can read a Shakespeare play in a day. They're sort of ... I don't know, they're like 50 pages long. It's not that bad. You have to get used to the language. Yes. But I would recommend that for sure. I guess you asked for two to three. I love High Output Management by Andy Grove. I just think that's a great business book, and people tend to read summaries of it on the internet more than they actually read the book. But the actual book has a lot of really interesting stories and explanations about ... I think the most powerful thing about that book is actually how Andy Grove thinks, and less any of the specific tactics there. And I think you don't get that unless you read how he came up with all these things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:31:48):\nYour first two books were extremely out there versus what other people have recommended, and the third book was the most recommended book on this podcast. So I love that spectrum that we just went on. Perfect. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've just really enjoyed?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:32:04):\nThe last movie I really loved was a Decision to Leave. It's a Korean movie. It's by the Director of Old Boy, which maybe some people have heard of. It's a great movie. I think it was released a couple years ago and the basic premise is, there's a detective who is investigating a woman who's accused of killing her husband, and he gradually starts falling for her, which starts to affect his judgment in all these ways. Just a really fascinating kind of psychological thriller with a sort of romantic element to it. Visually, very beautiful. Yeah, I think a lot of the most interesting movies nowadays come from abroad actually. So East Asia, South Asia, places like that. TV, I don't watch so much yet. It's been a while.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:32:47):\nTotally understandable for a founder. Okay, next question. Do you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you just really love? It could be an app, it could be something physical, it could be a water bottle.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:32:58):\nI don't have a good answer to that one. I guess I don't buy enough stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:33:01):\nFully acceptable. There's no wrong answers in the lightning round. Moving on, do you have a favorite life motto that you often find useful in work or in life that you come back to, that you share with friends or family?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:33:15):\nSo there's this architect called Christopher Alexander who wrote these beautiful books that are about beauty and kind of more than architecture. And he was a teacher at UC, Berkeley, and he got really frustrated with the students because he just felt like they were always turning in kind of average work. And so he would always tell them every week, imagine there's a gothic cathedral in France called Charge. And he would say, you have to aim for Charge. You have to make something that is better than that. That should be your goal, not to just turn in something that's what you feel is good enough. You actually have to try and be better than the very, very best that ever did it. And I find myself just repeating this a lot to myself. It's just aim for that, really try and do that. Otherwise, it's very easy to anchor on something right in the middle. And you do this unconsciously all the time.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:09):\nSo is that the motto, just aim for Charge?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:12):\nYeah, yeah, yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:13):\nI love that. Most people have no idea what that would be, but with the context is quite powerful. Final question, what's a classic novel that `you think would be most valuable for product builders?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:27):\nMy favorite novel is Anna Karenina, and I would recommend that everyone read Erica.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:34:32):\nI'm reading that right now. I've never read it before.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:34:35):\nNo way. And yeah, so it's by Leo Tolstoy. It's this epic 19th century Russian novel that follows a set of characters across society. And I think it's just extraordinary because what's amazing about him is he's just able to imagine himself into the brain of anybody. And so even ... he will briefly just go into the consciousness of, I don't know, the servant who's bringing the meal to the table or something like that. And he'll just tell you a page of what they were thinking, and then he'll just flip back into his main character's head. And I think that is the most impressive demonstration of this kind of skill I've ever seen.\n\n(01:35:12):\nAnd I think, to connect it to your question, this is what you have to do if you're going to be really good at product, is you have to really think yourself into the other person's head, and you have to be really seeing it the way that they do. And it's so hard, especially as a founder or product person, not to just get stuck on your own way of seeing the problem, right? You wrote up this doc, you made these marks. You're like, this is going to be great. And then you take it to somebody, they don't care that much. You really have to exercise your empathy and understand why they see it that way and what they actually care about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:35:43):\nWhat a beautiful way to bring it all together. Let me also add, while I'm reading the book, something ... a tip here is, people talk about having Chat GPT voice mode, just kind of sitting there next to you. I found that extremely helpful with this book where I just ask what the hell does this thing mean? There's all these Russian dances and balls and etiquette. You just ask and you're like, I'm reading Anna Karenina, what does this mean? And it just tells you.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:04):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:04):\nSo there's another cool tip for AI. Okay. With that, Nabeel, this was incredible. Two final questions in case people want to look you up. Where can they find you online and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:16):\nFind me online, my website is nabeelqu.co and my X handle is Nabeel QU, I'm probably most active on that, but yeah, my website has all the links and a bunch of essays and interesting stuff. How can you help me? I would say send me an email. My email is on my website. Introduce yourself, say hi. I love meeting people. I don't always have time for coffees nowadays or things like that, but I genuinely do get a lot of energy from just receiving emails from interesting people, so please do reach out.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:48):\nAwesome. Definitely check out Nabeel's Principles. Is that the name of that post?\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:36:53):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:36:53):\nGreat. Okay. That's one to start with, and then also there's the Palantir Post that we just talked through. Okay. Nabeel, thank you so much for being here.\n\nNabeel S. Qureshi (01:37:00):\nThank you. Appreciate it, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:37:02):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.
