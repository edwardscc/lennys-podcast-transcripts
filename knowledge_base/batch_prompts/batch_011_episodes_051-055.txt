However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is. About 3%, 4% is to just stick to it. Like if you just do an episode a week for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created.\n\nLenny (00:00:30):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Chris Hutchins. Chris is not only a former product manager, founder and investor, he just this month went full-time on his podcast and the independent creator path. When I was looking for advice on how to build a podcast, Chris shared this awesome deck with a ton of great advice that he's built throughout his journey, and so I thought it'd be fun to spend an episode talking about all the things that you should know about launching and growing a podcast. Chris's podcast is called All the Hacks, covers all the ways to financially optimize your life, and it's one of the biggest business podcasts in the world. Chris has also been on the Tim Ferris Show actually, interviewing Tim Ferris.\n\n(00:01:15):\nHe's also head of new product strategy at Wealthfront where he took some big, bold bets within the company, which we talk about. Chris is awesome and I am excited for you to learn from him. I bring you Chris Hutchins after a short word from our wonderful sponsors. This episode is brought to you by Notion. If you haven't heard of Notion, where have you been? I use Notion to coordinate this very podcast, including my content calendar, my sponsors, and prepping guests for launch of each episode. Notion is an all-in-one team collaboration tool that combines note-taking, document sharing, wikis, project management, and much more into one space that's simple, powerful and beautifully designed. And not only does it allow you to be more efficient in your work life, but you can easily transition to using it in your personal life, which is another feature that truly sets Notion apart.\n\n(00:02:06):\nThe other day I started a home project and immediately opened up Notion to help me organize it all, learn more and get started for free at notion.com/lennyspod, take the first step towards an organized happy team today, again at notion.com/lennyspod. This episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\n(00:03:05):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive. Enter Vanta, over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

I'm excited.\n\nLenny (00:03:50):\nThis is going to be a pretty unique episode, I think. You're a product manager and we're going to talk about some of the things you've learned being a PM on some really killer products. But what I want to spend most of our time on is talking about how to launch a podcast. You've built one of the most popular, biggest business podcasts in just like a year and a half. You've taught me some stuff, you've helped other people with their podcast and so I just thought it'd be really helpful just to talk about just the skill of building a podcast and all the things you should know. How does that sound?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:04:21):\nSounds great. You just did a episode about growing a newsletter business, which I was like, \"This is awesome because I have a newsletter and I want it to be bigger.\" And I think anyone that's has knowledge to share. I talked to a PM yesterday who was like, \"Oh, I've got all these product ideas. Maybe I'll start a podcast.\" So totally, this is fun.\n\nLenny (00:04:36):\nAwesome. That's exactly how I've been thinking about it. First we did the newsletter and then podcast maybe the other things, I don't know what's left.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:04:42):\nYouTube channel.\n\nLenny (00:04:43):\nYouTube channel?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:04:44):\n[inaudible 00:04:44] I don't know if you feel this way, but YouTube. I feel like just putting a podcast on YouTube isn't enough, I need to learn the skills of YouTube.\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\nYeah. All right. I got to get MrBeast on, that's the next goal. To set a little foundation for folks, to give him a little sense of your background and some of the things you've done in your career. Can you just talk about some of the biggest things you've done in your career, which you've been up to and then what you're up to now and also about your podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:05:09):\nI'm kind of like a happenstance product person. I basically really liked startups, but I didn't know what job I could have as a non-technical person. And I joined my first startup probably 10 years ago and was like, \"I will do anything.\" And they were like, \"Do business development.\" But it turns out we didn't have anyone who also was doing products, so they were like, \"What should we build that people will buy?\" So I was like, \"Well, I got to figure out how we turned this API we were building for location services into a product.\" Left that to join other startup with a few people we co-founded, did the Jack-of-all-trades role at a startup and then quickly were acquired by Google about a year in, and I went through the interview process and they were like, \"You're a PM.\" And I was like, \"Oh, great, what does a PM do?\"\n\n(00:05:51):\nI didn't really totally know I'd never worked as a PM. Went through Google's kind of like week of training and got thrown into it and I think I've now learned with a lot of time that being a PM is awesome. Being a PM at Google when we were working on Google Plus was not awesome. Transitioned pretty quickly over to Google Ventures, did venture capital for three years, left to start another company trying to make financial advice more affordable, more accessible. Grew that for about two, three years and we ended up selling that company to Wealthfront where I ran a new product strategy. I most recently just left that role after three years and started going full-time on All the Hacks, which is my effort to help everyone upgrade their life, their money, their travel. I'm the spreadsheet for everything, optimizer and do all this research to try to help people live better, happier, wealthier, healthier lives. And I have a podcast where we share all the hacks to do all of it.\n\nLenny (00:06:43):\nAmazing. While we're on the podcast, we're going to dig into this stuff more. Where can folks, find it. It's called All the Hacks.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:06:48):\nAnywhere you listen to podcasts right now, search All the Hacks, you can find it at allthehacks.com. I'd be surprised if someone listening to this is more of a newsletter reader than a podcaster, but allthehacks.com/email is the newsletter too.\n\nLenny (00:07:02):\nOh, newsletter. I love it. All right, coming back to your last gig at Wealthfront, from what I understand your title was New product Strategy and Andy Rachleff, who was the CEO for a while, kind of legendary figure. He co-founded Benchmark. He's just like this brain that... I listen to him every time I hear him on a podcast. He basically pulled you into Wealthfront and specifically wanted you to focus on figuring out new business ideas, new business lines, new product lines within Wealthfront. Is that right?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:07:31):\nYeah, so we had an engineer at the time who came up with this idea called Self-Driving Money. I was like, \"Gosh, what if you could automate and optimize your entire financial life and you didn't have to rely on human financial advisors?\" And we heard from our customers forever that they pay us to not talk to someone, our demographic doesn't want a bunch of humans in the mix. And so we had this idea but we didn't really know what it was. So Andy was like, \"Gosh, you've been spending time thinking about financial planning and software and as an entrepreneur, could you come in and help us build Self-Driving Money?\"\n\n(00:08:00):\nAnd I was like, \"What is it?\" They're like, \"Well, we got a bunch of ideas from an algorithmic standpoint about how to do it.\" But, \"What exactly is it?\" So it was thrown into, \"Let's do a bunch of customer research, let's talk to a lot of people and let's try to come up with as audacious of an idea as we could for how you fulfill the promise of automating and optimizing someone's entire financial life to the point that they don't have to think about their finances on a daily basis and they know the right things are happening.\"\n\nLenny (00:08:28):\nWhen I think Self-Driving Money, I'm picturing money just driving around, like a Tesla. Money meets Tesla.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:08:34):\nYeah, the vision I had was what are the core pieces of financial life that are stressful? It's like, \"I got to move money, I got to contribute to these different accounts. I want to make sure I have enough to pay my bills.\" And so what we ended up with was a product called Autopilot that would monitor your core banking account, whether it was a checking account at Wealthfront or not at Wealthfront or whether it was an account at Wealthfront. And we would say, \"Let's make sure we leave a certain amount of money.\" And you could tell us that much. And then we would say, \"Great.\" Now we had basically a series of things to fulfill with any excess. It was like, \"Let's make sure you keep this much as a three-month emergency fund, max out your Roth IRA. Let's make sure you max out your 529 for your kids and let's put the rest in your kind of taxable just brokerage account.\" And we would just periodically say, \"Oh, you got extra money, let's sweep it over and do what we need to do with it so you don't have to think about it.\"\n\nLenny (00:09:22):\nCan you talk about the impact this had on the company and also just how long of a endeavor this was within Wealthfront?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:09:29):\nIt was a quick endeavor to try to start talking to people. This was just throw in the mix. I have a very poor sense of time, but let's say somewhere between six and 12 months maybe before we put something really in front of someone that could execute on all the features, there was a lot of prototype UI testing. I think Andy, he's legendary. If anyone listening to this, wants to learn about product market fit, Andy is your guy. I believe he coined the term, he teaches the class at Stanford. And the lesson was really find something people are reaching over the table want, and make sure you have that validation. And so we were putting things in front of people, clickable, full prototypes, and I remember we got to one where someone was like, \"Can I go get my husband? I need to show him this.\"\n\n(00:10:12):\nAnd then I created this thing, which I'm sure is not that new, but I would start pretending that the product existed in the interviews. Only to find out, at the end, people was like, \"Oh, it's not out yet.\" And they're like, \"What I want to use...\" You could really feel the like, \"No, no, no, no, this has to be out. I want to start using it.\" So we found this thing that a small number of people were very excited about and we knew that a product, this was going to be a high risk bet because people don't automate their financial lives today. People drive to go pick up fast food and if you could with a push of a button, bring it to their house, you're making a thing that they do much more efficient. Right now, well, technically they do this manually, but trusting software to do it is something that we knew would be a higher risk bet.\n\n(00:10:59):\nAnd I think the takeaway, I would say the impact on the company was not as high as we had wanted in that it didn't become this wild top of funnel. I think it's similar to Tesla's autopilot. It's like nobody goes and says, \"I just want to buy this car because of this feature.\" I'm sure some people do, but once you're in the ecosystem, it had huge impact on making it easier for people to start saving more, making it easier for people to be more confident in their finances and just automate all that behavior. So I would say the letdown was, it wasn't the big, huge top of funnel thing where people are like, \"Oh, this is all I've ever wanted.\" Even though if you interview people and you're like, \"Gosh, would you like a product that could just automate all this stuff?\" They're like, \"Yes, I would love it.\"\n\n(00:11:43):\nAnd then you hand it to them and you're like, \"Do you want to use this thing?\" And they're like, \"Well.\" It's very hard to test that. And so what we found was it was a win in terms of it. It moved a lot of metrics for saving more money, increasing contributions and that kind of stuff, but it didn't become this growth channel, which Andy would say product market fit is exponential organic growth. So I would say by that metric, we didn't have product market fit, but as a tool to make a system of products so much better. We have the cash account with all the checking features, we have an investing account, we have retirement accounts. So this really brought it all together and that was super valuable.\n\nLenny (00:12:18):\nAwesome. So here's my big question. What have you learned? You spent a lot of time thinking about big bets, big innovations, working within a company to come up with something totally new. What have you learned about how to approach that within a larger company? How do I successfully innovate? How to think about launching big bets, how to structure teams, anything along those lines?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:12:37):\nI've learned a few things and I think some of them I've learned came naturally being a founder before being a PM. But you think that customer research is all you need to build a product at a company, but figuring out how to create excitement internally and get buy-in from other teams because they're the ones that are going to build it. They're the ones that are going to help market. It's all a team effort. Sometimes you get caught up, at least I found, as a PM of like, \"Oh, we got the customer insights, we did the testing. It's all positive.\" And then you show the ratings you got from sub survey or the engagement or some clips and that's not the end of it. The end is creating this compelling vision for what you're building. And then the thing I learned from being a founder is, gosh, you have to state your vision and your mission and why you're here, every all-hands.\n\n(00:13:27):\nIt seems so crazy because it's core to you why we would build this, what it's purposes, why it's amazing. But as a founder, I was like every week I was like, \"Hey everybody, before we get started, this is the mission we're on, this is why we're doing it. This is the thing we're doing in the world.\" And as a PM sometimes you're like, \"Well, I told people three weeks ago and I put it in that email that I sent out to everyone and it was in the top of the PRD, so why hasn't everyone understood why this product exists?\" And I realized very quickly that, that same thing is true. So if you want to make a big bet, if you want to make a big impactful product, you have to bring people along with you. And your ability to speak publicly, persuade people, build influence within the company. Those things are all as important as your ability to identify a user need and build a product that solves it.\n\nLenny (00:14:15):\nAwesome. This reminds me a lot of Airbnb, where the founders, all-hands share the vision and the strategy that they came up with that year. Every single all-hands. And it's always like, \"Yeah. Yeah, we know. We know.\" But to your point, it's so powerful and important.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:14:28):\nAnd some people don't know. Some people we're not paying attention that one all-hands, we're kind of missed it out, skip all-hands. Often there's just, you need everyone to be able to in... And this is a little segue to podcasting and we'll come back to it, but I start my show with saying, \"Hello and welcome to another episode of All the Hacks, the show about upgrading your life, money and travel.\" Because I just want everyone to know this is exactly what this show's about, so when their friend asks them a question, they're like, \"This is exactly what it is.\" And the same thing is true about a company's mission, a product, vision, anything you want everyone to really understand it, be able to talk about it succinctly and just have a very cohesive narrative in their head. That's a really big one. I think the other one is just understanding the customer, not just by talking to them, but just being in the mix, playing with all the products.\n\n(00:15:14):\nSomething I asked a few of my colleagues before this, \"What are things that I've particularly done well?\" And they were just like, \"Gosh, I feel like you understand what's happening outside of the walls of our business better than a lot of people.\" And maybe that's talking to a lot of other people who are founders talking to a lot of other people, starting companies, going to read all the comments on new financial products on Product Hunt. Really just trying to understand people beyond just customer research. And so that was another thing that I think... As a founder, you're always looking for product market fits, you're always trying to learn. Sometimes at a company it's really easy to get caught up in the research you've already done and the customers you've already talked to and you forget to kind of step outside and go talk to other people and see what other people are doing. And I'd say don't get caught up in what competitors are building and try to feature parody them, but just understanding the space outside of the walls of your business.\n\nLenny (00:16:06):\nOne thing I'll add to your point about reminding people of the strategy and the vision is if you can also help them understand how their team and project connects up through that, create kind of a little tree of, \"Here's all the teams, what they're doing. Here's all connects to the pillars of focus and themes and then here's how it connects to the North Star metric and or vision mission. \"That kind of adds another wrinkle of like, \"Oh, wow. I get it. I get why this team's important.\"\n\nChris Hutchins (00:16:30):\nThere's a great analogy, I'm sure if I send a link you could put in the show notes or something about a football team. And it's like the GM's goal is to sell out the tickets and win the conference championship and it actually tiers it down. It's like, \"Well, there's a defensive line coordinator.\" I'm not even that big of a sports person, but it's like the defensive line coordinator's job is just one specific thing, but they kind of explain how it all levels up to this one North Star metric for the company or two in that case. And I think that's just so important and when you're talking to people at your company with your colleagues, it's not just what it does. It's like, \"This product will automate people's money movement so they don't have to move their money and it happens automatically.\" And that's cool, but it's equally as important to remind everyone, \"And then they don't have to worry about their money every week and then they don't have to worry that their contributions might leave them without enough money in their checking account to pay their rent.\"\n\n(00:17:22):\nThere's these two components of it which are, what does it do, but what's the feeling you want someone to have? And that gets into product vision versus just the product feature set. And whenever we've written product visions statements about things we're building, it's like, \"Imagine a world where someone can feel this way about their money.\" And it's like, \"And then this thing will do that.\" That's the product strategy. It's how you execute on it. And so Reforge has this awesome product strategy kind of product vision roadmap that levels them all up, which I really like as a another resource.\n\nLenny (00:17:54):\nThe Reforge. I just recorded another podcast this morning actually, and what you just said reminded me of it, where a lot of people focus too much on features and not enough on benefits. And the stuff you're talking about is just like, \"Think about what are the benefits of the person.\" Versus, \"Here's feature one, feature two, feature three.\"\n\nChris Hutchins (00:18:10):\nThe last little skill, and I know you, you've talked about this, but I think it's something that I was fortunate enough to not care about. Which I think is, when you focus too much at a company about like, \"Ooh, I want the promotion\" you get caught up in this world where you're like, \"If I want the promotion, I need to do what my boss wants.\" And I had this fortunate benefit of... Like my last job, I was the CEO. I didn't care about my title, I didn't care about leveling up. I came in and I was like, \"I want to continue trying to execute on this vision of this thing that I wanted to do.\" What that actually meant was my only metric I cared about was impact and trying to build a product that would work. And I think in any job in any company, it turns out you think that doing what your boss wants is actually what's going to get you promoted.\n\n(00:18:55):\nBut the people that I've had work for me or I've worked alongside that seem to always be the outperformers, are always the people that are just solely focused on having the most impact on the company. I think the thing I learned, which I thanks to Andy Rachleff for teaching me this is when you push so hard for your ideas and you have really strong beliefs, you have to also make sure you state your intent. Because sometimes people think you're acting out of self-interest. I'd be like, \"Oh, we should delete this feature and build this crazy thing. It's going to be amazing.\" And people are like, \"Oh, Chris just thinks his idea is better than everyone.\"\n\n(00:19:27):\nAnd so he taught me, he's like, \"It would go a long way before you said that, you said, \"Hey guys, I've got some crazy ideas, but before I say them, I just want you to know that all I care about is that the company is successful. And I think this idea will make the company successful. And that's why I'm so excited about it. I don't need to own it. I don't care who owns it, I'm just really excited about it.\"\" And when you state your intent, you give people a little bit of ease in thinking you know what it might be. And even though I'm sure half the people listening work at a company where their culture is like assume best intent is one of the pillars, it's still our nature to assume that if someone's shooting down an idea we have that maybe it's out of their own self-interest.\n\n(00:20:03):\nAnd I've learned that when you have crazy ideas and when you're pushing back against a lot of people, if you can make sure you constantly remind them why you're doing it and what you care about, it goes a lot further than if you just kind of come in there with sharp elbows and try to push for crazy things.\n\nLenny (00:20:19):\nReminds me, I think Andy is the person who on a podcast once said that every year he picks like a, \"We're going to bet the company on this idea.\" Kind of project, is that?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:20:28):\nI would say we've done that a few times. I think the thing that I always told people that I wanted to work on is like, \"I want to work on a project that if successful makes everything we do as a company today feel like it's not that important because we did something that was 10 times bigger than everything we're doing today. And what we're doing now is just 10% of the company.\" Those are the kind of crazy ideas I like to work on. They're very hard sometimes you're like, \"Ooh, I've got one.\" And then it just doesn't work. Sometimes you do one and it takes a turn. But I think that when companies find those things, they're so powerful. But if you don't have the buy-in for management that that's your goal... Andy, he always talks about slugging average, not batting average. He's like, \"I don't care if you hit the ball every time. If one in 10 times you hit a home run that's better than someone who hits it every three out of 10 times but gets out a lot.\"\n\n(00:21:15):\nHe thought about that and the balance. He's written a lot internally about the balance between working on iterative improvements to current features and then taking big bets and trying to find the balance amongst it all. But I think he does believe there is always exploration necessary for taking big bets and trying to take swings that could have outsized impact. You got to balance it because you're often wrong. And I think that's something that I was like, \"That's the thing I want to work on.\" As someone who is kind of running a company, when you get to go to a big company and you're like, \"Now I can solely focus just on this big product bet. I don't have to worry about hiring and recruiting and all these other things.\" So that was fun.\n\nLenny (00:21:52):\nSpeaking of being solely focused on something, let's talk about the podcast. So this is kind of the new thing that you're going to be focused on full-time. You just left Wealthfront and you launched the podcast maybe a year and a half ago, correct me if I'm wrong, by a year and a half ago. The podcast is Top 30, top 40 business podcast. It's probably gone a lot of higher at some points. And so there's a bunch of questions I want to ask about just how you launched this thing and built this thing. But broadly, what did I miss about the [inaudible 00:22:18] framing of the podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:22:18):\nOh, yeah. That's it. It's about 18 months old. Been doing, gosh, probably about almost 100 episodes, not quite there. Weekly show and I went on parental leave part of the last 18 months and I tried to balance family and just grinding on this and it's been a passion project on the side and I'm very excited to see all the different kind of legs and tentacles that the brand and the content can have.\n\nLenny (00:22:45):\nWhat kind of benefits and good things have come out of having a podcast and launching a podcast or running a podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:22:51):\nI think we all run into people and you're like, \"Gosh, this person's really smart. I wish that I could just pick their brain for an hour.\" And sometimes you could just email them, be like, \"Hey, could we schedule some time in a month and we could just chat?\" But that sometimes just feels like a weird thing to ask. The podcast gives you this great platform, you're like, \"Well, I have a podcast. And so I would love to invite you on and help you amplify your message and spend an hour trying to understand everything about topic X, Y, Z.\" And sometimes it's really nerdy and nuanced and sometimes it's broad, but being able to have a reason. I think one of my first episodes was with a guy named Morgan Housel who wrote a book called Psychology of Money. I read the book, I was like, \"This is a great book. I have so many questions.\"\n\n(00:23:32):\nBut like what I'm I going to od? Randomly email this person I don't know and say, \"Hey, I loved your book. Can I just ask you questions for 45 minutes?\" I would never do that. But I randomly emailed him and said, \"Hey, we've never met. But I have a podcast.\" I don't even think it had launched, \"It's launching next week, but I'm really excited about it. Could I pick your brain?\" And he was like, \"Sure.\" So I would say the biggest thing is it just gives you a platform to explore your curiosities on things provided that you can really focus the thing that you talk about on one vertical, niche, something so that people learn what it's about. Because the hardest part about podcast growth is there's like four million podcasts and you've got to find a way to stand out in a sea of many podcasts.\n\nLenny (00:24:12):\nLet's actually talk about that. I was going to ask you about that. There's like four million you said, that seems right. It's probably a four million launched to date. Also, if you're someone that's thinking about, \"Should I do a podcast? Should I not do a podcast?\" Do you have any advice for just signs that this might be a worthwhile endeavor with your time versus signs you probably should not do this, do not even-\n\nChris Hutchins (00:24:34):\nI'll give you two perspectives. So one is, yes, there are four million podcasts. However, there are only about 150,000 podcasts that have had 10 episodes and have published in the last 10 days. So the easiest way to be in that top, I don't know, 5% ish. I don't know what the math there is, about %3, 4%, is to just stick to it. If you just do an episode a week, for 10 weeks, you're now in the top 4% of all podcasts that anyone has created. Now, that doesn't mean you're in the top 4% of the 150 active podcasts. So what I would say to that is... I mean, maybe you have a massive platform already, in which case just go start the podcast. But if you don't already have a massive platform, it is unlikely statistically, that this thing is going to work. So absolutely, do not start the podcast if you wouldn't do it for free, making no amount of money in perpetuity or as long as you want to experiment with.\n\n(00:25:31):\nThat's one thing I'll throw out there is you are most likely going to start a podcast and it will not take off and be wildly successful. However, I've met plenty of people who have hundreds of listeners and hundreds of episodes and they stuck at it because they truly loved the thing. If you don't know if you love the thing, it's very easy, which is what I did to say, \"I'm going to have one season of eight episodes.\" And I committed to record eight interviews and put eight interviews out in the world. That was it all I committed to myself. And I said, \"If that doesn't work, then I will be fine and say, \"Here is season one and there's just not a season two.\" And I would be okay with it.\" So you can commit to see if you like it before you do it, but chances are, and you might have found something similar when you started creating content, it's like for the first six, nine months, there's no revenue coming in.\n\n(00:26:23):\nIt's a lot more work than it seems. Everyone I know that has no podcast and goes to having a podcast, they're like, \"Oh my gosh, I thought this was just once, one hour a week, I just talked to somebody.\" It's like, \"Now, I have to prepare for it. I got to write up show notes, I got to make sure it's edited properly, I got to recruit people. Turns out you reach out to 10 people, two reply, one is willing to schedule this week.\" There's just a lot that goes into it. So I'd say only do it if you're excited to do it, even if five people are on the other end.\n\nLenny (00:26:49):\nTalking about the time investment, how long does it take you per episode, hours-wise? And then how long did it take you to kind of prep launch?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:26:59):\nAnd this has evolved a bit as the podcast has generated enough revenue to hire other people. But in general, I would probably spend, depending on how well I knew the topic or the person, anywhere from two to 10 hours preparing for an interview. If someone wrote a book at the beginning I was like, I got to read the whole book, I got to take notes. Then I was like, \"Well, if I read the whole book and take notes, then I kind of know everything. So I'm going to read a few chapters.\" I wanted to listen to everyone on different interviews. Some people are really hard, some people have only talked about one topic and you want to get them on another topic. I interviewed Carrie Walsh Jennings, who's a three time gold medalist at the Olympics for beach volleyball. And I listened to every interview she'd ever done because only 3% of each interview was about not volleyball stuff.\n\n(00:27:45):\nAnd I was like, \"Well, I don't want to talk about volleyball, I want to talk about performance and how you can train.\" She won a gold medal while she was pregnant. This is a serious level of physical and mental preparedness that I wanted to dig into. So that's one big piece of it. After it's done, then it really depends on the style of show. If you have this NPR style editing where it's very narrative driven, it could take you a long time to go through the editing. For me with interview style, I think it takes me about an hour to go back and listen to it at a little, speed up pace. And then go in and be like, \"Ah, this thing wasn't worth keeping in. Or I mean, we had to repeat something and let's cut that out, or this person stumbled on their words.\"\n\n(00:28:27):\nFortunately there's some amazing software. Now I use a piece of software called Descript, which basically imports all the audio, transcribes it to, let's call it like 95% accuracy. And then you can edit the podcast like you would edit a Google Doc. It's crazy. You're just like, \"Oh, let's delete all the ums, control F, um. Ignore all ums.\" And then you listen through it and you're like, \"Oh, that um, was really necessary, let's put it back in.\" And little edits like that. But that tool makes the editing process really easy. From the get-go, I had an audio engineer who would actually mix and master and add in the music and that kind of stuff.\n\n(00:29:02):\nSo I would say each guest is probably at least 10 hours plus probably two or three hours of coordination and outreach to three or four people that you reach out to in order to get the one. Now I've since, hired someone who helps do a little bit of research. So they might go listen to two or three episodes, read a couple chapters of book and put up some notes with links to those various places. So I can then take that and take my time from 10 hours to three hours.\n\nLenny (00:29:31):\nI'll share my experience briefly. It's a little different, which is really interesting to hear your experience. So I launched the complete opposite of your advice, which is I just launched big with like, \"I will do this forever. This is my new thing. I have 40 guests lined up, here's who they're going to be.\" And I think it's partly because I already went through that initial period of uncertainty, whether I can keep this up with a newsletter, which you said eight to nine months. Which is exactly how long it took me to do the newsletter every week to get to a point where I'm like, \"Yes, I can keep this up for years. Let's start adding a paid plan.\" So I think I was just more confident that I can keep at it.\n\n(00:30:06):\nAnd then I actually planned to monetize from the beginning. I think partly again, because I had the newsletter already. And I will say, so I don't edit that myself. I have a production group that is a game changer. So you can save a lot of time and I don't know if you've gone to a producer or anything, but I feel like most people eventually do.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:30:25):\nI've now switched to someone who went back, listened to the first 20 or 30 episodes and said, \"Oh, I get what you like to cut out of a conversation.\" And I'll end and say, \"Hey, take that 90-minute conversation. And I think there's probably 20 minutes to cut out.\" And they do a very good job of getting pretty close.\n\nLenny (00:30:42):\nAwesome.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:30:42):\nTo the point that some episodes I'm just like, I don't even look at it.\n\nLenny (00:30:45):\nYeah.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:30:45):\nIt's just recorded and done.\n\nLenny (00:30:46):\nYeah.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:30:47):\nWhen it comes to launch, I would say one of my suggestions is to get a few things in the bag. Line up... You don't want to launch and then be scrambling. So I tend to think launching with two or three episodes, either all at once or in a week is a really valuable strategy. You talked about in the intro, you're like, \"Sometimes it's been a higher ranked, but top 30.\" I think I've been top 100 in the business category all the way to top five in the business category, maybe top 10 and just all the way in between.\n\n(00:31:18):\nAnd the reason for that is that the ranking charts are all driven by different variables than you would imagine. They're driven a lot by momentum of new subscribers, at least on the Apple charts than actual downloads. So I have a friend who launched a podcast and had a huge following on social media and so out the gate was able to garner a ridiculous number of new subscribers to the point that she was the number two podcast overall, all podcasts in the world.\n\nLenny (00:31:45):\nHoly shit.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:31:45):\nIt is crazy for a week or two, a woman named Erika Colberg, she has a podcast called Erika Talk.\n\nLenny (00:31:51):\nOh, yeah.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:31:53):\nBut it's not number two anymore because it's so driven on the momentum of how often you can get new subscribers. She's still in the top 100 of business podcasts, but to get to the number two spot overall, it's all about number of new followers per hour. And if you can get a ton of traffic early on, you can drive that. And I will say the value of you doing that is now you've got this screenshot of like, \"Look, I was top 10.\" And by the way, she did the same thing I did. The moment I was top 10, the second I was in top 10, I immediately took all those guests that were on my dream list and I was like, \"Hey, I've got a top 10 podcast. Go look at it right now and see that it's in the top 10.\" So you can always say that forever after it happens once, you can always use those things. So capitalize on that.\n\n(00:32:39):\nSo you had the newsletter before. I had a newsletter I'd written on casually for various things throughout my life and for my last startup. And so I kind of put it all together to try to carry a big launch so that we really spike the rankings, maybe qualify for Apple does this new and noteworthy thing. And so there's a lot of stuff you can do to build momentum at launch, but at the end of the day, all the momentum in the world doesn't matter if your content's not good. So I try to say content for me is product market fit for building software. It's like you need to have a good podcast. And so if you launch big, one of the downsides is you're like, you don't really get that moment of tweaking and testing and seeing how it is. And I will say, I did five episodes in the fifth one. I was like, \"This is number one.\" The first one I recorded came out, I don't know, fifth. But the fifth one I recorded came out first because I just knew it was episode one.\n\n(00:33:32):\nAnd the guest that I had on, and we talked about travel hacks, a guy named Leigh Rowan, he's come on twice. It was just like this awesome energy episode about everything you want to know about travel hacks, allthehacks.com/one. So save yourself the need to scroll through the whole list. But if your content isn't a unique perspective, you don't have a unique way of saying it. It's going to be really hard to stand out in the sea of podcasts. So I always say, be you, be authentic. Try to be someone's favorite. Don't try to be everyone's okay podcast. I remember Tim Ferris was saying... I got a chance to go on Tim Ferris's show and interview him about podcasting. And he's like, \"Look, I did an episode about how to...\" I think it was like how to make violins or something. And he's like, \"I was so fascinated about this. 80% of people were like, what is this episode? But 20% of people thought it was one of the best episodes I'd done that year.\"\n\n(00:34:24):\nAnd I think half of his top 10 episodes of all time are people you wouldn't recognize. So I would focus on what gets you excited, not focus on what you think will move the metrics. Because every time I have a guest where I'm like, \"I really think this person's going to move the metrics.\" It doesn't. And then I interview someone who no one has ever heard of, and I get these emails like, \"Wow, that was such a good episode. Can't be. Oh man, I'm so glad you did that one.\" I was like, \"You don't even know this person is.\"\n\nLenny (00:34:50):\nVery similar experience in many ways across a lot of the things that you said. Something that you did mention that you shared previously with me is, and this is advice that I've thought about a lot, is you should be somebody's favorite podcast. That's like a sign that you're doing something right. Can you expand on that?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:35:08):\nThere's this whole idea of your build your 1000 true fans. And I think anytime you're creating something in the world, you want people to be your advocates for it because those are the people that are going to share it. Those are the people that are going to write the reviews, those are the people that are going to send you the ideas. Those are the people that are ultimately, when you make a call-out on a podcast like, \"Hey, I'm looking for someone to help build this company or this enterprise.\" That are going to reach out and want to work for you. I find it so valuable to build that relationship with people. And it's even more valuable with podcasting because podcasting is such an intimate medium. You're in someone's ear and they're actively listening to you while they're going about their life. They're going on a walk, they're [inaudible 00:35:52], but you're right there.\n\n(00:35:53):\nAnd I get so many emails, they're like, \"Ah, I feel like I'm just sitting on the couch with you while you're talking to me.\" And you create this really close relationship and the more you can create for those people and be their favorite time of the day, their favorite thing. Someone once told me, \"Make sure you're consistent with the time you release because you'll get people that are like, \"It's Wednesday morning, where's my episode? This is how I... It's become a ritual in my life.\"\" And so, I don't know. I just think it's so valuable to build that early kind of excited user base and those 1000 true fans that I always try to put something out that's someone's favorite.\n\n(00:36:30):\nAnd I actually surveyed the audience about 50 episodes in and ask, \"Which was your favorite episode?\" And every episode except one was someone's favorite. There's one episode that, no one's favorite. So I'm still waiting. Maybe next time I survey someone will be like, \"No. No, that one was my favorite.\" But every other episode of 50 episodes was someone's favorite. And it was like the coolest feeling knowing that every episode was someone's favorite.\n\nLenny (00:36:57):\nThat's exactly what happens with my newsletter. I get a reply with every newsletter and someone's like, \"This is my favorite one yet.\" Okay, somebody really likes this one. It's so interesting.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:37:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:37:09):\nAre you hiring or on the flip side, are you looking for a new opportunity?

And then did you have just advice for folks for how to pick the topic for their podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:38:07):\nThis is an interesting one. So my podcast actually started as a parenting podcast from the perspective of dads. And I was doing all this research. I built this probably 75-page Notion doc all about parenting. It was like I had a kanban board for all the things I needed to do in each trimester of the pregnancy. And then the fourth trimester after the baby was born, I had all these checklists. I had a stroller spreadsheet that had, at least, let's call it 15, 20 different features that you could filter on. Dimensions, cubic volume of when you sum up the dimension, everything. It was crazy. And I was like, \"I'm so obsessed with this.\" And I was like, \"Nobody's really taking this kind of crazy optimized approach to processing parental information except a few people.\" Emily Oster, by the way, if anyone out there wrote a few books, I really loved her pragmatic science approach. But I just didn't see a lot of this and I especially didn't see as much content coming from dads.\n\n(00:39:07):\nAnd I was like, \"I'm so excited.\" And then we had our daughter and for some reason I was like, \"I love her. But the topic of parenting and optimizing every aspect of it just wasn't what it was before we had the child as after.\" I was like, \"Wow. But I bought this microphone and I figured out how to use all the editing software and I had never even recorded an episode.\" And it just ended up that I was like, \"That topic just wasn't right for me.\" And I went on another friend of mine's podcast guy named Kevin Rose, who was a co-founder of a company we started, he started Digg back in the day. And in the middle of it we'd been talking about this, I've been brainstorming ideas, and in the middle of his podcast he's like, \"Hey, tell us about your new podcast.\"\n\n(00:39:50):\nAnd then I was like, \"Kevin, I haven't nailed down what it is.\" And he's like, \"Yeah, it's fine. Why don't you just record a response to that question and email it to me before this episode goes live and then you could just tell everyone what your podcast is about.\" And then I was like, \"Okay, I'll think about it.\" And the next day he was like, \"Dude, I need this by Friday.\" I was like, \"Oh, man. So I have two days to figure out what my podcast is.\" And I talked to a lot of people and they're like, \"What do you love, what do you love talking about?\" I was like, \"Gosh.\" What question someone said is, when you're at a dinner table, what's the thing that you talk about where you notice that everyone at the table is leaning in and trying to listen and pick your brain on and maybe sends you a text after?\n\n(00:40:27):\nAnd I was like, \"It's probably all the hacks I have for traveling for free, for getting upgrades, for saving money, for shopping online, for optimizing my health or anything, house hacking, saving money on my rent.\" And every time I bring those up, people are like, \"I like saving money. I want to travel for free.\" And they're leaning in, they're like, \"Which credit card do I get? Is this one bad? What about this one?\" And I couldn't come up with a name. I had hundreds of names. It was like life upgraded, optimized your life. But every time I described what it was, I just said, \"It's life upgraded. I'll teach you all the hacks to do this.\" And then someone, I can't even remember who was like, \"What about just All the Hacks?\" And then I looked and I was like, \"Is allthehacks.com available?\"\n\n(00:41:08):\nI was like, \"What? It's available.\" It's like... Get the domain. And then I very quickly recorded a response to Kevin's question, which was like, \"Yes, I'm launching a podcast called All the Hacks, here's what it is.\" And I had to go create a trailer and upload it all in three days. And I think I was fortunate that I just had the time pressure that I had a thing to get out. So I'd say one, what do you love talking about at the dinner table? What gets you excited? What do people reach out to you for expertise on? What do you spend your time going down deep rabbit holes on the internet on? Because all of those things are going to be part of your life as a creator. And then two, if there's any way you can force yourself to just have to make a decision because I get stuck in this analysis paralysis, that's great.\n\n(00:41:51):\nSo find some friend of yours that's like, \"I'm tweeting about your podcast on Friday, or I'm going to include you in my newsletter next month.\" And give yourself an artificial deadline or even a real deadline to just put a stake in the ground. And you could change the name, you could pivot the topic, you could pivot the style of content. All those things can happen after, but just get started because you'll get to learn whether you like doing it, how it feels. And you could always... This is another fun hack. You could create a podcast and make a private feed and people can add a private feed to their podcast app. So if you want to get some feedback, you can just send people a URL and say, \"Hey, paste this URL and the Apple Podcast player and listen to a couple episodes and let me know what you think.\" Before you make that plunge to send it to the whole world.\n\nLenny (00:42:34):\nAwesome. I actually heard that interview with Kevin Rose back in the day, and I checked out the podcast, I think I actually subscribed and it felt very natural. So nice job.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:42:43):\nYeah. Little did you know that it was inserted in post production, recorded on a separate system. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:42:49):\nSo people listening to this made feel like, \"Hey, I don't have Kevin Rose announcing my podcast. How do I get started? How do I get my initial traction in my podcast?\" Do you have any advice there for people that are just launching things they could do to get their initial set of subscribers and get the word out and get some kind of traction without a friend with a huge platform?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:43:08):\nYes. I interviewed a guy named Nick Gray, and it was a fun conversation because he wrote a book called The 2-Hour Cocktail Party, and it was all about how to build relationships by throwing the best cocktail parties. And it was very tactical guide, but one of the things he does is he has a friend's newsletter. And he basically created a newsletter and every time he meets someone that is a friend of his, he sends him a note, says, \"Can I add you to my friend's newsletter?\" People say, yes. And he just shares, \"Here's some cool articles I'm reading. Here's a cool thing I'm doing in my life. Here's a picture.\" It's instead of waiting till the holidays to send your holiday card to everyone that's like, \"Here's what happened this year. Or maybe now we've...\" That's what my grandparents did. Now it's just like, \"Here's a photo of the family.\"\n\n(00:43:45):\nHe just sends it out. I don't even know what the cadence is. It's just like every now and then I get an email and it's like, \"Oh, this what Nick's up to, this is pretty cool.\" Anyone can subscribe to it. And he shares all these great things. He's like, \"Ah, I was thinking about a virtual assistant. Here's 75 things that I dreamed up that I could send to a virtual assistant.\" I was like, \"That's really cool.\" \"Here's how I tweak my Calendly. And I sent the Calendly to you. It's like I added a few little things in it that...\" He had suggestions to just make it a little more friendly, make it a little more comfortable. The one I loved was like, \"If I'm not arrived within two minutes of the start time, here is my cell phone number. I just want to make sure I'm prompt. And people know that.\"\n\n(00:44:19):\nAnd so, one thing is, before you even get started, find a way to just build an audience of your closest friends, family, colleagues, and throw stuff out in the world. You don't have to do it weekly or monthly. You could just send it out every quarter, every six months, it doesn't matter. But start to build something. So I started with a new, I think it was on MailChimp, called Life Updates. And I think I sent five of these out 10 years ago, and I hadn't really sent one out in seven years, but I still had this email newsletter with 1100 people on it that I just collected from life. And so that was one thing. Look, you can always go out and try to find other creative ways to partner with people. So you have a newsletter, but you don't have a podcast.\n\n(00:45:03):\nCould you use your newsletter to promote something? Could you find someone who has a platform that you could trade your services for promotional things? Yeah, I can think of any couple examples where there's been something where I've been really excited use and I'm like, \"Hey, could I talk to my audience about this thing? And then you could let me use this?\" So if there's anything, whether it's consulting services or anything, you could maybe trade those services for other people with an audience to share and promote you. I think that happens more often than not. But again, it all matters if you have good content. So I'd say the first thing, the most important thing to grow a piece of content is just have it be good. And it's hard to know what's good. Put it out in the world, see if people like it. Maybe get your reps in before you even try some of these growth things.\n\n(00:45:46):\nI think I was fortunate to have done some public speaking before, so I felt a little more comfortable. But if you... You mentioned MrBeast earlier, he's very public about the fact, if you go back 10 years and look at his YouTube videos, they were not exciting like they are now. And it took him a long time. And I think that's the reality with content is, for almost every person that you see out there and you're like, \"Wow, they have this huge audience. It's so awesome.\" You go back 10 years and you're like, \"Oh, well their first episode wasn't that awesome. It was actually kind of crazy. Or it wasn't that interesting. And they got better over time. They learned what their audience liked, they built a following.\" So those things are all there. Find communities. If you're talking about a very specific thing, I never forgot Gary Vaynerchuk's lesson, gosh, he probably told me this 13 years ago.\n\n(00:46:32):\nHe was like, \"When he was starting Wine Library.\" Which most people don't maybe even know that that's what he was originally known for. He wanted to build this business and so he went on Twitter and he looked for every single person that asked a question about wine and he at replied them back. And so a tactic that I think could work really well is, for me, I'm like, \"I love travel. I love points and miles.\" I can just search Twitter and find every person on Twitter, every person on Reddit, every person on a forum, whatever that's asking a question about the thing my podcast answers, and go in and try to be a value add to them. I guarantee that if you have a podcast and your favorite thing is quilting and in your bio on Twitter, maybe Twitter's not the right platform, but let's just go with the analogy, right?\n\n(00:47:14):\nYour bio says , \"Top quilting podcast.\" And you go find everyone that's asking questions about quilting and answer their questions with strong, good answers. They're going to look at your bio and be like, \"Oh my gosh, this person knows their stuff about this topic. Let's go see what they do.\" And you have these advocates they share in their communities and it grows over time. I'll come back to one more tactic, which I didn't do, but there's no built-in distribution engine in podcasting. TikTok, you make a TikTok video, TikTok sends it to like a hundred people and if no one likes it dies. But if like a few people like it, they send it to more people and more people. And YouTube does the same thing. Instagram Reels does the same thing. Podcasting doesn't have that, and so it's just a slow growth effort and you just have to be okay with that.\n\n(00:47:59):\nBut what I didn't do early on, which you can do is you can make clips of your podcast and you could put those clips on these channels that do have that built in distribution. And if those clips do take off, they could build a massive audience. And so there's a guy, Danny Miranda, he has a podcast and he launched, didn't have a huge following, but he created clips of every single episode, lots of clips. He didn't know what was the most interesting piece of content, so he made a clip for everything. He built millions and millions of views on TikTok and Instagram, just by creating content from his podcast that drove downloads over to his podcast. Helped him build his audience, and he built an audience on social faster than I have a and bigger than I currently have out of just being all in on distributing his content on platforms that had growth engines built into it.\n\nLenny (00:48:48):\nThe last point is interesting because what I've been hearing, and I've actually experienced it, so I have TikTok clips, I have YouTube videos and YouTube shorts, and I find they drive followers within the platform and downloads and views, but I haven't seen any actual impact on the podcast. And maybe people can measure it or maybe they can tell something's happening, but from what I hear and what I've seen, I don't know if it actually drives a lot of downloads, but it's still really useful, still useful to have an awesome TikTok account and an awesome YouTube account.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:49:16):\nHe said, \"Look...\" I don't know if it drives downloads, but it drives brand awareness for me.\n\nLenny (00:49:20):\nYeah.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:49:20):\nAnd he's had multiple guests be like, \"Oh yeah, I'd love to go on your show.\" One of the clips he made, he made a clip talking about Ray Dalio. And Ray Dalio was like reposting his clip. And so he was getting a lot of engagement with people that would be very difficult to reach out to saying, \"I have this many downloads.\" But because he was getting thousands or even millions of views across a platform, it gave him the credibility to do a lot of things that he might not have been able to do now. Then he's gone and translated that into, \"Well, let's go bring some of these people with really, really wide distribution of their podcast onto my show and let's do an interview with them.\" Then for the most part, people are like, \"Oh, let's distribute that content to my audience that you had me on.\"\n\n(00:50:03):\nOne thing he did that was so good is he did all of his videos in person, so he would fly to someone record in person, and the quality of the video for an in-person video was just so much better than you get doing a remote thing. It's a lot harder. It's a lot more work and it doesn't even impact the audio, but he would make the best quality clips, and Erika Colberg does the same thing. And she would deliver them and he would deliver them to the guests, and now the guest starts using those clips because he spent so much time trying to come up with the best clips, the highest quality, best produced that made his guests look amazing. And then those guests were much more likely to share those in their audiences and all of a sudden you've got a lot of momentum.\n\n(00:50:44):\nDoes that translate to downloads? I'll give you a little shout-out, Danny has a paid newsletter on Substack where he actually breaks down all his downloads and all his tactics on how this is all working for him. And it's fascinating, it's called In The DM, because he did a lot of his early on recruiting with guests in DMS on social media. But it's to be seen, how much of an impact it can have on your podcast, but it certainly builds other things that are, I'd say like indirect... There's no direct attribution, but that doesn't mean that things aren't overall going up. And then the last one is finding other podcasts that you can go on as an expert in some area. So hopefully, you're starting a podcast because you believe something is exciting in the world, you love it, you have a passion about it, you're an expert in it.\n\n(00:51:32):\nTake that thing and go present yourself to other podcasts. And they all have listeners that are listening to podcasts, so it's the best medium. Because yes, someone who likes short form, 60-second videos is maybe not the best target demo to listen to a one-hour audio only thing, those two are very different behaviors. But if you can find something you're really good at and present a value add to people to come on their show, then that could help you build your audience while adding value to their audience. And I think as someone who gets a lot of pitches from people to come on their podcast, I will only caveat it with, do the work to make sure you're really presenting a compelling pitch. You're going to get a lot of nos, that's just how it works. I've pitched myself to go on lots of shows and sometimes I get nos also.\n\n(00:52:19):\nMany times I get nos, but I never send an email that's like someone would read it and be like, \"This person obviously, doesn't know what they're talking about.\" But I get so many, they're like, \"Oh, I'd love to have my client come on your podcast. They love talking about building a business.\" And I was like, \"Well, I don't really interview people about that.\" If someone came to me and was like, \"Here is a tactic to improve your life that I think your audience would benefit from and here's why my expertise makes me the best person to talk about it.\" I'd be much more open to it because they actually understood what my show is about.\n\nLenny (00:52:51):\nYeah, I get it. At least, one email a day with one of these pitches and I know exactly what you mean. I generally, don't reply because it's just not even worth trying to convince them they're not a fit.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:53:00):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:53:01):\nShifting gears a little bit, I want to talk about your stack, your podcasting stack. What do you use on the software? What do you use the hardware? Mic, headphones. What do you recommend?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:53:11):\nOn a mic? I started out with the ATR2100X, I think it is a great entry level mic. It's under a $100. You can use old analog XLR cables if you want, but it's also USB. That mic got me through 50 episodes. I have since upgraded to a Shure SM7B, which is the XLR compatriot to, I think you have a Shure MB7.\n\nLenny (00:53:36):\nYeah, I have the USB version if that's what-\n\nChris Hutchins (00:53:38):\nYeah, exactly. And those are two great kind of upgrade mics that I think... I like the sound quality a little better, but every time I'm traveling and I'm not sure if something's going to come up, if I can make a recording and if I have to record the intro, do a remote interview, I still carry the ATR2100X, because I just think it's an easy thing to have and it works really well. I record everything on Riverside. I put everything into Descript. I plug my XLR mic into a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2, which is like a audio interface. I would say I've gone a little bit overboard with video, so we were talking right before this started. I have a Sony a7C, which is like a mirrorless, full frame camera behind a $60 Amazon teleprompter so that I can make direct eye contact with the camera while an iPad that's... I don't know, it's like 10-year-old iPad sits under it and projects as a second screen for my computer, using this-\n\nLenny (00:54:36):\n[inaudible 00:54:36] If you're not watching this YouTube, you got to check out the YouTube video at least for five seconds to see Chris just staring at you. I've never seen this on a podcast video before.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:54:43):\nYeah,\n\nLenny (00:54:44):\nIt's the future.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:54:45):\nSo I have that set up using a iPad, running an app called Duet Display. I don't do the editing. I've worked with one editor that uses Audition and one that uses Pro Tools. I don't have a strong opinion there. Oh, my favorite of all, my friend of mine, Brendan Mulligan, started this company called Podpage. And so for people who don't know a lot about how podcasting works, there's a hosting platform, I use Simple Cast. I liked that they were one of the only hosting platforms that has a really affordable self-serve option, but also has a really great pro, all the features that you would want in the future for monetization, everything so that you wouldn't have to switch. Not to say that you know couldn't switch easily, it's pretty easy to switch. How it works is you upload an MP3 file, you write out all your show notes, the title of the episode, everything, and they create an RSS feed for you.\n\n(00:55:36):\nYou could literally just create an RSS feed, right? That's all it really is, and you could host everything on your own on AWS or something, but they make it really easy for not that much money. And then you go distribute that RSS feed to all of these different players, so the Apple Podcast app, Spotify, et cetera. And one of the things that's amazing is this site Podpage, you submit the RSS feed to this website and they go in and say, \"Oh, here's the description of the podcast. Here's each episode. Here's the cover art you submitted for that episode. Here's the title, here's the show notes.\" And they just auto-generate a website for you. And then they give you the tools like a WordPress style set of tools to go and change the header, change the descriptions. They're like, \"You could go in and tweak things.\" But every night on Wednesday, or I guess Wednesday morning at 2:00 AM my podcast goes live. And at 2:05 Podpage has already noticed, the RSS feed is up-to-date and that site is posted. I don't have to do anything.\n\n(00:56:30):\nThey even monitor for the slug, like the URL slug I put in as a checkout. This podcast at this URL and podcast page says, \"Oh, that's the URL you want them to check out. We're going to inherit that and put it in so you don't even have to give us any information. And we'll just know the URL that you want to set this episode up on.\" I think that is a super simple way to build a podcasting website. The only other thing, we didn't talk at all about analytics at all, but I use Chartable for analytics. And podcast analytics are a little crazy because you don't have a lot to go on. But Chartable is a really cool analytics platform that becomes really interesting when you start to cross promo with other shows or run ads for other shows or do anything like that because they basically can track IP address of downloads.\n\n(00:57:22):\nAnd I say track, I don't know who's listening to what from where in any kind of very specific way. But what I do know is if I'm doing a cross promo with another show where I'm saying, \"Hey, check out a podcast I love.\" And they're saying, \"Check out a podcast I love.\" It actually says, \"Oh, how many of the people that downloaded this episode actually went and listened to this other episode?\" So you can get direct attribution of podcast listeners going from one podcast to another. So that is a really important tool in my kind of running a podcast toolkit, but it doesn't matter as much until you start focusing on growth and doing promotions and stuff like that.\n\nLenny (00:57:58):\nAwesome. I host on Substack as maybe one difference. I use Podpage for my site, my producer/editor people actually use Descript/Descript also. That's kind of what they use for editing professionally, so it's good for amateur hour and good for professionals as well. I use Chartable, something's up with my Chartable, I think I've told you, or it doesn't count my Spotify downloads. It's kind of a pain in the butt, but it's still-\n\nChris Hutchins (00:58:21):\nWhich is funny by the way, because for anyone listening doesn't know, Spotify actually owns Chartable. So the one platform your Chartable doesn't get good download data from, is the one that it is owned by.\n\nLenny (00:58:33):\nYep. I do not understand what is going on. I've talked to them and they don't know what the fix is. It doesn't matter anyway. I get enough analytics other places. There's one other site I'd recommend called Podstatus that just gives you quick access to where you're on the charts every day, gives you these cool line charts. Which Chartable sort of does, but it's a lot simpler on Podstatus. But otherwise-\n\nChris Hutchins (00:58:53):\nAwesome.\n\nLenny (00:58:53):\nAll the same stuff. One other question real quick. Say someone launches their podcast, what would be a good download goal to aim for, when you're getting started that's like, \"Maybe this is working.\" Do you have a sense of a threshold try to hit?\n\nChris Hutchins (00:59:08):\nI wouldn't think of a threshold to hit because you could launch with a huge audience and have a terrible podcast and you might hit 10,000 downloads and it would be crazy, right? You would feel really good. So I would care more about the direction than about the number because even the Apple charts, they're more momentum driven. You could have one download, but the next week you have a lot more and a lot more and a lot more. You would actually rise in the charts faster than someone whose podcast is kind of stagnant doing X number of downloads. If you have 3000 downloads an episode or something like that, you're in the top 1% or something. So you know, don't have to get to crazy numbers to be in the top of the charts.\n\nLenny (00:59:08):\nYeah, I heard-\n\nChris Hutchins (00:59:08):\nI would say-\n\nLenny (00:59:54):\nI heard a similar number, 3000.\n\nChris Hutchins (00:59:55):\nThe top podcasts are doing millions in episode, but that's like top 10, top 20, top 30. The next tranche of the top 50 are doing probably hundreds of thousands of downloads. But outside of the top two, 300, it's in the 10,000s of downloads per episode. And this is a little bit variable if you have a daily show or a weekly show or something. But I would say if you cross 10,000 downloads an episode, you are now taken seriously by a lot of people. So I had conversations early on with networks like iHeartMedia and different podcast networks that wanted to bring in the show and would do all that, and that all started at 10 to 15, maybe 20,000 downloads an episode. But by no means would I expect anyone to get there right away. Even I didn't get there right away. It took time even with a few friends to make announcements and stuff, it took time.\n\n(01:00:50):\nSo forget how many downloads you get on your first three episodes because you're probably going to tell everyone in the world and you're going to use all your social capital to boost those. And then look at how many downloads you get on your fourth and fifth and sixth and does it go up? Does it stay stagnant? Apple and Spotify actually give you really cool data about how long people are listening. Do they drop off halfway through? You could start to be like, \"Oh, do people stay for the whole episode?\" I will say I haven't found a good site for benchmarks, but it's like the average podcast I think probably has less than 50% of listeners by the end. So don't be turned off when you say, \"Wow, only 40% of people made it to the end.\" That's not horrible. I think my best episode, it might be like 65 or 70% of people made it all the way to the end. It's not 99.\n\nLenny (01:01:37):\nWhat I like about those charts is you can see what percentage of people skip the ads and then just keep continuing. It's like a bump-\n\nChris Hutchins (01:01:42):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:42):\nThe mid-rolls and the-\n\nChris Hutchins (01:01:44):\n[inaudible 01:01:44] And it's not as high as I thought.\n\nLenny (01:01:46):\n10, 20% depending on-\n\nChris Hutchins (01:01:47):\nMaybe 15%. It depends.\n\nLenny (01:01:48):\nYeah. Not bad at all.\n\nChris Hutchins (01:01:51):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:51):\nAny last words of wisdom on the world of podcasting? Starting a podcast? Continuing a podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:01:57):\nYeah, I've got three things for you. One, this is a little bit of a financial outlay, but I think it's really interesting. There's this podcast app called Overcast, and it's not the biggest in the world, but you can run ads in it. And the thing I like is that the ads are much more reasonably priced than a lot of other places and they're very dynamic. So I would encourage anyone listening to watch it for a few weeks if you have a podcast and you want to experiment, because the same ad could be $200 one week and $700 the next week depending on how much demand there is for that category. So you can wait and hold out. But what I like is they take your art from your podcast and then you can rewrite your description and they tell you how many people saw the ad, how many people tapped on it, and how many people subscribed to the podcast after seeing the ad.\n\n(01:02:43):\nAnd technically they could also listen to the trailer, they could listen to an episode. And they even give you benchmarks of what to expect. So for a few hundred dollars, you could go in and run an ad for your podcast. Now, I would say in all of the experiments I've done with them, I've probably garnered... I'm looking at some numbers, like hundreds of subscribers, not thousands. And I've probably spent maybe a $1,000. The average cost to acquire a podcast listener, if you're doing paid marketing is about anywhere from three to $10 depending on the appeal of your show, what kind of audience? I'm sure it could go way over that for a business show. And by business I mean, B2B focused kind of show. So, let's call it $5. So it's not going to be the best way to grow your audience. At some point, if you're at enough scale that you have ads in your show and how much a customer's worth, maybe it makes sense to pay $5 because your LTV of a podcast listener is $7. But getting it started, that's not you.\n\n(01:03:39):\nWhat you can do is say, \"Okay, what was my click-through rate on the ad?\" Which will tell you if someone doesn't click, it's either not a good description or it's not a good set of content, or your cover art's not good. So you can think about, \"Okay, I actually need to figure out the podcast before I even have content.\" And you could run this ad with a trailer before you even record anything. And then it's like, \"Okay, well people tapped on it, how many of them subscribed?\" And I like to use this as a way to say, \"Okay, well the benchmark said I was going to get about 50 subscriptions for this ad that was going to get a thousand taps and I got seven.\" So these aren't people who weren't interested. These are people who read the description, were like, this is interesting, and they didn't subscribe.\n\n(01:04:20):\nThat means my content probably sucks. That means someone listened to a trailer or an episode or something more than the description in the image and decided, \"This is not for me.\" Maybe they looked at your episodes, I don't know. But if they don't tap on it, if you're supposed to get a 2% click-through rate and you get 0.5, then it's actually the topic or the way I describe it or the cover sucks. And so I like that as a way to, for a few hundred dollars, get a good test. I've even thought of running an AB test of the same podcast with two different descriptions. I wish you could do it with two different cover arts. So I don't know, that's like a cheap way to do a little bit of testing. One other thing that I'll share is I just try to share the podcast everywhere.\n\n(01:05:05):\nSo you've probably noticed that in all of my emails at the bottom, it's like, \"Oh, great, talk to you Chris.\" And then it says, \"Hey, want to upgrade your life, money or travel? Check out my podcast and newsletter.\" I'm taking every opportunity I can to let anyone know about it because you never know it'll happen. And my favorite example, especially, when it's written that it doesn't come across a big bulky signature was we bought some floor mats and one of them didn't fit. And I was going back and forth with the customer service person and they actually replied and they were like, \"Oh, thanks for sending me that podcast. I really appreciate it.\" They thought I was just randomly telling them, \"Hey, if you want to upgrade your life, check this out.\" They didn't know it was my signature. So I got a new listener from customer service from a floor mat company. Which by the way, here's one hack that I also learned from the floor mat company.\n\n(01:05:52):\nCome to my show for hacks, but if you're ever trying to get a deal on something, that floor mat company, I just pulled up the live chat and just asked. And I said, \"Hey, I'm looking at these floor mats, think you could give me a discount. It's a little expensive.\" And it was like, \"Yeah, refresh your cart. It'll be 15% off.\" So, this episode's not about all the hacks, but there's one cool one.\n\nLenny (01:06:11):\nWe need more hacks. Wait, I think we'll get to that at the end. Keep going.\n\nChris Hutchins (01:06:14):\nAnd then the last is, I think it's fun, that podcast you can experiment. I started out doing guests and then I did some Q&A episodes from questions listeners asked me, and then I recently did some solo episodes. I was really interested in the idea of all the ways you can rent and swap and exchange your home to stay in vacation homes around the world. So I just researched it for, I don't know, two or three days and just did a 45-minute episode of me talking. There was no guest, there were no questions, it was just me talking. And that works. I'm going to start another series of episodes where instead of interviewing people about an expertise topic, I'm going to interview people who are really dialed into a country. So I've got a guy who's written a handful of the Lonely Planet guidebook for Japan and is in Japan right now for three weeks getting dialed in, what are the latest, coolest stuff.\n\n(01:07:03):\nHe's going to come back and we're just going to record an episode about everything you need to know about going to Japan. And I'm going to add on about 15 minutes I think at the end without him, where I just talk about all the tricks for using your points, your miles, deals and discounts. Like there's this new airline in LA that's super cheap to fly to Japan, but it comes with some caveats. So it'll be like two thirds guide to going to Japan, one third guide to getting there for cheap. And there aren't a lot of businesses or ideas where you could just have all of these things that you can experiment with.\n\nLenny (01:07:35):\nAnd then you could do them so fast. Yeah,\n\nChris Hutchins (01:07:35):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:35):\nI love that.\n\nChris Hutchins (01:07:37):\nIf I interview you, which I'm doing right after this, so anyone listening to this that wants to hear a little of Lenny's story, come check out All the Hacks. And for 20 minutes we talk about some topic that's a little off topic. I've sometimes just taken that it's submitted it as a bonus episode on Friday. 15, 20 minutes, it's not my regular show, but there's so many ways you can experiment and find out what you like. And then you might say, \"Wow, you know what? I really like doing the solo things.\" Or maybe you have a co-host on for a week and you're like, \"Ah, that's so much better.\"\n\n(01:08:07):\nSo I just love that it gives you a good opportunity to experiment with stuff, find the thing you love, because I think my big takeaway is once you find the thing you really love to talk about, all of that, it just makes everything so much easier because it's natural and you would do it for free. And the harsh reality of this whole game is like there's probably going to be a number of months or years you have to do it for free before it takes off. So if you don't love it, that's going to be a painful few years.\n\nLenny (01:08:31):\nTo build on that, I find the same thing with a newsletter, same with a podcast. The last thing you want to do is create a job for yourself that you hate. And so picking a topic that is just not interesting to you, picking a medium that is painful to you, there's no reason to do that. You may become a TikTok star and you hit a viral video, but then you have to make viral videos for the rest of your life. That's no fun. You have to think about, \"Do I want to do this for years and years and years.\" And you can stop, but then becomes hard if it becomes a really good source of income. So that's something to think about, just don't create a job for yourself that you just don't want.\n\nChris Hutchins (01:08:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:09:07):\nWith that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I don't know if you knew this was coming. So it'll be extra special, real quick, easy, whatever comes to mind, let me know, and then we'll see how it all goes. Does that sound good?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:09:18):\nThat sounds good.\n\nLenny (01:09:19):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people recently or in life in general?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:09:26):\nTwo, I love. Actually, this could be three, Happy Money is a fantastic book. All about ways that you can spend your money to optimize for happiness. It's like a collection of a ton of research about the science of happier spending, so that's one. Vagabonding by Rolf Potts, who I had the pleasure... The last two I've had the pleasure of interviewing recently. It's like a guide to long-term travel, but it's just kind of a different perspective on travel. I would say if you're at the point in your life where you now have kids, it's probably going to be hard to live up to that. But I have gifted that book to so many people who are like, \"Oh, I think I should take a trip for six months.\" I'm like, \"Go read this book.\" My wife and I travel around the World for seven months, and that book was instrumental to us taking it and how we lived on that.\n\n(01:10:09):\nAnd then the last is called Die with Zero by Bill Perkins. And that book probably had the biggest impact. I haven't gifted it to anyone. I've recommended it heavily the last week because it had a huge impact on me. And the fundamental premise of the book is that, this isn't very lightning round response, but instead of optimizing for money, which is so tied up in American culture of how do I make more, how do I get promoted? How do I earn more money, how do I save more money? We should really be optimizing for the net fulfillment in life, and we shouldn't be trying to save all of this money. We should actually be trying to allocate it over our lives in the most optimal way to increase experiences, increase fulfillment, increase happiness. And sometimes that means saving less when you're younger and you're more able to do things like backpack around the world for seven months or go bungee jumping. And when you build those experiences early on, the memories of those experience pay dividends, the rest of your life.\n\nLenny (01:11:04):\nGood choices. What's a favorite other podcast, other than your podcast and my podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:11:10):\nI love Animal Spirits. If you're into markets, life and investing. And they always have good recommendations at the end also on podcasts, TV shows, books, movies, that kind of stuff. So that's one I really like.\n\nLenny (01:11:23):\nWhat's a favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:11:28):\nA show that I love, which I think is kind of like a version of a show called Silicon Valley, but not, it's called Mythic Quests on Apple TV. And I haven't heard enough people talking about this that I felt like maybe it's a hidden gem. Maybe I'm amongst company of watching this show, but I think it's a funny show. It's lighthearted, it makes me happy, and hopefully at least a few people haven't checked it out. But it's like a startup life show, but just dragged out to the extreme like Silicon Valley was.\n\nLenny (01:11:55):\nWhat's a favorite interview question that you like to ask on your podcast?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:12:00):\nI like to try to ask people about their favorite misconceptions in a space. Yeah, I like to kick things off usually with, \"What's a thing that you kind of have a contrarian take on or you think most people get wrong about the thing that best?\"\n\nLenny (01:12:13):\nAwesome. Final question. What are your three favorite money hacks that listeners can take action on soon?\n\nChris Hutchins (01:12:23):\nOkay. One that has paid dividends and literally, I've had people on a podcast telling them, write back to me, guests that are like, \"I just saved money.\" So go to your state's unclaimed money website. Every state has one, and you can go put in your name, state or city, you don't even have to give your address. And you can find whether there are people that owe you money. And oftentimes they're businesses like you moved and Comcast couldn't figure out how to get you the final part of your prepaid month. And I had someone message me the other day and they're like, \"I just listened to you talk about unclaimed money on a podcast, and I just found $136. I've never gotten paid to listen to a podcast.\" People have saved hundreds, some people, thousands. I always say, if you're going to dinner party, you now know someone's address.\n\n(01:13:07):\nYou probably know their name instead of bringing a bottle of wine or in addition, just check if they have unclaimed money. I brought over to a bottle of wine to someone's house and said, \"Also, by the way, did you know that this pharmaceutical company owes you $200?\" And I showed him how to go claim it and boom, free money. What a great conversation for the dinner table. So that's one great one I love. Another great one, you can't use it right now unless you have a trip planned. But anytime you're booking a hotel book directly with the hotel and email the hotel in advance that, \"Hey, we booked. We're really excited to stay with you.\" If you're celebrating something, let them know. And if you can't get the email address, just call the front desk, ask for an email address, follow up a couple days before you get there, let them know you're coming.\n\n(01:13:51):\nAnd I would say, you've got a 50% chance of getting an upgrade, getting a bottle of wine, getting some comped something, getting a better view. One person wrote into me letting me know that the hotel had their initials embroidered on their pillow, which I thought was kind of a crazy thing to have happen. It's never happened to me. Personally, I'd rather have the bottle of wine, but I'll take that for what it is. And for people who like the points game, I'll share something. Just give you a little tease of how I love finding all the points and miles optimizations. If you have a credit card that pays multiple points, three, four, or five x points on things like a grocery store or an office supply store, anything like that, drug stores, that's great. You probably don't have a card that pays any multiple of points on home improvements or Home Depot, Lowes.\n\n(01:14:41):\nSo what I like to do to make sure I get the most points I can, instead of going to Home Depot and paying with a card that's going to give me one point per dollar at Home Depot. I have a four x grocery card. I like to go to Safeway and I just buy Home Depot gift cards. I get my four x points on the gift cards, then I go buy stuff at Home Depot knowing that I got four x points. But you also have some cards that give you three or four x points, if you go to CVS or other pharmacies or drug stores, you can do it there. You can do it at Office Supply stores if you want to take it to the next extreme. If you have an Amazon card, you could buy Amazon gift cards and get your five x or 5% back on the Amazon Prime card.\n\n(01:15:20):\nSo I'm a little crazy like that. My favorite is if you're trying to buy something at a store, always shop online for coupons. If you Google like Lowes, Home Depot, Crate & Barrel coupons, there's all these websites. My favorite one is Save n, the letter, deals.com. You could buy Home Depot and Crate & Barrel coupons online for a couple bucks, save 15%. So stack up and then the cashback portals. I'm going to buy something, I'm like, \"How do I get the cashback portal? How do I get the most points per dollar on my card? And how do I get a discount maybe from asking in the live chat or going in and buying a coupon.\" So I go a little crazy on that stuff, but I love saving money and just feeling like I got a good deal.\n\nLenny (01:16:03):\nAmazing. What an action packed episode we had. We got money hacks, we got big bets, we got podcasting, we got Self-Driving Money. What a conversation. Chris, this was amazing. Two last questions.

  "transcript": "# The essence of product management | Christian Idiodi (SVPG)\n\n## Transcript\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:00:00):\nI try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them, and you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's kind of the real essence of it, and that's, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not had, you're probably also not doing it right.\n\nLenny (00:00:35):\nToday, my guest is Christian Idiodi. Christian is a partner at Silicon Valley Product Group, alongside Marty Cagan, who when he introduced us, called Christian the most interesting man in the world. After meeting him, I tend to agree. After a long career in product, Christian now spends his time working closely with companies, big and small, implementing and improving their discipline of product management. In our conversation, we discuss why the product management field is so often disliked and what you can do to avoid becoming a product manager people don't want on their team. We spend a lot of time on coaching, how to get better at coaching your reports, how to get better coaching from your manager, and some really clever tactics for building trust with leaders within your company. Also, Christian shares his one favorite go-to method, out of all of the discovery methods out there, for figuring out what to build.\n\n(00:01:23):\nAlso, we spend some time on the great work that he's doing at Silicon Valley, Product Group. He's been doing a lot of great work on the product management field in Africa to help product builders and founders build great companies. That and so much more Christian is awesome. With that, I bring you Christian Idiodi, after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:38):\nYou fell in love with building products for a reason. But sometimes the day-to-day reality is a little different than you imagined. Instead of dreaming up big ideas, talking to customers and crafting a strategy, you're drowning and spreadsheets and roadmap updates, and you're spending your days basically putting out fires.

Christian, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:04:03):\nThank you for having me, Lenny. It's a joy to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:06):\nIt's a joy to have you here. So Marty Cagan introduced us, a colleague of yours at Silicon Valley Product Group. And the way he described you is he considers you the most interesting man in the world. Did you know that that's how he thinks about you?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:04:18):\nI didn't. I consider him one of the most interesting people in the world too.\n\nLenny (00:04:22):\nYou guys are so kind to each other. I wanted to start with this trend I've been noticing in product management and the perception of product management. It feels like, I don't know if this is new or if it's always been around, but it feels like there's this trend of people just not liking product managers. There's trend of founders feeling like they should wait a long time to hire their first product manager. There's a lot of teams that wish they didn't have a product manager in their team. We don't have this person telling us what to do. I'm curious just why you think there's often this dislike of product managers. And then for PMs listening, do you have any advice for just how to not become a product manager people don't like and don't want on their team?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:04:59):\nI think most people don't like product managers often because they haven't experienced good product managers. The core of product management is competency-based, meaning there is someone in an organization that represents the customer the best, that has a deep knowledge of the customers and your users, that has a deep knowledge of your data, your industry, your business and the product itself. And because of this competence, you kind of trust them to make decisions because if you have a problem that says, say we want more customers, it makes a lot of sense to go to the person that is an expert in customers to say, \"Help me solve this problem.\" What you see happening in many organizations is that there is kind of this misperception displaced influence and mistrust because of the poor competency, meaning I feel I know more about the business or I know more about the customer or the data. And so why should I not tell you what to do?\n\n(00:06:03):\nAnd I think people fail to understand that this role is, it's a team spot. They are part of a team of people working together to discover a solution we're building and in a way that works for our company. And so I think when I think through the companies I've worked with, where I see this discipline really eroded is where there is just not a competent level of product management. The way I describe it to a CEO, I'll ask him, \"Tell me who you trust in your company to make a decision on what markets we go to, what things we do.\" And they always have some senior leader, some VP, some person. And I say, \"Why? Oh, Bob has been here a long time. He knows everybody. Everybody loves him and trusts him. He understands our business.\" And I often say to him, I say, \"Well, Bob said put up manager.\" And it's often interesting to executives when I try to explain that way. I say that's the competent level that we're talking about here.\n\n(00:07:01):\nImagine if you had Bob's on every team. Imagine how much you can accomplish. So one, I don't really think it's... I often say it's not the hate for product management, it's a hate for the understanding of what they have experienced in product management, which are people that are not able to deliver results that help them meet the outcomes they want.\n\n(00:07:23):\nSo if I were advising product managers, I often say, look, when we see sales or executive driven product management where we see these alternatives to product management, it's not a cultural knock or a leadership knock, it's really on the individual and the discipline has to elevate itself to a place that it earns the right to make a decision on what we do.\n\nLenny (00:07:45):\nI have exactly the same perspective. When people say they don't like product managers, exactly what I tell them is, you just haven't worked with a great product manager. A great PM makes everything easier for you. If you want to be a PM, people would hate to lose on their team. I would never want to lose Christian on my team as a PM. Is there something they could do maybe or change to become that person?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:08:06):\nWell, I was just joking with someone earlier. I said, \"I've only seen great product managers come out of two places. One, either a series of massive failure in their career or experiences that have been bad or from learning from great product leaders.\" The reality of this kind of role, it's kind of like if you have all kinds of... maybe you're like on a sport, like a quarterback on a team, you need to practice product management to be good at product management. You're not going to get mastery by avoiding some of these elements.\n\n(00:08:39):\nAnd we've kind of clearly defined what you need to represent to a company for them to trust you. So there is this period of humility that I challenge all product managers to have, this period of learning, recognizing what you do not know. And what you do not have is the trust of an organization or even in yourself that you know the customer, the business or the data better than anybody else. What you need to do is quickly try to accelerate that. You're going to find the loudest, most influential person in your organization, the person that everybody knows, knows everything, is in every meeting and stuff, and you're going to ask them to teach you. You're going to challenge them. And if they don't have the time to teach you, you're going to volunteer to help them. I'm going to intern for you. You're going to get permission from your manager and say, \"Look, I want to spend time with Lenny. He's the head of sales, he's the head of operations and stuff. I just want to learn from him.\"\n\n(00:09:35):\nNow, what you're doing is you're extending that person's trust to yourself. You're also building a relationship with that person. But more importantly, you're learning what is driving that person's influence, which is their competence in the business or the customer.\n\n(00:09:51):\nAfter you've done that, you have to keep doing discovery because what's going to be different now is that person knows they've taught you everything that they know, but everybody now sees you learning every single day. So at some point, people will recognize that you might have more insights and more data than anybody else, and they will only know this because they've seen you learn from the best and they've seen you continuing to learn. So I always practically advise product managers in this kind of scenario, build relationships with people. You earn their trust by asking them to do two things. One, you're either going to teach me or I'm going to help you. And you're going to build relationships there, gain experience with them. You've got to immerse yourself in the deeper understanding of the business and the data.\n\nLenny (00:10:38):\nWow, there's a lot there. Because this is awesome. This is exactly, I think what people want to hear is how do you become better and how do you become more trusted and respected? So things you're recommending to PMs that want to become better, less disliked, more successful. I just took some notes as you were talking. One is there's a sense of becoming more full stack in the company, like understand the business, not just there's your one product and here's your one goal. And then this idea of just be always learning, which is both you are learning things and also people see that you're learning and see that you really care about a lot of the parts of the business that maybe you wouldn't naturally be inclined to understand. And that also helps you build relationships. And also just this really important point of if you know more than anyone else, people will innately trust you and respect you and want you on the team because you happen to have a lot of answers.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:11:25):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:11:26):\nAwesome. Kind of on a similar thread, something that Silicon Valley product group has is a really good definition of what a product manager's job is. And I thought it'd be cool just to spend a little time here. There's these four attributes you guys like to share. Can you just talk about that, as a little foundational?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:11:40):\nI kind of mentioned before, a product manager is in a team spor., so they work as part of a team to uncover a solution, what to build. And every time you solve a problem, there's inherent risk involved. There's the risk of will people buy this or will they choose it or will they choose to use it, which is all a value type of risk. There's the risk of can they use it, which is a usability type of risk. The risk that we can build it to have the skills to build it or the time to build this, that's a feasibility risk.\n\n(00:12:14):\nAnd the risk of it working for our business, which is a viability risk. I cannot call out the product manager's competency. It's really to try to drive the first and the last one, which is value and viability. A solution worth building, something people will buy, choose or use, and one that works for our business, which is at the core of what product teams do, solve a problem in a way customers will love and a way that works for our business. It's why the product manager gets all the rap of, if everything goes great, a great team effort, if everything goes wrong, they blame the product manager.\n\n(00:12:49):\nIt's because people hold them accountable to results. Nobody wants to work on something nobody wanted in the first place and your job is to ensure that we are working on something people want in the first place. And it is such an amazing role. I try to explain to people that the real essence of this job is that you wake up on behalf of someone else to solve a problem for them. And what an amazing job. There's just no greater... I cannot think of a better discipline with such inherent permission to solve problems on behalf of someone. And you have to do it well enough that they give you something back in return. That's the real essence of it, and that's the, I always call it a certificate of appreciation. And it could be in the form of revenue, engagement, loyalty, reference, all of those things. And that's the real essence of this job. If it's not fun, you're probably not doing it right. If it's not hard, you're probably also not doing it right.\n\nLenny (00:13:51):\nWow, I love that frame of reference of you're giving something to customers and your success is measured by do they give something back in return, which is basically do they pay for your product? Such a beautiful way to think about that. Oh, man.\n\n(00:14:05):\nOkay. So just to summarize these four elements, there's value, usability, viability, feasibility to understand if the product they're building hits all these attributes.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:14:15):\nThat's right. You're trying to uncover a solution and you know you've solved the problem when you get those two things, something customers love, they give you something back, and our business can support it in some ways. And I'm calling out, these are the different risks in our kind of taxonomy, how we call the things you have to tackle. And it's a team sport, and so there are these four risks of should we build it, will people use it, will people buy it, will our customers support it or our business support it? And you're trying to answer those questions with a designer and a product engineer.\n\nLenny (00:14:52):\nOf these four, so value, usability, viability, feasibility, where do you think most new PMs fail most or should spend more time?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:15:00):\nOh my goodness, value. Value is probably, it is the most important and the most overlooked. And the big driver for that is often because of the operating model of teams. Teams are often given roadmaps of projects and features to go build and deliver. If that's the case, you actually really don't need a product manager because they're going to assume value. If the boss told me to build this, I cannot say, \"Should we build this? Is this the right thing to build? Is there a better option? Is this what people will buy?\" You just assume it's valuable.\n\n(00:15:38):\nAnd so often, when people ask me why does the product manager seem to play like a core leadership role on a team, almost like the quarterback. And it's not that they're more special in solving the problem that the designer or the engineer, but they're answering a question that determines if we should be working on this in the first place.\n\n(00:15:57):\nSo value is often the hardest thing to solve and must be overlooked. We often see bad patterns where companies will say, \"Yes, we ran a test, with 300 users and they all scored it 84% or 90%. They love it.\" In that way. I said, \"Well, just because somebody can use your product doesn't mean that they will buy it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean they will choose it. Just because they can use it doesn't mean that they will actually use it.\" And what people say is often different from what they do. And our job is to actually solve the problem, which is what core value is, in a meaningful way. And often overlooked because we check the box on our own item. So the most important, because that's to the point of the certificate of appreciation, what you get in return, that's the ultimate outcome. Really, value.\n\nLenny (00:16:55):\nYou once gave a talk along these lines around discovery, and it was this talk of here's all of the things you can do to help understand what to build to make something valuable. There's a billion frameworks for every step of the discovery process, press releases, story mapping, opportunity solution, trees, fake door tests, all these things. And you're like, if we had to pick one thing, if there's one process or approach that you recommend most, your answer was essentially finding some number of reference customers to work with and helping them and working with them to design the product. Do you still see that as the one, if you had to pick one approach to figure out what to build? And if so, you just talk about how you recommend going about that.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:17:35):\nThe holy grail of product walk is really a reference customer. This is somebody that has used your solution or your product, loves it enough to tell people about it. I kind of described the work of the product team is to solve problems in a way that customers love and a way that works for our business. The ultimate definition for me today of the love that somebody has for our product is they're willing to put their reputation on the line by telling people about it. And for me, if we think about you do a lot of interviews with founders and entrepreneurs and you're going to have people that they find a market with an idea and they jump in. But if you think at the core of some of these founder-inspired businesses where the founder will say, \"Well, I had a problem and it was their problem and they focused on solving the problem and then they got their friends on it.\"\n\n(00:18:39):\nAnd so it's almost like this idea that if they were their own first reference customer. They were so close to the problem, immersed in the environment of the problem, solved it in a compelling way enough where it was like, there are more people like me. And it is like if I said to you, \"Lenny, let's go to a steakhouse. Find me a new steakhouse around you.\" You might go online and Google and you see a steakhouse with one review. How do you feel about that? I don't know. Maybe other people don't want to try this. You see two reviews, you're like, maybe it's the chef and their spouse or something. The question is how many positive reviews would you have to see to jump and say, \"Let's go try this one.\" There are some things inherent in, if you look at Geoffrey Moore's adoption curve and those kinds of models in here, most people don't want to be the first to try things. But you are likely to try things if other people that look like you have accepted it or defined it as good.\n\n(00:19:39):\nAnd so the whole essence for me of this technique is to create those first people, those reference customers. If you think about how companies make the shift to becoming sales-led or operations-led, almost all companies start product-led. The product is first. You kind of build something and it's like, yeah, it's going, let's hire salespeople and marketing people and operational people to do it. What's really happening is that the product team created the first customers. And now a group of people have to capture the value that was created. So what's happening here is that it is constantly the job of product teams. The reason they lose influence is because salespeople are having to sell a product. You see? So they're like forcing back, \"I need this and I need this.\" But if you came to me and said, \"I want to buy steak,\" and I say, \"Let me show you 20 people that look like you that recommend this steakhouse,\" my job as a salesperson is very easy. I'm just like, \"Hey, you should eat here. Everybody that loves steak, they all eat here.\"\n\n(00:20:44):\nSo product teams feel, at this contract to an organization when they don't create powerful reference customers. So it's by far my favorite technique. And the way this technique works is you want to discover and deliver and develop who has the problem, the customer. I want to discover who has the problem. At the same time, discover and deliver a solution to this problem. The idea here is that if you really want to solve a problem, you need to get out of your building. Go spend time with someone that has the problem and don't leave until you solve the problem. People talk about why we had such a record time to the Covid vaccine. Sure, technology has improved, our research has improved. But if you think about it, we had the highest number of volunteers for vaccination in the history of any vaccine in the history of time.\n\n(00:21:36):\nWhy? Did we have to look for someone with Covid? No, they were literally all around us. The research was immersed in the environment of the problem. They could study... and so this is often what I call, it's almost like a pressure-cooked discovery in some ways. If you truly, truly want to solve a problem, get out of your building, get out of the assumptions, get out of your opinions. Immerse yourself, find someone who has the problem, stick with them until you discover a solution for this problem. And you're going to do that. The part of why I love this technique, the two biggest reasons I think, the first is if I cannot find a certain number of people that have this problem, my goodness, it might not be a problem, but solve it. I have never had a product failure using this technique. If I were to credit... goodness, I think last count, I'm up to like 205 products I have worked on or participated in creating in my career. And I tried to build a new product every year from scratch. It's kind of a crazy thing about me. My friends know what I want for my bad day is a problem worth solving. And I like to go from idea to revenue, and the setup, and I test all of these techniques in this way. And everybody knows my favorite technique is if we find a problem worth solving, we need to uncover a solution for B2B, I want six to eight references, for B2C, I want maybe 15 to 25 references as an indication that we've achieved product market fit.\n\nLenny (00:23:15):\nJust to be clear, you said you still work, you build products yourself and you practice this and you've built... okay, what's like every recent product that you've built? I didn't know this.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:23:25):\nSo I do a lot of work in Africa now. WorkNigeria is like a job board that helps people. We do kind of a job board HR replacement and advisory too as well. I'm actually working on another app around the NDA and protecting high-asset individuals in some ways. So kind of every year, I find a problem like that worth solving and I practice doing the work of discovery with a team of people.\n\nLenny (00:23:54):\nThat's amazing. I see this unraveling of the most interesting man in the world is happening a little, bit by bit. We learn more and more about you. Okay, amazing. So just to kind of summarize some of these-\n\nLenny (00:24:03):\nOkay, amazing. So just to summarize some of these points, which are really great and I've never heard it described this way before. So basically, a really effective way to understand how to build something people actually want and solve real problems is this idea of pick reference customers. And I really like this word reference, which is not just they're going to help you build a thing, but they're also become a reference to future customers because they end up loving it because you built it for them and they love it.\n\n(00:24:27):\nYour advice is find six to eight in B2B space, 15 to 25 in B2C. And the reason there's a number here is if you find just one or two, you never know, they might be just the one or two that have this really weird problem that no one else has. And I think that's usually the flaw in this approach is you end up building it for a small number of people and nobody else really wants it. And it sounds like in your experience, this is a good kind of number where probably a lot of more people will have this problem.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:24:53):\nYeah. There've been studies to validate some of these numbers. I think early, IBM, kind of struggled selling those supercomputers. And if you're buying a million dollar computer, someone says, \"Hey, do you want to buy?\" And you're like, \"I don't know. Is there anybody else that has bought it? Shall I be the first?\" And there was this common question of what would it take for you to buy it? And someone says, \"Hey, if I see five or six people that look like me already have this, then I feel confident making the argument to my company, we should jump on it.\" And it's like, so how do I create the first five to six? And you can see a lot of the validation on B2C in some of the things you might see in the App Store on Yelp or those places. My idea here is if you found a steakhouse with 25 5-star reviews, you are likely to adopt this.\n\n(00:25:41):\nSo in every app I have ever put on the App Store, on the day I launch the app in the app store, they are 25 5-star reviews. I will never launch an app and be like, \"Let's hope Lenny loves it. Let's see who the first person.\" On the very first day of launching the app, there are 25... so I will know I am not ready until I have achieved 25 people that have told me, worked with me and said, \"I am now ready to put my reputation the line.\" Sometimes I might need to work with 30 people or 50 people because the output is 25 reference customers. Because if Lenny is like, \"I don't love it enough\" or \"I don't feel comfortable,\" I'm not going to customize for Lenny. I'm going to find my single target market, talk to more people. If I get 25, I have achieved product market fit.\n\nLenny (00:26:29):\nSo interesting. It basically kicks in this word of mouth flywheel that everyone's always looking for is how do I get people to talk about it. Build it for them, solve their problems, tell them that it exists. You mentioned a bit about how you understand if it's actually, let's call a product market fit, if you have product market fit with these people that you ask them if they're going to leave you a 5-star review for example. I guess what do you consider this is good, I got one more person that's really happy with this? What tells you it's got product market fit with a person?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:26:55):\nIf I were thinking about how I will do this, pick a problem to solve, first of all, I have to know who I'm solving the problem for. And in some indication and I want to validate that this is actually a problem you do have. And I'm looking for a certain type of person. These early adopters in our world are broken up to technologists and evangelists. Technologists could be, \"I love the new iPhone 16 is coming out and it's going to have five cameras and I write an article in some tech review board. Super fast, super sleek, all good design.\" You just love new technology. You always jump on new technology. And evangelist could be someone that says, \"Oh my, I look great with the iPhone 15, it has three cameras. I will look phenomenal with the iPhone 16, so I'm going to go stand in line at the Apple Store for three hours or overnight because I just can't wait to get my hands on the Apple 16.\"\n\n(00:27:53):\nThey may feel a little irrational, but those are the kind of people you're looking for, people that believe they have a problem. So it's like you will try any steakhouse, in my example. You're just like, \"I love steak. I don't care if there are reviews or not. I'll try it.\" And what I'm trying to do here is I'm saying, okay, Lenny loves steak, he wants to try a steakhouse. And I'm good to say, \"Lenny, I'm trying to build the best steakhouse here. If I create a menu that you absolutely love, are you willing to tell people about it?\" That could be a video testimonial, write a review, stuff like that. And it's okay Lenny, if you don't love the first iteration of it and stuff like that, I want to hear your feedback. I want you to work with me in ensuring that I build the best steakhouse here. And that's kind of the idea.\n\n(00:28:37):\nSo I'm going to work with 25 people that look like you and I'm going to keep tweaking, in this sense iterating on the product and the menu until Lenny's like, \"My goodness, this is the best steakhouse in the world.\" It is like I'm just going to write about it and when I get 25 people that have all, it's not the steakhouse, they love it enough. Because this is where you really get the shift in value. Because if I say, \"Lenny, go write me a review, a five-star review.\" You're like, \"I don't know if I feel comfortable about.\" You say, \"Why not?\" You see, I'm really going to get deeper feedback because people will say or do anything just to avoid hurting our feelings or for us to get out of their face. So they'll be like, \"Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll give you a five-star review.\" But when I say do it, you're like, \"Well, I have this hesitation.\" Why? That's really where great discovery comes. But it's hard to in a silo. You have to be immersed with the person that has the problem. So product market fit is when you iterate it in this discovery, you've discovered and delivered something so meaningful that these customers that are your target customers, are willing to put their reputation on the line and be a reference. That's my indication.\n\nLenny (00:29:49):\nI imagine though, Christian, so charismatic, comes to me and says, \"Hey Lenny, would you leave me a five star review for this product. I'm working on this, I'm trying to figure out if people want it.\" I would be like, \"Yeah, of course. I'll leave you a five-star review.\" What do you do to kind of avoid that, just like I just want to be nice, like I don't care, I'll leave a five-star review.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:30:06):\nYou. It's part of why I need 25 in B2C. And don't get me wrong, if I can convince 25 people in there, I may have a marketing product and a charismatic marketing products. If that's all I needed to do was a good message and charisma to get people on it. The good benefits of this is that you can tackle risk very early because you can involve many other parts of your organization, marketing, sales, legal, finance. People often ask me how do I come up with the marketing spiel or the description? I'm like, \"I don't make that up.\" If I ask Lenny, \"What do you feel about this product?\" And he says, \"Well, it's cool and it's very sleek and very nice.\" The marketing department will say, \"We don't like those terms. We want to call it comprehensive.\" And when you go out to sell your product, people are going to be disappointed because the expectations are created by what's on the box.\n\n(00:31:04):\nI only market exactly what customers tell me. I have never been surprised about what customers will say when I release a product because in this technique I already get their feedback. And so I'm going to put exactly what Lenny said on the box. \"Hey, this product's cool and sleek and easy to use.\" I've only launched a product that says super fast but difficult to read because the technology team said there was no way to change the font on something and it was just going to be difficult to read. And you know what everybody did when they got the product? \"Oh my goodness, it is super [inaudible 00:31:39]. All right, it is also difficult to read.\" It matched their expectations in some ways. So what I do here is I learn how to sell the product with this technique, I learn how to market the product because I have real people, that we're not making assumptions.\n\n(00:31:54):\nWhat's the best way to market this? How much Lenny? How would you find this? Does this language resonate with you? Does this properly describe the menu? See? So that's kind of what you're doing when you use a technique like this. It feels heavy to people, but that's kind of part of the practice of it. If you do this a whole lot, you get really comfortable at involving, you're working with your customers to solve it. But for me, the fact that you will not have a product failure because you have a natural pivot out, meaning if I can't find 25 people that love steak, why in the world am I building a steakhouse? So if you don't find enough people that love this problem and are willing to help you, just be like, this is not a problem worth solving. But more importantly, you really start to get... is the fastest part to product market fit, the clearest definition for me because I know when my product is ready, when I've dotted those I's and crossed those T's, in that way.\n\nLenny (00:32:49):\nI think your point there, recruiting is itself a huge signal, is really important. Can you find people that have this problem and care enough about this problem that they're going to talk to you and spend time exploring this thing that doesn't exist yet. I think that's super interesting. And then I think another key part of this is it's one solution that solves many people's problems. And it can't be a bunch of different things for a bunch of different people.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:33:10):\nThat's right, that's right. If one person says, \"I don't want this,\" wants this, another person wants this, you don't do it. That's how you know you do the minimum. All 25 have to want the same thing. If one person's out, you just don't do it at all. And the reason that's powerful is because if I come to you and I say, \"Hey, it's missing this feature.\" I say, \"Well yeah, 25 people that look like you that are very happy without it.\" You see? That's how if you think about what you do in a review, you see the five stars and you instantly like, \"Oh, that's good enough.\" But if you have a question, what do you do, you cannot double click on the review to read. And that's how people get convinced. There's this social influence of like, \"Well, Lenny's cool, he likes the steakhouse. I should like it. He's fine with this not being there so I should be fine with it.\" So your references are super powerful in more than any company, in influencing consumers on what they should choose or not choose.\n\nLenny (00:34:06):\nBasically, Strive builds new products exactly this way. They find new customers that have a problem and they work with very small number of customers to build a product for them, and that's how a lot of their new product... I think Rippling works like this too. So I think this is a really good lesson for everyone listening, if they're trying to build something new. Is there an example that comes to mind that would be, I don't know, interesting to talk through, of something you built that you worked through this process?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:34:30):\nOh, boy. I tell the example of solving a problem when I was at a staffing company, a snag job. They do hourly jobs and help people find their best job or an hourly job and I actually get a call here from the head of Global staffing at Starbucks. Now, he called me, you can see the benefit of this technique, because I'm the person he calls when he has problems. I've used this technique with him at a previous company. He didn't even know I was at a new company. And he calls me up and he says, \"Christian, I have a problem.\" I said, \"Well, don't we all have problems?\" He said, well, \"We just bought a bakery in the San Francisco Bay Area. And as we're doing the paperwork to kind of take over this company or this acquisition, we realized that close to 800 of the employees may be undocumented workers.\"\n\n(00:35:22):\nAnd I said, \"Wow, that does sound like a problem.\" He's like, \"Yeah, imagine if this breaks out in the news and all of that. But more importantly, we still need to get all their paperwork. So all these people are going to quit and we'll have a new bakery without employees.\" And my first question to him as a product guy is like, \"Wow, would you give me a million dollars to solve this problem?\" And it's like, \"No, seriously?\" I was like, \"300,000.\" I'm throwing out numbers. He's like, \"Maybe.\" I said, \"Wow, you have my attention.\" I go to my CEO, I tell him to call. I grab a designer and an engineer. I just say, \"Hey look, I would love to work on a little project with you all if you have some time.\" I kind of debrief them on the call. Now the first thing I have to do is to try to define the problem, identify problems. What really is the problem going on?\n\n(00:36:08):\nYeah, we're breaking it down, we're talking through this. We say, well, at the end of the day, Starbucks needs to hire like 800 people quickly because we can't fix getting everybody's paperwork. But they're going to lose these people and they need to hire those quickly. And I say, well, who else has this problem? We're trying to throw out guesses. I'm like, \"What are we talking about? Let's go out.\" Everybody jumps in my car and we start driving around and this is where we're doing our product work from. We're talking in the car, just out of the building. We see a new construction site for a new McDonald's coming soon and we're curious. We're like, well, \"Let's go find out.\" We start talking to people on sites. Fortunately, the operations director is on site and we ask him, we say, tell us about opening up a new McDonald's.\n\n(00:36:54):\nHe says, \"Well, do you know we need like 120 people on opening day?\" We're like, \"Whoa, for McDonald's? Really, 120 people?\" He's like, \"Yeah, do you know that most of the people in this industry don't show up to work on the very first day, and every day we're in construction, we're losing money. So the second the bathrooms, the restrooms, are done, we want to open up.\" We're like, \"Wow, we didn't think about this, new construction, a new store opening.\" They need to hire lots of people quickly. So I said, \"Thank you very much.\" I gave him my business card, he gave me his. We jumped back in the car. We just kept driving. We went to the mall. We started talking to people there. We talked to a manager at Macy's and she said, \"Oh look, we hire 20,000 people in the holiday season.\"\n\n(00:37:36):\nWe're like, \"Macy's.\" Yeah, it's like nights, weekend, shipping, stuff like this. We started hiring in the summer because of how painful it is. Now, all we're doing here is just validating that this is a real problem, like other people will have the problem. So we go back to the office, we're brainstorming, like, \"How will someone even go about solving this problem?\" We're thinking this was like, we're not really sure, but McDonald's guy was very desperate. I said, \" I have his business card.\" We start throwing some ideas. So I called the McDonald's person and I said, \"Look, you just met with us.\" He's like, \"Yeah. We would love to help you solve the problem.\" He said, \"Well, what do you have in mind?\" I said, \"We've been talking. What if we just sent you some people to interview. And if you like them, you'll hire them.\"\n\n(00:38:18):\nHe said, \"That seems fairly easy.\" He's like, \"How do I pay for this?\" And we took a swag like, \"Maybe you pay us for everybody that you hire.\" He was like, \"Oh, I don't see much risk to that. This is great.\" I'm like, \"Oh, okay.\" We have no sense of what to do. We are literally Googling, how do people find a job at McDonald's? We go to colleges, we are sticking up flyers. We are putting ads in the newspaper back then, we are looking at different techniques to try to get people into a funnel and interest by posting on Craigslist or things like that. At the end of the week, we get about 40 people that are interested to come to the interview. We're like, that feels good for our first try. We call the manager up and we say, \"Look, on Monday we will send you 40 people to interview. This is great.\"\n\n(00:39:05):\nMonday I take my designer, my engineer, we are on site with the manager. At nine o'clock, we expect three people to show up for interviews. Nobody shows up. 10 o'clock, another three, one person shows up. We got to the end of the day, less than 20 people show up. This man only has four or five people. We are like, \"We suck this. This is terrible.\" We go to the manager, \" Let's go and apologize for wasting your day and stuff.\" He starts to laugh. We're like, \"What's going on?\" He said, \"Look, I forgot to tell you. Folks in this industry don't even show up to interviews. We are McDonald's, we pay minimum wage. People will leave us for 25 more cents an hour. They will leave us for a job that is one block closer to their house or less than a mile closer to their home.\"\n\n(00:39:54):\nNow, the engineer is with us and he's thinking about it. It's like, this is really interesting. About half of the people showed up. He hired one in five. If you really want to solve this problem, playing the laws of averages, we probably need to send this man close to 200 people. We need to go bigger. So we are storming the office, we called the McDonald's guy again. I was like, \"Can we try again next Monday?\" And he's like, \"Do I only pay for the people I hire?\" We're like, \"Sure.\" It's like, \"Oh, go ahead and kill yourself on this.\" It's a pain. We've been trying all kinds of things for years.\n\n(00:40:26):\nNow, we start doubling down our efforts. We start calling back all the people that didn't show up for interviews like, \"What's going on? Did you get lost? Don't you want a job? What's wrong with you?\" We start figuring out what portals worked well for us the last time, what wasted our money, what was the cost to acquire a person. And we spend a week doubling our efforts on those channels. We probably have about 120, 130 people on the list. The Sunday beforehand, we start calling them up like, \"Please show up. Don't embarrass us. Don't you want the job? Do you need that address? Should I call you a reminder, set your alarm.\" We're trying all the techniques to try to get more people. There we go the next day and at the end of the day he has about forty-five to 50 people. He comes to us, he shakes our hand. He's like, \"Whoa, the quality was excellent. All my recruiters were engaged. The day was smooth,\" [inaudible 00:41:17] how successful we are.\n\n(00:41:18):\nHe's like, \"I want to use you for every new McDonald's I open in the area.\" Now, I don't know I have a product. I just know I was able to help one person at McDonald's. But I feel like I have enough learning. So I called up my friend at Starbucks and I said, \"Hey, man, remember the problem we talked the about?\" He's like, \"Yeah. I would love to help you solve it.\" He said, \"Oh, okay. What do you have in mind?\" I said, \"Well, I think we need to send you about 3000 people to interview.\" He said, \"3000 people? I told you I only need 800.\" I said, in this industry, most people don't show up for interviews, right? He said, \"Oh my goodness. You know our industry well. I like this. I'm going to take this up, I think we'll give you this contract.\" I take my designer, my engineer, we go to San Francisco. We're out there recruiting because this is where it was based. We have to get a whole hotel, hire people. We are working all the channels we knew, working in the area. Remember, we don't have any software, no technology. The designer, we're doing this manually, Excel spreadsheets, phones, emails, in that way. In one week, Starbucks hired 784 people. I get an email the next Monday morning from the contact at Starbucks. He copied Howard Schultz, then CEO of Starbucks. The email read, \"These guys just saved our butts.\" I sent it to my CEO, but then I said, \"You know what?\" I only know now I can help on McDonald's and a Starbucks, but that doesn't mean I have a product. But I now have enough of problem definition. I reached out to the head of marketing, the head of sales. I said, \"Tell us who has this problem you've come across,\" because we need to work with more people to try to uncover a solution that is scalable, maintainable, reliable, and works for our business. Weirdly enough, the next opportunity we had was the Los Angeles International Airport. They were opening up a new terminal and they said, \"We need 200 people to manage all the stores in the new terminal.\" And we were like, \"200 people? We just hired close to 800. We got this.\" We go to LA for the briefing with the staffing group and they tell us the people that work at an international airport have to match the demographics of the travelers. We say, \"Say what? Yeah, we have 13% Chinese-speaking travelers, we need 13% Chinese-speaking employees.\" We say, \"Sorry? We've got 5% Korean speaking.\" I mean my team is in LA, we're in Chinatown. We are speaking, trying to recruit people to come and work in an airport. If we expect 10 people to show up, only one person shows up.\n\n(00:43:49):\nWe start calling job seekers up like, \"What's going on?\" They say, \"Do you know what it means to work at an airport?\" First, I wake up at five o'clock, I drive to the employee parking lot. I get into a bus. Then I go through security. There was not like TSA pre-check back then. Then if I want to break, I go to security again and then you pay me minimum wage. It took us close to three months to staff this. We had to negotiate with the union to raise the price to like $15 an hour to attract people. When we come back from that, you know what we're saying, that is not our customer. Never again. We are never doing airports. That's a pain.\n\n(00:44:24):\nAround this time, it was the holiday season, so we reached out to the person at Macy's. We told them about our work with McDonald's. They say, \"Oh, we'll try this.\" We started working with them. You can imagine through this, the engineer is thinking, how can I use technology to improve this? I always tell this to people, I never wrote a requirements document, I never wrote a story. So the designer is thinking, how can we improve the end-to-end experience? Okay, we need a recruiter experience, a job seeker experience. We had a funnel. We need to build a scheduling tool so that they can scale the interview. Oh, what about notification? Maybe text message. We can send them a map so that they can know how to get to the... I mean, all of these things, because they were involved from the very beginning in defining the problem, they were immersed in the solution to the problem. It takes us about eight and a half, almost nine months to build this. When we launched this product in its first 90 days, it booked $32 million in sales.\n\n(00:45:22):\nWhy? Because you got McDonald's probably until today using this product to open up every new store. Well, Starbucks went to the global contract. We say, \" Well, we've only done discovery in the US so I only know where it works in this market.\" And we started finding, if you look at NASCAR, some of these big sporting events, they have to bring a lot of people together very quickly for a short amount of time. And this is the same kind of product they use to do that high volume hiring in a short amount of time. If you think about it, I was discovering who had the problem and developing the customers that have the problem. At the same time, I was discovering and delivering a solution to that problem.\n\nLenny (00:46:01):\nThat's insane. You said you made thirty-something million dollars the first year of launching this thing.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:46:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:46:06):\nThat's unreal. I love how this is the epitome of doing things that don't scale. You going hiring McDonald's employees and then Starbucks employees.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:46:15):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (00:46:16):\nThen airport employees. Wow.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:46:18):\nYou do things that don't scale and then you do things that do scale. And it's so powerful when you discover how to do things that don't scale, when you actually know. Because it's the power of technology is just the beauty of what it can do at scale.\n\nLenny (00:46:34):\nAnd to that point, it's easier said... a lot of people talk about doing things that don't scale. Many people don't actually do anything like that. They're like, \"Nah, let someone else figure that out, or let's just actually think about the future of this versus just doing it and solving and finding problems.\" I love that also, you didn't do any of these other, the things we talked about. There's no fake door test, there's no opportunity solution trees. There's no user interview. You're talking to people. It wasn't like a user research interview, come sit down, ask questions.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:47:00):\nI said, there's nothing better in learning how to solve a problem than trying to solve the problem. You will get all the answers, the research, the failure, the mistakes, all the evidence. You know the difference between what people say, this is what they do. You'll validate and test. Because at the end of the day, what is statistically relevant? Solving the problem is the clearest indication that we've solved the problem and that we know how to solve the problem then. And so yeah, very powerful technique.\n\nLenny (00:47:30):\nAnd I love that you didn't really know exactly where this was going to lead. It was just kind of this exploratory, let's see if there's something here. And you just kept following this like, huh, there's a problem. It looks like we found a way to solve it. Let's just see where else this can take us. Amazing.\n\n(00:47:44):\nThis time of year is prime for career reflection and setting goals for professional growth. I always like to spend this time reflecting on what I accomplished the previous year, what I hope to accomplish the next year, and whether this is the year I look for a new opportunity.

You spend a lot of time helping product leaders get better at coaching, get better at building relationships, get better at building trust with their teammates. Marty Cagan actually shared this quote with me when he joined, he said that you can build trust with executives and product leaders faster than anyone else he knows, and the people you coach adore him like some kind of rock star.\n\n(00:48:57):\nHe's literally on speed dial for several of the CEOs of the largest companies in the world. Okay, so let me just ask you, what's your secret to being a great coach, and how can people listening become better coaches to their reports, maybe colleagues?\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:49:12):\nThis topic is probably near and dear to my heart because, I mean, there are many ways that I think our corporate structures have failed in creating high performance and stability in people, and I think one of them is actually encro of leadership. And by leadership, the key component I often point to is coaching. This idea of what truly is the job of a leader. And I tell people, yeah, it's context and culture at the highest level like, why are we here? Where are we going? How do we organize ourselves to get there? What's important?\n\n(00:49:51):\nJust kinds of things and the environment in which we do it, but there's a people element because you recognize that you want an outcome and you need people working together to that outcome. So I now have to staff those people and I have to hire and train them and equip them and then appoint them to what those things are. But many of those things are one-off, meaning I create a vision, I create a strategy. I hire a person. There's something that is every day and that's coaching, that's like the day job of managers. And if I think about high performing teams in the world, and you can pick sports is one of those, artists, they have coaches and managers like it's an everyday thing. And the idea is that when I explain this to people, I say doing product management is a product manager's job, but getting better at product management is the manager's job, is the coach's job. And people tend to misunderstand how that dynamic works.\n\n(00:50:57):\nYou see, if you are playing a game, you're in the game. The coaches are on the sideline watching you play the game and getting you better at playing the game. Your job may be to kick or pass the ball and you need a competence level, but somebody's job is every day looking for ways for you to be better at your job.\n\n(00:51:16):\nThe number one reason most people don't give good coaching is because they've never experienced good coaching themselves. And most people can only give to other people what has been given to them, what experiences they've seen. I was in an executive meeting with a CEO and he gets up in a meeting and he just starts screaming and cursing at everybody, just throwing up And I said, \"Whoa, whoa.\" I said, \"Can we talk outside?\" They pick him outside. I was like, \"First of all, I don't even think I can work with you anymore given this environment you're creating, but I need to understand why you are talking to your team like that.\" And he says to me, he says, \"Christian, well my boss used to scream at me like this. And look at me, I'm now a CEO, I got it, I understand it. They are grownups, they can understand it too.\"\n\n(00:52:05):\nAnd I said, \"Well, tell me what you're trying to communicate.\" And he explains it to me and stuff and I said, \"Is it okay if I show you an alternative way of communicating that?\" He says, \"What do you mean?\" I said, \"Well is it first of all safe for me to do this with the team?\" So I go back to the team and I say, \"Look, I'm going to try to say what the CEO was trying to say again. He's giving me permission for you to speak freely and candidly, I want your honest opinion as to what was more effective and why.\" And I took a stab at kind of representing what he was trying to say and I asked the team and it's like, yeah, it's the same thing kind of message, but when he tells us this stuff we just go do it. We get it, we go do it. But the way you described it right now to us, I can think of four other things I need to do. I even understand some other things that may be missing that we need to now go tackle.\n\n(00:52:57):\nAnd the CEO is kind of really taken aback and it's kind of in some ways he has never seen an alternative. And he's never seen if an alternative be effective. Most people need to see something then they need to do it before they can even teach it, in some ways. Now I'm saying this all because I need to make a very strong argument for people understanding coaching. And in some ways I probably did not know that I was probably good at coaching. I coached my kids in soccer for eight years and we always won the championship, my boys team and I had long waiting list of people and I thought I had a fundamental flaw in understanding it because when my kids were all four years old, when you have the kids run around the soccer field just kicking the ball any way, my team always had plays, they all have strategy.\n\n(00:53:49):\nSo winning games like 10 to zero, other kids, I thought I'm like, maybe I was born in another country. I didn't know you were just meant to let them play. And I was really coaching kids and I was treating four-year-olds like adults. We're watching video, watching tape, having real... [inaudible 00:54:05] But it was so funny when you see them execute on the field. But I've kind of always had this mentality about the truest forms like companies cannot care for people, people care for people. And the representation of what is acceptable in an environment or what we do is by the leaders. Now there's some different dynamic to why that's not happening with how we promote people and the whole poor structure around that. But fundamentally, trust is a key part of doing this. And I think when I tell these people, I say, \"Look, most people don't know that you know something until they test you.\"\n\n(00:54:50):\nWe do it a whole lot in our environment. I ask you a question, I see how you answer and it's like I might ask you what's one plus one? It's two and now I know that one plus one is two. I don't care when you learned it. I need you to know that it's two to do my work. So it happens in everyday environment and what people fail to do is to do the learning so they get the question wrong and they lose trust. And trust is based on competence and character, there are other values like communication and concern and care, but most corporate environments, it's a competency thing. That's why you see so many companies accept people with bad communication, bad care, because they're very good at their job. So if you can demonstrate competence, you will earn some trust, at least the trust of competence from people.\n\n(00:55:44):\nSo I kind of explained to people a whole lot that the real core of their job at first is to learn, to seek to understand before they are understood, to know what you don't know. That humility and ego only last a small minute. The most powerful way I have found to get trust with many people is to have them accountable for an outcome of mine, which is to know. So if I wanted to accelerate trust with Lenny, I will ask Lenny to teach me. And I see this like an emotional intelligence, black belt technique here, but many environments, if you get into environment, it's very quickly for you to identify the power in that environment. Who is influential? Who has loudest voice and all? And there's something behind why they're powerful. Yes it is title, but if you think about why someone is called a CEO, it's because there's some competence that made someone give them the title, they are great at growing businesses, they have a good stride, whatever it is.\n\n(00:56:51):\nSo what you do to build trust is you want that person to trust you. Okay. But the only way that person will know that they trust you is if they test you. And unfortunately many environments they do that publicly. I'm in a meeting, I ask Lenny a question. He bumps a presentation like, oh, product managers are useless. That person doesn't know anything. So here's what I do when I want to build trust, if Lenny's a new hire in my company, I take Lenny to the loudest, most influential person in the company. And I say, \"Look, I just hired Lenny. Super rockstar, did all of this. But he knows nothing about that business, nothing about how we work and stuff. I will love for you to teach him some things.\" Now he may be like, \"I'm super busy, I'm involved.\"\n\n(00:57:36):\nI say, \"Look, Lenny should just hang with you. I've played his calendar for the whole week. He's just got to sit in meetings you are, quiet, observe, just by observing you, he will be a rockstar. No stress, nothing to give.\" Now it's impossible for this leader to sit with you for a whole week without saying things like, \"So Lenny, where are you from? What do you do? Tell me about yourself.\" What have I now done? I forced a relationship between a very powerful, trustworthy, influential person and somebody else that doesn't have it. If you are walking around the company with this person, what is everybody going to say? Oh my goodness, you're friends with that person. I want to know Lenny because we can never get him to agree on it. So if I know Lenny, I'll be close with it. Lenny is more accessible, he's new, but how did Lenny break in? I'm extending somebody else's trust to you. Now by also making that person share in the accountability of training you or teaching you, in some ways, I am now making them accountable for your growth. It's impossible two months from now for that person to say, \"Oh, Lenny doesn't do anything.\" Why? Because it makes them a bad teacher. So they're always going to be friendly, be like, \"Oh yeah, Lenny, let's have a conversation. Don't do it like this in this way.\" They will prep you because it makes them look bad if you're not competent. Now, this technique accelerates relationships and trust. It's the help me teach me type of technique. It also allows them to observe the dynamics within the company, but it accelerates relationships because it's impossible for you to be in a meeting with a leader all the time without the person saying something like, \"Oh yeah, hey folks, let me introduce you to Lenny.\"\n\n(00:59:20):\nNow that person is now the one introducing you to more connections within the company. Fastest way to build is, now feels like it's a expense but this is the job of a coach. You are designing a very specific playbook to help people achieve the outcomes reward and that's by getting them competent at their job and then their potential where they need to go next.\n\nLenny (00:59:45):\nThat are some Jedi ninja tricks right there. I love that. I've never heard this advice before. Makes so much sense and it's so easy to implement.\n\nChristian Idiodi (00:59:54):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:59:54):\nAmazing. For someone that maybe doesn't have a Christian around as a coach or a manager that isn't at this level, what advice do you give people that are looking for a coach or someone that could help them along these lines to learn to build trust and learn to just generally improve?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:00:09):\nBoy, like I say with everything, you don't get mastery by avoidance. And one of the things that good coaches do that when I say corporations fail companies is they don't create space for practice. I see people complain to me about people all the time, oh this person is not good. They presented this, it was terrible. And I ask them, \"What did they do at practice?\" They say, \"What do you mean?\" I say, \"When they were practicing this, what did they do?\" Say, \"Well, they didn't practice. I told them to prepare this.\" I say, \"Think about what happens at practice. Any practice of any sport, any game. You can stop. You can make corrections, you can give feedback. What you do at practice, you do in the game. Product management is a one time, game time kind of role. So when do people practice?\"\n\n(01:00:57):\nAnd so what I tell people in the absence of getting good coaching, you need to find practice arenas. It's kind of like if you are learning a new sport or basketball, you kind go to the gym. It's a practice arena. You can play and shoot around and let maybe some people have pickup games that you join and stuff like this in some ways. And so I always advise product managers like, you need to join a lot of pickup games, which they are low barriers to entry, low evaluation reward, loan risk type of thing. Go volunteer at a non-profit working with the team, go volunteer in your community event or church or whatever you go to, go party. But now what am I trying to do with these things? Find places where people do collaborative problem solving. That is what you're doing as a product team.\n\n(01:01:50):\nIt's more likely in a high performance environment you'll find a good coach. You'll find somebody out there but what you're also doing is you're observing other people play. Most people learn a lot of skills by, you watch TV like, oh I like that move. And then you go to the gym and you practice that move, you see what you do? So it's like you're seeing then you're doing it in some ways. So you need to see good product work so that you can do good product work so that you can teach good product work. So if you don't have the benefit of having a good coach directly, you've got to find environments where you see good coaching happening and a good indication of good coaching is actually good outcomes over and over again. Winning teams, winning performances, great products, great products come from great product teams. They probably have good leaders or a good leader within a bad culture.\n\nLenny (01:02:45):\nSo essentially it's get a bunch of reps in is a big part of this advice. Just get reps in and I think what you just said is such an important part of it is collaborative problem solving is the key thing to look for. I was going to ask you how you recommend people get into product management. I imagine this is a very similar answer, it's just find opportunities to collaboratively problem solve.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:03:04):\nThat's right. And I differentiate that because there are all those guys that are the, I know I like to change a light bulb or they can walk individually or thinker and stuff and I kind of differentiate that problem solving from the people that are very good at working with other people to solve a problem. And there are so many of those pockets, you're getting reps. You've heard those who that just tell you stories of them working problem and I can see how they will help me. They know how to use data, they know how to use insights. They're not afraid of talking to people. How are you going to get those reps? Because you come into my company I ask you a question like, oh, I really don't know where do I find? But if you've done the problem solve with a team, sometimes you may not even know how to get the answer, but you know who to go to get the answer. That's a gift too.\n\nLenny (01:03:52):\nI love that so much of your advice comes back to being the person that knows the most or has learned the most or even looking like they're spending the time to learn the most, which makes so much sense. The people you want to entrust are the people that happen to have the answers.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:04:05):\nI try.\n\nLenny (01:04:06):\nAnd each person will know. Yeah, it just makes sense. Something else you talk about is people getting promoted too early. Leaders getting promoted too early, not doing well, they end up blaming others when really they were not actually ready for this new position. Can you talk about why you think that happens and then just how maybe as that person that might be in that position right now feeling like, oh, shit, maybe it's not my fault.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:04:31):\nI don't know how to make an appeal to corporations on this one. It's a similar appeal in the light of coaching too as well. Most people are promoted to a point of incompetency or so, but I kind describe the dynamic this way. It's kind of like Lenny is a fantastic engineer. If you think about it, he wins engineer of the year awards. If you go to the office, his picture is on the wall, everybody knows him. He's feeling good. But it's like one year, two years, maybe eight years in Lenny's feeling like, am I really growing in my career? Am I really challenged in my career? He looks at the engineering career ladder. The next role from his senior engineer role is engineering manager. The leadership team, HR, they look at the same thing. That's true. We love Lenny. We don't want to lose Lenny, we need to promote him.\n\n(01:05:20):\nAnd the next step is engineering manager or product manager, manager, however, I want to use the rule here. And so, we do what? We promote Lenny. It feels good at the moment. Yeah! Congratulations on your promotion. He posts a nice post. We are like, \"Yeah, we're going to keep Lenny there for long time now because he's promoted.\" Now, Lenny has never been a manager in his whole life. He's never interviewed people, fired people, didn't even coach people or had done any of those things directly. After a couple of months, Lenny starts to recognize an interesting pattern. Nobody's clapping for him at company meetings anymore. And sure they've taken down his picture from the world because he's no longer an engineer, he's a manager. So somebody else is now the engineer of the year, they are clapping for him in meetings. He's like, he doesn't feel recognized or seen anymore. He's just a guy now behind the scenes and that kind of thing.\n\n(01:06:10):\nThen in a couple of weeks go by, then they have a big engineering problem. And you know what Lenny does? He jumps in and he solves the problem. Lenny did not recognize that his job has changed. His job is no longer to solve the problem directly, but to get a team of other people good at solving problems. This is because you're a great engineer but not a good manager. This story or this dynamic I've told is probably the most common origin story of what people see or deem as micromanagement. In many cases here, this individual knows how to do engineering. They don't know how to do engineering management. They don't see the shift in their dynamic being changed. We see back patterns where it's like the second you become a manager or a leader, you cannot say things like, I don't know. I'm not sure, I need help. Who told us those things? But it's like such an expectation that our leaders must have the answers, must know the right things, must do the right things.\n\n(01:07:17):\nAnd so what do we see people do? Rather than Lenny asks for help, he goes to Google and searches how to do an interview, how to write a review. Are you seeing? He reads different articles like this one looks cool and then he does it and nobody dies. Nothing breaks so he thinks there's a good framework and a good pattern. And we have this dysfunctional culture of everybody doing different things, whatever works for anybody and that is the cycle that repeats itself. Now, a person that works for Lenny sees that he used this framework and thinks it must be a good framework, my boss did it, and you see how that cycle repeats itself? Because Lenny didn't actually get coached to be a manager. If you ask anybody that works with me, if come to me and say, \"Oh, I need to get promoted to be a director.\" You know what I say? I say, \"Go be a director. You don't need a title. Let me tell you what a director does. And you're going to work with me over the next couple of months to do those things because I am promoting you to do the job, not to learn the job.\" You see where it falls apart in promotions? We promote people and it's like you're now a VP, do VP things. And you're like, I have never done VP things before, but I cannot tell people I've never done VP things because it makes me look incompetent, but I see the job description. I should do some VP things. What did my last VP do? Those things and those. How you say? But the best place to learn how to be a VP is when you're not a VP because that's where you practice being a VP.\n\n(01:08:52):\nThat's where you get feedback on because then when you become a VP, you have done those things before. It's like why is the first time you've done an interview when you're now a VP? Come in and do an interview with me, observe me do an interview, ask questions, see what works, get feedback. That's why I love those group product manager roles because those are actually meant to be designed as ways for people to make a decision if they want to be a manager or they want to just stay in the discipline, but people use them as why would you give somebody four direct reports if no evidence, they can manage one? So what I do is I give you one, you might tell me, I hate people. That's okay, we can talk about that. But it's like, let me give you four and you're just going to practice the bad behavior on four.\n\n(01:09:37):\nSo this is what often happens in company. We promote them into incompetence. It's not their fault because we are not coaching them. What we need to do is create a safe environment for people to practice leadership before they become leaders, before we promote them. We have to have good coaching programs for leaders to say, if there's a succession plan, I want Lenny to be a new manager. I don't wait till it's time to promote him then I teach him management because then apparently he cannot say things like, I don't know. I have to teach him leadership and management before he becomes a leader or a manager.\n\nLenny (01:10:10):\nI love this idea of just doing VP things. I just picture someone walking around and, I'm doing VP things.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:10:14):\nI'm doing VP things. All the time, I see them live, but what's a VP thing?\n\nLenny (01:10:19):\nI'm doing VP things. I think another added benefit of doing these things before you say you're VP is that is the best way to get promoted to a VP is you are already doing the job.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:10:28):\nThat's right. And nobody bites you on it. You see that? And you're not even surprised by it and it's very safe because when you're not in the job, you can make mistakes and nobody blames you. He's not a VP, look at him trying to do VP things. You see? But the second you're a VP, there's so much leverage in the role that your mistake is serious because it impacts everybody. But when you're not, it's like you get coverage, you get protection, nobody's as mad at you. It's like, yeah, he was just trying to take a stab at it. Let's coach him on that. But what is the best time to know those things? It's before you're in it. Before you're in it\n\nLenny (01:11:06):\nTo give companies and leaders something to do with this advice, you talk about helping them train and practice before they do this. How did you do that? I don't know, is it work with Silicon Valley Product Group to help train and coach?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:11:18):\nThere are many great product coaches out there. There are many leadership coaches out there. I think there's some recognition. People have to have the humility and the self-awareness to recognize that there are opportunities for them to get better as a leader and product management, you need to see or experience, good leadership, you need the reps of good leadership and we do it in everyway. You probably talk to people about strategy and what did they do? They outsource it all the time. Tell somebody else to do it, and that cycle feeds itself because you never do it. You only know how to outsource it. You never learn how to do it. You see? And so many people outsource, oh, go get a mentor, go take a training class, and they'll think that they're outsourcing coaching in that way. It's like go take a communication.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:12:02):\nSourcing coaching in that way. It's like, \" [inaudible 01:12:03]. Go take a communication class.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\" They come back from the class, and they punch you in the face. I'm like, \"Why did you punch me?\" \"The class taught me to punch you in the face. You paid money for me to learn how to punch you in the face.\" I say, go to the communication class with the employee because they're going to need to practice the communication.\n\n(01:12:20):\nYou learn what they're learning. Both of you now will practice it together, so that they can get better at communication. A communication class doesn't get you better at communication. Communicating better is an indication that you're better at communication. You need to practice it. And I need to create a safe place for you to practice, I need to give you feedback that you're communicating better. These are all patterns in coaching that many leaders just don't have these tools and techniques to do it.\n\n(01:12:48):\nI do teach a lot of leaders how to coach. I do a lot of people work with leaders. There's not a singular product problem. People here me say, \"All problems are people problems.\" There's not a singular problem that I have not seen coaching address.\n\nLenny (01:13:04):\nWhat I hear is essentially the biggest burden is on the manager to be a great coach to their reports, and for a manager to get good at this, essentially a coach is a really good method. Bring someone in that could work with you one-on-one on a lot of these things. Awesome. That's very actionable, very solvable.\n\n(01:13:21):\nEveryone's always going to ask, \"How do I find an awesome coach?\" Difficult, I guess. I don't know. What do you tell people to go find a coach? Is there anything you could recommend, just how to go find a coach?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:13:30):\nYou've got to find people that have generated good outcomes. People are always like, \"How do you find a good consultant?\" I get people teaching people a lot that haven't done the job. Don't get me wrong. If you look at American football teams, there are some coaches that have played the game before, and you feel good that they can coach you. And there are also some coaches that have not played the game, but if you look at the pedigree, they've learned from good coaches, they've worked under good coaches.\n\n(01:13:57):\nSame thing with product. I say there are only two parts. A good coach is someone that has played the game before and has generated good outcomes, and the second is that they've learned from good product coaches. You want to find people with a strong pedigree. You see [inaudible 01:14:12], and you, \"Oh, you worked at Amazon this year,\" or \"You worked at this company,\" or \"You worked at Stripe. [inaudible 01:14:18] good results. How did you do that?\"\n\n(01:14:19):\n\"Oh, my environment was great. The culture was great.\" \"Who taught you? Who coached you?\" Do pick-up games with the people that they coached. They will tell you what patterns their coach told them. How do you do that? My coach told me to do this, and you're going to learn from them. I say, \"Oh.\" Important things.\n\nLenny (01:14:37):\nAmazing. Okay. Final area I want to spend a little time on is the work you do in Africa. Marty said that you're the foremost expert in introducing product and technology into world's developing countries. I know you spend a lot of time in Africa specifically. Can you just talk about the work you do there and also just maybe the opportunities and challenges you run into when you're working with folks there?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:14:56):\nYeah. I have an African background, and my family is there, and I used to have this false notion that the things we've done in North America or Europe or Asia, the problems we've solved, have been solved in these markets. I remember talking to someone in Africa years ago, and he said to me, \"Oh.\" I said, \"You just got a new job. Where did you find a job?\" He's like, \"Oh, I found it in a newspaper.\" I said, \"A newspaper? What do you mean found a job?\" I remember participating in solving that exact problem in 1998. I was working with the team to solve that, and I had this false assumption that because I solved it here, of course it's solved everywhere.\n\n(01:15:40):\nI started to see patterns like this in Africa where just two things were trending. One, so many, the poor use of technology and enabling technologies to solve problems. And two, the difficulty in actually solving problems in these markets, in these emerging markets. And one of the things we take for granted, I always tell people the government is probably the biggest public private product platform in the world. In all countries, they all have this public... Because they provide the infrastructure and the architecture that is enabling for people.\n\n(01:16:18):\nImagine if you were trying to code and you didn't have power. Now you're thinking there are markets where you have to solve the problem of getting power before you then getting access to a computer and then getting access to the right type of software to be able to code something. Look at all the different things. You have to solve many problems just before you can start to solve the problem in a meaningful way. This is a very big reflection of the dynamic in Africa.\n\n(01:16:44):\nThe second pattern of what we see is because of this challenge, I see two things. One, people make a lot of money on a problem than from solving the problem. There's this whole society that people are very good at walking around problems. \"We've got an electricity problem, we'll just buy generators.\" \"We've got a road problem, we're going to buy bigger cars.\" I was talk at a conference, and I was driving up to it, and I saw a Tesla with a portable generator at the back of it. They'll stop and charge the Tesla, and they keep going on the road. In some ways, that's a whole society, but it's never been a society that didn't have creative people.\n\n(01:17:26):\nJust an amazing, tremendous amount of talent. It's a very young population. I talk to people all the time. I say, \"Look.\" Someone told me, \"Well, Africa, seven of the eight most underdeveloped places in the world are in Africa.\"\n\n(01:17:41):\nAnd I said, \"Well.\" They were talking about the discovery of the internet. Less than 30% of Africa has discovered the internet. And I tell them, \"Wow. And we created seven Unicoms from that. Imagine if 50%, 75% discovered the internet. We need to understand the opportunities, the youngest population, the fastest growing, some of the fastest growing economies in these markets. Some of the problems are so basic, and the opportunities are so huge. So I had to kill all these assumptions. One, that I needed permission to come to solve problems there, and two, that we didn't have the means to equip and educate people.\n\n(01:18:24):\nWe don't have a talent problem or a resource problem. The biggest opportunity I've found is to really empower a continent with enabling technology and the mindset and the skills to be able to leverage technology in solving problems.\n\n(01:18:40):\nThis led to me starting a nonprofit in Africa, the Innovate Africa Foundation, and we are committed to this education of people on the continent, this enablement with technology. We did our first conference last year, the Inspire Africa Conference. It just blew my mind. I'm so humbled when I could see a thousand people from 31 different countries in Africa come with a hunger and an eagerness to learn how to do product work. And it's not cheap by any means for them to do that.\n\n(01:19:14):\nWhat moved me the most is looking at the future generation. We had a 13-year-old and an 11-year-old in the workshop. The 11-year-old was a robotics engineer. The 13-year-old was a CEO of a small startup that keeps healthcare records, a leader. And I'm like, \"If I can help these people learn how to do product well, this is the whole generation for Africa. This is the future of people that want to leverage technology in a meaningful way.\" So I spend a lot of my time in Africa, coaching, advising and teaching teams how to use technology, how to do product, how to organize themselves as product teams, how to solve problems, and really to create a boldness within the continent for them to go after problems and solve them, than walk around the problems or make money on them.\n\nLenny (01:20:03):\nIf people want to learn more about this, maybe support the work you're doing, what's the best way to find out more?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:20:09):\nYou can visit the nonprofit website. It's innovateafricafoundation.org. You can follow our work on SVPG or the inspireafricaconference.com. I know I will be doing a lot more next year. In January, I am going to be launching a fund, the Paid Africa Fund, and I want it to be a fund funded by the product community for Africa. It's an angel investment fund. One of the problems I recognize is that so many of the startups, they are not ready for institutional investment, and they are forced into it in some ways. They say people are giving up a lot of equity when they just need cashflow. And so I really want to focus on a fund for the community to enable people to get product market fit in those markets.\n\n(01:20:55):\nThat'll be launching in January. I'll probably do an announcement about it. I'm excited about that work and to really try to promote more of product-centric thinking on the continent.\n\nLenny (01:21:06):\nAmazing. You should call this fun reference customers or something along those lines, if the goal is to help them find product market [inaudible 01:21:12]-\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:21:12):\nThat's right. They'll be learning a lot of that.\n\nLenny (01:21:15):\nChristian, is there anything else you wanted to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:21:21):\nI've always made an appeal to the product community to really have a sense of what they do beyond the job of a products team or product manager. And I always try to encourage people to see that: at the very core of what you do is really solving a problem. And that's creating... When you do that, create value in the world, you're making a dent in the world. People that participate in trying to make things better or trying to solve problems, and we should not shy from that definition of our job.\n\n(01:21:58):\nIt might feel like a fluffy one. It might feel too lightweight and not meaningful, but I think when people take to heart that that's really what the essence of products is or product work is, they bring to work a different passion, they bring to work a different sense of empathy, they bring to work a different sense of customer centricity. And all of those things lead to good outcomes.\n\n(01:22:21):\nI always make that appeal to product people as like, \"Yeah, all the frameworks, techniques, all the stuff, just think truly about what you're trying to do. You're trying to care enough about a problem to solve it on someone's behalf and do it so well that it give us something every time.\"\n\nLenny (01:22:37):\nI really love that last point of just that's how you know if you've built something people care about. They give you something in return, and one of those things could be actually telling other people about it.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:22:44):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:22:46):\nTo your point about reference customers.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:22:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:22:47):\nAmazing. Well, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:22:52):\nI don't have a choice.\n\nLenny (01:22:54):\nNope. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:22:59):\nOh boy. In this discipline, probably all of our books: Inspired, Empowered, and we are coming up with one in March, Transformed.\n\nLenny (01:23:08):\nI see that tee shirt there. I see the promo happening.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:23:10):\nYes, it's happening. It's happening. But it's really a reflection of so many decades of love and passion for product work. And I have not found, I always told Maddie that you write the books after have gone through the failure. It's like, \"I've failed at leadership, now there's a book on it. I've failed at product, now there's a book on it.\" And it reflects really the heart of good product work. I love Ben said the hard thing about hard things I love. There's some books that really describe the mindset and culture that good product work is done in. I always recommend those to people.\n\nLenny (01:23:43):\nJust on this topic of Transformed while we're on it, when is it coming out, and can you give just an elevator pitch for the book just so people know what it'll be about?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:23:49):\nTransformed is coming out March next year. Oh God, just three months. Some people should have gotten shipping dates on their books if you pre-ordered it now. But it really talks about how to move to the product model or the product operating model, which is really this set of beliefs and principles that the best companies work in. We share stories of companies that have transformed into this that are not your traditional bond digital or bond tech companies that have made this transition. We tell stories of what companies can do. If it's anything, it's an appeal that there is a better way of working and solving problems and that companies can work in this way regardless of where you are in the journey.\n\nLenny (01:24:32):\nAll right. We'll have to have you back once the book comes out to get more people aware of what is happening. Amazing. Okay, I'll keep going. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you've really enjoyed?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:24:41):\nI jumped on the Succession bandwagon, and I enjoyed, and I used to love Billions too as well. I love good writing, really just intellectual media writing business. And so probably Succession and Billions would be two.\n\nLenny (01:24:57):\nDo you have a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing candidates?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:25:02):\nWell, I always give them a problem to solve. That is probably my favorite question, and it's not a traditional problem. I probably will see something like, \"Hey Lenny, I have a friend. He's been legally deaf or hearing impaired his whole life, and he just got a new job that requires him to wake up significantly earlier than he normally does. And as you can imagine, traditional alarm clocks will not do it, will not solve the problem. And I would love to give that problem to you. Walk me through how you go about tackling this or solving this.\" For me, I like that question because it gives me a sense of how you think. It gives me a sense of how you solve problems. It gives me a sense of how you know what you do not know and how you go about knowing the things you need to know, what you need to solve a problem.\n\n(01:25:52):\nThere's no magical right or wrong answer. I do a lot of people that say, \"I have no clue what to do. I'm more curious and because I want to now know what you do, but you don't have a clue.\" Or people that jump straight to solutions, are more engineering-centric. People that jump straight to... I can get a sense of who you are when I give you a problem that requires you to do some thinking.\n\nLenny (01:26:15):\nAnd you're doing this live in an interview? It's not like, \"Go home and think about this, and then-\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:26:20):\nOh, I'm doing this live in an interview.\n\nLenny (01:26:20):\nLive, okay. And then what's a sign that they're on the right track? What do you look for that's like, \"Yes, this is what I want to see\"?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:26:26):\nRemember, when I think about what makes a good product manager, I look about collaborative problem solving. There are people that feel like, I'm just going to solve the whole thing myself. This is what we should do. We should do it like no evidence, no data, no kind of stuff in there. It's very interesting. But people that are saying, \"You know what? I would need probably work an engineer and designer. We might need to put [inaudible 01:26:46].\" I look for intellectual curiosity in some ways, people that have proven questions in your head. People that are very quick to see things [inaudible 01:26:54] people. I will talk to 20 of them. I say, \"How you going to do that? Do you know sign language?\" And they're like, \"Oh, how am I going to talk to them?\" There are people that are like, \"I'm going to need a lot of help to try to figure this out. I don't know a lot about your friend, but I know...\" Some people have frameworks they run to. It exposes that, if they're married to one way of working.\n\n(01:27:14):\nIt's more about knowing what you can't know. I'm looking for empathy, humility in some sense. It is a competence thing because most of I can teach, I can coach a lot of things, but that arrogance, that ego, those kinds of things, those \"I walk alone,\" those things are very, very challenging and disruptive to a team culture.\n\nLenny (01:27:35):\nDo you have a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like? Either an app or something physical? Anything that's like, \"Oh, this is really cool\"?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:27:43):\nMy eldest son is into sports. He loves all kinds of sports stuff, sports apps, all of those kinds of things, and he got me on this app called Real, like real sports. It's really cool. It shows scores of different games, but it's really driven by social influence. So all of your Twitter posts will get there like, \"Oh my God, [inaudible 01:28:07].\" It's almost like real time more than real time. You're getting real time with reactions of people around you and your communities.\n\n(01:28:15):\nIt's a very different way of checking on a score than I've ever seen, and I thought it was just really, really thoughtful in how... I want to share reaction to touchdown with 50 people around the world that will care about my favorite team just got a touchdown, and you'll all share reactions at the same time. And the first person that saw it, you can see it. It's very simple. This is like scores for games, but these days I don't check my scores anywhere else but on it.\n\nLenny (01:28:45):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often repeat to yourself, share with friends, either in work or in life, that you find useful?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:28:52):\nWow, boy. I've said a lot in this talk about companies don't care about about you, people care about you. It's never too late to be what you want to be. But early on, my father would always tell me, \"Show up. Show up, and you're ahead of 80% of the people in the free world. Show up on time, and you're ahead of 85% of the people in the free world. Show up on time with a plan, and you're ahead of 90% of the people in the free world. And if somehow you have the guts to put that plan to action with a smile, then you probably will have a great chance of success. And if you do that over and over again, every aspect of your life, it can at least lead to successful outcomes.\" And I think that's a lot of some mental definition for me every day.\n\nLenny (01:29:37):\nAmazing. I love that. Final question: as maybe the most interesting man in the world, is there anything people may not know about you or would be surprised to hear about?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:29:48):\nWow. I hope there are no surprises about me in that kind of case in that way, but I went to a gifted and talented school. I was out of my house at 12, and I went to kind of boarding school, and I've never been back home since then, so I've kind of been on my own. But we are kind of in the middle of nowhere, probably eight miles from any form of civilization and stuff in the middle of the jungle. No potable water, no electricity. So you kind of had to get water yourself, generate your own power. Probably the most interesting time in my life to shape my worldview, surviving at 12 to 16 on my own in the middle of the jungle. Very intriguing part of my life.\n\nLenny (01:30:40):\nVery different from your life these days. Actually, one more question. I think you're the fourth... You're from Nigeria, right? Your family's from Nigeria?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:30:47):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:30:47):\nYou're the fourth Nigerian guest on this podcast, I realized. And I always like to ask, what's your favorite Nigerian food slash which food should people seek out if they were to try to find some good Nigerian food?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:30:59):\nMy favorite Nigerian is super-duper cultural and native. It's like starch and [inaudible 01:31:06] soup. You can't really find that anywhere, it got to come from mom's cooking. Marty Cagan has tried it. He came to my hometown, my parents' house and had it. But if you are discovering Nigerian food, [inaudible 01:31:18] is a variation of rice, which everybody has, jollof rice, and yes people, I'm going to say this: jollof rice, Nigerian jollof is better than Ghanaian jollof. It's a war, but it's okay. We already claim victory, and we'll move on. But start with jollof rice is elementary, but then you have to try [inaudible 01:31:34] like a pounded yam with a soup. There are many different variations of that. And you get a pounded yam, like pounded cassava, and you eat that with a soup, and you will love it.\n\nLenny (01:31:45):\nSome controversy over here, competition-\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:31:47):\nThat's right.\n\nLenny (01:31:47):\n... for who's got the best rice. Amazing. Christian, I am now a huge fan of yours. I'm so happy we did this. Thank you so much for making time for this. Two final questions: where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:32:00):\nYou can find me on LinkedIn as well. You can reach out to us on our websites svpg.com. I tell people the best fit to be useful to us is to do good work using these principles and all the things we teach people over and over again. We care about outcomes, we care about good product work in the world. I would love your support with the work I'm doing in Africa. I've always reached out to the product community around the world to help developing countries and communities. So please follow our work, please support our work in Africa in building a product community.\n\nLenny (01:32:35):\nAnd what is the website for that again? Specifically the nonprofit you started?\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:32:38):\nInnovateafricafoundation.org.\n\nLenny (01:32:41):\nAmazing. Christian, thank you so much for being here.\n\nChristian Idiodi (01:32:44):\nThank you for having me, Lenny. Such a pleasure.\n\nLenny (01:32:46):\nBye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The ultimate guide to OKRs | Christina Wodtke (Stanford)\n\n## Transcript\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:00:00):\n... people do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, \"Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations and oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better.\" The simple act of getting together and saying, \"What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?\" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special, and it's super exciting.\n\nLenny (00:00:30):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Christina Wodtke. Christina is a multi-time author, speaker, and lecturer at Stanford where she teaches product management, game design, and a few other topics. She also consults with companies on their product development processes, and in particular, their OKR process. Before getting into teaching and consulting, she was a product leader at LinkedIn, MySpace, Zynga, and Yahoo, as well as a founder of three different companies, plus an online magazine called Boxes and Arrows. In our conversation, we go deep into OKRs. What is the atomic unit of an OKR? What might be broken about your OKR process? Why you may want to roll out OKRs or change how you approach them. \n\n(00:01:20):\nAlso, how the best companies leverage OKRs, the most common root causes of OKRs going wrong, the elements of a healthy OKR cadence, how OKRs fit with mission, vision, strategy, and roadmaps. We also touch on the skill of storytelling. And she also shares her most contrarian perspective on what new product managers should be focusing on. Christina is a wealth of knowledge and super interesting and fun, and I know you'll learn a lot from her. \n\n(00:01:45):\nWith that, I bring you Christina Wodtke, after a short word from our select sponsors. Today's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. I have a quick request, head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guests you'd want me to have on this year. I've already gotten a bunch of great suggestions, which you'll see when you go there, so just keep it coming. And while you're on the Miro board, I encourage you to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to capture ideas, get feedback, and collaborate with your colleagues on anything that you're working on.\n\n(00:02:22):\nFor example, with Miro, you can plan out next quarter's entire product strategy. You can start by brainstorming, using sticky notes, library actions, a voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team's prints. Then your whole distributed team can come together around wireframes, draw ideas with a pen tool, and then put full mocks right into the Miro board, and with one of Miro's ready-made templates, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks, all in Miro. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O .com/lenny. \n\n(00:02:58):\nThis episode is brought to you by Dovetail, the customer insights platform for teams that gets you from data to insights fast, no matter the method. There's so much customer data to get through, from user interviews to NPS, sales calls, usability tests, support tickets, app reviews. It's a lot, and you know that if you're building something, hidden in that data are the insights that will lead you to building better products, and that's where Dovetail can help. Dovetail allows you to quickly analyze customer data from any source and transform it into evidence-based insights that your whole team can access.

I'm really excited to be here. I've been hearing about you forever. It's so cool to be here in person.\n\nLenny (00:04:00):\nI'm more excited for you to be on the podcast. I kind of see you as the queen of OKRs. I don't know if you like that title or not, but in my mind that's where you sit currently, and partly because from what I can tell, you've done more to help people with OKRs and understand OKRs and fix their OKR process than most anyone else I know. As I'm sure you know, a lot of people just don't like OKRs, are kind of anti-OKR and have had bad experiences with OKRs. And what I want to try to do with our chat today is to try to change people's mind, who are maybe anti-OKR and to help people optimize their OKR process if they're having an okay time with OKRs. How does that sound?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:04:39):\nThat sounds just fine, although I have to say in the tech industry, it's a little too easy to be clean. Maybe when I'm a emperor for life, that might be my title.\n\nLenny (00:04:48):\nThat might be by the end of this podcast, we will crown you emperor for life. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:04:52):\nExcellent. \n\nLenny (00:04:54):\nOkay. That'll be our goal. So, as maybe a first question, I want to give people kind of this confidence that OKRs can lead to great product, great success. What can you share, just to give people a sense of, \"Here's how many companies who are having a great time with OKRs, here's the impact OKRs can have on your company if you roll it out or make it more optimal.\"\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:05:15):\nI've seen so many companies do extremely well with it, and I would say that not all companies will be successful, period. Companies are really successful with it are companies that... I think I can swear a little, they have their shit together.\n\nLenny (00:05:27):\nAbsolutely. 100%. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:05:29):\nAnd the first step is, get your shit together. They have strategy, they have empowered teams, they have psychological safety, and then the OKRs are that extra layer that supercharges them. So, I say OKRs are more of a vitamin, they're not a medicine. So, if you take OKRs and you're like, \"Oh, this will fix everything that's wrong with you.\" No, that's not going to happen. It's just going to reveal everything that's wrong with your company. But if you've done the hard work of getting your company to be strong, it's amazing how well it works. It works really well with startups. It works really well with multidisciplinary product teams. I've seen it over and over. I don't really have permission to talk about all my clients, but I have one client that I'm just working with right now, and it's a purpose built company. So, in other words, they exist in order to make the lives of their customers better, healthier, wellness.\n\n(00:06:20):\nAnd so, they used OKRs to really create this amazing focus on, what does it mean to make everybody's life healthier? And one thing that came out of applying OKRs was this wonderful idea, they're bringing robots into their warehouses, not to replace their humans, they're keeping all the humans, but to reduce the amount of back problems their humans have. So, the humans are doing much more complex tasks, thinking about inventory and how to be more efficient. And the robots are doing the heavy lifting. \n\n(00:06:51):\nThey've been growing and growing like crazy. And the OKRs are this very simple way of allowing you to focus on what actually matters and making sure you don't forget in the chaos of everyday life. So, if you know what you're trying to do, then the OKRs just help that happen. It aligns the company. And I think they're a lot like dieting advice, in that they say, \"Eat less and exercise more.\" Well, that's really simple. It's worked for me. I've lost 25 pounds doing eat less and exercise more. But wow, it's hard. It's really hard to do. And I think about OKRs that way. You have to just stay with it and be strong and committed, and that will help.\n\nLenny (00:07:36):\nThere's a number of things I want to follow up on in what you said. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:07:39):\nSure. \n\nLenny (00:07:39):\nSo, I'll start with, you talked about the benefits of OKR. If you had to just boil down, here's what OKRs can do for you as a company, as an organization, what would that be? What's just the main benefit of OKRs at your company?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:07:51):\nThe main benefit is that there's a lot of concrete action through a OKR that you don't always get from strategy. Strategy tends to be a little longer, a little more Muji Muji. And then when you get the OKR, you say, \"This quarter is what we're actually going to be doing, and these are the numbers we're actually going to be pushing further.\" So, that's really good. It creates a cadence of progress, which is incredibly valuable. It creates alignment. There's no question what the single most important thing to do in the company is, assuming you're doing radical focus and you don't have 20 OKRs every quarter. Ugh, don't like to think about that. And last of all, the thing that I don't see a lot of people talking about that I think is really amazing, is because an OKR focuses you for one quarter and at the end of the quarter you grade your OKRs.\n\n(00:08:40):\nHow well did we do? What got in our way? It creates this learning cycle. So, then you can take that information and say, \"Next quarter, what should we try next?\" And I think the time is the thing that a lot of leaders really struggle to think about. But if you've been really focusing on say, retention for one quarter, two quarters, and then you go over and say, \"Okay, let's work on acquisition.\" You don't forget all the things you learned about retention. No, you're just building knowledge and building knowledge and building knowledge, which means your company will constantly get smarter and more effective.\n\nLenny (00:09:13):\nI love this. So, just to summarize, the main benefits are focuses you, lines, creates a cadence and creates a learning cycle. And maybe a simple way to think about it is, it's like a plug-and-play product development process. You don't have to invent everything from scratch. There's this thing that exists. I know it's not the whole piece of it, but yeah, maybe... You're nodding and I'm curious, when I say that, what comes to mind?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:09:36):\nYeah, I guess you have to have a product development process, because obviously otherwise you're just running around chickens with your heads cut off, but it keeps you from making the same stupid mistake over and over and over again, which has been a goal in my life. My motto is, \"Make new mistakes.\" So, by having this focus on really important things, not to spread yourself too thin, like the famous peanut butter memo from Yahoo, which I guess was long ago enough, not everybody remembers it. But companies have a tendency to try to do everything all at this exact moment. And so, everybody's working with 1% on this, 1% on that and 1% on the other. And instead you use the OKRs and say, \"Okay, this is the big rock we're going to move. This is the big thing that's going to happen this quarter, and you can fiddle around with all the other stuff if you want, but this one has to move.\"\n\n(00:10:27):\nAnd then the next quarter, the next thing gets moved and so on. And it just accelerates the speed of your accomplishments so much. It's kind of mind-blowing. I've actually been running my life for the last eight, 10 years on OKRs as well because I'm ADHD and I'm all over the place. And so, looking at my OKRs every single Monday and saying, \"Well, am I going to work on a book? Am I going to work on my teaching? Am I going to work... Where do I want to put that attention?\" It changes me personally, just like it changes my clients.\n\nLenny (00:11:00):\nWhat's an example of your personal care? You said writing a book maybe could be one?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:11:03):\nWell, I wish, but no, it's actually been health. One of the great things about managing my OKRs for so long is I discovered this pattern, which is that anytime things get busy, I just stop taking care of myself completely. And that's really bad because if I'm healthy, I can be there for my kid, I can be there for my students, I can be there for my colleagues. So, this quarter's been about setting up habits of well-being and like I said, I've been really pleased at how it's been going.\n\nLenny (00:11:30):\nAmazing. I haven't heard that before. What would you say is kind of the atomic unit of an OKR? So, people talk about, \"We're doing OKRs, we're not doing OKRs\". What's the line between we have goals and a plan, and we're actually doing OKRs as a concept?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:11:44):\nGosh, what is the atomic unit? That's a really lovely question. I would say, \"What am I doing this week to get closer to our goals?\" If you could answer that question, you could give up all the OKR stuff, but if you just asked the question, \"What are we doing this week to get closer to our strategic goals, our longer term goals?\" That is the very heart of it, because there's the tomorrow problem, like my kid will do his homework tomorrow, and tomorrow never comes. It's always tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow. So, what are we doing right now? And I find that it's really useful to tie it into temporal landmarks. \n\n(00:12:21):\nBy that I mean that there are things like birthdays or New Year's or Mondays or quarters that are already built into the world. And so, we piggyback onto them and we say, \"Okay, it's Q1, boom, we're going to stop. We're going to take a breath, we're going to look at everything and we're going to say, 'What do we actually have to do?'\" Raising your head above the noise is really vital. \"And then this quarter, remember we have a mission over here and we have a vision and we have a strategy. Okay, this quarter's all about, what?\" And you move towards that. \n\n(00:12:52):\nI know there's a lot of talk about outcomes and I think that's absolutely right. It's really critical to think about outcomes because that gives you flexibility on how to attack the problem. But the biggest question is, why? Why do we get up in the morning? What are we trying to actually do? Are we making a difference at all? And if you can say, \"This week I'm going to do this,\" and then at the end of the week you say, \"Oh, that worked or that didn't work,\" and you can try something new or keep going. That's just invaluable.\n\nLenny (00:13:18):\nThat is really interesting that your answer wasn't like its outcome or some key results and 70% of success is goal, that there's something more fundamental, which is just being very clear on what you should be doing next week and we should be focusing on now. And that translates into what kind of the OKR process ends up being.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:13:34):\nOh, yeah. Can I tell you a little story?\n\nLenny (00:13:37):\nAbsolutely.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:13:37):\nSo, this is personal OKRs, but it works for everything else. It's always easier to talk about personal OKRs because I don't have to do an NDA with myself, so I apologize. But I've had this accountability group with these three women for at least five years, and every Monday we send our OKRs to each other, and I do it the way I do it in the book. Another woman, she had the getting things done approach where it was like, \"How percentage did I make and what am I trying to do?\" And exactly, super detailed. \n\n(00:14:06):\nAnd then another woman was like, \"Ah, I don't know. I guess I'm trying to think about... What am I trying to think about? Oh, maybe I should think about if I have to get out of product management or not.\" Well, now the woman who was very precise has kind of disappeared. I think it was just something that she couldn't keep up that level of diligence. While the woman who was hand-waving, she actually has gone from a product manager to a consultant to a life coach, and she's making so much money, and she is so damn happy, and she has a new house. And so, I really do think that the heart of everything is answering that question.\n\nLenny (00:14:44):\nAnd what is that question?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:14:46):\nWhat am I doing this week to get to the outcome I really want? Her outcome was to not worry about money and be joyful with what she was doing. And she got that just by every Monday saying, \"What the fuck am I doing here? What am I trying to do again?\" And it worked.\n\nLenny (00:15:03):\nThat is a really cool framework. So, the question you ask yourself every week is, \"What am I doing today that's helping me get closer to my outcomes?\" Is that the word to use outcome?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:15:12):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. And it is an outcome. In her case, it was not worrying about money, having a house, having joy in her work. I think a lot of us get caught up in, do I want to be a writer? Do I want to be this thing? When the reality is, we just want to be satisfied and happy. And with a business, it's the same thing. We get caught up in this or that little details, but you need to go back and say, \"What was our mission?\" I mean, think about it. How often do companies ever talk about their mission? It's like they set it, they forget it, it's super vague, it's useless. \n\n(00:15:42):\nInstead, it's good to think, \"Okay, when we started this company or when we changed this company or grew this company,\" or whatever you want to go to, there's always these various points in time. \"Why? What did we think would work? And let's go back to that moment of meaning and reconnect with it and then make it real in the activities we take every week.\" And I like every week rather than every day. Because the reality is we still have to do progress reviews and we still have to do accounting and whatnot, but if we just push a little bit each week, over time amazing things happen.\n\nLenny (00:16:15):\nSo, I want to drill into some of these things, of just how mission, vision, roadmap and OKRs kind of fit together, just to be pretty tactical. So, as a PM say, or founder, what is the process you recommend for working through mission, vision, and then OKRs, and then roadmap?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:16:33):\nI think it's really important to have a mission, and people get freaked out because they think the mission's forever. And so, they make them super vague so they can do anything. But instead, if you think about it, if the mission lasts for five years, what would you like to see happen in five years? And it might be, \"We're going to bring amazing games that delight our users and we're proud to ship into the world.\" That could be a mission. And it's like, \"Okay, I could do that over the next five years.\" And then, there'll be a point where you probably want to change again. So, you're bringing, what does it mean? What does it mean to be proud? What does it mean to delight people? Really talk about that and get into the nitty-gritty. And then out of that would come your strategy, which is this is going to be our year of exploration, if you have enough money for such a thing.\n\n(00:17:18):\nOr this is going to be our year of making our current games a little bit better. I'm in a very game mindset today because I was talking to a client. So, you get into that. Okay, now we have this sort of idea of what we're doing with our year. Now, let's talk about the quarter. And you can use OKRs for the year, but the quarter is where they have the most impact, I believe. Spotify talked about doing quarterly performance reviews because it's long enough to get something done and short enough to not forget what you did. And I think that sums it up perfectly for OKRs as well. So, once you know where you're trying to be, and once you know what you want to do with your year, you can say, \"What are the things we want to see happen across these four quarters?\"\n\n(00:18:01):\nI call it sort of a half-built strategy because too much strategy ties you down and too little strategy, you're too responsive to everything. So, you say, \"Okay.\" Let's say you're building a new game. So, Q1 is about figuring out what it is and what's going to be interesting to users. And then Q2 is going to be about getting some early prototypes out and validating those concepts. And Q3 is about building extensive, and Q4 is about marketing and throwing it out, something like that. And you could venture them into your outcomes. A lot of people who are very venture driven don't understand outcomes, objectives, excuse me, objectives, outcomes, potato, potato.\n\nLenny (00:18:39):\nAnd they sound horrid.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:18:39):\nIt's really something inspiring. Q1, we have a vision for this game that will drive us forward. I don't know, I'm making stuff up, which just means it's going to be imperfect. Although I do warn people not to get too caught up in wordsmithing. We can spend hours doing that. And then, you get to ask my favorite question, how do we know? I love, how do we know? That's how you get to outcomes. So, what does it mean to have a vision for a product we believe will be successful and meet our mission, whatnot? Well, what would it be? How are we going to figure this out? So, something about user testing, probably. Maybe we do a landing page, see how many people are excited by the concept. Maybe we do some technical builds to see if it's actually buildable. What are the sort of things that would tell us, yes, please go forward? We might be excited about VR. Well, how do we know that VR would be profitable for us? \n\n(00:19:35):\nSo, once we answer those three, how would we know, then we can know that by March we have the results we need. And we're always going to try to think about the best possible future, the whole moonshot thing, which I'm a fan of, but the reality is, the reason we do that estimating is so we get good at estimating. Everybody sucks at estimating when you first start, and a lot of people think it's like black magic or something you're born with. But no, it's a learned skill. You practice estimating, you get good at estimating, you get better and better and better. And being good at estimating is incredibly valuable as a business skill. So, there's your OKRs, right? And then for Q2, we don't know how Q1 is going to go, so we're just going to leave the objective there, but we're not going to get into the nitty-gritty OKRs. Key results cause a lot of arguing among the team, takes forever to track them down, just wait and see how Q1 goes. And that way you have enough play within your strategy to react to new information.\n\nLenny (00:20:32):\nThe question you talked about of, how do we know? That's to decide the objective or the key results?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:20:39):\nKey results, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:20:40):\nOkay, got it. You're saying objective. Okay, cool.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:20:42):\nObjective. My bad. I didn't signal when I turned. No.\n\nLenny (00:20:49):\nOh, okay, cool. That makes sense.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:20:49):\nObjective is that vision for the quarter. This is what we're we're driving towards in this quarter. And then the key results, you answered the question, how do we know we succeeded?\n\nLenny (00:20:58):\nAnd so, what was the tip you gave of turning strategy into the objective? How do you translate from strategy to deciding your objective for the core?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:21:06):\nOh, that sits between mission and OKRs. So, strategy, I've been really shocked lately. I've discovered that lots of companies don't seem to have any strategy whatsoever, which just blows my mind. So, if you think about strategy as a strongly held hypothesis about a way to win in the market and fulfill our vision, then you can say, \"Well, our mission is this, or vision...\" I kind of use them interchangeably because I think they are kind of interchangeable, and I'm not going to get in semantics in the bitty bits, but the strategy is really important because it says, \"We think we're fulfilling our mission of connecting people, by what?\"\n\n(00:21:55):\nI think that there are a lot of good product strategy pieces out there, but businesses have a lot of questions to answer. Are we going to ship physical products? Are we going to ship digital products? Are we going to be a service? Are we going to do a subscription? Strategy answers those questions. They say, \"We're going to have a game. It's going to be an Apple Arcade. We have a hypothesis that's actually going to help us. We're going to build in there and build our customer base there in order to get name recognition, which we can then use on other platforms.\" That's the sort of strategic stuff. And then we're like, \"Oh great, you have a vision. What are we doing? What does that actually mean for us this year, this quarter, and then eventually this week?\"\n\nLenny (00:22:39):\nFor the actual OKRs you end up with, is it as simple as just with the template of an OKR, is it just objective three-ish key results? Is there anything more to it that you recommend folks use? \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:22:51):\nNo. Simple things give you a lot more room to fiddle. And I feel like every time I see people make really complicated methodologies, they get way too caught up in the rules and they don't think about, what are we actually trying to do? So, simple is better.\n\nLenny (00:23:04):\nAnd what's your rule of thumb for number of key results?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:23:06):\nI like three. I think about it as triangulating. I always like something that's really hardcore numbers. I like something that's a little squishier, like a quality, make sure you don't forget about it. And I usually like something that involves a dollar sign, but it's really going to be specific to what objective you're trying to do. Launch a new product. Well, you probably want to make a certain amount of money, well you want a certain amount of reach, and then you want that delight thing. And then when you get into the delight thing, you can say, \"Well, is it going to be Metacritic? Is it going to be a survey? Is it going to be NPS?\" You know, could figure out what one makes the most sense for you.\n\nLenny (00:23:45):\nThat's an interesting topic. Is there anything you find there to measure customer happiness, satisfaction, delight? What have you seen work best for that sort of squishy stuff?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:23:53):\nI know there's a big backlash against NPS. I think it's okay. It's really funny because you can be insanely successful with a game that people feel yucky to play, and you can be incredibly successful with a product people hate using. Zoom, for example. How many times have you heard Zoom get cussed out? So, the question is, why would I care about that if I'm making money? And I would say the answer is, would you like to keep making money? It's always about retention. \n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nRight.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:24:24):\nSo, anytime you can get strong retention signals, I think those are good signals to get. So, that comes out of qualitative research. There's nothing better. So, if you don't have a qualitative researcher on your team, I think you should get one. You need somebody who knows how to separate what people say and what they do, and what the truth is in that. And then use that to apply to your strategic decisions, so that happy users sell your product for you, right? Happy users stay with your product. Happy users are willing to type an email telling you when you're messing up. I mean, you want committed users. They're just so important.\n\nLenny (00:24:58):\nOne final question around the actual OKR document. What do you find are the most one or two common mistakes people make when writing out the objective or the key result in deciding on what to go with?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:25:09):\nObjectives, people make them so fluffy that they don't have any meaning. They really should be a proper goal. We're doing this because we want to see this happen, it matters. We want to delight our customers. Sometimes people make them too fluffy and sometimes they make them too boring. It's like, \"Oh, we're going to ship this thing.\" That doesn't inspire anybody. Your objectives should make you, when your alarm goes off and you wake up, you go, \"Oh yeah, I'm changing the world today, or I'm doing something really cool.\" It shouldn't be like, snooze. So, I think an objective should be motivating but not ridiculous. \n\n(00:25:42):\nAnd then the key results, it's always going to be tasks. I mean, people put tasks in there all the time, and it can be tricky. Sometimes it feels like a task, like you have to get past a product review, so it's going to have a binary. They either said yes or no. But when you think about it, it is an outcome because it's really hard to get a product review group to say okay to anything. So, making sure that you have real outcomes that let you move forward, I think that's the biggest mistake people make in OKRs.\n\nLenny (00:26:13):\nYeah. I know you shared a few examples of just that came top-of-mind, but just is there any examples you can think of just, here's a really good example of an outcome? And I think your results are a lot easier, just move this metric 10% or hit-\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:26:25):\nLet's try to keep it fairly concrete. You're a online magazine selling interior design ideas. So, what are you trying to do? You're trying to get strong leads out to your advertisers, and that's really important, and you're doing it because you believe that people deserve to have homes that are warm and wonderful. You have this mission, and you want to make money while you do it. So, your strategy is going to be about connecting human beings with the brands that will suit their lifestyle. Okay, that's great. And then we get to the nitty-gritty, well, what does that actually mean? Are we going to really work on recommendations passionately? Are we going to really create various markets and throw down advertising where we think these people are? That's when your strategy comes into play because you're making all these interesting choices. So, let's say we're going to double down on recommendations, which has a lot of presuppositions.\n\n(00:27:23):\nWe have to get people to like, we have to understand their patterns of behavior, and that's when we can start to go to OKRs. We can say, \"Okay, so we have this online magazine, let's really work to get as many people being members rather than browsers as possible, so that we can start understanding what they like.\" And that's what Q1 could be really about, is starting to collect profiles of people's passions, and that sounds kind of exciting. \"Okay, great. We're going to do that. We're going to create a profile of people's passions. Awesome.\" So, how would we know we were successful? \"Oh, gosh. Well, we probably need a bunch of people to do it, but do we really need everybody? Maybe 30% of our audience flips over, and maybe that's right, maybe that's wrong.\" If you don't know, you just set it and you'll know by the end of Q3, whether you were stupid or not, it's fine, move on.\n\n(00:28:12):\nOkay, that's great. Okay, how many things should people do what with? So, they bookmark, favorite, like... How about like? Okay, so maybe they're going to like a certain number of products each week. Let's go for weekly active users. So, they're going to like three things and present it. Okay, so now we've got a couple of numbers that are pretty good. How do we know they're actually kind of liking it? Maybe you decide to do some panels, and we're going to measure using a customer panel, bring them in, have them talk to us, and we're going to do that at the end of every two weeks to hear how it's working and understand more about it. \n\n(00:28:54):\nOkay, now we have some OKRs. With key results, I always recommend spending 10 minutes brainstorming every single way you could possibly measure that outcome. Because with brainstorms, you always think of all the obvious stuff first and then you have no ideas and you're just sitting there with your post notes going, \"How long is 10 minutes anyway?\" And then you start getting the weird ideas. And often out of those weird ideas are really good insights. So, I recommend some pretty long brainstormings on the key results, but the objective is sort of a manifestation of the strategy at a one quarter level.\n\nLenny (00:29:26):\nAmazing. That was an awesome example. You talked a bit earlier about how OKRs end up being... or sorry, key results end up being tasks for a lot of people. And this reminds me, we had the CPO of Figma on this podcast, and he told the story of how they moved away from OKRs at one point because they found themselves sitting in these meetings reviewing these large spreadsheets of hundreds of tasks- \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:29:49):\nOh, god. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:29:50):\n... that were basically just tasks for ICs that they're working on, and they kind of lost sight of why does any of this matter? What are you even trying to do as a company? So, they moved away from OKRs and then they came back to them actually later and fixing some of these issues. So, maybe just as a question, what do you think is a sign that your OKR process is busted and that you need to spend some time improving and rethinking the way it works?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:30:13):\nI think if those meetings are boring, that's a great example. One of the other benefits, which I didn't bring up about OKRs is that they scale really well. One of the biggest problems founders struggle with is they don't scale very well, but if you can set a good OKR and get people to work on it, then you don't have to decide all those little IC tasks. You don't want to be drug down with that. You got a job. CEOs got to figure out what's coming up down the line, not fiddling over everybody's tasks. So, you set the OKRs and then you ask in the meeting, \"What are the top three initiatives that you're doing towards them?\" Or two or five, whatever. It's going to vary a little bit, but you want to keep it small. You only want to look at the most important stuff and just trust your people to take care of everything else.\n\n(00:30:58):\nAnd then you can say, \"Well, why do you think that's important? What do you think that's going to do?\" Or, \"I've been seeing that for weeks. Are you going to try something else anytime soon?\" It's all about those conversations about, is our current strategy, not just at the company level, but at each departmental level, are these strategies working? Are they moving us forward, towards our goals? And so, looking through OKRs, I tell people, \"When you first start, it might take a half hour, but after that it should just take 10 minutes.\" It's like, \"I think that's stupid. We should talk about that.\" Or, \"No, it looks fine, looks essentially correct, let's move on. Anybody got anything?\" And then you can get into whatever else you do, if it's a metrics review situation or if it's talking about a new deal, the rest of the agenda.\n\n(00:31:43):\nBut that constant checking in is like touching a lucky stone in your pocket. It reminds you, \"Oh yeah, there's this thing, there's this thing.\" And that rhythm... I'm a teacher, I'm really into learning theory. So, there's a really big concept which is about repetition and retrieval practice. So, retrieval practice means that I put a fact in your brain and I keep asking you to go back and get it again. Qualitative research is really useful for understanding the psychology of your users.\n\n(00:32:15):\nI'll say, \"Well, how do we understand the psychology of users?\" And you'd be like, \"Oh, I heard this.\" Okay, I bring it up. Well, it's the same thing in these weekly meetings, you're practicing retrieving what your OKRs are, and after a while they're just in that long-term memory and you don't have to struggle to think about them and you've got them. And anytime you make a decision and you're in a big rush, you don't want to go through a bunch of paper to try to find what were our OKRs? You just go, \"Boo, this is what we should do. I know what we're trying to do and I know how to make a decision about that.\"\n\nLenny (00:32:44):\nSo, what I'm hearing is, a lot of this comes back to, if the meeting is not interesting and boring, change the way you run the meeting. Don't go through everything. Maybe just pick the things that are most interesting and focus on that. You don't have to review every single key result.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:32:57):\nKeep the meeting level at the right place. I'm sorry, I wandered off in a different direction. I get really nerdy around learning theory.\n\nLenny (00:33:03):\nNo, I love it. I love learning how to learn. Feel free to share more as things come up. Okay. So, I don't know. I'm trying to think. Figma, I imagine they probably thought they could change this meeting, but I think maybe there's a more deep-rooted issue. And this is kind of where my next question is going to go, is what do you think are just the root issues of OKRs going wrong? \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:33:24):\nOh, my god.\n\nLenny (00:33:25):\nMaybe that's a symptom of the meeting, they're really boring, but yeah.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:33:27):\nWell, the symptom, it's really wrong. Yeah, it means that you're in the weeds, man. You're fiddling with the little tiny bits. You got to let go of those. You have to trust your people. So, if we do the five why's, okay, why don't you trust your people? Is it you or are you hiring horribly? Okay, if you're hiring horribly, why are you hiring horribly? Is it because you can't find the right people? Is it because you're rushing through it? You have to keep chasing it down. OKRs are a great diagnostic tool because they tell you something's broken. So, if your OKRs are going sideways, something's broken deeper. There's also the problem with psychological safety. You need your teams to be able to say, \"This isn't working. We're doing something else.\" Instead of just saying, \"This isn't working, tell us how to fix it.\"\n\n(00:34:13):\nPeople are coming to you and saying, \"How do we fix this problem?\" Something's broken in the company. You're doing something wrong as a leader. You have to think about, if somebody doesn't know what to do and you're like, \"Well, I have a strategy. I told you what my strategy is.\" And they don't know how to make decisions, it means something's wrong with the strategy or you aren't being clear, because the conversation always has two people. There's an old joke that I think about a lot, which is, if during the day you meet one asshole, he's probably an asshole. But if all day long you meet nobody but assholes, you might be the asshole. And I think that's very true. If your entire company's confused, you might be the asshole. You have to think about, how can I get more clear? If people are constantly bringing you little things, it's not because they're scared, it's because you're scary.\n\n(00:35:01):\nSo, a lot of times your OKRs breaking are speaking to something else happening, and if your OKR process isn't working, then you have to step back and go, \"Okay, how far deep do I have to go before I figure out what's wrong with my management team?\" And it could be the CEO, but it could actually be some weird group dynamics, and you've got to focus on that. I really love Patrick Lencioni. Five Dysfunctions of a Team is his most famous book, and I would recommend that if you like the fable style book. But it's the same thing. You got to fix things at the top, you got to do your own work, and then everything else runs a little better.\n\nLenny (00:35:40):\nThis episode is brought to you by writer.

Is it a middle manager doing something wrong? Is it just misunderstanding how to use OKRs? What do you think is usually the issue with OKRs not working well?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:36:57):\nI can repeat everything I said, but instead I'll just say speed. People read, measure what matters. They get their panties in a bunch, they get really excited. They're just going to do OKRs for everybody, but they didn't really read the whole thing. You kind of skimmed it and you don't really understand how it works, and so you just implement it. Or you ask your head of HR to implement it, and it gets implemented and everybody's really happy and then they're really sad and then they spit it out. And then you say, \"Okay, OKRs don't work.\" I mean, that's what I see over and over again. Nobody calls me for advice when they are thinking about OKRs. They call me for advice when they've done it in sales, every damn time. \n\n(00:37:32):\nI think it's... What is it, the illusion of knowledge? If I asked you right now, how does a bicycle work, or how does a pen work? You'd be like, \"I know how that works.\" And if you tried to write it out, you couldn't. Well, I couldn't. How does a ballpoint pen work? Okay, there's a spring and there's some ink. I'm not sure. So, really thinking about, how would OKRs work throughout the company, is valuable. So, because you don't have time as a leader, what you should do is just give my book to your best team and say, \"We're thinking about OKRs. Can you guys see if it works?\" And then three months later, check in with them. \"What did you figure out, guys?\" Okay. \n\n(00:38:13):\nBecause the best team always wants to be better. I love piloting with the best team, but they're still very imbued in your culture, so they'll figure out where OKRs in your culture don't fit. They'll figure out where it's helpful and then they can give it back to you and you have a template, and then you can take it to two more teams, and then you can take it to two more teams. And maybe you adopt it with your management team, little bit by little bit. That's how I tell people to start with OKRs. Just figure out your best multidisciplinary team team and say, \"You guys start and let us know.\"\n\nLenny (00:38:44):\nThis might be a good time to talk a little bit more about your book for folks that are actually planning to roll out OKRs or trying to fix their OKRs. Can you just talk about what it is, how to find it, what it's called, anything else.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:38:54):\nYeah, it's called Radical Focus. I could have called it Guide to OKRs, but I think what's really important is to learn how to focus on the most important things and make them happen. It is a business fable, as they call it, where I tell a story about two startup founders and their struggle to find focus and how OKRs help them. And then the second half, it's the second edition that's out now, it's gotten twice as big because I started working with big companies as well as startups and had to work through, what does it mean when you have a larger company and what struggles they follow? \n\n(00:39:27):\nAnd so, I think the first part's nice because it's fun to read stories, but I think what's really good about is what you notice, which is when I talk you through this company trying to figure out what their OKRs were, everything became a lot more clear. And I think that's one of the powers of stories, is seeing an example. And then the rest of it is really like you could almost open it to any page and look at your problem, go, \"Oh my problem's with strategy or my problem's with tasks versus outcomes.\" And you could flip around and figure out, what's the piece I need to solve?\n\nLenny (00:39:57):\nAnd folks can find it on Amazon if they search for Radical Focus?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:39:59):\nIt's everywhere, baby. \n\nLenny (00:40:01):\nOkay, great. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:40:01):\nAnd it's been translated into eight languages, which is pretty cool.\n\nLenny (00:40:05):\nWow. Which one's your most favorite language it's been translated into?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:40:08):\nWell, Chinese, because it sells like crazy because apparently some Chinese actress said she loved it and then it's been selling bigger there than anywhere else.\n\nLenny (00:40:17):\nSo, Chinese actresses using OKRs, what is going on?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:40:21):\nMind blown. Once again, life is always more surprising than anything you can imagine.\n\nLenny (00:40:25):\nI have more questions I want to ask you about OKRs, but you were talking about storytelling and fables and things like that. So, you also wrote a book about, not that we're going to go through all your books, but you wrote a book about drawing and the power of drawing, and also you just believe in storytelling as a really powerful tool. So, I'd love to hear just your take on why storytelling is so powerful and why skilled drawing is so important for product leaders at the [inaudible 00:40:48].\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:40:48):\nI think there are some things that are fundamentally human that are built into our genes. Storytelling's one. If all of human history was a clock, we started writing things down at 11:00 PM, so most of human history has been an oral tradition where we told each other stories to help pass on knowledge. And so, don't get anywhere near the big kitty with the great big teeth because you will die, or don't eat those red berries because my grandfather threw up for three days and then croaked. But we tell them better than that. Longer stories tend to have more conflicts and they tend to be seen as having more information. So, if you use storytelling, you're talking to the most ancient part of the human brain and you will get attention, you'll get comprehension and you'll get retention. The teacher's Holy Trinity, right?. So, I love stories. They work well, they catch people's attention.\n\n(00:41:38):\nAnd one thing I read that kind of blew my mind was, they said that if you tell people a bunch of facts, they'll forget most of them, especially those that don't fit into their current mental model of how the world works. But if you tell them a story that's full of facts, they will remember it. And if you look at TED, everybody loves a TED Talk. They're mostly all just stories, and facts sprinkled inside those stories. So, I think stories are very powerful. I think images are very powerful. Words are very abstract. If I say the word chair, what pops into your brain? Was it a big easy chair? Was it a hard wooden chair? We use these words as if everybody knows what we're talking about, but people don't. \n\n(00:42:22):\nSo, in my time in industry, because I was at, what, Yahoo, LinkedIn, Zynga, MySpace, stuff like that, I just found if I got on the whiteboard and drew really badly, and I think it's almost important to draw badly, make some marks, make some squares. Somebody else will go, \"No, no, no, it doesn't work that way. Give me this pen,\" and start doing it. And it gets you so fast to a shared vision of what's going on. I know designers spend all this time making wireframes and I'm like, that's the lamest use of time ever. Just get some whiteboards, go into the room with your engineers and start making some marks together and that just works better. \n\n(00:42:56):\nAnd I found that for some reason in America, people seem to think that you have to be one of the chosen few and born a drawer. But it's like anything, it's like playing piano, you just got to practice a little bit. So, the book mostly just has some really simple things you can draw, and then it tells you how to use them in business. So, I wanted to make something that was even simpler than Back of the Napkin, which is an awesome book, but gets pretty intense, pretty quickly.\n\nLenny (00:43:22):\nWith the storytelling piece, I feel like most people are like, \"Yes, I know storytelling is powerful.\" But they don't know how to do it. Is there one tip you could share? Just how to get a little bit better at storytelling or integrate storytelling into your work as a product leader or founder?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:43:37):\nIf you say one tip, you're really holding me down. I would say-\n\nLenny (00:43:41):\nYou could do two tips if that makes it easier.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:43:43):\n... when you finish telling a story, if you're telling it to someone you can trust, say, \"What's something I could have done to make the story better?\" You're going to find out, do I just blather on forever, or do I not give enough details? I mean, if you're only going to do one thing, get feedback, is always the answer. The second tip would be structurally there's a beginning, middle, and end. Intrigue people with a hook, a mystery. That's the beginning, right? A mystery, a secret, a surprise. The middle is, you can tell them a little bit about it. That's where you get your message in. If you're trying to pitch something, sneak your product in, whatever. And the end is always going to be success and celebration because you're trying to get people excited about your story or remember this information. So, just a basic structure in your head really, can kind of make a big difference.\n\nLenny (00:44:29):\nYeah, I love that. That's such a actionable, straightforward tactic for getting better, just ask people, \"How could this have been a better story?\" Great idea. Your second piece made me think about the Minto Pyramid. Do you know much about, do you work with that at all? The Minto Pyramid principle?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:44:45):\nI had a Minto binge for a little while, but I moved onto other stuff. I do.\n\nLenny (00:44:45):\nI think it was a triangle. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:44:45):\nYes, but I can't recount it to you. I do remember it.\n\nLenny (00:44:54):\nI was just going to ask because it's kind of the reverse concept, which is, you start with the conclusion and then you kind of share how you got there.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:45:01):\nI think that's a good one. I mean, if you think about what's the job of a hook, a hook just gets you excited. So, how do you get people excited? You can start with a conclusion. There's going to be success. Oh, tell me more. I want to be successful. It could be a mystery. Ooh, what's happening there? I want to be part of that. It could be a secret. Something happened and I'm not going to tell anybody else, but I'm going to tell you. There's so many ways to hook people in, but they're all doing the same job because you want people to actually listen to you and not pretend and nod. So, I think you can do it backwards as well. But I bet even when Barbara Minto did it, she probably opened with a success and ended with a success, I would bet good money, to remind people that there's a happy ending and the story's worth following.\n\nLenny (00:45:42):\nThat's a really interesting perspective because to me, there were opposites of build tension and you reveal the answer. The Minto approach is start with the answer. Here's what we're going to do and here's why, and here's all the work I did to get there. Your point is, that's also really interesting. You're like, \"Oh wow. I don't know how you got to that.\"\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:45:56):\nThere's so many ways to tell a story. Just don't bore your users.\n\nLenny (00:46:00):\nGreat advice. Okay, I want to come back to a couple more OKR questions. It could be less fun than the story maybe, but hopefully more useful. I want to just get your take on what is the cadence of a healthy OKR process? What are the ceremonies and meetings and emails that are involved? I know you have this kind of weekly status email practice. Do you recommend... How do you describe the system of an OKR process?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:46:23):\nOh my gosh, I'm glad you asked because I think the cadence is probably the single most valuable piece of it. So, every Monday, because Monday is a great temporal landmark, look at your week, and you go, \"Okay, what am I going to do to move the ball forward?\" And it could be an email to your boss, it could be an email to your accountability group, could be an email out to your team, could be standing there like standup. I mean, it's very easy. OKR rituals were built on agile rituals. So, there's a lot of connections there, which is great. \n\n(00:46:52):\nSo, you just, Mondays you commit and Fridays you celebrate. People do not value celebrations enough. I've had CEOs who said, \"Well, it was the middle of the quarter, so we didn't start OKRs, but we did start Friday celebrations. And oh my God, things are already changing. Things are already getting better.\" The simple act of getting together and saying, \"What was the most awesome thing that happened to you this week? What's the most awesome thing that happened in marketing? What's the most awesome thing that design did this week?\" It makes people feel like they're part of something really special and it's super exciting. \n\n(00:47:25):\nSo, you have these [inaudible 00:47:26] bookends and I think if you only do that, you're probably in good shape. I think status emails, I hated them so profoundly for most of my life. I had this huge team at MySpace and my project manager would gather everybody's status emails and put them together into this giant status email that I had to send to my boss. And I was so busy, I just sent it forward figuring it was fine. And then I read it and there was this really bad thing in my status email that should not have happened.\n\n(00:47:51):\nI was like, \"Fuck.\" And I waited to hear back from my boss, and nothing. Apparently he wasn't reading them either. So, I was like, \"What's the point of the stupid thing?\" And then when I was at Zynga, we were using OKRs and they were really short. They were like, \"What's your confidence level on your key results? What did you do last week? And what are you doing next week?\" And the last week, next week is great because it allows you to start noting down what stops you from getting shit done. And that, I got to say, there's so much learning in that. I tried to do this, but what? Did I get sick? Did somebody get mad at me? Did somebody not want to work with me? Do we not have this critical database? The whole, I tried to do this last week and I failed, learning goes through the roof.\n\n(00:48:38):\nAnd that rhythm of just having three P1s, you can't have more than three P1s. You can have as many P2s as you want and P3s if you really think you should, but you can scam it... scam it. You can skim it, right? Go through it really quickly. And we would all send them to emails. You could subscribe to email lists, which meant I could read the status emails of most of the company, and I would know what was going on and I could quickly see who should I go over and talk to, and who should I make a connection with? So, those emails were invaluable. I think a lot of my clients are doing it in Slack now instead. And that works really well, if you have this place where you're putting your status in and people will quickly go, skim, skim, skim, skim. \"Oh, okay. I got to talk to that guy.\" So, it's hyper valuable.\n\nLenny (00:49:20):\nIf you assume others, the OKR doc, you're like, \"Here's our outcomes for the quarter. Here's our three key results.\" You make that plan once a quarter. You have any recommendation how long to spend on planning your OKR?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:49:32):\nMy goal is always as little as possible. Time you're planning is not the time you're shipping, and the best is the enemy of the good. So, in an ideal world, you would grade your OKRs week at the end of the quarter, maybe second to the last week of the quarter, depending on it. If it takes you a whole week to set OKRs, which I hope it doesn't, but who knows. And then the very last week you set your OKRs for the next quarter and that's it. \n\nLenny (00:49:58):\nCool. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:49:59):\nBoom. If you can do it at in a... usually you can do it in four days total, unless you have a very hierarchal, huge deep bench. And even then, I have something, I'm going to share this with you because I don't think many people talk about this. The approval process will kill you. I've seen it happen over and over again. I was working with one of my clients and we came up with this different kind of approval process that's working really well, is that basically instead of having your boss approve it, you write your OKRs, you get three... I'm a big fan of the rule of three, because I'm a storyteller, but you could do less or more, I guess, teams that work with you enough to know what you're up to, to look them over and they just look them over, 24 hour turnaround. \n\n(00:50:43):\nThey say, \"This looks right, but I don't think this is possible.\" They give you that feedback and you're done. That's it. That's the entire approval process, and it's so fast and it works so well. And that means you might have to say no to somebody if they're asking you to do more than... if you had 10 teams asking you to look over their OKRs, you have to say no. You want to keep it down to a reasonable number, but if you do one a day, it could be done in a week.\n\nLenny (00:51:09):\nI'm thinking about companies the size of Airbnb when I left, trying to do it that quickly. And it's hard to imagine, partly because there's top level strategy that has to align with individual team roadmaps and dependencies, and platform teams and things like that. So, I imagine it's hard to do as the company's scales. I like the drive to make it a week and be done.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:51:29):\nWell, I mean, who really has to approve it and what does it cost you if you get it wrong? And so, if tech looked at it, if somebody from strategy looked at it, if somebody from sales looked at it, whatever, the right people looked at it, you're probably fine. And if you're not right, you'll figure it out over the quarter and do better next quarter. We have to let go or we will get mired down in all this crap.\n\nLenny (00:51:57):\nI love that. I went off track, but just to kind of put a ribbon on the concept of OKRs, you have this document with your object, your outcomes, your key results, and then your recommendation is do a weekly email. And is the idea everyone on the team sends this weekly email or Slacks to the rest of the team?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:52:15):\nTo the rest of the company if you can.\n\nLenny (00:52:18):\nWow. Okay. [inaudible 00:52:19].\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:52:19):\nThat's the thing, is Google, even as a huge company, everybody's OKRs and their weekly updates are on their intranet. You can look stuff up, so why not?\n\nLenny (00:52:28):\nGot it. And we'll link to a template that you have on your blog post. And also I think in the book, I imagine you have this template of what it is, but essentially it's your confidence level of hitting your OKR, what you did last week, what you're going to do next week.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:52:40):\nAnd then a few notes if you need to.\n\nLenny (00:52:42):\nDoes this replace stand-ups in your experience?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:52:45):\nIt could. I never try to tell engineering how to get their shit done, but if they felt like it was doing the same job, then they could combine them.\n\nLenny (00:52:56):\nCool. Okay, great. And is there anything else? Is this the whole OKR process, in your experience?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:53:01):\nThe only other thing I would bring up is thinking about the word grading. So, a lot of people think about trying to make something really numerical, like 0.08, I got 80% of the way there, but a lot of times they're qualitative. So, how do you think about that getting approved by the product committee? So, it doesn't matter. It really doesn't matter. Don't get fussy. Don't try to make it really precise. Just go ahead and say, \"Ah, hand wave, hand wave, 80%.\" What matters is, why 80%? Really focus on the learning. So, we almost got there. Well, if we would've gotten there, if we got two more days, that's fine. We basically got there. We knew what we were doing. If we didn't, if we were really far away, what went wrong? \n\n(00:53:44):\nIt's all about the retrospectives. Make sure your grading is secondary to retrospective, is the biggest thing I would say, because that's what's going to be valuable. And you could spend so many hours trying to come up with some fake measurement system that never is quite accurate and just wastes everybody's time when you could just be faster. I'm just obsessed with speed. You may have noticed that.\n\nLenny (00:54:03):\nI thought it was 70%, is that 80% is success? Is that the rule of thumb for OKRs?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:54:07):\nIt's about 70%. Some people do 80%, some people do 0.075, I don't know. My feeling is, a good goal is one that makes you feel somewhat uncomfortable but not doomed. You're like, \"Woo, that's kind of good, that's going to be tricky. Okay, let's go for it.\" That's about where I like to land with a key result.\n\nLenny (00:54:29):\nI had a newsletter post with Lane Shackleton from Coda, and he made this point that OKRs were created by Google, which is the most incredible business model in history. They just print money, and for them it's okay not to hit their goals, like 70% of goal is fine, it'll be fine, we're making so much money. And so, his perspective for most companies, it doesn't make sense to set the goal to be like 70% of this goal you set is a success. Do you have a perspective on that?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:54:57):\nI think you'll never know what you're capable of unless you try to do something that you're not sure you can do.\n\nLenny (00:55:01):\nI agree. I find setting more ambitious goals than you think you can immediately achieve actually really pushes you to achieve them.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:55:08):\nAnd the literature agrees. There's a lot of literature that shows ambitious goals are actually quite motivating unless you feel you're doomed, at which point then they're demotivating.\n\nLenny (00:55:16):\nI've seen that too. Okay, two more OKR questions. One is, I noted this from before so I'm just going to come back to it. There's a balance with key results of, as you've talked about, being very precise and metrics-driven and focused. And then there's, you talked a bit about sometimes it's okay for them to be a little fuzzy, like quality and delight, and those latter ones are harder to measure, it's hard to keep people accountable. Do you have any advice for just how to find that right balance of, this is what will keep you accountable, and this is how we drive the business forward, and this is how we know you're doing a good job, versus here's a general thing that we think is success and it's fine. Do your best.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:55:57):\nYeah. One of the most common arguments I have with my friends is I think everything can be measured to a certain degree. Not precisely necessarily, but you can get enough of a swag to be useful. So, by trying to measure things, you'll start learning how to measure things. So, you maybe try NPS and you're like, \"Wow, this is not actually accurate, or weird, or not.\" There's a lot of stuff we don't know until we try them. And of course, my background is in lean and agile and design and they're all iterative. They're all about, let's try something and then learn something and then do something. Which is why I'm so fanatically iterative. So, I think that when you got these fuzzy things, you just got to start trying out ways to measure it and trust the team to be able to figure out whether it's working or not.\n\n(00:56:46):\nRevenue, it's easy. This is what we're making now, this is what we could be making. Or you're not making anything now, so you can look up some numbers from public companies or whatnot. That's easy. DAU, it's easy. Acquisition numbers, it's easy. But when it comes to will people stay, do people actually like this? That's harder, but it's not impossible. There's a lot of user researchers who have worked hard to figure out how to measure it.\n\n(00:57:15):\nSo, you can either buy the obvious off-the-rack package like an NPS, or you can dig a little harder and figure out what would be meaningful to your company. And I think there's a desire not to do things that are hard and take a little bit longer, but that's where you're going to get the super value. That's how you become the next Netflix or Amazon or whatnot. So, you really got to say, \"How will we know about our product and what are the approaches are out there and which one makes sense for us?\"\n\nLenny (00:57:47):\nFinal OKR-related question. Say someone's listening to this and they're like, \"Wow, this is awesome. I want to do this at our company, we have a focus problem, we have alignment problems, we need to be more clear about what we're working on.\" Other than buying your book and reading it and sharing with everyone, what would you recommend would be the first few steps to work along that journey to rolling out an OKR process at the company?\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:58:09):\nI hate to say this, but there are a lot of consultants that have popped out of nowhere and it's kind of terrifying because so many of them really, really suck and they're just like, \"Oh, OKR sounds like SMART goals or whatever, I'll just use that.\" Or it's hot, and so I'm going to figure it out by reading some articles. And so, I would ask for references. I think that's a good one.\n\nLenny (00:58:33):\nSo, your advice is find someone to come in and help you figure out how to do this well and find the right person.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:58:40):\nYeah, I guess I think that finding someone to coach you is really high value, but I also think it would be okay if you just read a book or read a bunch of blog posts and start experimenting. It's not rocket science. You just listened to this podcast, listen to it again. Take lots of notes, Google around, see if you can learn a little more about some of the concepts that you didn't fully understand or you want to know more about. And then just run a tiny pilot and say, \"Okay, what does this mean for us?\" You don't even have to call them OKRs. You can just try, \"We're going to do a outcome focus this quarter and let's see where it takes us.\" But just try it because that's where you learn stuff. And try it at a small, safe level where you don't think it's going to hurt too many things.\n\nLenny (00:59:25):\nAnd you said to start with a high performing team. \n\nChristina Wodtke (00:59:27):\nOh, yes.\n\nLenny (00:59:28):\n[inaudible 00:59:28] point.\n\nChristina Wodtke (00:59:28):\nBecause they're smart, they're capable, and if anybody's going to figure out how to make it work, they will. If you try to fix a bad team with OKRs, you'll make everybody hate OKRs and make the bad team worse. So, just don't do that. It's not a medicine, but that high preferring team, they're going to be the ones who go, \"Oh, well, okay, our stand-up's like this, so we should add this to standup. And then instead of emails, let's just have a brag channel on our...\" I've seen people do the coolest stuff with OKRs, totally changing what I recommend, doing wonderful things with it, just because they're smart and they messed with it till it worked.\n\nLenny (01:00:03):\nAwesome. Final question in topic. You teach product management at Stanford. What's maybe a surprising or contrarian opinion about how to learn to do product management, how to get into product management, how to do product management, from your experience teaching young PMs?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:00:22):\nI taught it and a bunch of students who thought they were going to be product managers realized that they wanted to be interaction designers and not product managers at all. I think one of the things that might be off with a lot of the product management education and conferences is, it's good that they take a lot from UX and it is important to be people-centered, but the reality is the product manager serves the business. That's their role. Teresa Torres talks about the product trio, right? Trio.\n\nLenny (01:00:52):\nTrio.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:00:53):\nTrio. She's talking about business and user experience and technology. So, if product's over here messing with the user experience or products over there, messing with engineering, who's taking care of the business? And I think it's absolutely critical product managers, they say they're the mini CEO, but that just means they want to be in charge and nobody's in charge. It's all about working together as a team. So, they need to understand business models, they need to understand how to do a target market, and what is a target market, why is that target market the right one to go after, and how is it going to grow, and what are the trends that are going on that's going to change the business? \n\n(01:01:29):\nProduct managers need to serve the business and it's not a bad thing. If you have a company, it needs to survive and all money is, is oxygen, it lets the company keep going, unless people are being greedy assholes, which definitely happens. But it's okay to care about the health and well-being of the company's ability to make money and feed itself. And don't do anything unethical, but really focus on these questions. And if you don't know business models, if you can't talk about why you might want to do a subscription or if you want to just do one-off sales, if you don't understand why you know have all these in-app purchases in your mobile devices, go learn it. I'm really shocked at how many product managers are just smart people who care about users and just showed up and said, \"Yes, I will be a product manager.\" So, no, business is a real thing. It has a long history of knowledge and understanding, and go do that.\n\nLenny (01:02:30):\nWhat I'm hearing is, maybe product sense is overrated in your experience.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:02:34):\nAin't none of them yet old enough to have product sense. I mean, seriously. Product sense is intuition, intuition is compressed experience, compressed experience comes from having lots of experience. And if you're young and you don't have a lot of experience, the smartest thing you could do is learn. You've got to learn what models work and why they work, and just intuition is overvalued and under-exists.\n\nLenny (01:03:01):\nImagine that's kind of freeing to a lot of people listening, where they're like, \"Man, I just don't know if I have product sense. How do I learn product?\" All this. Yeah, don't worry about it is what you're saying. Any other advice for just people thinking about getting into product or trying to get into product other... Many can't get to Stanford and learn product from someone like you. What else would you suggest they do to try to help them get into a product management role? What other activities or areas they should spend time, in your experience?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:03:30):\nI think I agree with my friend Ken Norton on this, in that you shouldn't probably start in product. Go be an engineer or be a designer, work, get to know businesses. And I got into product from, well, I was a developer and then I was a designer, and both of those gave me a lot of knowledge. But when I moved into product, it came out of my startup where I had to learn business, and I absolutely had to learn business or else I wasn't surviving. So, I would say work for a company that's small enough that you can poke into the corners and learn from other people, and learn and then do stuff. \n\n(01:04:11):\nI don't know, it's funny because I'm at Stanford, which is all fancy with a degree and stuff and I'm like, \"No, no, no, just read up, go hang out with people, get a job, figure it out.\" Because that's very much how I did it. And I think that if people want to get into product, I'd ask, \"Why? Why do you want to be in product? Do you want to be in charge?\" I learned that nobody's in charge. No matter what you do, you have to use your influence, you have to use your people skills. \n\n(01:04:34):\nAre you willing to work on your interpersonal dynamics? Because if you can't fire someone, if you can't tell somebody their behavior is interfering with the ability to get things done, don't be a product manager. If you can't solve the fight between two of your coworkers, don't be a product manager. If you can't go out and talk to somebody in a Starbucks line and say, \"Hey, we're working on this new thing, what do you think?\" Don't be a product manager. You got to have hustle. You got to talk to people. You got to always have your eye on the bottom line.\n\n(01:05:00):\nMaybe you don't want to be a product manager. Maybe it's much more fun to leave work every day at 6:00 and be a designer and think about how all the systems work and how and where the error message is going to come in, and is blue the right color, all the combinations of that, that's fun. Or you really want to be an engineer and solve puzzles all day. Product manager is probably the worst job unless you love talking to everybody and connecting them and stepping into the mess.\n\nLenny (01:05:24):\nI definitely agree. There's not enough talk about how painful and hard the PM role is and how thankless it often is.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:05:29):\nAnd I love it, but I love everything. I fell in love with the web and I haven't stopped, even though it's now mostly on phones and stuff. It's an exciting space. But yeah, you got to step up and do the hard stuff.\n\nLenny (01:05:42):\nThat is an awesome way to end it. And with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round where I just have six quick questions. I don't know if you know they are, so let's just go through them and see how it goes. Are you ready?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:05:53):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (01:05:54):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:05:59):\nThe Fearless Organization. I think that book on psychological safety is the bomb. It's so, so, so good. For fiction, I loved The Overstory. It's about trees, and it's mind-blowing and so good. I'm going to leave it at that. Less is better.\n\nLenny (01:06:17):\nI tried reading The Overstory and it's very long, but beautiful.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:06:20):\nIt's a lot like Cloud Atlas. If you liked Cloud Atlas, you'll like The Overstory.\n\nLenny (01:06:24):\nI think I watched that movie.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:06:25):\nNo, a terrible movie. Only read the book.\n\nLenny (01:06:28):\nI agree. Speaking of movies, what's a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:06:33):\nWe just saw Wakanda Forever and it's a very different movie than Black Panther, and my kid and I spent quite a bit of time talking about it and what it meant and it was a lot deeper than I expected. And I'm very passionate about the Mayan people because I live in Belize part of the year, and I don't know, the Mayans are just the OGs of everything, invented zero, writing. They're just so amazing.\n\nLenny (01:06:56):\nLove it. Next question, favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:07:01):\nWhat questions should I have asked you? I've been using that one forever, whether I am interviewing somebody or being interviewed, because the person is an expert in themselves. And if you say, \"What question should I have asked you?\" A lot of times they'll be like, \"Oof.\" They'll be knocked off-base and then they'll give you a really honest answer.\n\nLenny (01:07:20):\nWhat are five SaaS products or tools that you just love and use constantly?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:07:24):\nOh, I hate all technology. That's what the problem is, if you've been a product manager and a designer, all you can see is the flaws. But I would say I like Zoom better than you might think. It's terrible, but it's better than everything else. Slack, when I saw it, I was like, \"This is not going to get rid of email. This is just going to be another channel of nonsense.\" And that showed up. But I do use it. God knows, I use it. \n\n(01:07:48):\nThe Google Suites, I got to say the Google Suite is pretty amazing. Most people think that the students who go to Stanford are all rich, but 70% of them have huge amounts of financial aid. And so, I'm always looking for things that are free and won't cost too much for these students. So many of them are first generation, the first student who's gone in their family here. So, having the Google Suite and being able to have free slides, free docs, everything interconnected, Drive is sort of a gift. So, I've got to say I love those.\n\nLenny (01:08:20):\nCool. I didn't expect the question to go in that direction, but I love it. Two more questions. What's something relatively minor that you've seen a company you've worked with change in their product development process that's had a tremendous impact on their ability to execute and ship crates?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:08:35):\nI will never forget when people stopped sitting with their disciplines and started sitting with their teams. I think that we in tech want everything to be tech and be remote and everything, blah, blah, blah. And there are definitely jobs that are wonderful remote, but if you're trying to innovate, there's nothing like getting the product trio to sit together, and preferably with walls. Walls are really underrated. If you can just give them a war room where they can put stuff on the wall, or I hate to say it, cubicles, I'd rather see offices, but if you can give people walls, it becomes part of your memory. And then you're not using your short-term memory to remember stuff. You're using it to think, and so the war room becomes a living memory so you can make connections. I mean, it's one of the hardest things I have to teach my students too, is that some things are just better done analog and that's okay.\n\nLenny (01:09:27):\nReminds me of a story I just heard from a friend where there was a team sitting next to a data science team and they were one table apart. They're right next to each other. And the data team just had a lot of concerns with what that team was building. They didn't believe in what they're doing and they're just like, \"Why are we wasting these resources on this thing?\" And the head of data science put one of the data people on the team and had them sit just one table over with the team and everything changed. They're just like, \"Okay, let's do this. This is great. We're going to build some awesome products.\" \n\nChristina Wodtke (01:09:55):\nWe're human.\n\nLenny (01:09:56):\nJust that one move.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:09:58):\nWe are human. We are social. Yeah, and I think moving people around every year or so, everybody hates it. Nobody wants to change desks, but do it to them anyway. It always makes things better.\n\nLenny (01:10:07):\nFinal question. What's a company that you think has a really strong and effective product culture? If you can name one, if not, that's okay too. \n\nChristina Wodtke (01:10:14):\nWell, I think of all my clients, the best cultures all seem to be very small companies working in strange little corners of the world. They're not the big, sexy guys. Everybody's there because they want to make dog food or they want to make this kind of financial software, and they're amazing. I think we treat scale like it's a virtue when it's merely a tactic, and it might be a bad tactic as well. So yeah, I think there's something really sweet around 250 people working on something that everybody agrees is important.\n\nLenny (01:10:49):\nChristina, I honor you as emperor for life of OKRs. \n\nChristina Wodtke (01:10:54):\nWoo.\n\nLenny (01:10:54):\nYou've achieved it. I'm very proud of you. I think we've made a big dent in how people perceive OKRs and will utilize OKRs. \n\nChristina Wodtke (01:10:54):\nI hope so.\n\nLenny (01:11:03):\nThank you so much for being here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:11:10):\nIf they want to learn more, I've been blogging at eleganthack.com, like a hack writer since 2000. It's where I've dumped my thoughts for a long time, so it's always a good place if you want to go spelunking about anything. If you want to attempt to hire me, cwodtke.com is not a bad place to go. I say attempt because I teach, and so I don't have a lot of time. But you know what users could do? Users could slow down. I just wish everybody would take a deep breath and think about, \"Okay, we're going to adopt this thing. Let's read up on it. Let's think about it. Oh, we're going to build this new product? Let's do a literature review, let's do a competitive analysis. Let's see what's been done. Let's learn from the past.\"\n\n(01:11:55):\nI think if you could slow down, you'll end up going a lot faster. So, I would encourage people, if you're in a panic and you're in a tizzy, and I know the economics bad and the world's on fire, but just take some deep breaths before you do anything and just ask yourself, \"What's a good way to do it? What's a good way for me to move forward?\" I think I would like to encourage that.\n\nLenny (01:12:16):\nA beautiful way to end it, but I also want to make sure you plug your books. Just say the titles of your books and where people can find them, and then we'll [inaudible 01:12:24].\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:12:23):\nRadical Focus. Get the second edition. The Team That Managed Itself. And Pencil Me In. Those are my three books that are out there right now. You can get them pretty much anywhere I do believe, but definitely, I mean Amazon. Amazon rules us all, so they're definitely there.\n\nLenny (01:12:40):\nAmazing. Christina, again, thank you for being here. We'll all go slow down right now.\n\nChristina Wodtke (01:12:44):\nThank you so much for having me here, Lenny, and sharing your audience with me. It's been an honor.\n\nLenny (01:12:47):\nBye everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse, and I was just like, \"Oh, my gosh.

I'm so happy to be here, Lenny.\nLenny (00:02:39):\nFirst of all, I just wanted to give a big thank you to Ben Williams who is a previous guest on this podcast who suggested you join this podcast and who connected us. We were chatting earlier and you said you have a story about Ben. So, what is that? \nChristine Itwaru (00:02:51):\nI do. Absolute thanks to Ben for connecting us. So, when he made the intro, I was super excited, one because it's you, and two, because I love hearing from Ben. I was like, \"Oh, great, he's doing all these wonderful things and whatnot.\" I just remember in that moment, my first conversation with Ben, which was really early in the days of starting product operations at Pendo and we were going through all these just really crazy things that he was going through and his team was a customer of Pendo at the time. He's sitting there just staring and I was like, \"Oh, you're okay?\" He was like, \"Yeah, I'm fine. I thought that I was just throwing them off at every return.\" \n(00:03:28):\nHe said to me, \"I bet you I'm not the only person who has these questions and I bet you I'm not the only person that's thinking about all these problems that probably seem very normal and natural.\" I don't know. All of us are going through this. This is why I'm building product ops here. But what he said and he was just like, \"I really think there are a lot more people that you need to talk to about this stuff.\" It's just full circle. I think he connected us and he was one of the reasons I started to say... One of the best things that my first boss product always told me was, \"You have to find a way to give back.\" When he said that to me, I was like, \"I wonder if this is one of the ways that I can start to give back to the product community.\"\nLenny (00:04:08):\nAwesome. Well, here we are, and obviously, we're going to be talking about product ops. You've been in the product ops role for seemingly feels like as long as the role has existed. I'd love to know when you think the role actually and we're going to talk about just when this spurred happened in product ops. I hate this term, but it feels like you're a thought leader in the product ops space. I've never actually worked with anyone in product ops. I've never had a product ops team, so I have a ton of questions. I imagine many people listening also have and are also just curious about this emerging role. \n(00:04:38):\nSo, what I'm hoping we do with our chat is to help people understand, \"Do they need a product ops team? Would that be beneficial to their company? Whether people should be consider moving into product ops, whether they're in PM or something else right now, and then just generally helping people understand this emerging role of product ops.\" Does that sound good? \nChristine Itwaru (00:04:56):\nYes, thank you, number one. That was really kind. Two, yeah, I'm happy to dive in. Yeah. \nLenny (00:05:01):\nOkay, sweet. So, I think we have to start with the basics. What's just the simplest way to understand the role of product ops, especially in relation to product management? \nChristine Itwaru (00:05:11):\nI've had many ways of describing this in the past and it generally centered around the ladder of what I'm going to tell you or the second part of this, but I'm breaking it down now into two simple things. One is it is a thing you do. Product operations for a VP or a head of product or a product manager is the creation of some system that allows you to thrive or allows your team to thrive in product management. The second is what we've seen more of over the last couple years, and it's the more common definition. \n(00:05:44):\nThe emergence of the role itself is why it's so common. It's a person or the people, the group of individuals who are strong partners to the product manager and then for more mature product ops teams end up people being more strategic advisors to the head of products. So, your CPO or your VP again. When it comes to data, qualitative, quantitative, anything that they feel can help the CPO or the head of product make more strategic decisions and well-informed decisions. \nLenny (00:06:11):\nGot it. It feels like there's been this big inflection and emergence of the role in the past couple years, past few years. I'm curious what you think triggered that and if that's true, if it feels like it's just emerged in the last couple years and then just like why do you think that has happened? \nChristine Itwaru (00:06:28):\nThis is interesting, because as a former product manager and product leader, I don't think that things are new. Absolutely. When I go back to the story about Ben, I'm like, \"No, none of this stuff feels really interesting and it's just stuff that we had to deal with in product.\" So, the problems have always been there. I think maybe that is because I have a product background. So, I felt that pain very acutely, but I will say for the majority of people I always speak to who don't have that product background, they're coming from consulting or from technical success or from some other group marketing maybe, it does feel relatively new because they're starting to dive into that space a little bit. \n(00:07:06):\nBut I will say that for me in particular at Pendo, it was the summer of 2019 that this really picked up and I remember a colleague of mine, shout out to Shannon. He's no longer with us, but he is one of the original people on the Pendo product team. He said, \"I think this is the summer of the birth of product ops.\" I just started laughing and he was like, \"I'm telling you, it's everywhere.\" All of a sudden, everybody's just like, \"We need something. We need to make product better.\" I thought that was awesome because we had already started talking about it. \n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]So, it took me a bit to understand what was going on across tech that was making this thing so big. I'm very grateful because we have so many great customers that reach out and say, \"Help us understand how you're doing this.\" I'm like, \"Well, help me understand what's going on.\" So, for me, it went beyond the problems that we would solve as a product team with the Pendo product. It went into, \"How can we help you as an organization solve pain that you're feeling within your product team that trickles out to the business?\" \nLenny (00:08:07):\nThat's interesting. That was the summer of product ops. What happened there? Why was there a summer of product ops? Why was everyone starting to get excited and creating product ops teams? \nChristine Itwaru (00:08:17):\nYeah, I'll dive in. The customers started to come up and we started to feel it a bit more and I felt like there was this huge need for a voice of customer management and synthesis of both this qualitative and quantitative data as a theme that I saw arising across our customer base or even just folks that were reaching out about this role as they saw Pendo was putting it down. There was a lot of pain around internal alignment in general, transparency to stakeholders up across your revenue team members. Then for a lot of people during this time, growth was a massive propeller of the need for product ops. I remember just sitting here in this office and getting these random... \n(00:08:58):\nEvery industry almost was like, \"Yeah, I'm thinking about doing this and I really need to do this, the pandemic, blah, blah, blah.\" Because it was growth during the pandemic, especially within industries such as home furnishings and making their living space a whole lot better. All of a sudden, we started to see that rise, but we were all experiencing this massive amount of growth across some of these startups and really rapidly growing companies. We're also moving more towards these product-led tactics, product-led growth. All of these things I feel like made this perfect storm for product operations to come in and start calming things down. \n(00:09:34):\nI personally believe there's this natural evolution that happens at any mature function when it starts to grow in an industry and across an organization. So, think about marketing or sales. This just started to happen with product managers. For me, I was sitting there going, \"Well, you can appoint a PM to liaise with other ops teams and the business, but at what risk?\" Their product portfolio, the growth and adoption of their product, all these goals that they have to hit today in order to build a better tomorrow for their customers. So, I feel like that was the moment to say, \"Okay, how do we give them the structure that they needed to thrive?\" Because the CPO is in charge of so much more than product people have historically been in charge of, right? \n(00:10:17):\nI'll probably talk about Marty Cagan several times here. I really do admire and respect him, and I think one of the things that he always talks about is future teams versus high performing teams and focusing on outcomes. CPOs went from deliver, deliver, deliver to really increased business metrics or just help drive the bottom line versus just really look at the product. You really have to figure out what that means for the product team at large. \nLenny (00:10:45):\nGot it. So, the way to think about this role, because I imagine most people haven't ever had a product ops person in their company is there's a slice of the PM role that companies are finding is valuable to put on a different person that has different skillsets that can take this endless load that PMs have. PMs have so many things to do and their job is so full of responsibilities that there's a sliver of stuff that a product ops person can take off. I'd be curious too and feel free to comment on that, but I'm also curious, you mentioned a few specific things that the product ops folks do. \n(00:11:19):\nIt'd be cool to just go through a bullet list of just those sorts of things, like you said, responsible for voice of the customer, pieces, alignment across stakeholders, whatever. If you could just go through some of those, that makes it really concrete I think for people to understand wow, this person that could have someone do all these for me, that'd be amazing. \nChristine Itwaru (00:11:37):\nIn some ways, I've got this question a lot from product managers who are concerned about the rise of this role or product leaders who are concerned that it was going to create some controversy or friction between product ops people and product managers. The way I've coached people to get around that is really, \"What are your people responsible for? What are you holding them accountable to? Are you holding the product manager accountable to elevating these strategic insights so that they are going to elevate it to everyone else and then everyone else is going to go out there and build thing and drive the value or are you holding them accountable to truly understanding the customer in whatever way possible?\" \n(00:12:15):\nEspecially going on and talking to the customer, please don't let anybody ever take that for granted. Really spending time with their engineers and the customers in order to drive a better experience. So, if they've got to spend all this time, which is our most valuable asset with those two entities, everything else still has to give. So, I think that yes, there was a point of friction, but I feel like now it's been a nice change where I'm seeing people in products saying, \"No, I want to do product ops now,\" who was a former product manager. The second part of that, you said, let's go through the list of tactical things. Yes, voice of customer management is definitely one of the things that we're seeing more... \n(00:12:54):\nI don't want to say mature because then I feel like I'm seeing mature of your peak, but the ones who have matured a bit, I feel like they are focusing more on the voice of customer elements. So, quantitative analysis, qualitative, bringing all of these different inputs that would traditionally be handled by product manager through looking across the aisle at their PM or looking at different data sources to the surface when they're going through their product development lifecycle planning, and really figuring out too what that balance is. I think there's an art. You can do voice of customer in two ways. \n(00:13:27):\nYou can do it one in this process way where you're feeding it to a really mature longstanding product team who has switchboard product or you have this voice of customer thing that you have to do for teams that are actually building something new. They're really trying to move fast, so how do you really get them what they need in order to experiment and iterate on the next thing that they're doing? That's one aspect. Another one is tooling. We see this more for folks who don't yet have tools under control in their product org. I'm not saying everybody has this, right? We had someone at one point handle whatever tools connected to Pendo and make sure that those systems are set up for maximum outcomes for the product manager. \n(00:14:10):\nSo, Pendo's connected to Salesforce. We're connected to Looker. We're connected to all these different. So, what does the product manager need to achieve out of all those things that ultimately drives our experience for Pendo ourselves? We get very meta here. That person was responsible for that. That's all also a part of the data component. The other things that we're seeing are more of along the lines of content strategy and being really intentional about making content and education a part of the product process and the delivery process. So, taking a look at how they maximize the outcomes from the outcome that the product manager is driving so that they can help increase retention, growth, and all of that good stuff for the product. \n(00:14:57):\nSo, those are some of the things that we're seeing. Then there's also this component that happens or this piece of it that happens in the beginning when you're standing a product ops for a product team that does not have much process in and that's the process piece. That's the bit that's a bit controversial, because folks are like, \"Is this just program management? Is this just a different flavor of agile?\" \n(00:15:20):\nSo, what we're seeing is this, what are these folks doing? Are they managing and facilitating the product development lifecycle? Are they doing things with the rest of the organization? So I feel like this one's a little bit up in the air. Some are actually agile facilitators as well, but I am seeing emergence of some companies that have the program management team under the product's umbrella to help with this massive amount of things that they have to manage across the board. \nLenny (00:15:49):\nOh, that's a really interesting point on the last piece. I want to dig in on that a little bit just to summarize what you shared. So, some of the key roles of a product ops person, there's this voice of customer element and just to understand what you mean by that. The team is aggregating feedback from customers and feedback from the customer support and sales and things like that and sharing it with the product manager to give them clear conclusions and takeaways so that the PM doesn't have to sit there and filter their data. Is that a way to think about it? \nChristine Itwaru (00:16:19):\nThat's one part of it. We actually developed this really cool way of doing it here at Pendo, which is the transparency is a word that we love here. What we found that there was just not this need for the revenue org to be transparent and say, \"Hey, this is what we're hearing. Product people, please listen,\" or vice versa. Here's what we're doing for your customer. There was this interesting moment where we realized that our sales team was screaming for something and our success team was screaming for something else, but [inaudible 00:16:46] looking at something else. So, they're all wonderful relevant things that our customers wanted, but we were like, \"What if they're aware that they've got all these amazing things and they're talking about it separately?\" \n(00:16:59):\nOur PMs, they would get the whole readout with us, but we brought those folks in a room together. It was really cool because I think our head of professional services team at one point was like, \"Whoa, this could truly impact what we do from an onboarding perspective and now we have this data. Then how do we then strengthen this area and the product?\" So, it wasn't just about the components. So, I don't know if other companies are doing it like that, but I was very proud of the way we ended up doing that here. But the PM got risk data, high-priority deals, feedback from our feedback product. What are we hearing from prospects versus paying customers. What segments are saying what? \n(00:17:35):\nAll that stuff got fed over to the PM and then validated through our research team or disputed through our research team, which was really cool. This is a really good partnership with our research team. But on the other side, what was really nice too was we were able to educate our revenue team on behalf of the product team and say, \"Guys, not everything requires a product change.\" So if you're saying there's customers that have friction around this one area of this product, maybe it's enabling. Maybe it's something that we need to help you guys understand a little bit better so that you can make their experience better or maybe we need to help update. It's just very simple things like that that just ended up coming up this voice of customer process. \nLenny (00:18:15):\nSo essentially, it's just finding ways to make the PM more focused and allow them to focus on the things they want to focus on and reduce workload. On the user research piece, so it feels like there's user research coming in. PMs are involved, user research. There's a research team. Where does the product ops team fit in there or is it focused on internal alignment, stakeholder feedback more versus external customer feedback? \nChristine Itwaru (00:18:41):\nYeah. Again, I'll say these probably several times. Every company's doing it in their own little bit of flavor. I'll tell you that here and from a couple companies that I'm seeing outside of Pendo, our user research team sits with our UX team. They report into our head of UX and they are responsible for proactive research and making sure that we are aligning to our strategy and saying, \"Okay, here's what our folks are saying. Here's why we're going after this market or this new thing that we're doing. Let's start going out there and validating or checking with some of these key personas and what we need to do.\" Then they are also a part of the ongoing development process or product development process. \n(00:19:21):\nSo, testing stuff out, making sure that they're doing user interviews, and all that good stuff. So, they sit as a partner to us. We work very closely together. Again, I'll give you that example of voice of customer, which is we have all of this input coming in from our customer success or post-sales teams and we know we're about to invest in our guides area of the product. We have all of these. What do we do with it? Well, we couple that with I'm personal responsible for NPS or I was for a very long time. I'm seeing a lot of noise around guides. \n(00:19:52):\nSo, I take all of that, we pull it all together, and we give it to our head of research and say, \"All right. Let's all make sense of all this together. Is this something that is in line with the direction that the product team is going, the guides team, or is this something that we're going to need to dig a little bit more into to see if their efforts right now where they're growing are not where there should be going?\" \nLenny (00:20:10):\nThe other two bullet points, just to make sure I totally understand, you help with tooling. The product ops teams help, just optimize the tooling to build product. Is that a simple way to think about it, just make sure the product development process is efficient? \nChristine Itwaru (00:20:24):\nYeah, we partner with the program management team and the tools that they use for product development stuff. I would say it's more, \"What are the things that the product manager needs in order to be successful?\" So, we look at Pendo, right? We do use our own product like I mentioned quite a lot. Salesforce is another thing, so how does that all plug into our own product and what data are we looking to get out of there? So, our PMs have a complete picture in Pendo. Tray is another one I mentioned. Zapier was another one that we had used. So, it's more about the PM's tool stack versus the PM's planning tool stack if you want to draw that distinction. \nLenny (00:20:59):\nGot it. Okay. That is helpful. Then content strategy, by that, you mean internal documentation to train sales and customer support or is there also help the product team build out product marketing content and things like that? \nChristine Itwaru (00:21:13):\nNeither or a bit. I guess what we have done is fed into both of those technical documentation. We use Zendesk as another tool, so we use Zendesk as another part of our tool stack to support our customers. So, a brand new feature comes out. Natural thing to do, let's write up this thing in Zendesk, but it's also about how we weave education into the product and we use Pendo again. Sorry, that's all right. It's actually really good tool. So, we do use Pendo guides and we just release our NPS themes. So, a pain in my team's butt has been manual labor around NPS themes and qualitative data. So, we designed this experience for customers who are in this beta. So, that they can in the product understand what it is. \n(00:21:59):\nThen if they really need more, they can go out to the technical documentation, but it's about the education for the customer. I mentioned earlier treating content is a part of the development lifecycle process. You really want to treat it as a part of definition of done. When you think about product-led growth and the emergence of that in particular over the last couple years, it's all about creating that experience and keeps people in and helps them upgrade. So, they work alongside product marketing to develop these playbooks for what they're doing in app to create less friction and drive more engagement. \nLenny (00:22:36):\nGot it. Okay, that makes a lot more sense. Would it be safe to say that product ops is essentially for B2B companies where there's all these internal stakeholders, sales, customer support, marketing, things like that and that's the work that you can take off the product manager's plate? \nChristine Itwaru (00:22:53):\nMy personal experience and I think a lot of people would agree with me has led me to believe that's not accurate. It's emerged a lot more in B2B or I think we've seen it a lot more in B2B or at least people talking about it. I'm curious as to why and I wonder if it's because we're sharing because we're all trying to go through this thing together serving each other and then the other is serving the customer. So, it's not like, \"Hey, you helped me figure this thing out.\" I understand I was so lucky and I still am so lucky to work with so many people in my network, in our customer base to help them understand the role or determine whether they even needed this thing or not. \n(00:23:28):\nWithout calling out names, there were some really big companies in retail and finance and some industries that you would not expect who are B2C, larger, well established companies who we all know and love and maybe not even love. Maybe the experience is bad for us. So, they also do have a lot more cross-functional engagement internally than we would even think of. So, I don't know if it's because we're used to this world and we haven't thought about that side of it, but it's really interesting. I think the common thread is the cross-functional transparency and then transparency out to the customer. \n(00:24:04):\nSo, I mentioned transparency is a big word for us, but readiness is another one and so readiness means a lot. You have your teams you need to get ready internally, but you really need to get customers ready for something new as well and everybody needs to feel aligned. So, it plays a massive part in what the product manager and the product team needs to consider, advocate for, deliver, and communicate about, I feel like no matter the size or industry. \nLenny (00:24:28):\nI imagine a lot of PMs listening to this have this two minded view right now of on the one hand, somebody could take all his work off my plate. That's awesome. On the other, it's like, \"Oh, okay, there's another stakeholder that have loop into every meeting and they're going to be doing this work that's cool and important that I'm not going to get to do anymore.\" That's weird. What have you found is the best way to convince a PM to this is like, \"Wow, this would make your life so much better\"?\nChristine Itwaru (00:24:54):\nYeah, I go back to that question that I have asked leaders when helping them stand this up, which is what are you looking at your PMs to drive and how are you measuring their success? That generally just helps everybody get on the same page really quickly. I've had customers or I've had folks come to me in the product community that say, \"I've tried this and it's just not going anywhere.\" There's resistance to the role because they feel like it's stepping on too many toes and whatnot. Generally, I will tell you it's because they still have a bit of buying in the top to get done. \n(00:25:32):\nI'm seeing that the most successful ones that are drawing the lines and showing that this role is valuable are the people that have their buy-in from their CEO or CPO at that level or their head of product and saying, \"Hey, this is what this role means for you.\" So, I don't want to say it needs to be directive. I do want to say that you need to be able to articulate the value to somebody who's heading up essentially businesses and saying, \"Here's what this role is going to drive for you at the end of the day.\" The very mature product ops end up having people that are strategic advisors too, a product leader. So, once you can show that this is what you'll also get as a result of me and this other person or me and this team doing this, it ends up being an easier conversation. \nLenny (00:26:17):\nWhat are a couple bullet points that are most effective to convince a product leader product op is going to make a big impact and benefit you and then just an ICPM who's like, \"I don't want this person on my team\"? What actually works there to get buy-in? \nChristine Itwaru (00:26:31):\nYeah. Number one, do you want your PMs to constantly be fielding questions from your revenue team when they could be spending time with customers? Yeah, you're shaking your head. That one seems to be the one. \nLenny (00:26:43):\nYeah. Yeah, that's a good one. \nChristine Itwaru (00:26:44):\nYeah, I can count on one hand the companies who have blocked their product managers from speaking to customers and those companies are not product companies. I mean they do not believe in product management. They might say they do, but they don't. So, that's number one. Number two is how are you measuring your outcomes and where are you making this all transparent? Is this happening consistently across the board? So, one probably seeing product teams across so many different places is you might have somebody who's really passionate and really good at doing this stuff for their own vertical and then it doesn't scale. \n(00:27:20):\nSo, how are you doing this at scale so that your stakeholders are building this trust in you and making sure that they get the best out of the product team at any given turn? I say those are the two bullet points that seem to stick the most is that quality time, giving the PM what they need, which is their time to be able to drive the outcomes for the customer. \nLenny (00:27:41):\nWhat is it that you think a PM will never offload, if that makes sense? In your perspective, what's like the core of a PM's role versus maybe product ops for now and then maybe potentially other roles that take off some of the stuff on their plate? \nChristine Itwaru (00:27:57):\nSpeaking as a former PM, I would not ever give up spending time with customers and watching their pain. That sounds really bad to customers. I'm sorry. That's how I fell in love with product was I saw my internal customer 10, 12 years back now fighting with the keyboard, fighting with the mouse. I was just like, \"Oh, my gosh. What's this guy doing?\" \n(00:28:23):\nI think it was an experience that some people might say, \"Oh, I never want to be in that situation again because it made me feel very uncomfortable that my product is not doing for this person what it needs to,\" but for me, it was, \"How do I make this thing do what it needs to for this gentleman? How do I make this thing better?\" I cannot see product managers saying, \"I don't want to be a part of that conversation.\" Then you know what? I'm going to say it then don't be in product. \nLenny (00:28:50):\nLove it. Yeah. I'm so curious what parts of the role get sliced off over time because I love that. That's the core of it is just build great products that your customers want and use and want to pay for. Then what else can people help you with along the side? Because yeah, PM role is just crazy. There's so many things going on.\nChristine Itwaru (00:29:06):\nIt's crazy how this article that I wrote, I dug into the history of product management and it's like 100 years old not in its current form, but it's about 100 years old and just the evolution of what product managers have historically been responsible for. Then if you think about just really sit down and think about what the world has turned into today and how much noise we have coming at us. We talked about put yourself onto not disturb mode and I learned a long time ago, put myself onto disturb mode. So, imagine having a partner that helps you filter that noise. \nLenny (00:29:44):\nYeah, quite useful. Along those lines, I was going to go in a different direction, but as you mentioned that, there's all these roles adjacent to PM. There's program managers, project managers, agile product owners, and all and then now product ops. I guess before team has product ops, let me just ask this one straightforward question. Which of those roles generally does the thing that product ops can do for you? Is it the PM or is it one of these other roles? \nChristine Itwaru (00:30:11):\nIt's a PM. It's PM. Yeah, it's a PM and then I would say, because what I'm seeing in less mature product orgs who first bring in product ops, the first thing they ask them to do is streamline the planning process. So, I would say it's a PM and maybe the agile. That's probably what it is today. I feel like program management and agile are starting to get a little bit close to each other in what they do. So, it's most of the PM stuff because we're doing elements of their job that they have off to the side versus being able to focus on. But again, in lesser mature orgs, the first thing is, \"How do I actually just get the people to plan the same way and give me the thing that they're planning and doing?\" \nLenny (00:30:56):\nThat's interesting, what you said there, that maybe often a wedge to a product ops person joining their company maybe as a first product ops person is the planning, helping with the planning process. Is that what you find? \nChristine Itwaru (00:31:07):\nIt could be. The only thing that distinguishes product operations folks from program managers and agile is that product operations people know, understand the product, the customer, and the inner workings of the business. \nLenny (00:31:20):\nCool. Yeah, Marty Cagan has some hot takes there about how product owners are never going to be great product managers. They don't really understand the customer needs and building product in any way. That's a whole other topic. I want to talk about the career path, but before we get there, I want to go in a spicy direction. So, Casey Winners, he is a guest on this podcast at one point. He wrote this hot take many years ago about this premise that operations in general often is a Band-Aid for inefficiency at a company. \n(00:31:54):\nCompanies often hire a bunch of ops people to just solve a problem and often they're much better ways to solve that problem. For example, tooling or a new process. His take is a person doing the thing often should be the last resort or it's a temporary gap and then over time you should strive to find a more efficient way to solve that problem than people. I don't think he's saying ops people in general or not necessary. It's an easy default. So, I'm curious what you think of that take. Generally, do you think product ops is this long term we're going to need more and more of this or is there a different path that's solving the problem that product ops? Spicy take warning.\nChristine Itwaru (00:32:41):\nYes, I remember this. I'll address that inefficiency comment first, right? I mentioned a little bit earlier as roles in any industry or I guess any role matures like marketing or sales, this ops thing ends up being this natural progression. It's not just because the role itself is maturing. It's also because the org is maturing. So, what I found and what I'm finding with customers is that ops alignment across companies is what often ends up keeping the companies moving and keeping everybody aligned. So, to say ops teams are generally a sign of inefficiency or the need for them is a sign of inefficiency is not always accurate, it's generally a sign of growth and opportunity. \n(00:33:21):\nPeople are really just trying to stay in aligned and do the best for the people that are doing the thing, the product managing, the marketing, the selling within that org. Overall though, I will say I will agree with his points about getting in and maybe giving it off and using humans for other things. I wrote something recently and I highlighted something that he mentions here in this article and what he mentioned on your podcast, which is we as product ops want to and should be standing up whatever processes or systems are needed and then get out of the way so we can focus on driving more strategic value. \n(00:33:58):\nI keep mentioning that more mature product ops folks end up being a very good strategic advisor to leaders in product and to the product teams and that continues to be my belief. From day one, this has been my own personal goal for myself and for my team. I myself recently switched roles here at Pendo because I did what I said I was going to do, which was stand up the system, stand up the things that we knew we needed to do that were going to either be given off to another team or automated and then get the rest of the humans that are here to do the other strategic things for the product team.\n(00:34:34):\nSome of those are, \"How do we increase retention? Like I mentioned, how do we focus on growth in this one area? How do we make the experience better in app? How do we do a better voice of customer management?\" My energy now at Pendo is I'm able to now go towards more impactful things for not just the product team and the product community, but for our customers at large. So, I'm basically saying, \"Look, I did what I needed to do and I'm ready to go.\" \n(00:34:56):\nSo I think that's something though that people need to be very, very comfortable with, very comfortable with. If you change course and change your tune two, three years into doing this and you built this team, you're like, \"Here's what you're doing, manage this process,\" people are going to lose their mind. Change is constant, but telling someone, \"I no longer need you to do that,\" it makes them a little bit nervous. So, for years when I was interviewing folks from my team, I made that one point abundantly clear to them, get into this role if you're comfortable letting go of things and moving on to something that is well worth your time. The company's going to change. \n(00:35:36):\nOur process is going to need to be tweaked. The company is going to change. Something's going to need to be automated. We're going to need to cut something else. Maybe ChatGPT is going to make things very clear that humans are not always going to be doing the same things and we need to focus our energy elsewhere, but people do need to get comfortable with that role. \nLenny (00:35:54):\nI love that take. Generally, I think it aligns with what Casey's saying. What I'm hearing is you may be a product person today doing a bunch of stuff. Your job in a sense should be to automate as much of that as you can and find more strategic higher level things you could be doing instead of sitting there connecting Salesforce to Zendesk and maintaining that. It'd be great in customer feedback in theory. That could be a tool that could do that for you. That's part of the job. Is that roughly what you're saying? \nChristine Itwaru (00:35:54):\nThat's exactly what I'm saying. \nLenny (00:36:24):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. \n(00:37:03):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time-consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast-growing, companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n(00:37:40):\nZooming out a little bit and building on the stuff we've been just talking about, what would you say are just signs that your company would benefit from a product ops team and that you're a fit for building a product ops team? \nChristine Itwaru (00:37:51):\nI touched on this quite a bit, but that lack of transparency in many directions across, down. Sometimes people are on very transparent about, \"Hey, this came up in planning and here's what we need to do.\" So it's relevant for stakeholder management, getting stuck out to customers, internal teams, and making sure they're aligned, revenue teams in particular. \n(00:38:11):\nThat was the first thing we focused on at Pendo was really aligning our success org and our sales org to the product team. We monitored success just within... I think a quarter was the time-bound space that we had it in on quality of inbound to the product team. So, that was really cool. It was just more thematic questions around tell us what you guys do because our customers would benefit from this versus teach me how to do this thing. \nLenny (00:38:36):\nI wanted to dig into the transparency piece. Is that the same point as the transparency piece or are those two different heuristics? \nChristine Itwaru (00:38:42):\nThat's transparency. Yeah, so what happened was we realized that we share this story actually quite openly and I'll share it here again, which is one of the things that kicked off products for us was we had a really bad launch, a really, really bad launch. It was a moment in company history where we realized that there was not transparency across the aisle and there was this lack of readiness across the organization and out to customers for what was coming. It wasn't this piece that folks say, \"Oh, well, they didn't know this was coming.\" Well, there's two things. There's the knowing something's coming and then there's the knowing what to do with it. \n(00:39:18):\nYou can use just some status keeping thing to say, \"This is coming in Q4 and as we get closer, here's the date,\" but it's what to do with it and how to position it and how to talk about it and all the things that was missing from it. It was really bad and it was my fifth week here. It was a moment of, \"Well, I promised myself I'm going to let this happen.\" That was one of the things where I said, \"I'm going to start to focus a little bit more on product ops within this director position I had just as director of product.\" Then I spun off and I think we need to do this thing and make it a bit more formal. \nLenny (00:39:53):\nJust to dig it on a story a little bit, so I didn't know this, so you were a product manager at Pendo. There was this bad launch and you recognize there's this gap that maybe I could fill, that somebody needs to fill and that you want to take that on. Can you talk a bit more about that? It's really interesting. \nChristine Itwaru (00:40:12):\nYeah. They brought me in as their first director level. So, I was doing a bit of director plus a little bit of IC stuff because we were starting to build up our product team. Yes, that launch happened and the product area was under development for about eight months from what I can remember. I came in with the assumption and also knowing fully well that I'm a brand new leader in this product team and product people want ownership. They crave autonomy, they crave trust, and all of that good stuff. I know that firsthand. I did not want to jump in and say, \"Have you done X, Y, and Z?\", especially in the first four weeks of me being there. Yeah, it did not go very well. \n(00:40:54):\nSo, we recognized that we had more opportunity that we should have grabbed onto to test more with customers, to find feedback loops that were going to be healthy for the team and for our customers, to stand up ways for us to measure changes and impact of changes that this thing was making to our customers. This was the biggest launch in our company history since the launch of the product. So, it was a moment where we all sat down very openly and shared with each other what we all could have done better. It wasn't just the product team. \n(00:41:25):\nSo, I truly believe with a really healthy product operations person or team, you have that ability to impact change across the company. So, yes, we look at that story. I remember us sitting there and being, \"One day, we're going to look back at this story and we're going to say, 'Oh, yeah, I remember that.'\" We do now four years later or four and a half years later, but yes, I felt really passionate about making sure that that didn't happen. \nLenny (00:41:48):\nThe gaps you found are there's just like this lack of internal alignment. Sales didn't know what was going on. Customer support didn't know what was going on. That felt like that's where the gap was because that's what led to this product ops opportunity, right? \nChristine Itwaru (00:42:00):\nYes. There was a lack of alignment across again, they knew it was coming, they just didn't know the extent of what to expect and how to prepare customers or prospects or the change the way that we should have. There was definitely training. There was stuff being done. It just could have been a whole lot better. So, there were gaps there. One more point was the piece after that was I love people. I love managing people. I love healthy team environment and dynamics. \n(00:42:32):\nAs a product person, it means a lot to have that, because if you have direct reports, you obviously want them to be happy and healthy, but as a product person, you have this system around you even if you're not having people that report into you where you feel ownership to make sure these people are healthy. I remember even in my early days of being a PM, I wanted my engineers to be super happy. I wanted them to be proud of work that they were doing and I wanted them to be comfortable letting go of things that we no longer needed. \n(00:42:58):\nI remember that moment looking around and looking at our engineers and seeing that they were like, \"Hold on. What? Where do we go now? What do we do right now?\" We wanted to take that moment and make it less about firefighting and more about being responsible and really customer obsessed. So, that was our moment or one of our moments for thinking about, \"Okay, we might need product operations formalized here.\"\nLenny (00:43:24):\nIt's interesting that your mind went to product ops, because I think most companies would be like, \"Oh, the product manager of this product screwed up. They didn't communicate enough to ensure sales. They didn't set up the marketing material well.\" It often falls on the product team and the product manager. What made you realize, \"Oh, this is a product ops role and I need to move into that role versus here we are\"? \nChristine Itwaru (00:43:46):\nYeah, I didn't say in that moment we need a product ops role. All I said in that moment was we need to create a system so that this doesn't happen again. That goes back to my definition of what product ops is. It's a thing and it is also a person or a group of people. It could be one or the other. So, I want to make sure we decouple that. It does not have to be humans. It can be that there's a system being created that is from a strong product person who knows how to get this team to be healthy. \nLenny (00:44:12):\nThat's a really good way of thinking about it. That clarifies it in a big way. Thank you. You were talking about transparency and just like a sign that maybe you need product ops. I think the thing that stuck with me there is just the quality of questions the product team gets from sales, right? \nChristine Itwaru (00:44:27):\nYeah. I get a lot of questions around, \"I'm investing in this. How do I measure the effectiveness of the team, all of these things?\" It's really not easy to measure this in a quantitative measure just yet. Maybe one day, right? Actually, yes. Now one day, I feel like it might be coming sooner than we think. So, what we did was we looked at that transparency problem. We sent out this survey across both product managers and the sales and success teams and we said, \"Where's your time going, PMs? How much time are you giving on average to the revenue team to firefight? How much time do you with customers that's quality time.\"\n[NEW_PARAGRAPH]Then on the flip side to the revenue team, how many times do you find yourself asking questions? We gave all of these one to five and blah, blah, blah, those sorts of things, so that we can figure out where to place our energy. We came up with this, \"Okay, well, it seems like there's a lack of transparency across the two groups. Let's start with getting data out or information out to the revenue team from the product org.\" We created this product digest. It's like today and it's matured quite a bit, but I go back to this whole people can know when they're coming, but they need to know what it is they need to do with it. So, this thing was less about this thing's coming next quarter, go tell your customers. \n(00:45:43):\nIt's more about here's how you get ready for it, here's how you get jazzed about, and then the handoff, which is probably the question you're going to have at some point, which is, \"What's your line between PMM and products?\" The handoff is that we don't teach them to sell. We don't teach them to position, but we know that the product intimately enough to help them understand the new value, to help them understand how to use the thing and to make sure that they're hitting the ground. \nLenny (00:46:08):\nLet's ask that question. If there's anything more, what is that line between product ops and product marketing? \nChristine Itwaru (00:46:13):\nYeah, I always say this and it and it's worked. I haven't seen anybody dispute it yet, but product marketing positions help the revenue team sell their lead gen for all of the outbound and the campaigns that they're running. They are marketing. They're helping you at the end of the day make this thing sound amazing and do the right things with it. For us, it's about educating and it's about helping our internal folks, our internal revenue team understand, \"What is the added value? How do you now do this thing? How does this impact your role?\" \n(00:46:48):\nWe focus a bit on the customer success persona, for example, on Pendo. Customer success managers can go in. They can see their account health and what's going on and blah, blah, blah. How does this impact you as a customer success rep and how do you then help your customers understand the value? Not hey, can you help us upsell this thing and here's how you do it. \nLenny (00:47:06):\nGreat answer. Makes a lot of sense to me. Final topic, the career path of a product ops person. A lot of people listening to this podcast are either PMs today or I want to be PMs or thinking about becoming product manager, because PM can mean a lot of things. It's interesting, there's this new path that people can explore, product ops. I'm curious who you think might be a fit for the product ops role versus the product manager role. Someone deciding, \"Oh, man, maybe I should go down this other route.\" What do you think are just signs that maybe you'd be a better fit where you enjoy that route better? \nChristine Itwaru (00:47:41):\nYeah, I love that question because it makes me feel that this role has become embraced a bit more. What I hear questions like in the past, it was, \"Do we need this role and how do we help get the buy-in?\" Now it's more the acceptance from a product manager to maybe want to even become this. I'm seeing more PMs, like I said, go into the space. So, it's no longer being seen so much as a threat. It's being seen as this partner. So, just one, I'll say that I think if you're someone like me who absolutely loves and I mentioned the story about the engineers and the team health and stuff, if you love creating that healthy team environment and one where there's cross-functional collaboration and it fuels you to empower the team more, it's a wonderful fit for you. \n(00:48:22):\nAgain, I was a PM for years and I felt that pain so much and how much we had to do in order to make this small change and then figure out whether it's valuable. I knew that there had to be a better way to get better outcomes to happen, but I also know that better outcomes don't just mean for the product. It means better outcomes for the entire product team, for the customer experience at large, and ultimately for the business. So, I think that that's one thing. If you're curious and you really want to learn more about that side of the house, one of the beautiful things I saw was one of my products managers fall more in love with understanding the business as she was starting to assure in her product ops career. I thought that was really cool. \n(00:49:04):\nShe had already had product background and she was like, \"I want to understand the inner workings here so that I know how to help these people.\" So the other thing is if you're a PM having issues with the role that you're currently in, I think you need to remember that you are there to solve problems. That's a very simple thing that we talked about. What are the things that PMs won't shed and shouldn't shed and that go and talk to customers? We get to talk to customers in order to solve the problems, figure out the right problems to solve. You do that in product ops as well. You don't have to go out to customers externally, but my customers and the people I speak to are internally. They are helping me understand the pain that the product team is tied to. \n(00:49:47):\nSo, if you don't love solving problems through building brand new features and building a product, then how can you help contribute to solving other ones? If you're a true problem solver, think about whether you want to do that. So, if you know the pain, what can you do to build a better experience overall? You can ultimately impact your business. \nLenny (00:50:03):\nDo you find most product ops people, at least at this point, are former product managers? What would be the pie chart of last job was product manager versus not of existing product ops people? \nChristine Itwaru (00:50:13):\nI got to put on a new survey. I do. I really have to put on a new survey. Initially, I saw a lot more folks moving in from management consulting, from customer success, from technical success. I haven't seen anyone from sales move in yet, and I have seen a couple PMs. Now, that's the day-to-day product ops manager. I will tell you that the people who are standing up the product ops orgs and being the first product ops hire at the leadership level are former product people. \n(00:50:45):\nI strongly advocate for product ops leaders to have done that role, to have actually had hands-on product experience building and understanding customer problems and feeling that pain, because you very quickly realize where to place your efforts and where your team's efforts should go. That helps you from an efficiency perspective and the business knows you're not just dilly-dallying. \nLenny (00:51:11):\nThat's really interesting. That makes a lot of sense. Just the roles you named again, where product op people come from. You said customer success. What are the others again?\nChristine Itwaru (00:51:19):\nI have seen technical success. I've seen management consulting. The management consulting piece makes a ton of sense to me. I think there's that data piece that they really like to lean into and advisory, and then the leadership ones coming in from product to leader roles. That's been a happy change too, seeing a director say, \"I now want to move into a position to coach the teams and to help build a stronger product team overall. I don't feel like building product.\" \nLenny (00:51:46):\nFascinating. For someone that's like, \"Wow, I want to do this job. This sounds rad,\" what advice would you give for people to pursue this role and get a gig in product ops? \nChristine Itwaru (00:51:58):\nWell, one, it's a good thing that there's no shortage of these roles. I would say that there are a lot of these roles open out in the industry. Be intentional about what you want to do, because right now, it's still in a bit of, \"Well, what are we doing in product operations as a product management community?\" There's no consistency industry to industry, size to size, team to team. It is very different. So, really think about your strengths. Do you love data? Are you a person who thrives on being able to make beauty out of this mess that you're seeing and advise people and help them understand maybe this is a direction that we should be going in? \n(00:52:40):\nAre you technical where you're like, \"No, I actually really enjoy doing the quantitative side of things,\" and you truly enjoy working with data science teams and you really like to bring that data aspect to the product teams? You could probably find a mix of both. There are people who do like doing both of those things. Generally, I mentioned this and I keep saying it, standing up that system because you know that if you had it, you would've been a better PM. \n(00:53:05):\nI think that that's a big thing there. If people realize that there's a better way to do it and they no longer have to do it all but they can do a slice of it in order to drive efficiency for the organization, then start thinking about going out there and doing it. The other thing too is look at those roles and make sure that you fine-tooth comb those job descriptions. Some of them are very vague because they're trying to figure it out on their own as well. So, the more you know what you want to do as a product person, the more you know what to lead out from these roles. \nLenny (00:53:36):\nAre there red flags when you're looking at a product job description of, \"Hmm, this isn't really the role you want\"? \nChristine Itwaru (00:53:43):\nI think this is a red flag for any role. I mentioned that it's really hard right now to put a number to the success of the role or on the success of the role, but if there's no, \"This is how you will be measured or this is what we're looking at as a successful outcome for this person in this role,\" I would say that's probably a red flag. That's table stakes people need to have on their job descriptions. \nLenny (00:54:06):\nFinal question. Something I try to get to with people from new companies that I haven't talked to before is just to get a general sense of how the product org is structured at the company. Just because people are always curious, how do you structure product teams? So I guess broadly I'd love to hear just how is the Pendo team product team structured? What are the buckets? Then also, is their product ops person integrated into each cross-functional product team? \nChristine Itwaru (00:54:31):\nYeah, I too love to learn about this. We're broken into major areas of the business or revenue streams and we have general managers over those. The GMs actually sit in the product team, which is nice. All have PM background, all really, really experienced and incredible. We also have a head of growth, so there's that component to it as well. Then you've generally got the senior directors. There are teams of product managers who are responsible for different areas in the product. So, we've got one product that's our core product and very mature, broken down into different components there. We have a newer product where that's just one straight product team versus having many different directors. \n(00:55:06):\nWe do have a product ops person integrated into these teams. I'd say probably all of them at this point, but the key thing here is they share themselves across two or three teams. Something going through listeners' minds right now is, \"Christine, is there a ratio of product ops people to the team?\" I would say that at one point, I felt like there might have been and I don't think that's the case anymore. Again, based on my experience and what I'm learning, we operate pretty lean and a lot of people are having to operate very lean right now. So, every few quarters, we look at our goals. We determine who or what goals need a product ops person and for what reason. We're really intentional about it. \n(00:55:44):\nAs an example, I use this saying respect the hustle with my team a little bit for the newer product that's still finding its way. The last thing you want to do as a product, which for somebody who I had a legacy product in my last job, one that I was building from the ground up and one that I was just responsible for getting out the door, sun setting at some point, you don't want anyone stifling creativity with any process or some time bound this or anything like that. So, the last thing you want to do is introduce something in there that feels like that you want them to hit the ground running. \n(00:56:18):\nSo, we don't over-index on things like a certain planning process or you need to get this to us because the other teams have. We need to know this thing by this timeframe. We'll do what we need to do from there. That's it. We're also quicker with the data. Voice of customer stuff takes a little bit longer for a more mature product team or this is more like, \"What are we learning right now and how quickly can we communicate this over to that team so they can iterate really quickly?\"\nLenny (00:56:47):\nAwesome. To come back to the structure just briefly, so you have GMs, business units. Within the business units, you have directors of product that report up to the GM within each and the directors or product have cross-functional product team that they operate that builds specific features and elements of the larger product. Then there's a product ops person supporting some of these teams and they're shared across teams. Got it. \nChristine Itwaru (00:57:14):\nYou've got everybody rolls up to a CPO. CPO's got all of this. \nLenny (00:57:15):\nChristine, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'm going to just fire them away. Does that sound good? \nChristine Itwaru (00:57:23):\nYes, let's do it. \nLenny (00:57:24):\nLet's do it. Two or three books that you recommend most to other people.\nChristine Itwaru (00:57:28):\nClassic is Inspired by Marty Cagan. It's one of the reasons I really fell in love with the product. It's inspirational. Leaders Eat Last, Simon Sinek. I really like that book too. That's more leadership style and making sure you putting in your team first, which is something I strongly believe in. This is a plug, but I also really like the book and it's very practical so it falls in that category, which is the Product-Led Organization by our CEO Todd Olsen. Really good book for right now, especially with people really going through this transformation. \n(00:58:00):\nThere's an old book that I have that's sitting on that shelf. It's Product Roadmaps Relaunched. It is really old. I mean I don't want to date myself, but it's almost 20 years old when I was in college. But it's really, really valuable and I can reference it just for a quick yeah, I forgot about that from a communication perspective for a roadmap. This is really cool. \nLenny (00:58:21):\nFavorite other podcast?\nChristine Itwaru (00:58:22):\nThe Product Experience Podcast from Mind the Product. I really like that one. A little bit similar to this other favorite one I'm on right now, but lots of really good product people and just very practical advice too. For leadership, I like HBR IdeaCast. Again, I like to balance the business side and the people side of leaderships.\nLenny (00:58:44):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show?\nChristine Itwaru (00:58:46):\nBecause I have kids, my brain is flooded generally with kid shows. I would say this year, it was between the new Matilda movie, which is based on the Broadway production, which was based on the old Matilda movie, but it's really, really good. Really well done. Then there's this movie. I think it's called Rise. Have you seen it? It's about the Giannis... I cannot say, forgive me, his last name, but he's on the Milwaukee Bucks, basketball player. It's about overcoming adversity and just struggle and really pushing through and giving it your all. I think that one is really good. Add it to your list if you haven't. It's called RISE. TV, I have Food. I don't have a favorite TV show. I've just finished watching White Lotus if that's qualified. \nLenny (00:59:33):\nIt's the most popular mentioned TV show on this podcast. \nChristine Itwaru (00:59:40):\nYeah, I would say for TV in general, you give me anything food. I love cooking. I'll cook an entire massive meal, three course, whatever, sit down, and eat it while I'm watching. Yeah. \nLenny (00:59:53):\nYum. Favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're interviewing people? \nChristine Itwaru (00:59:58):\nIf you could choose any career outside of what you're doing, what would it be and why? \nLenny (01:00:04):\nWhat do you look for in an answer there that tells you that this is a strong candidate versus not? \nChristine Itwaru (01:00:08):\nThere are skills that are a part of that other role that I would lean into. So, if somebody were to ask me that question, I would tell you a chef. It's about experience and it's about constantly refining your craft and it's about constantly looking to delight. I think that speaks to my love for product. It's all about that end state for the customer. So, I always ask that question and I look to see, \"What is it? Are they looking for fame? Are they looking for the temporary role?\" It's really telling. You dig into the qualities of what makes a good candidate for the other thing. You can figure out a lot. \nLenny (01:00:47):\nFascinating. If they're watching this and learning the secret, that's a good sign too. They're doing the research. \nChristine Itwaru (01:00:52):\nYeah.\nLenny (01:00:53):\nTop five SaaS products that you love, use at work other than Pendo. \nChristine Itwaru (01:00:53):\nI got to say Pendo.\nLenny (01:00:59):\nWe already know. We already know that's on the list. \nChristine Itwaru (01:01:01):\nYeah, I love Miro. I love Miro so much. During the pandemic, this became an essential tool for so many teams. I brought it into our company and I was a big advocate, part of my last one as well, just the collaboration and connection. Figma along the same lines, I think Figma is really great at that for our design team and the rest of products. So, that one's been really good. Seismic is one that I really like as well. That's the content management system for our go-to-market teams. So, it really plays well into how do we make sure we give them what they need and the tool that they need to be in. \n(01:01:36):\nGong is another one. I think Gong's really great. I've watched them go from the early days and I think we were an early customer or we were using it early on. I think they've pivoted at some point or they've definitely updated messaging on the coaching for their teams and us being able to dig into the qualitative insights that we get on those calls of people is really good too. So, yeah.\nLenny (01:02:01):\nGreat list. Ones that people haven't mentioned before, so that's always fun. Final question, what's something relatively minor that you've changed in Pendo's product development process that has had a tremendous impact on the way that you build product? \nChristine Itwaru (01:02:15):\nThis one's going to sound really elementary or for some people really elementary, but for some people, they're going to be like, \"Uh-huh, I totally feel that.\" Early on, we started bringing in engineers to customer meetings more and more and you don't want to typecast or profile an engineer, but generally, they're not raising their hand and being like, \"Yeah, I'm going to come and join, blah, blah, blah.\" They want to make sure they're doing their job and building the experience, but it's so simple and it's so effective. When we started doing it, the response from the engineering team was great and then also it helped us dig into a different side of the customer while we were on call sometimes. Some of them were flies on the walls. \n(01:02:52):\nSome of them were actually engaging with the engineers and help them increase their confidence in speaking to customers. So, I don't know. I feel like that just ended up changing a lot of the way that we started planning and making sure that their voice had a certain amount of weight or even more weight than it did before in the product development lifecycle. We respect their time. I remember some were very nervous and be like, \"Oh, I got to do all this other stuff,\" but they're like, \"Okay, I'll try it.\" \n(01:03:21):\nThen all of a sudden, they're like, \"Whoa, I really want to do this more and more.\" But it's just really being able to see that pain for them firsthand from a customer or the delight and frustration was very impactful. So, that's my answer and I feel like if you're not doing that as a product manager or product leader, then you better get on that train real fast because it's life changing for the entire team. \nLenny (01:03:42):\nThat is an awesome answer. This is the first time I've asked this question. I think I'm going to make it a standard question now because I feel like we're going to get all kinds of cool nuggets. So, thank you for starting it off with a bang. Christine, thank you so much for joining me. I learned more about product ops in an hour than I've learned in years and years of reading about it online. \nChristine Itwaru (01:04:02):\nThank you. \nLenny (01:04:02):\nSo, thanks for making the time. Thanks for sharing all your wisdom. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe ask you some questions about product ops and then how can listeners be useful to you? \nChristine Itwaru (01:04:13):\nThey can connect with me on LinkedIn. You'll put that up, I'm sure. Twitter, same. I've got my own site, so the productcraft.com. I started posting on product management products. I'm going to start doing some stuff on careers, all that good stuff. How can they be useful? So don't laugh at me, people. I needed a Twitter reset and so I had that for 13 years and then I no longer did and now I took it. So, just help me rebuild over there and just get back on that site. That's more immediate, but I would say help me understand what's going on in product and product ops. I will continue to do things like this and share more about what I'm learning, but I need to learn more from other people as well. That's an amazing, incredible part of my job that I'm about to do. \n(01:05:00):\nThere's just like a lot of pain right now all around us in the tech industry. I think about today and probably the next year or so. For people who are really questioning their next steps in their product careers, whether they stay in it, whether they move into something adjacent or relevant, they're looking to sharpen their skills, maybe make a site pivot to ops, whatever it is. I'm really interested to just gather more data on this and see how it all plays out while also trying to see if I can make some connections. So, I've been able to do that. Full circle back to Ben, Ben did this for me and you. I think that it's really important that the product community is smaller than we think. It's large and it feels expansive, but it's smaller than we think. \n(01:05:43):\nI think we're all facing an interesting time where people may be, again, questioning that next move or struggling. It would just be amazing for us to share. So, cheesy as it may sound, product ops for me was an easy way to be able to connect the dot and be that partner, right? Talk about the transparency and alignment. If there's a way that this community can help empower me to do more of that for all of you, I think that that would be incredibly helpful. \nLenny (01:06:06):\nWhat a beautiful way to end it. Christine, thank you again for being here. \nChristine Itwaru (01:06:10):\nThank you. This was so fun. \nLenny (01:06:12):\nSo much fun. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share. If you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you could look back on your career and go, you know what? I was part of this and that, and I was on this team, now's the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is, the future needs you.\n\nLenny (00:00:35):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products.\n\n(00:00:43):\nToday my guest is Christopher Lochhead.

Also, how to actually go about creating your own category. A ton of examples of companies that did this well and didn't do this well, what we could learn from them. Plus a ton of practical frameworks, including something Chris calls The \"Better\" Trap. Also, why he thinks product market fit is a very dangerous idea.

And let me say in case my ADHD brain forgets, I love all things Lenny. You're doing a great job, buddy. I'm honored to be here. And there's so many people in the entrepreneur startup marketing world who are scam artists, shysters, pieces of shit, idiotic hustle porn stars yelling stupidities. There's a lot of idiocy in the world in which you travel and I travel, and you, sir, stand out. You are making a difference. The conversations you're driving, the content you're creating. You're fucking awesome, Lenny, and I'm really stoked to be here with you.\n\nLenny (00:04:27):\nDamn, what an intro to my own podcast. I'm bad at accepting compliments. I'm just going to accept that and I appreciate that, man.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:04:34):\nNo, you need to get it. You are a beacon in an ocean of crapola. You are incredible.\n\nLenny (00:04:42):\nWell, enough about me. I really appreciate it. I was preparing for our conversation and usually what I try to do when I prepare for conversations is I read everything the person has written and it was very challenging with you. You have two podcasts, you have at least six books. There's probably more I missed. You have a newsletter, you tweet a lot. There's probably a lot of other stuff I didn't get to. And so you made my job very difficult preparing for this podcast, but also very worthwhile. So I'm excited to begin.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:05:07):\nI apologize for that.\n\nLenny (00:05:09):\nThe other thing I noticed as I was browsing your website, and it was hilarious because you have all these testimonials of your book and podcast and you have a lot of negative reviews, like \"Off-putting, or, \"Very disappointing,\" or, \"Absolute crap.\" I'm curious why you chose to do that as your website testimonial wall.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:05:29):\nWell, and I believe, I'd have to check with Steve Osler, the founder and publisher of Podcast Magazine, but I believe I'm the only podcaster in history to run a full page ad in Podcast Magazine with just negative quotes in it.\n\n(00:05:44):\nSo a couple reasons. Number one, can we all just have a sense of humor about this stuff? So it's my way, and the name of our team, yet we're sort of a company, but we're more of a band, is Category Pirates. I mean, clearly if you're called Category Pirates, you're probably trying to have a little bit of fun with this stuff. And so part of it is just trying to have a sense of humor with people.\n\n(00:06:10):\nThe second piece of it is, for a lot of entrepreneurs, marketers, creators, innovators of any kind, we live in this fear that when we launch our thing, whatever our thing is, that we will be criticized by the world and that we will be made fun of. And if you've ever authored a book or done a podcast or done anything, built a product, a software product, built any kind of a product that you feel is part of you, and most innovators, creators, software developers, artists, of course entrepreneurs, feel that way because they put themselves into this stuff. And when somebody criticizes us, many of us are devastated. And I have been in the past too. I'm a person just like anybody else.\n\n(00:06:55):\nAnd what I realized is, fuck them. Anybody who's trying to do anything exponential, anybody who's trying to break and take new ground, anybody who's trying to radically innovate, anybody who's trying to design and dominate new categories of the way we live, work and play, gets criticized. Picasso was called stupid. The Beatles were called terrible. Elvis was called terrible. I just wrote recently a little bit about hip-hop. I was listening to Rick Rubin on Barry Weiss's podcast, excellent episode. Excellent. She does a great job with him. And he was talking about how ridiculed hip-hop was in the beginning and it got banned. And it's the number one category of music in America today.\n\n(00:07:38):\nAnyway, so that's also part of it, is to just sort of say, \"Hey, look, this is some of the shit people have said about our work and my work, and I'm going to just put it on display, because this is going to happen to all of us.\"\n\n(00:07:50):\nAnd then I guess, Lenny, the third reason is in the creator world, broadly, there's a lot of people who are breaking their arms patting themselves on the back. And look, I understand why we have to tell people about why they should pay attention to us, and so we use our credentials or our awards or our downloads or our books, I understand that, and I do a little bit of that too. However, come on, let's just not take ourselves so seriously.\n\nLenny (00:08:17):\nAmazing. I could definitely use more of that skill of not taking negative feedback as seriously. And I love the idea of just embracing it and showing people what people don't like.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:08:27):\nWhy not? I mean, look, you're incredibly successful and if somebody says something negative about you, okay, great. Fuck them. They're not your people.\n\nLenny (00:08:39):\nFuck them. There we go.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:08:40):\nI didn't know who you were until Substack, and I saw your logo, the fiery logo, and there was something endearing about your logo. And the other thing that's great about you, from a radical differentiation marketing perspective is, you call yourself Lenny. And when I talk about you, I don't know your fucking last name. I mean, I sort of know it, but I don't really, you know what I mean?\n\nLenny (00:09:04):\nYeah. It's hard to pronounce.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:09:04):\nActually, I was at the gym this morning and I was telling my buddy that we were doing this, and I said, \"Oh, I'm going on Lenny's Podcast.\" He says, \"Lenny who?\" And I said, \"It begins with an R. I don't know. Everybody just calls him Lenny.\" And so the fact that you are yourself, you don't play a character, you're not a douche, you're just a person trying to be successful in the world and help others, right?\n\n(00:09:28):\nThat's a very powerful thing. And I think one of the things that is insidious about influencers, hustle porn stars, part of the business model is creating the perception of superiority, right? The reason Grant Cardone and Tai Lopez and all these douchebags pose in front of planes and all this garbage is they want you, the Kardashians are the queens of this, they want you to look at them and go, \"Oh, wow, don't I wish that I was them.\"\n\n(00:10:03):\nAnd so these folks are in the create and monetize envy business, and you're the opposite of that. And I think the legendary educators in the native digital world are the opposite of that. Anybody who's creating separation, anybody who's putting themselves above, anybody for whom there must be, \"I must be the leader, and you must be the follower,\" that's the business model of a massive amount of people in the native digital world, and we reject that. And I know you do.\n\nLenny (00:10:34):\nAbsolutely. We've already gotten way off track, but I love it. I'll just say one thing and then we'll get back on track. The reason I called my newsletter, Lenny's Newsletter is because that was the default recommendation Substack gave me when I signed up. They're just like, \"Call it this.\" And I'm like, \"Okay,\" because I don't know, I didn't have no plans to actually be doing this long term. And then it just stuck. And then I brainstormed for weeks. I'm like, \"I need a real name on this thing.\" And I just couldn't think of anything that I liked. So I'm just like, \"All right, I'll just roll with it.\" And then when the podcast launched, I tried so many ways to call it something else so that it would push the whole naming in a different direction, it wasn't about me, but I couldn't think of anything better. So I'm just rolling with it at this point.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:11:12):\nWell, and the interesting thing is, even though the branding of the shit has your name in, it's not about you. That's the irony, right? Meghan Markle gets canceled. Why? Because it's about her, and it turns out she's infinitely uninteresting. I've consumed enough of your content to know that the cool thing is, yeah, it's called Lenny, but it's actually, you are not trying to impress all of us with how awesome you are in front of a fucking plane or a bunch of scantily clad people, or I don't know what.\n\nLenny (00:11:54):\nIt's true. Well, I'm enjoying this podcast. You're very kind to me. Let's talk about the meat of what I want to chat about, which is your bread and butter category creation. It goes without saying you're a big fan of creating your own category versus what most people try to do, which is try to compete in an existing category. So just to kind of lay a little foundation, can you just explain what this actually means, this idea of category creation for people that have heard this idea in this term, but don't really know what it means.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:12:23):\nIt turns out that in business, most people, and in life for that matter, make a unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued, unthought of decision that they don't know they made. And the decision they make is, \"What I'm going to do, is I am going to compete in a market with demand, with a better product/service/brand, maybe a better business model, maybe a better set of growth hacking ideas that I learned on the Lenny Podcast. And when the world gets my better, the world will beat a path to my door.\"\n\n(00:13:16):\nAnd if you go onto Amazon right now, Lenny, there's roughly a hundred thousand marketing books, and I think I'd have to double check, but I think there's about 60,000 or 80,000 business strategy books. And of course, me and my collaborators, we haven't read all of them, but like you and like many of us in business, we've read many of the tomes, the Bibles out there, and there's an interesting thing about virtually all of them. That's what they're about. It's about how to compete and win.\n\n(00:13:53):\nWell, here's the aha. Nobody legendary ever did that. Not a one. We all know who Bob Marley is. We don't know who the 17th greatest reggae musician or band in the world is. We all know who Pablo Picasso is. We don't know who the fifth greatest cubist artist is. And so wherever you look in life, whether it's in the business world, people who drive social change, artists, creators of any kind, the people that we tend to admire the most are the people who broke and took new ground. And the aha here is the category makes the product, the category makes the brand, the category makes the company.\n\n(00:14:51):\nSo I'll give you the data and then I'll fully answer your question. So here's the data. We did an analysis for our first book where we studied every venture-backed tech company in the US from 2000 to 2015. And we asked a question that, to the best of our knowledge, had never been asked before. And we went to Stanford and we asked a bunch of professors this question, and they said, \"We don't know this. You're going to have to do it yourselves.\" So we did, and incidentally had it peer reviewed and published in the HBR. And if you've ever gotten data published in the HBR, then you know what it's like to have a journalistic proctology exam.\n\n(00:15:32):\nAnyway, here's the net of it. In tech market categories, on average, one company earns two-thirds, 76% to be exact, of the total value created as measured by market cap and or valuation. So not market share, which is important, market cap as measured by the value of all the companies in the category. So you take a category, you add all the companys' value together, and you say, \"What percent goes to the leader, the category, queen or king? And what percent goes to everybody else?\" One company, two-thirds of the economics.\n\n(00:16:12):\nSo the aha here, Lenny, is when we make the unquestioned, unconsidered, undialogued decision that we didn't know that we made, to compete, we have unwittingly said, \"We're going to fight for the 24%.\" And it's the distinction or delta between create demand and capture demand. So we prefer the term category design, and I can explain why design instead of creation, we don't have anything against creation, but creation creates a confusion in people's mind. When people hear category creation, because most people in business, most people in tech, are strongly oriented to product, what they think you said is first to ship a product that has X features.\n\n(00:17:08):\nSo when most people say category creation, that's what they think. They say, \"They [inaudible 00:17:16] category, Myspace did.\" Or if you've been around for a little while longer, \"GeoCities did.\" And so category creation, category design, does not equal first to ship a product with a set of features. So what does it equal? Here's the aha. Just like you can design a product, just like you can design a company culture or business model, you can actually design a market.\n\n(00:17:46):\nAnd in so doing, you create a new distinction in value for people that didn't exist before. I'll give you a simple example. If I could own any product in the world right now, I think I'd probably want to own Purell. And there's a great thing about the company that makes Purell. The company's been around for a very, very long time, and they're owned by the original family that created the company. Their original problem that they were solving is, it was a husband and wife team, and they were working in a factory. This was 80 plus years ago. The company, by the way, is called Gojo Industries. Gojo. And Gojo is a portmanteau, putting their two names together. I think it was, maybe it was Gloria and Joseph, or I'd have to double check the husband and wife names, you'll excuse me, but the company's called Gojo Industries, and I think the granddaughter runs it today, if I'm not mistaken.\n\n(00:18:54):\nAnyway, so the gal, the wife said, \"This bar soap is disgusting. It's full of crapola, it's hairy, it's full of man nastiness.\" So the solution to washing your hands called a bar of soap was a disgusting, inappropriate solution for her. So she reimagined the problem, not as, \"How do I wash my hands,\" but as, \"How do I wash my hands without a disgusting bar soap?\" And Gojo Industries created a whole new category called liquid soap. And in most restaurants, most corporate bathrooms, most airport bathrooms, if you start paying attention, you'll see the Gojo logo on the squeezy thing that you pull when you go to get the soap. So unlike most innovators and entrepreneurs, who get obsessed with the solution, and I understand why, we all love our shit, we all love our product. If you want to talk to me about our shit, I want to talk all about it.\n\n(00:20:05):\nWe could do a 12-hour deep dive on all your content and how you built the newsletter, and you'd love it. It'd be great. We all do. If you're a creator of any kind, entrepreneur, innovator of any kind, you love the thing you're creating, of course. However, Gojo focused on the problem, not just the solution. So they stay obsessed with the problem, and then they ask a different question, which is, \"How do I wash my hands in the absence of water?\" And of course, the answer to that question is a new category, [inaudible 00:20:44] hand sanitizer. And the dominant brand, of course is Purell.\n\n(00:20:49):\nAnd so the aha here is the company that designs the space and gets it to tip at scale. And when I say designs the space, what I mean is specifically gets a meaningful percentage of the world to agree with their definition of a problem set, which then leads to their definition of a solution set. The company that does that at any kind of scale, wins. And so the number one question for any entrepreneur or any creator at all is, \"Do I want to compete for 24% of an existing market category? Or do I want to create my own where if I can execute, I will earn two-thirds of the economics?\" That's the decision that most entrepreneurs make, that they don't know that they made. And at its heart, category design is about the most radical kind of differentiation.\n\n(00:21:52):\nSo most companies actively seek comparison. If you go to, well, if go to many software company's website right now on their homepage, you'll see a Gartner report or a Forrester report on their homepage. You'll see ads and/or content that say, \"Here are three competitors and a list of features,\" and there'll be 25 features, \"And then there's us,\" and there'll be 125 features. And they're actively inviting comparison. You even hear it in ads. If you listen to what marketers say, Lenny, we say the stupidest shit. Don't take our word for it. Anyway. And so the legendary innovators over time, they did not compare their innovation to the past. They broke and took new ground. They wanted to be irreplaceable. They wanted to be so much value in the minds of customers that not only were the switching costs horrible, switch to what?\n\nLenny (00:23:07):\nTo follow this thread a little bit, companies that you're pretty familiar with, maybe just a rapid fire sharing of their category to give people a concrete sense of what does it even mean to have a category?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:23:21):\nOkay, let's go.\n\nLenny (00:23:22):\nIt's becoming obvious that they basically all came up with a different category that they wanted to win. And so Gong comes up as an example. I don't know if you know about Gong. I think they-\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:23:32):\nI do.\n\nLenny (00:23:33):\nSo it's basically like sales analytics is what they pitch, is like, this is the first thing you can ever do to understand how your sales team is doing. Is there anything you know more about their approach?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:23:43):\nYeah, I know the space very, very well, and they did something incredibly smart. So they were a little later in the space than some others. And so there were a whole bunch of companies in today which you could broadly refer to as the revenue space, right? In the spirit of full disclosure, I'm familiar with Clary. I'm good friends with Andy. I know the team. I've done some work with them. So all disclosure. Clary, and a handful of others, in the beginning started to create the space that ultimately became RevOps. And the interesting thing that Gong did, very smart, was as RevOps started to emerge, they were smart enough to realize that revenue was going to be a big new important space. That CRM didn't actually do it. That ERP didn't actually do it. BI didn't actually do it. And so there was this sort of emerging set of thinking around, \"We need a different approach to revenue.\"\n\n(00:24:44):\nThey were smart enough to realize that if they went for the whole enchilada, it's not credible from a startup that you're going to go build, that you're going to show up and say, \"We have a suite that's equivalent to that of SAP, just for this other area.\" So they picked off a very tight part of a broader emerging category, and they executed incredibly, and they dominated that part. But here's the mistake they made. In all new mega categories, they start like this. This is exactly what happened in CRM. I could walk you through the history if it matters, but there were companies in support, there were companies in help desk, there were companies in sales, there were companies in marketing, and there were a whole bunch of sub-niches underneath that. There was a point in time in the Salesforce automation category, when that was a standalone category, that some of the hottest companies in that category were sales configurator companies, a further down niche.\n\n(00:25:44):\nAnd so as these mega spaces emerge over time, no one company can fulfill the needs of a customer. And so there's all these niches. The mistake that Gong made, as well as the vast majority of others in that space, is they stayed in their micro niche. So the strategy in the beginning that was genius and exactly what you should do as a startup, all of a sudden, when they didn't expand and set the agenda, the design for the big category, they got fucked. Because now they're niched. And there's a big learning in this Lenny, which is, if you're a company that's already up and running and you're winning, and let's say you're becoming the category queen in your space, every entrepreneur, every CEO, faces a fascinating moment. If they become successful in the first five years or so, which is they realize their biggest barrier to growth going forward, is their current category, because you can only be as big and successful as your market category.\n\n(00:27:02):\nAnd so you have to continuously expand the vision for the category and continuously build on that. And if you don't, and somebody else frames, claims, and names, the bigger agenda, as has been the case, and look, I'm biased, as has been the case with Clary, Clary's crushing everybody in this space right now, and the Gongs and all the other players are now in this horrible position, which is they basically only have two choices. One, they can stay in their niche, which is what most players do, and they argue best of breed \"Oh, well, we're the best revenue carbodingulator. And you could go buy an end-to-end revenue platform. But if you do that, you won't get the best functionality in the carbodingulator space. So buy our revenue carbodingulator.\" That doesn't work. Microsoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:28:00):\nMicrosoft proved it over 30 years ago, and we can talk about that if you want. You either stay in your niche and get diminished over time, or you uplevel and you go to play for the whole enchilada. The problem is for them and all the others in this space who didn't do that, if they were to do it today, well over a year after Clari did, they're just a Clari copycat. And so basically you either go compete with Clari for who can be the category king, or you stay in your niche and get diminished over time. And if you're going to go compete with the company that is laying down the category design that's picking up the most momentum for the overall market, you better know how to do a fifth dan black belt category wars.\n\nLenny (00:28:58):\nFollowing that thread, there's a bunch of threads I'd love to follow, but something I definitely wanted to touch on is, in this concept of the better trap, which is where most people go, where they try to be the better solution in an existing category. And just to reinforce that point, what have you seen? What have you learned about just why that is often, and maybe always the wrong approach?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:29:19):\nLet's take a very current example, Threads. We just wrote about this. When Threads came out, and I can show you all the headlines if you want to see them, New York Times, nevermind tech... All these places. Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer, Twitter killer. And at the time there's all this discussion of Musk and Zuck having a UFC cage fight. And so there's all this buildup into the launch of Threads and there's all this supposed Twitter hate, and, quote, unquote, \"Everybody's leaving Twitter.\" All right. So Threads comes out. What happens? Threads surpasses GPT as the fastest growing app ever.\n\n(00:30:08):\nNow the headlines, Lenny, are coming. This is it. Zuck's a genius. It's incredible. And by the way, this sits inside one of the newer stupid axioms in Silicon Valley. So this is a side note, but when somebody says something in Silicon Valley that enough people think, \"Yes, that's smart.\" They just parrot it. They don't actually think about it. There's a current thinking in Silicon Valley, and this was real loud as Threads was coming out, this was the reason why Threads was the Twitter killer. What you need, Lenny, is brand and distribution. That's what you need, especially distribution. I would assert to you that Threads had the greatest distribution advantage of any new piece of software ever launched. If there's another one that has a greater distribution advantage, I'd like to know what it is.\n\nLenny (00:31:11):\nNo, that seems right. Seems right.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:31:14):\nMassive distribution, incredible, easy up and on, incredible. Free product, not even freemium, free. Awesome. And Facebook Meta, you tell me, one of the 10 most powerful brands in tech?\n\nLenny (00:31:32):\nAbsolutely.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:31:33):\nHow many users does Facebook have today, Lenny, do you know?\n\nLenny (00:31:35):\nOver a billion? Might be more.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:31:37):\nHow many billion person apps have there been in the history of apps?\n\nLenny (00:31:42):\nNone.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:31:43):\nRight.\n\nLenny (00:31:43):\nI think.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:31:44):\nLegendary brand, the greatest distribution advantage in history. What happened? It cratered. It's gone. It's still there, but nobody's there.\n\nLenny (00:31:59):\nThey're launching the [inaudible 00:32:00] soon so they have another shot.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:32:02):\nOh yeah. Now why, why did that happen? Why did one of the richest people in the history of the world, who's potentially one of the smartest people in the history of entrepreneurship in tech, fail so miserably when the entire world said he was going to \"kill,\" quote, unquote, Twitter? And after the initial, quote, \"success\" of Threads everybody said that's exactly what was going to happen. And now all those experts are surprisingly quiet. The legendary Kevin Maney said that category design is a new lens on business. It's a different lens. It's sits next to the product lens, it sits next to the competition lens, but it is equally important. So here's what happened with Threads.\n\n(00:32:54):\nThey attacked an existing, well-known, well understood, incredibly well-defined problem with a direct copy. They even were celebrating that it was Twitter, just better. They said virtually those words. So known existing problem with a known existing solution that was, quote, unquote, \"better\" and integrated with the rest of the Meta shit. Quote, \"Everybody checked it out and everybody went away.\" Why? Here's the aha.\n\n(00:33:33):\nProblems create categories, and you either have to A, solve a new problem, or B, reframe, name and claim an existing problem in a, I'm going to use these words on purpose, very different way. And if you reframe the existing problem such that people see it in a different way, that's when they'll be open to a new solution. But the mistake is the impasses is on the wrong [inaudible 00:34:11]. The impasses is on the product. Because we live in a world where just like the availability of oxygen, we believe the best product wins. Zuckerberg is going to blow in excess of a billion dollars on Threads and it will fail. It already has failed. Because you can't take an existing problem with an existing solution, launch exactly the same shit, tell the world it's better and have the world embrace it. Because the problem makes the solution the other way around.\n\nLenny (00:34:51):\nSo classic advice along these lines is, if you're, say, 10 times better than the existing product, you have a good chance at getting people to care and having success. Is there a line of just like it's the same thing but 10 times better? Or do you have to, in your experience, reframe? And I want to talk about that.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:35:07):\nLet's just look at the evidence. We could agree that Jeff Bezos is not a dumb person, yes?\n\nLenny (00:35:14):\nYes.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:35:16):\nDo you have an Amazon Fire phone?\n\nLenny (00:35:19):\nI don't.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:35:20):\nNeither do I. Why not?\n\nLenny (00:35:24):\nI'm very happy with my iPhone.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:35:27):\nAnd so, Bezos launched a better product and nobody bought it. And the reason nobody bought it is the problem. And therefore the solution that you think you're solving with your iPhone is solved with your iPhone. When was the last time you enjoyed a Red Bull Cola?\n\nLenny (00:35:48):\nNot once.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:35:50):\nRed Bull made exactly the same mistake that Zuck just made with threads. What Red Bull believed was, \"We built one of the greatest brands in the world.\" Which they have, but they didn't understand why. The category made the brand not the other way around. Energy Drink made the category, so they go, \"Great, we can put our brand on anything and it'll sell. So let's make Cola.\" They lost a bazillion dollars. It's reported that Microsoft lost somewhere between 400 and a billion dollars in Microsoft Stores. Did you ever go to a Microsoft store, Lenny?\n\nLenny (00:36:28):\nI walked by them in the mall and I don't think I've ever entered.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:36:32):\nWell, they look exactly... If you remember, they look exactly like an Apple Store. And Ballmer famously told the team, when the Apple Stores took off, he famously told the team, \"Go to the Apple Stores, study everything they're doing and let's copy it exactly.\" Google that shit, it's out there. Well, it didn't work. Why? Because you can't attack an incumbent category queen unless you frame, name and claim a new or different problem. Because when the existing problem is well understood and the existing solution is well understood, there's no need for a new solution. Even if people, quote, unquote, \"hate Twitter,\" didn't do anything to Twitter, and now Zuck's going to have to write off probably over a billion dollars on Threads. And the funny thing is, Lenny, this just keeps happening over and over and over. Venture capitalists in the next five years will blow at least half a trillion dollars in the AI space alone, on me too, demand chasing existing category competing startups that have a 10x better product, no one cares.\n\n(00:38:02):\nAnd look, we're all going to sit here and watch them do it. And we, category pirates, and those of us in the category design world will say, \"Told you.\" And they're just going to keep doing it. More importantly, because the big companies in many cases can afford to continue to fail and make this mistake. The tragedy in this is how many legendary innovative products never got to see the light of day because the inventor, the creator, the entrepreneur, believed in the product, but didn't know that every solution has to fit into a problem of value for people. And so their innovation went nowhere.\n\nLenny (00:38:51):\nLet's talk about how to actually go about designing a category. You've used this phrase a few times, and that may be the best lens to approach it. If not, we can go at it from a different direction. But this idea of framing, naming, and claiming, how do you do that? What's that process like?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:39:08):\nGreat question. It starts somewhere where most people don't want to start, and that is, the first law of category design is thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking. If you're going to think about thinking, we have to define thinking. Now, the minute I start down this path, there's a meaningful percentage of people whose eyes rolling, going, \"Here comes some bullshit,\" right? \"Just tell me how to do the SEO, Lenny. Where's the SEO? Or where's the...\" Whatever the tactical thing is.\n\n(00:39:47):\nSo the first thing we have to do is break down thinking. Roger Martin is considered to be the greatest management thinker, or certainly one of them alive today. We were lucky enough to have him on the podcast when his most recent book came out, which if I'm remembering correctly, is called the New Way to think. People call him the new Peter Drucker. And he describes it as effectively as anyone I've ever heard. And at a high level, and this is me paraphrasing, so give me some license, but he's the source. At a high level there's two kinds of thinking, reflective and reflexive. And now, this is my editorializing. What most people think is reflective thinking is actually reflexive thinking. What's reflex versus reflective? Reflex is simple. You go for an annual checkup, yes?\n\nLenny (00:40:41):\nI should be.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:40:43):\nHave you ever had a doctor whack your knee with the little pink?\n\nLenny (00:40:46):\nYeah.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:40:46):\nAnd your knee goes whoop.\n\nLenny (00:40:49):\nI do [inaudible 00:40:49] .\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:40:50):\nAnd she's testing your reflexes. And that's an involuntary thing, when you're sitting on the doctor's table and your legs are hanging like a little kid and she goes whack, your leg just does this twitch, right? So that's a reflex. And reflexive thinking is very, very powerful. You have a driver's license, I'm guessing.\n\nLenny (00:41:11):\nI do.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:41:12):\nAnd when was the last time you were in a vehicle, driving?\n\nLenny (00:41:15):\nYesterday.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:41:17):\nAnd if you're out on the road driving and somebody cuts you off, what are you likely to do?\n\nLenny (00:41:25):\nI get a little upset and then I keep driving.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:41:29):\nBut I would assert, Lenny, you do something before you get upset.\n\nLenny (00:41:31):\nI guess I try to avoid hitting this car.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:41:34):\nYes. And maybe you swerve, maybe you hit the brakes, maybe you do both. My point is this, the car cuts you off and we instantly, no thinking, react in order to save our lives, not damage our vehicles, not hurt anybody else. We didn't think about that. We literally just reacted. That's the way people think about most things. I say to you, Lenny, let's talk about guns and abortion and immigration rights in America.\n\nLenny (00:42:14):\nNo, thanks.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:42:15):\nNow you have opinions about those things, right?\n\nLenny (00:42:17):\nI do.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:42:18):\nAs do I. Most people don't challenge their own thinking. Most people say, \"Now, why do I only think what I think about abortion? Where did I learn that? What do I really think about abortion? What do others think about abortion? Are there smart people in the world that I admire who are more educated and experienced in this field that have meaningfully different opinions than my own? There are. Why is that?\" Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. We don't fucking do that, we say our opinion on abortion is the opinion on abortion. And in the United States of America in the political domain we say, \"And anybody who thinks differently is trying to kill America.\" That's not thinking. So reflexive thinking is, what do I really think? Why do I think that? And in the business world, most people unconsciously assume the future is a continuation of the past. That's not what legendary entrepreneurs do. Legendary entrepreneurs don't just think they know the future is going to be different, because they're designing that different future. And the problem they're focused on matters to them so much that the fact that the problem continues to persist makes them batshit crazy. RJ... Is it RJ or JR? I can't remember now... The founder of Rivian, obviously Musk at Tesla, these guys are obsessed. It drives them insane. They don't understand why we're not all in EVs already.\n\n(00:44:12):\nAnd so my friend Mike Maples, the legendary venture capitalist from Floodgate, says, \"The greatest entrepreneurs are visitors from the future telling us how it's going to be.\" And the reason many of them are so irascible is because the fact that the present is not already at the future that they see makes them insane. And so the point being legendary entrepreneurs and creators make the future different. They literally are in the design different futures business. Can I tell you a story?\n\nLenny (00:44:46):\nPlease.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:44:50):\nWe're friends, and we've done some work with the guys who created Lomi. And Lomi is the first kitchen appliance in 20 years to earn a spot on the kitchen counter. A, it's one of the fastest growing new consumer items in the last 20 years. And B, if you think about your kitchen counter, do you have a toaster?\n\nLenny (00:45:19):\nYep.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:45:21):\nCoffee maker?\n\nLenny (00:45:22):\nYeah, I don't drink too much coffee, but we do have one.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:45:25):\nAny other devices on the kitchen counter?\n\nLenny (00:45:27):\nWe got a rice cooker and the rest is hidden away.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:45:33):\nPerfect. So what's Lomi? Lomi is the category designer of the smart home composter. Imagine a device that's one and a half or twice the size of a good size toaster. And what Lomi does is you take your food scraps, and it turns out that depending on whose numbers you want to believe, in America, we throw away somewhere between 40 to 60% of our food. And it turns out that food garbage, food waste is some of the most damaging to the environment. So what does Lomi do? You take your food scraps, you dump it into Lomi, you fill that shit up, Lomi's got a button on the front, you press that button, and what used to take three to six months to compost gets composted in three to six hours.\n\n(00:46:29):\nAnd even, this is weird, it smells good to me. Lomi did not say that, \"we're better garbage, that we're different garbage, that we're better recycling.\" What they said was, \"We are a different way of solving this huge problem.\" And they use both personal motivation, nobody likes throwing out garbage, nobody likes a big mess in their kitchen, et cetera, and an altruistic vision, which is... And oh by the way, if we do this, we will do something that governments heretofore have not been able to do, which is take a massive amount of environment hurting gases out of the atmosphere. And it turns out because of global climate change that we're creating more and more sand and we have dirt traces. Lomi dirt has been shown to be amongst the most nutrient rich dirt in the world. Here is a company with a breakthrough technology that truly makes a difference in the world with a business model that allows them to build a highly profitable high growth business.\n\n(00:47:48):\nAnd the way they got there was by designing a new category and showing the world why, by making room in your tight kitchen for this new device, you'll make a difference for your family and the world. And if all they had done was what, by way of example, Dean Kamen did when he launched the segue, which is, isn't this cool? Nothing would've happened. So my point is, the Lomi guys designed a product, a company, and a new market category. They created demand out of nothing for, I think the average price is around 400 bucks. The sum total of the market for smart home composters when they launched was fucking zero. And their vision for the new category was so compelling, Jay-Z was one of their first investors.\n\nLenny (00:48:53):\nI have their site up. Thinking about this framework of, frame it, name it, claim it, they framed the problem in this unique way of... Is it the framing of the problem or framing of a solution? The framing step, best way to think about that.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:49:09):\nThere's something in category design called languaging, which is the strategic use of language to change thinking. And a mistake that a lot of entrepreneurs make is they use old language to describe their new thing. And we can't use so much new language that nobody knows what the fuck we're talking about, so we have to meet the category where it is and bring them forward, but we have to create new language. Can I share with you one of my favorite, most recent, favorite category design stories in this regard?\n\nLenny (00:49:42):\nPlease.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:49:44):\nYou've been on an elevator, yes?\n\nLenny (00:49:45):\nYes.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:49:47):\nHave you ever looked at the floor and seen a logo on the floor of the elevator?\n\nLenny (00:49:53):\nI can't recall. I imagine it.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:49:55):\nWell, if you do, you'll more than likely see this name, Otis. Otis Elevator. Most people don't know why Otis is the category queen of elevators. Well, here's why. Elisha Otis invented the elevator. Now, pre-Elisha, there were no skyscrapers. Because how could you get to the top floor? How could you build the top floor, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. So when he creates the elevator, there's no known problem for it to solve. So he demonstrates it, people think it's cool. He shows it at like fares and shit. Because the big problem with prior elevators was they would crash. And so he built this safety system to catch them if the wiring would crash. And the category name, he actually used, Lenny, he called it the safety elevator to address the current problem in the space, which is... I don't know. People still went, \"That's interesting, but why do I need a safety elevator?\" It's a solution with no problem.\n\n(00:51:14):\nSo what does he do? Languaging. And in category design, one of the breakthroughs is this thing called a point of view, which helps you frame, claim and name a problem and educate the world on why they should move from the way it is to, we call them frotos, from to, a new and different way. So Elisha has to make the market, there's zero demand. It's what many of our smart VC friends call a zero billion market, which is what you want. So what does Elisha call it? The vertical... Railway\n\nLenny (00:51:57):\nBeautiful.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:51:59):\nAnd people understand what a railway does. It moves people and shit this way. And he said, \"Great, we've now got a vertical elevator that moves people and shit this way.\" And if you have a vertical elevator-\n\nLenny (00:52:11):\nVertical railway.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:52:12):\nA vertical railway, thank you. You can have a new category of building. This is no different than anybody today, for example, in the technology space, who's building a new part of the technology stack for AI. So if you've got a new important security layer for AI that enables a new highly secure AI application. From a languaging perspective, if you just use existing languaging, you'll be like Elisha in the beginning where people go, \"That's really cool, man. Fucking A, didn't think that was technically possible. Wow. It's like you've broken gravity, dude, incredible. Don't know why we'd ever need this. See you.\" And he goes, \"Wait a minute, wait a minute. What if it was a vertical railway?\" \"Well, what could we do with a vertical railway?\"\n\n(00:53:09):\nThis is why thinking matters. The way you think about the problem, the way you frame claim and name the problem. One of the core tenets, Lenny, in category design is listen to the words. Listen to the words. And when you listen to the words, you will hear things that you don't normally. And so he created new languaging, what in category design is called a point of view, to frame, claim and name a problem, which is, how do I move up and down versus across land? And in so doing the aperture of people's minds created what you could think of as new mental scaffolding for a whole new kind of innovation. And thanks to Elisha Otis, we have tall buildings.\n\nLenny (00:54:01):\nI really like this idea of languaging. Are there any other examples come to mind, awesome examples of languaging in action that worked out?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:54:07):\nI got a bazillion of them. Another one of my favorites. When Starbucks first starts a coffee is 10 cents. You sit there and you go, \"We can't make money at 10 cents.\" That doesn't make sense, right? Unit economics don't work for what we're trying to get done. If the ASP in the industry is 10 cents, we want to have an ASP of three bucks. Fuck. Well, here's the aha. It's very hard to charge three bucks for a thing that everybody currently pays a quarter for, if you call it the same thing.\n\n(00:54:50):\nSo they create new languaging, they teach, they literally teach consumers new language. That's why you and I walk into Starbucks and say, \"I'd like a double grande latte, please.\" 25 years ago, that was not languaging that you and I used. And they use it as a mechanism for radical differentiation and radical value/price differentiation. And they made up the fucking word. It sounds kind of Italian, vente. But the truth is, by the way, it's a milkshake, but that's a whole other conversation. They're the number one milk seller in the country. They're a milk company, not a coffee company. But that's, again, a whole other conversation. The point being, if you want to charge three bucks for something that heretofore has been 10 cents or a quarter, change the language. And you know it's Starbucks language. Where I live, there's a shit ton of new hipster independent coffee shop type places. Where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before-\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:56:00):\n... where they paint the Mona Lisa in your latte before they give it to you and all that shit. If you walk into one of those hipster places and ask for a double grande latte, the super hipster gal or guy behind the counter with the nose ring and shit is going to give you a bit of a grizzle, because you are using Starbucks languaging in their location, and that's the other breakthrough. This is really important in the technology industry, the company that creates the languaging for the category wins.\n\n(00:56:39):\nOh, you see that today, OpenAI. Not that long ago you did not hear the term large language model. Correct?\n\nLenny (00:56:51):\nCorrect.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:56:52):\nThat was not a term we were talking about.\n\nLenny (00:56:53):\nThat's right.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:56:56):\nAnd today the entire industry is talking about LLMs. Here's another thing that they created, training data. Well, those of us who've been around for a long time, we understand what data is. We know what a database is, we know what data in motion is, we know what data at rest is. We know what structured data is, we know what unstructured data is, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n(00:57:19):\nI'm not a data expert by any stretch, but I've been in the industry for 37 years, I know some about shit data. We'd never heard the term training data, and I'm still frankly looking for a breakthrough in languaging to describe it to people, because I think when most people realize the difference between data/content and training data, there's a massive breakthrough that can occur there. The languaging is still not sufficient, but we're getting there.\n\n(00:57:53):\nNew languaging creates new thinking, and a demarcation point in language creates a demarcation point in thinking, which can create a demarcation point in perceived value, and she, who changes and or creates net new value perceptions wins.\n\nLenny (00:58:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by Round.

To give people one more tactical tool for coming up with and figuring out the category they want to go after and framing it and even naming it, you mentioned this idea of having a point of view. Maybe that's the best way to approach this question, or maybe there's another framework of just how can people best think through and spend time thinking about what this new category they should be creating ends up being?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (00:59:51):\nGreat question, Lenny. Two things, at least. First, spend more time on the problem than the solution. There's a very early stage, security startup I'm working with right now in the AI space that's doing absolutely mind-boggling things, and the founders have incredible backgrounds with large transaction systems and deep security, just an incredible company.\n\n(01:00:21):\nI had a call yesterday with the founder and some folks on the product team just getting an update on where they're at and this and that and the other, and we're sort of starting to want to talk to people externally. We've raised a seed round, VCs are coming, they're very ... Anyway, we're sort of slowly starting to want to come into the world and begin to have a conversation.\n\n(01:00:46):\nThe founder CEO sends me a text yesterday and says, \"I'd like you to, if you're open to it, have a call with so-and-so. He's a very important person, knows a lot about our space, blah blah. Known him for a long time,\" dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Great. I said, \"It sounds wonderful, but why? What's the purpose of my conversation with so-and-so?\" The founder literally said to me, \"I would love it if you would be willing to invest some time in listening to some of our customers to hear from their perspective what the problem is and what the solution could be, not just from me and our team.\"\n\n(01:01:27):\nThat is a founder who's obsessed with the problem. That's the first piece. The second piece of advice I'll give you, I mentioned Mike Maples, he's got a very powerful way of framing this. He calls it backcasting as distinct from forecasting. You're nodding your head, you're familiar with this.\n\nLenny (01:01:54):\nYeah, I've read this in length in the show notes, it's amazing.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:01:56):\nYeah. Here's the idea. What most people do is you and I are entrepreneurs, we have this idea for a product, this problem we can solve. We think we're going to be bazillionaires, we think we're going to help a lot of people, we think we're going to have a lot of fun, and so we have at it. And whether we realize it or not, the mental scaffolding we use goes like this: Lenny and Christopher are sitting here now, we have these big dreams. We think, let's say, five years out into the future, \"What do we want to do? Oh [inaudible 01:02:32]. Why don't we go through all the dreams? Great.\" Then we ask ourselves, most of this is subconscious and then it shows up in business plans and other things, \"What do we need to do to get from here to there?\" Have you ever done any backcountry hiking, Lenny?\n\nLenny (01:01:56):\nYeah, I have.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:02:52):\nYeah, so if you and I were going to go on a four or five-day trip in the Sierras, we would have a start point, right?\n\nLenny (01:03:00):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:03:02):\nAnd we'd know where we were coming out, right?\n\nLenny (01:03:03):\nMm-hmm.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:03:04):\nAnd we'd have way points along the way, yes?\n\nLenny (01:03:06):\nYeah, probably.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:03:09):\nBecause we knew we were going to be out four days or six days or whatever, we would try to plan our food appropriately.\n\nLenny (01:03:14):\nAbsolutely.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:03:14):\nAnd the whole plan would be predicated on \"We're going to start here and we're going to end here,\" and what do we need to do to get from where we start to where we end, yes?\n\nLenny (01:03:25):\nMm-hmm.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:03:26):\nNow, when going on a backcountry hike, that's a very smart fucking thing to do, because if you've ever been on a backcountry hike and you're four days in only to realize you don't have enough food, that's an experience you don't want to recreate. Okay, turns out that while that's highly effective for a hike, it is intergalactic disaster for a startup. Here's why. Your point of reference is everything. Thinking about thinking is the most important kind of thinking.\n\n(01:03:59):\nWhen we do it that way, mentally we are standing in the present, which is an extension of the past, and we're saying, \"What do we need to do to go from this present to the different future we want, and what are the obstacles in the way?\" Here's the mental scaffolding. That's forecasting, here's backcasting.\n\n(01:04:26):\nWe do an exercise, we abandon everything. In category design you get taught to what's called reject the premise, so I reject everything about the way that it is, all of it. You and I now envision this future five years out and everything's gone incredibly, it's exceeded our expectations. We make that true in our minds. We write out, we brainstorm out \"What's it going to be like? What kind of technology are we selling? What are we doing for customers? How big's our company? How many people will hire?\" Da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da. Then we say, \"Okay, standing in that future, five years out, looking back to the present, what did we do to make this different future happen?\" That's category design. That's how you unshackle yourself from the past. See, one of the biggest disservices in our industry is this word disrupt. \"Oh, [inaudible 01:05:26] we're going to go disrupt the engineering industry.\" Nah. Well, if you're disrupting something, by definition, your reference point is the something. And when your reference point is an existing thing, your reference point is the past. If we want to be able to think in unconstrained ways about a radically different future, the more we drag the past forward, the worse off we are. What reject the premise teaches us is let's forget everything we know and start fresh. My friend, a legendary designer, John Bielenberg, does this course on innovation and design with kids in university. He does this multi-week exercise and the objective of the exercise, Lenny, is design a bicycle. That's the objective. And there's only one design point. It cannot be rideable.\n\n(01:06:25):\nAnd the reason John makes him do that, his philosophy, he calls it thinking wrong. That's his version, if you will, of reject the premise. The reason for it is when you take away the premise, it must be rideable, you open up the aperture for legendary new thinking, radically different possibilities, radically different futures. This is the mistake that many, many entrepreneurs make, is whether they realize it or not, what they're doing is incremental better and they're fighting for market share, fighting for existing demand with something that's incrementally better. And the reality is that's why most entrepreneurs fail. Now, you could fail doing it exponentially different, it sounds medically insane to say \"What you want is a zero billion dollars market.\" However, as crazy as it sounds, it's the only thing that leads to meaningful success. And the proof is in the data.\n\nLenny (01:07:34):\nYeah. You talk about this in your writing, that on the surface it feels very hard and expensive to design a category, build a category, convince everyone this is a new problem. But your point is there's no other option really if you want to build a large business. Is that right?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:07:49):\nCorrect. And the other thing is people say, \"Oh, it's really expensive and it takes an amount of time.\" As compared to what? You've lived a lot of your life in the product world, yes? As have I. Well, if you ask smart VCs, if you ask Brian Roberts at Venrock, the number one healthcare tech investor in the world, I believe he says it's eight to 10 years for a product to really have some maturity and be really stable. And I don't know whether he's right or not, but he's a super smart guy. We know how long does it take to create a legendary culture, how long does it take to get a legendary innovative business model to really hum. \"Ah, it's mainly hard.\" Well, so is building a product, so is building a company, so is raising VC, so is doing sales, so is doing marketing, so is doing HR. If you want to be easy, go work at the fucking DMV. That's point A.\n\n(01:08:53):\nPoint B is the reality, Lenny, when you look at it, the vast majority of innovation comes from startups. People say, \"Only big companies can do this.\" Listen, my collaborator partner Eddie Yoon, is the Obiwan Kenobi of category design in the Global 2000 Arena and particularly on the consumer side. And he will tell you that most of these major companies... And he's worked for, you name a big food company, you name a big beverage company, he's worked for many of them. They fail miserably. The reality is six people with a small investment from a rich uncle can stand something up that has the potential to be worth $3 trillion dollars. That's what Apple is.\n\n(01:09:52):\nAnd I sat there with Don Valentine and asked him about why he signed the check to Steve and Steve, and he said it was the stupidest use case he ever saw. The use case was a stay-at-home mom, keeping track of her recipes on the Apple personal computer. This is the stupidest use case ever. However, Don could see the potential in the category and in the guy's willingness to go get after it. And so for a VC, if you're going to raise money, the VCs who invest in early stage mass potential companies are the ones who see your different future.\n\nLenny (01:10:40):\nAlong those lines, I had this note that you had this quote around product market fit and it's this hot take that product market fit is a very dangerous idea. I'd love for you to speak to that, because I think most people are in the opposite camp that it's the only thing that matters. Why do you think it's such a dangerous idea?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:11:01):\nThere's a bunch of these product myths. Product led growth is another one, but let's go to product market fit. And God bless Mark Andreessen, he's the guy that framed it. And Kevin just wrote a really super thoughtful piece on why it's backwards, and I'm happy to send that to you if you want. Kevin Maney, genius. Here's the aha, again, category design principles. Listen to the words, product, market, fit. Product market fit. Now, let's think, what there is for me to do is find a way to fit my product into a market.\n\n(01:11:48):\nPretty simple way to determine or to distill product market fit. And what product market fit has come to mean is, we're a brew pub, you and I want to start a craft beer place like everybody else on the West Coast, and we're going to make a bunch of samples and shit, and we're going to feed those samples to our friends and to our ideal customer profile that I learned from Lenny. And if enough people amongst my friend group and my ideal customer group say, \"That's a yummy IPA, I like it,\" then we're going to build it. And then if people start buying that IPA, we have, and these are the words people use, \"achieved product market fit.\"\n\n(01:12:43):\nOkay, well, Threads achieved product market fit faster than any product in the history of the world. Here's the aha, categories make products not the other way around. What you want is you want to design a market category for your product, not fit your product into a market category. And the problem is, our industry, like many others, but the tech industry, is full of product bigots, because they really, really, really, really, really believe, like they believe in the availability of oxygen, the best product wins. They really believe it. And they believe what marketing's job is, \"Could you put a demo on our website and get a demo? Can we get a viral video that's a demo? Because once people see how much better, faster, cheaper, smaller, bigger, whatever our thing is, they're going to buy it,\" and they don't. What they buy is a new insight around a problem/opportunity that requires a different solution. That's what they buy. Here's another simple example. This is the one I hear right now a lot, \"What we need now the story, we need a story brand. The number one thing you can do in marketing as a startup founder is to share your startup founder journey. Share your journey.\" This is all the shit we're hearing. We've been hearing this for a while. Well, guess what? No one gives a fuck about your journey. They really don't. You know what they care about? Themselves. Their problems, their needs, their opportunities. For our book, Snow Leopard, we did the first ever comprehensive data science research ever done using Nielsen data to study nonfiction books. And we know that because what Nielsen told us, and we had to sign an NDA that would choke a horse in terms of what we can say and can't say about the data. But one of the things we wanted to understand is what categories of business books sold and which categories didn't and why. We can get into all that if you want, but here's the aha. Guess what the number one category of business books, nonfiction books is by a mile.\n\nLenny (01:15:13):\nOh my god. Sales? Marketing, marketing-sales. No.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:15:19):\nPersonal growth.\n\nLenny (01:15:20):\nOkay, that makes sense. Self-help.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:15:22):\nSelf-help. And number two, personal finance. Biographies are way down on the list. The point being, no one cares about our product. No one cares that it's 25 mega flips faster, cheaper, whatever, they don't care. You know what they care about? Them, their needs, their wants, their problems. And categories are about customers and their wants, needs, problems and opportunities. Branding and marketing is about our product. And the greatest innovators in the world don't stop at innovating a product or technology. They design a new innovative market category where they standalone.\n\nLenny (01:16:12):\nWe're definitely going along, which I expected. And we've actually gone through most of the questions I had, but I have just a few more to close out the conversation. One is positioning. That's something you hear a lot about. How do you think about positioning versus categorying? Are they essentially the same thing? Is positioning just a way to phrase and describe your category? How should people think about that?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:16:32):\nWhat positioning today has become is essentially how do I tell a story about my shit in a unique way, in a compelling way? That's really what people mean when they say positioning. The parts they never stop to consider, again, listen to the words positioning as it relates to what? Because you, again, listen to the words and fucking think, \"You position against competitors.\" How do we position against the competitors? That's a phrase people use. The question is, what are you positioning against? And the answer to that question almost all of the time is competition. If you're doing positioning in that context, you just decided you're fighting for 24% of the demand designed by somebody else. And we think in the tech space where one company earns two thirds of the economics, if that's your starting point, you fuck yourself from the start. To put it simply, positioning in the modern context is for losers. That is to say people who are fighting over the 24%. That's positioning.\n\nLenny (01:18:15):\nI love it. Getting spicy over here.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:18:17):\nWell, it's factually correct. People go, \"Oh, [inaudible 01:18:21].\" Okay, so you mean to tell me that in tech one company doesn't take two thirds of the economics? Okay, believe that. And you can believe gravity doesn't exist. It does, but you can believe that Bigfoots are installing misters on 5G towers to make us all sick, if you want. You can believe anything you want, it doesn't make it true. What's true is one company wins and everybody else gets fucked. That's what's true. Look at any space you want. You want to go back to your list? We can go through the list. Positioning has become sort of category design for the cowards. It's like, \"Well, I know that we could really be as radical as to create our own space, so let's just see if we can carve off our little niche over here.\" Okay, great.\n\nLenny (01:19:20):\nA big part of positioning, just to expand on this a little bit, is differentiation. Differentiating yourself. People always talk about the importance of differentiation. Do you see that as the same potential pitfall, or how do you think about differentiation?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:19:34):\nOkay, this is really, really powerful. In category design, we don't compete, period, full stop at the brand to brand or product to product level. Category designers do compete, but not against a product, not against a company, not against a brand. Category designers compete against the status quo. Let me be specific. There's a category called cycling. You look like you might be a biker, Lenny, are you?\n\nLenny (01:20:09):\nVery casually, mostly an e-bike.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:20:13):\nThose are really fun.\n\nLenny (01:20:14):\nThey're so fun. Mountain bike. Yeah.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:20:16):\nBut you've been on a mountain bike. You've been on a road bike, you've gone out with friends, done this, right?\n\nLenny (01:20:20):\nYeah.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:20:21):\nAnybody who bikes on any kind of regular basis has been in an accident. And if you bike on a real regular basis, you've been in an accident with a vehicle that was not caused by you. That's true for every person I know that rides a bike on any regular basis, myself included. All of a sudden a new category shows up, and that new category is called indoor biking classes. And the category designer is a company called spinning.\n\n(01:20:53):\nAnd they say, \"Hey, biking's great. It's an incredible source of exercise, but you don't want to get killed doing it, so come take a class.\" And what they're doing when they do that, they're competing category to category, not brand or product to brand. And that's a strategy that's called damming the demand. What does a dam do? There's a bunch of water running in the direction, a dam takes that water, stops it and moves it, does something to it. Interrupts it and changes it. Here's what spinning does. They say, \"Why risk your life on a bike when you can take a wonderful class and not have to worry about it and get your exercise?\" What dam the demand, Lenny, is you thought you wanted this, but what you really need is that.\n\n(01:21:52):\nThen what happens? The next iteration in that space comes from Peloton. Again, when Peloton launches, they don't say, \"Hey, our bikes are better than spinning bikes. Our bikes are 12 mega flips, faster, cheaper.\" They don't do any of that shit. They don't shit on spinning, they don't attack spinning, they don't attack road biking, they don't do any of that stuff. They say, \"Why drive to the gym when you could do it at home?\" They dam the demand for spinning, they don't compete against it. And they reframe the problem called \"How do I get a great workout in a group environment without getting killed?\" And they achieve that massive success.\n\n(01:22:41):\nAnd I can give you many other examples. The mistake is competing directly product to product. The enemy is the status quo. That is to say the way it is now. If you go back to Lomi, the enemy, the way it is now, the status quo, is a nasty garbage in your kitchen that stinks and smells and gets all over the floor that you have to drag to the green bin and then the squirrels and the fucking raccoons eat it. That's the personal upset. And the environmental one is, we're destroying the planet. No, by the way, rather than destroy the planet, why not create this super awesome compost dirt? In category design, we call that a from to a Frodo. Category designers are leading the world from the way it is to a new and different way. They're not saying, \"My carbide ingulator is better than their carbide ingulator.\"\n\n(01:23:32):\nHere's a simple example. This is another reason the word disrupt doesn't work. Les Paul is the innovator of the electric guitar. Today most guitar players have an electric guitar and an acoustic guitar. Matter of fact, most guitar players have more than one, very few guitar players, some, but very few said, \"Oh, now that the electric guitar is invented, fuck the acoustic guitar.\" Very, very rare. The net new category called electric...\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:24:00):\nSo the net new category called electric guitar as opposed to the prior category, acoustic guitar, actually increases the overall guitar TAM. Doesn't disrupt shit. So in that case, you're actually creating net new demand. In the Peloton example, you're both creating that new demand and you're getting your start. And this is where I think a lot of the discussion that you have and a lot of your work, Lenny, around growth, is really powerful, because what's really going on when growth works is effective digital damning of demand. That's what's really going on, when it works.\n\nLenny (01:24:41):\nI think somewhere maybe wrote this, \"Damn the TAM\" is an awesome phrase. If you haven't, you should use that. Damning the TAM, increasing the TAM. So you have a number of books you put out. I'm going to link to all these. Play Bigger, I think, was your first, Niche Down is the other. And your newest book, I believe is your newest book, is the 22 Laws of Category Design. So maybe just as a last question, can you just share a few of these laws, maybe two or three of your favorite laws from the book just to give people a sense of the book?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:25:09):\nI think we talked about law number one, which, in a lot of ways, is probably the most important. Another one to think about is something we call the magic triangle, which we've touched on, but maybe not explicitly, which is, in order to build a legendary company, you've got to get product, company, and category right at the right time. And so some people hear the category design discussion and they think it's somehow pejorative to product as if product doesn't matter. The reason for category design is because we love the products. Products fail because they don't get category designed. So I think the aha of the magic triangle is product, company, and category are equal in importance, and so getting that right I think is very powerful.\n\n(01:26:05):\nI'm just riffing off the top of my head. I don't have it in front of me. Another example is lightning strikes versus peanut butter. So what most marketers do is they take their marketing budget for the year, they quarterize it, and maybe there's slight variance in the quarters, but essentially it's a similar amount of spend. And they do campaigns. And they do \"keep the lights on\" and maybe they launch a product and maybe they have a big push around the product. And they're trying to drive the funnel and they're trying to deliver sales or deliver leads, B2B, doesn't matter. And that's what they do. And what they don't realize, Lenny, is that approach, that peanut butter approach, is predicated on almost 100-year-old mental scaffolding and marketing called reach and frequency. And what reach and frequency was about, which was, I want to get my shit in front of the most amount of people the most often possible.\n\n(01:27:07):\nAnd if you listen to a lot of the shysters and hustle porn stars, the Gary VDs, and this is of the world, \"You got to release 400 pieces of content today on every platform.\" All this stupidity. That's just a reswizzle of reach and frequency from over 50 years ago in the new medium. Well, it turns out reach and frequency doesn't work. Because the number of marketing messages we get is massive, they're experts who say we get up to 60,000 a day, whether it's logos on coffee cups or ads on the internet and everything in between. And so it's virtually impossible to stand out in a reach and frequency mode. Now I'm not saying you shouldn't be doing keep the lights on marketing. Of course you need to do keep the lights on marketing. But, here's what the lightning strike model and category design teaches us. I'd rather matter for one week a year than be irrelevant for the rest of the year.\n\n(01:28:07):\nAnd so what we did, candidly Lenny, was we ripped off Hollywood's model for launching movies. We said, \"What if you did that as a software company? What if you launched a thing, be it a product or something else, the way Hollywood launches a movie?\" And so what a lightning strike is about is getting very, very clear, if you go back to your ICP thing, \"Who's our ideal customer? Where is that customer? Where does she hang out?\" Ideally, in the digital world first. One of your recent episodes, I was listening to the Growth Hacker Gala, how she went on to Reddit and stuff. That's a well-known strategy and I love that strategy. Go hang out where they are, put something provocative and engaging in front of them, and matter in that moment. So the idea of a lightning strike is, if you are in our target audience for that day or that two days, we are going to be all over you.\n\n(01:29:09):\nWe're going to be undeniable. And so we put a disproportionate amount of our effort, if we're in B2B, probably one to two lightning strikes a year. If we're in B2C, two to three. One a quarter if you're a really big company. It's hard to pull off one a quarter if you're a smaller company. And much more than that, if not a lightning strike, it starts to blur back into peanut butter. But, that is a very powerful concept. On the execution side for marketers, that's different. The other thing I'd say and probably should have started here, so I'm a three-time public company CMO. I've advised over 50 venture-backed companies in category design and marketing. Guess what I've never seen in a marketing plan ever?\n\nLenny (01:29:59):\nWhat's that?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:30:00):\nWord of mouth. This boggles our minds, those of us in category design, because WOM is was and always will be the most powerful form of marketing. And in the native digital world, WOM can spread in a way that was never possible on the analog world for all the reasons we all understand. So if you take the concept of a lightning strike, then you take the concept of a category point of view that is all about frame naming and claiming a problem. And then there's one other concept I'll introduce.\n\n(01:30:32):\nIt sits next to your ideal customer profile. It's what in category design we call super consumers. So it turns out that in most categories, roughly eight to 10% of the buyers are responsible for the vast majority of the profits. And more importantly, they are the zeitgeist. They are the thought leaders in the industry. They are the customers, the users, the purveyors of whatever the thing is that others look up to as being the ones to admire, the ones to aspire to, the best practices, et cetera, et cetera. That's a super consumer. Okay. So in category design, when you understand who your supers are, i.e. your ideal customer profile, you understand where they are primarily in the native digital world, how do we go hang out? And remind me what that gal's name was? I thought she was awesome.\n\nLenny (01:31:23):\nMeltem. Meltem Kuran Berkowitz.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:31:23):\nMelson?\n\nLenny (01:31:26):\nMeltem. M-E-L-T-E-M.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:31:29):\nWhat a name. That's a great name. Anyway, I thought Meltem was awesome. She's absolutely on point. So we know who our ideal customer, aka super consumers are. We know where they hang out in the native digital world. We have a radically compelling different point of view about framing, claiming, and naming a problem that, if we do effectively, we'll resonate with them. That's why we spend time crafting that POV. So we evangelize the problem. We participate in a native digital community where they already are. And we do it from the perspective of not a marketer, not a seller, an educator. We're teaching people about a new and different way to think about an existing problem or a problem they hadn't thought of, that when they have an aha moment, because we articulate it well with our point of view, they go, \"Oh, tell me more about that problem.\"\n\n(01:32:21):\nRight? As they do that, we take an education standpoint, mental framework to it. We open them up, we participate, and sooner or later somebody says, \"Huh, tell me again what you do.\" And bam, away that we go. And here's the aha. When you understand supers, you understand the targeting, you understand a radically different point of view, reframing the problem, presenting a radically different solution. Well guess what? It's the ultimate growth engine. And you can grow for a very small amount of money. You could send email to 300 people and drive a breakthrough in sales.\n\n(01:33:05):\nWhy? Because when you take this approach, you're not just driving near-term revenue, very, very important, you are driving WOM. A big part of why you want to have a point of view that can be articulated very quickly is marketing's job is to put the right words in the right mouths and to get that WOM to scale. And so when we have a category POV, that's about them, not us. Remember, brands are about us. Categories are about customers. We care about what they care about. And so when you have a powerful category POV, that drives WOM. And then when you do that in the native digital world, you get a tremendous amount of uplift from native digital viral WOM. And category design is the only business strategy whose primary execution focus starts with WOM.\n\nLenny (01:34:06):\nWhat an awesome way to wrap up our conversation. It's basically a very tight go-to-market strategy is what you just shared. For folks that want to dig further, I'll just share a few of the places they could learn more. And then Neil, at the end, I'll ask you where to point people. But, you have an awesome Substack category, pirates. That's substack.com. You have your books, which I think maybe the best way to, I guess you tell me, is to find them as go to your last name. com, lochhead.com, L-O-C-H-head.com. Is that right?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:34:34):\nYeah. And of course you can go to category pirates.com.\n\nLenny (01:34:36):\nOkay. Even easier. Amazing. So we have the lightning round coming up. Is there anything else you want to share as closing words or advice before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:34:47):\nYes, I do.\n\nLenny (01:34:48):\nOkay. Let's do it.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:34:51):\nSo I'm 55 years old, Lenny. I started my first company when I was 18. I got thrown out of school. I don't have a GED. And I've been in the tech industry the whole time. And the first thing I would share is anything's possible. Don't listen to anybody who shits on you. I've a chat on as much as you could possibly imagine. I have four or five different learning differences. ADHD, dyslexia, dyscalculia, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I was told I couldn't read. I was certainly told I couldn't write. I've written 14 number one fucking bestsellers, et cetera, et cetera. And so my point is, if you are somebody for whom you want to spend your professional time working on the exponential different as opposed to the incremental better, which I got to believe is a meaningful percentage of the people who consume your shit, if you want to work on the incremental better, incremental better is important.\n\n(01:35:52):\nI want the Boeing engineers working on the incremental better. I don't want the air traffic control system that's the exponential different. No. And a lot of incremental improvement over time can be exponential. So if you're a product manager and you're running a highly successful product with a massive install base, and you're looking at your next rev, and you're trying to figure out of the 472 features that you could build. What are the 26 that really matter? And you want to go talk to your customers to find out what those incremental improvements are and to stack rank them into all that good. PRD, MRD, IUD, all that shit. There's a big place in the world for all of that. It's incredibly important. That's not category design. So with that said, I think, Lenny, we are at the greatest time in history for our industry.\n\n(01:36:48):\nI think all the indicators show that the amount of innovation that is going to happen in the next five years will eclipse the amount of innovation that happened in the last 20 years. It's accelerating. AI is insanely exciting, dangerous, concerning. Do we need to focus on the downside? Do we need to be smart? Do we need to be thoughtful? Do we need to learn? Do we need to work with regulators and legislators? Absolutely. Could it go horribly? Oh, sure. But, that's always true. AI feels a little bit different, but it's always true. And for the record, the Luddites are always wrong. The point being now is the greatest time in history to be a creator, to be an entrepreneur, to be a marketer. I've been a marketer for my entire adult life. It's never been greater than it is right now. And so here's the big thing that I would share.\n\n(01:37:43):\nIf you are somebody for whom you want to make an exponential difference, you want to innovate, you want to create new value where there wasn't, you want to have a legendary career where you can look back on your career and go, \"You know what? I was part of this and that. And I was on this team.\" Now is the greatest time in history. And what I would say to you is the future needs you. Most people are not working on the exponential different.\n\n(01:38:14):\nAnd so the future of our world requires that the innovative people, that the entrepreneurial people stand up, take advantage of these incredible technologies. And a lot of people, particularly in my age group, Lenny, shit on millennials, Gen Z, what are lovingly referred to as native digitals. Absolutely not. I'm inspired by them. And I think the next generation of our entrepreneurs will be our greatest generation of entrepreneurs. So my point is, now's the time. The future needs you. Don't listen to any of the bullshit. I don't care what the boo birds say. Absolutely, go for it because there's never been a greater time to design and dominate new categories of innovation than right now.\n\nLenny (01:39:02):\nI love that message. You're just passion and energy for creating and inspiring comes through really clearly in all your writing. And so I love hearing it in person. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. What are two or three books you've recommended most to other people?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:39:22):\nRichard Bach, Illusions. And then in terms of business books, I'll share with you one, because I know people recommend all the same shit. I'll share with you one that I think it may still be in print, but if not, it's easy to get. Mark McCormack's What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School. So on the personal side, Richard Bach, Illusions. And for one that you may not have heard of Mark McCormack, What They Don't Teach You At The Harvard Business School.\n\nLenny (01:39:55):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:39:59):\nOh, right now we're watching Designing Anna or Inventing Anna or whatever that's called. So that's been fascinating to watch. I think it's been incredibly well done.\n\nLenny (01:40:10):\nWhat a wild story, that one. What is a favorite interview question you like to ask candidates when you're hiring people?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:40:18):\nSo there's actually two. And I'll start with the second most important interview question, which I think is the most important question. But in a job interview setting, for me it's the second most important. And that is, it there anything else? And you know this as a podcaster. I end every single one of my podcasts with, is there anything else? And the interesting thing about that question, you can spend three hours with somebody talking about very important shit. You can think you got all the detail. You could have asked all the questions about the technical architecture and the campaign and the distribution and I don't know what.\n\n(01:40:56):\nAnd at the very end you say, \"Hey, Susan, before we wrap, is there anything else?\" And often, Lenny, the most important thing for that person to communicate comes out then. It happens so often, it's bizarre. I use that in medical situations. Family member is in the hospital going for an operation. \"Okay, doc, tell me.\" I tell you all the shit. Is there anything else? I will tell you that eight times out of 10, the most important thing about the surgery with your loved one will come after that question. I will even use it during a conversation as we transition from various different points.\n\n(01:41:37):\nSo in an interview situation, maybe you're asking somebody about their background. You might say, \"Well, is there anything else about your background you think I should know?\" It's the most powerful open question. But in an job interview situation, it's my second favorite. My first favorite is, so Lenny, are you legendary?\n\nLenny (01:42:01):\nYou want me to answer that?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:42:03):\nYou can if you like or not.\n\nLenny (01:42:05):\nNo.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:42:06):\nBut, the answer to that question...\n\nLenny (01:42:08):\nWhat are you looking for?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:42:09):\n... Is always radically illustrative. I'm not looking for anything. I'm looking for your answer. Some people will say, \"Yes.\" And they'll tell you why. Some people will say, \"Well, that's a big word.\" Whatever they're going to say. But, it is a purposely provocative question with one of, I think, the most powerful words in the English language, because I want to get a read on that person and how they respond to a purposely provocative question about themselves.\n\nLenny (01:42:42):\nAmazing. Okay, just a couple more questions. What's a favorite life motto that you like to repeat yourself or share with other people?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:42:50):\nIf you're lucky enough to make it to the top of a mountain, throw down a fucking rope. And for me on that, Lenny, I'm somebody who has had and continues to have a radical amount of love and support in my life. When I was young, I started with nothing and I got thrown out of school. And I didn't know until I was 21 because when I was young, learning differences weren't a thing. And by the way, the way most of the world and education system deals with learning differences is completely fucked. But, that's a different conversation. It's definitely improved, but it is nowhere near what it needs to be. And so I just think that we should never be held back by those views of others. And so we need to be unencumbered.\n\nLenny (01:43:42):\nI love it. Final question. It's a dumb question. Maybe to lead to something fun. You're a category pirate. Do you have a favorite real pirate?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:43:51):\nI have actually a lot of favorite pirates. I'll tell you about one of them. His name is Tony Etherington, but virtually nobody calls him Tony. Virtually everybody calls him Doris. And Doris is a legendary surfer and surf explorer from the Gold Coast of Australia. And I went on my first ever boat tour, surf adventure in Indonesia with Tony.\n\nLenny (01:44:22):\nYou make this giggle.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:44:30):\nThere's a horrible story I'm thinking of telling you. Anyway, you haven't been with a real pirate until you've been in stormy seas at night with Doris smoking cigarettes, drinking Jack Daniels in the bridge thinking maybe we're going to die, but this guy's probably not going to let that happen. And so Doris Etherington would be one of my top pirates of all time. And he's got the voice. And he's got the attitude. When I was having problems surfing, he would say to me, \"All right, sit you down mate.\" Always smoking a cigarette. He's like, \"I'd smoke long if we could have ciggyed up now.\" He goes, \"You paddle out, wait for the biggest wave, lean into it, and get right up on it.\"\n\n(01:45:21):\nAnd so in our world, get right up on it is has become an expression for go for it. So I think we can all heed the words of Doris and get right up on it.\n\nLenny (01:45:36):\nI love that this question led to something fun and interesting. Chris, thank you so much for being here. This conversation was entertaining, insightful, spicy, fun, funny, everything I hoped it would be. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and keep reading? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:45:54):\nProbably categorypirates.com is the simplest spot to go. And how listeners can be useful to me?\n\nLenny (01:46:03):\nYeah.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:46:04):\nIt's what we talked about a moment ago. The future needs you. And the future needs the people who have the courage to make a difference, because the people who are different are the ones who have made the biggest difference. Every time. And we live in a world where we are rewarded for our sameness, for fitting in. Our education system teaches us what we're trying to do is find our place in the world. And listen, some of us do. I know people who wanted to be a vet from the time they were kids, and that's the path they chose. And they became vets. And they love it. And they're wonderful people. And they have great careers. And they make a giant difference. And they've always known. And fucking a. And so if you are somebody for whom you have found your place in the world, congratulations. That's awesome. And we also know, particularly in the innovator, entrepreneur, creator, marketer world, many of us, there was no place.\n\n(01:47:13):\nAnd so my hope is that you either find your place or if you realize there's no place for you, that you further realize that you can make your place in the world. And fundamentally, that's what category design is about. It's about making a distinct, unique place in the world for yourself, for your product, and for your company. Because the people who are different make the biggest difference. And so the great thing that people can do for me is to go into the world and make a different place for themself in a way that delivers massive value to others.\n\nLenny (01:48:00):\nBeautiful. Chris, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nChristopher Lochhead (01:48:04):\nLenny, bless you. I love all things, Lenny. Thank you.\n\nLenny (01:48:07):\nThanks Chris. Bye everyone.\n\n(01:48:11):\nThank you so much for listening.
