We don't take time to sit and digest it, but it's still coming in and getting logged, and so even as a non-designer, I think you can look at examples of logos where something's not quite right and be like, \"Something's not right here, I just don't know how to name it.\" But I think a good exercise is just like looking at fonts that are available in the world and asking yourself, \"What feeling does this give me?\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:47):\nToday, my guest is Jessica Hische. Jessica is a design legend, and it was such an honor to both have her on this podcast and also to work with her on a refresh of my newsletter and podcast logo and brand, which is launching around the same time as this episode comes out. Jessica is a lettering artist specializing in typographical work for logos, film, books, and other commercial applications. Her clients include Wes Anderson, the United States Postal Service, Apple, Nike, Tiffany and Company, The Gap, and Penguin Books, and her work has been featured in design and illustration annals, both in the U.S. and internationally. She's helped create logos for Philz Coffee, Eventbrite, and Mailchimp, is a best-selling children's book author, and if you live around the Bay Area, you've seen her work all over the city without knowing it. In our conversation, Jessica shares the process that she went through to update my logo and brand for my newsletter and podcast.\n\n(00:01:38):\nWhat specific elements of a logo and brand impact how you feel about that brand, why a good enough logo is just buying for a long time for most startups, and when it makes sense to refresh your look, also some really clever productivity tips, design advice, and a bunch of really fun stories. Jessica is a master at what she does and I am excited to spread the Jessica Hische gospel.

Welcome to the podcast.\n\nJessica Hische (00:02:19):\nHappy to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:21):\nI thought it'd be good to start with asking you just to describe what it is you do, because you're very atypical of the kinds of guests I have in this podcast and you also have very unique skillset.\n\nJessica Hische (00:02:32):\nYes. Well, I will describe what I'm most prominently known for, because I'm a person who just does a lot of things, but the thing that I do the most professionally is custom typography, like bespoke lettering pieces. That translates to working for all kinds of things. Sometimes it's for film and television. I've done movie titles and things like that and television credits and stuff. Sometimes it's book covers. Actually, a lot of times, it's book covers, and then a big part of my business is doing logos, and logo refreshes, and things like that, so basically being the person who knows all the things so you don't have to have that person on staff when it comes to typography.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:03:17):\nThis episode is brought to you by the Enterprise Ready Conference, a one-day event in San Francisco bringing together product and engineering leaders shaping the future of enterprise SaaS. The event features a curated list of speakers with direct experience building for the enterprise, including leaders from OpenAI, Vanta, Checkr, Dropbox, and Canva. Topics include advanced identity management, compliance, encryption, and logging, essentially at complex features that most enterprise customers require. If you're a founder, exec, product manager, or engineer tasked with the enterprise roadmap, this conference is for you. You'll get detailed insights from industry leaders that have years of experience navigating the same challenges that you face today. Best of all, it's completely free. Since it's hosted by WorkOS. Spots are filling up quickly, make sure to request an invite at enterpriseready.com. That's enterpriseready.com. I am excited to chat with Christina Gilbert, the founder of OneSchema, one of our longtime podcast sponsors. Hi, Christina.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:04:21):\nYes. Thank you for having me on, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:23):\nWhat is the latest with OneSchema? I know you now work with some of my favorite companies like Ramp, Vanta Scale, and Watershed. I heard that you just launched a new product to help product teams import CSVs from especially tricky systems like ERPs.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:04:39):\nYes. We just launched OneSchema FileFeeds, which allows you to build an integration with any system in 15 minutes as long as you can export a CSV to an SFTP folder. We see our customers all the time getting stuck with hacks and workarounds, and the product teams that we work with don't have to turn down prospects because their systems are too hard to integrate with. We allow our customers to offer thousands of integrations without involving their engineering team at all.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:01):\nI can tell you that if my team had to build integrations like this, how nice would it be to be able to take this off my roadmap and instead use something like OneSchema, and not just to build it but also to maintain it forever.\n\nChristina Gilbert (00:05:12):\nAbsolutely, Lenny. We've heard so many horror stories of multiday outages from even just a handful of ad records. We are laser-focused on integration reliability to help teams end all of those distractions that come up with integrations. We have a built-in validation layer that stops any bad data from entering your system, and OneSchema will notify your team immediately of any data that looks incorrect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:32):\nI know that importing incorrect data can cause all kinds of pain for your customers and quickly lose their trust. Christina, thank you for joining us. If you want to learn more, head on over to oneschema.co. That's oneschema.co.\n\n(00:05:47):\nPart of the reason I was excited to have you on this podcast is that I was lucky enough to get to work with you on a refresh of my logo and brand for my newsletter and my podcast, which I'm very, very excited about. It's actually going to be launching right around the time of this episode going live, so this is, in part, a celebration of the new look, and logo, and brand. I thought it'd be an awesome excuse to bring you on the podcast and give an inside glimpse into the process of updating a logo and a brand. Partly, because I think it'll just be people are like, \"What the hell? How did this change? Where did this come from? Why this versus that?\" and also just for people that are thinking about this for their own product or business, to understand the process and understand when it might be right for them, when it might be not right for them. Broadly, how does that sound?\n\nJessica Hische (00:06:32):\nSure. Yeah, of course. Everybody that starts a company knows that they need a logo. That is a big thing. Some people start a company and think the logo is going to drive the culture of the company, which I don't think that that is true. I think that the product itself, and the team you build, and the people you put together are the thing that should be driving things forward, but I do think the logo and the brand assets can generate a lot of both internal and external excitement and just tell people what to expect from the thing that they're about to engage with. Some people say don't judge a book by its cover. I'm the opposite, where any book... The cover of the book should be giving you incredible insight into what is on the interior of the book and setting the tone and setting the vibe so that when you open the book and read the book, it's a symbiotic thing where you're like, \"Oh, I understand what I was getting into. This got me excited about starting it,\" and whatever. It keeps that ball rolling.\n\n(00:07:34):\nBut with the refresh work that I do, a lot of people start companies and they have a certain amount of money. If they're bootstrapping it, they have less. If they get venture money, they have a little bit more. But what they don't want to do is spend venture money on a massive brand exploration when you're still in the hiring process, you're still trying to get early stage engineers, and all that kind of stuff, and so I am sort of a weird contrarian in this way in the brand world where brand people are like, \"Brand is everything. You need to take a significant investment in brand because that guides the vision of the product or whatever.\" But I think being a bit more of an insider within the tech world, I understand that sometimes people start companies and have an intention to do something.\n\n(00:08:24):\nWhile they're doing that, they're building the team, they're doing cool stuff, but then the company has to pivot for one reason or another, whether a competitor immediately comes out with a thing that you're doing or the technology that you're doing gets postponed, whatever's going to feed into it, and so if you invest super heavily on the whole brand vision from the jump, sometimes it's like throwing away money if you have to pivot. What I love about the work that I do is that I understand that a lot of people have to just have something to put on decks and have something to put on a holding page or whatever, and internal teams are totally capable of doing that early work. But then if it does become successful, you don't want to get locked into whatever it is that you had to throw together before an investor meeting or something.\n\n(00:09:15):\nI come in then to take the existing vibe and smooth it out, address any of the concerns that came up. A lot of times, it's really utilitarian stuff like this doesn't scale well, or this thing falls apart in this context, or we never had a good avatar version of it, or whatever. Sometimes it's really specific utilitarian fixes, and sometimes it's just about growing it up and sophisticated it without losing what was there in the first place that people got excited about.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:46):\nTo give people maybe a couple more tactical piece of advice here, what's a sign that it's maybe time to do something with your logo and brand from you took a first pass, it's good enough, your wife made one, your husband made you a logo, it's like, \"Well, this is great. Let's just go with this\"? What's a sign that maybe it's time to, \"Okay, we should actually at least uplevel this, not necessarily hire studio but takes something to make it better\"?\n\nJessica Hische (00:10:10):\nWell, one of the things is if, suddenly, you're starting to deal with the greater rollout of the look and feel of the brand. If you, at first, just basically had a really beta website and small version of the app but you're about to do a new one that kind of updates and expands it, that could be a really good time to roll it out. One of the things that a lot of people do when they're starting a company is that they'll make a logo with a font that is really popular or widely available or free. If you are about to, let's say, print a bunch of swag for new hires, or you're hosting a conference, or whatever is that event where suddenly you're going to physically invest money in making stuff with your brand on it, that might be a good time to do it.\n\n(00:11:03):\nOne of the reasons why I tell people why having a custom logo or custom typography can really matter is that if you're using something that's available to everyone, the chances of someone else coming in and copying you are very easy and high. You might be one of these lucky companies that just out the gate is outrageously successful, but with success comes people climbing up behind you trying to copy your success. If that success is very easily copyable and people will try to trick your customers into coming their way by repeating the things that you're doing, including the branding, one way to avoid that is by doing something that's more customized when it comes to the logo and brand.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:11:47):\nLet's actually talk about the work that you put into updating my logo and brand. From that, we can spin off into lessons and insights that you have along these lines. Overall, just high level, what's the process you go through to go through a logo refresh?\n\nJessica Hische (00:12:01):\nSure, of course. Super high level, it's figuring out what the goals are. Some people have a goal where they want their customers to not notice it at all. They're like, \"Oh, everybody loves this, but I, the person with a design eye, can see all the problems with it. I need to roll something out that fixes the problems that I see but that no one else really notices.\" If that's one approach to it, which is a very close in refresh where we're just trying out little things to make it feel custom or fixing things that have come up when stress-tested, whether it looks crazy when you scale it and looks like horsey and heavy-handed when you scale it too big or when you scale it too small, you lose a lot of legibility and stuff like that. That's what would be a really close in exploration.\n\n(00:12:53):\nFor other people, they might have bigger goals where they're about to pivot the company to try to attract a different audience or things like that. They might have this really cool and successful group of people that are super users but they're trying to expand it, so then it's about, \"What can we do to shift the vibe to make it include these new people without excluding our core folks?\" My first round is figuring out what that scope is, how experimental, how broad are we going to go for that first round, because then everything else cascades from there. If we go really broad for the first round, then we're in this process of narrowing down the scope as we go down. Whereas if we go really close in for the first round, we're already just talking about really technical stuff.\n\n(00:13:45):\nThis is another thing that is a little bit unique to me that not everybody else does, but I will hand off files to clients to try in situ really early on if what we're trying to do is solve utilitarian issues. Most other people are like, \"No, you don't get the files until we do the final because I don't want you to run away with this or whatever.\" There has to be some trust with it. Yeah, figure out what we're trying to accomplish and always keep those goals in mind, and then scope out the process based on what those goals are. For each round, we're addressing different things. First round might be about just capturing the overall look and trying things as broad as we can, and then the next round is, \"Okay. Well, now we have generally a look that we want, but is it the right weight? Is it the right letter height? Do we have enough details?\" That kind of thing, and then we get narrower and nerdier as we go along in the process.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:14:45):\nAwesome. In the experience of my podcast logo, I was an ass. At the end of it, I'm like, \"No, this isn't right,\" because we narrowed, narrowed, narrowed, and then I was like, \"No, I'm not feeling it,\" and then we unnarrowed it and went back. [inaudible 00:15:02]\n\nJessica Hische (00:15:01):\nThat is not an uncommon experience though. This is why there's a few things that I'm not opposed to that I know people that are very opposed to. I'm not opposed to Frankensteining options together. To me, it's like I'm giving you a menu of all the things that we can do, but I'm like a chef that puts a menu together where you can combine different appetizers and different mains and they all still make sense. Some people will give you a menu and if you try to do that, it's insane and it tastes terrible. But for me, everything that we're doing, I feel like, mixes and matches fairly well, and I will let you know if it doesn't.\n\n(00:15:37):\nIt's not unreasonable for clients to go down one path and then use that as validation or confirmation that something that we did much earlier was actually the right way. In that way, if a client ever asks me to do something, they're like, \"Let's see it in purple or whatever.\" There's designers that will really fight you tooth and nail, because they're like, \"That is wrong, that is wrong,\" but I know that some people just have to see it before they can let it go. Sometimes you have to walk down a path before you're able to understand what the right thing to do was all along.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:16:10):\nThat's exactly how it felt for me. Going back to the goals, the different goals people have when they're exploring this, you mentioned there's just little problems with the logo, it doesn't scale, it doesn't print well, that kind of thing. Another goal is people are pivoting and they want to change the vibe and the feel of the brand. What other goals might appear that you've come across why people want to do this?\n\nJessica Hische (00:16:31):\nWell, sometimes there's a legibility issue that is really glaring once you see it and then people are too close in to notice it, so this is why it's like you have to show it to a lot of people that aren't familiar with looking at those letter forms and stuff. The one that came to mind immediately when you asked was when I did a refresh for Jeni's Ice Cream, which is a really amazing ice cream brand based out of Columbus, Ohio. They had a few utilitarian things in mind. They had this long J that created this pocket of white space underneath it that made it really hard to design with, but then the biggest glaring one was that they decided to make the apostrophe of the Jeni's over the I as a cool thing. It made the word look like it said penis because of the way that J was drawn.\n\n(00:17:18):\nIt had a little loop at the top of the J. That was the most specific fix that I've ever had to do, is make the logo not say penis anymore. But yeah, I feel like a lot of it is misreads. When you think about logos and things like that, you want it to be something that, at a super fast glance, people can read it right away. That doesn't mean that everything has to be simple, but it just means that everything has to be incredibly legible, especially when you're starting a new company or you have a less recognizable brand. Because eventually, you become a household name and then people can look at just the color and recognize that it's you or whatever, but it takes a long time building equity before you get that. Until that, it's really important that the legibility is just super tight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:04):\nLet's talk about actually thinking through my new logo and brand. Can you just talk about what you had in mind as you started to explore directions and we started narrowing what was the mindset, and the approach, and the vibe?\n\nJessica Hische (00:18:18):\nI think with the Lenny's brand, you are what I would call a person that has a beloved fan base that we don't want to exclude or offend by shifting gears super crazily. When I was looking at redoing your brand, it was about what's here that we can look at that we should keep or at least explore keeping in order to make sure that it still feels the same on the other side? We didn't want to do anything super drastic. Some of the things to think about in that way are you have this sort of handwritten approach to a lot of the parts of your brand, and I was like, \"How do we do something that feels handwritten, that feels like it could jive with the handwriting scripts and stuff that you were using but might feel a little bit more refined moving forward and in a way that could blend with illustration so that the illustration and the letter forms all feel like they were created by the same hand?\"\n\n(00:19:17):\nA lot of times for me, when it comes to doing an exploration like that, it's about how do we make sure everything feels like it was created at the same time and not that we just tacked on new things? Figuring out how to blend everything together is important. Color was also a big one. I feel like people's color stories are something that is an immediate read, where if you blur your eyes and look at a brand, you can recognize it by its color, and so I think keeping your color similar was a big one too. But then I really wanted to try different approaches with the typography, doing stuff that was a little bit more clean, doing stuff that still had a bit of a funky edge to it. Because your original Lenny's podcast type had this sort of cut papery, a little bit off kilter vibe to it, and so trying to capture that but with new cleaner typography. That was really fun.\n\n(00:20:13):\nI was using a typeface Degular as part of it, which has a nice wonkiness to it. It was drawn by a friend of mine, James Edmondson, who I love all of his stuff. That was one of the things that we approached because I felt like it could capture the look of the original cut paperesque type. But yeah, it was really fun to try a lot of different things and work within the iconography that you had used on a few stuff with the microphones, and also marshmallows, and campfires, and all kinds of things, and just trying to make a more unified system.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:20:47):\nAre there things that didn't work as you tried to explore this process that you recall, that might be worth sharing of just like, \"Oh, that was a cool concept,\" but didn't quite work the way you thought?\n\nJessica Hische (00:20:57):\nWith working on this refresh, so much of it was thinking about what are the immediate uses of the logo. Your logo, you have these very specific uses that you need it for, the avatar for the podcast being a top one. Some people, they'll design a logo and then have these illustrative versions of the logo that get rolled out for other things, but I feel like those layouts were actually more important than even just having a basic letterhead-esque logo. That's an interesting way to approach it, because usually, it's like let's start simple, and expand, and make it crazier. I felt like we had to always keep those things in play, so it was designing brand assets while also designing the logo. Sometimes you'll see examples of that in early explorations just because it makes it feel real to the client.\n\n(00:21:53):\nThat's why there's always the tote bag. You got to put the logo on the tote bag and then it feels real or whatever. But in our case, we had really specific uses that needed to get explored very early on, and that made it a slightly different process for me. In terms of things that didn't work though, I think just trying to work on the level of detail within the illustration and type so that it could shrink down, because we knew... One of the primo examples of the logo being used was on that podcast avatar, and some of the versions felt a little bit too detailed to shrink down that much. Trying to get the balance of that, having the illustrations feel illustrative and whole, but not when they scaled up, to feel too simple like we just pulled it from a icon library. I think that was an interesting challenge.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:46):\nOne of the impetuses for changing my logo, for motivating me, is my wife's a designer, as you know. She's got strong opinions about my logo, and she always was making fun of my logo saying it looked like a clip art fireplace that anyone just could just plug and play. She's always like, \"Oh, that's so bad. You got to change it.\" That was one of the motivators. I think I might have shared that when we started working together.\n\nJessica Hische (00:23:08):\nYeah. Also too, I think that really talks to what I was saying earlier about making sure that everything feels like it was created together rather than it feeling like these disparate elements, because I think you can have an icon or logo that is quite simple as long as the rest of the brand matches that simplicity. I think, for you, the biggest thing was making the illustration and the typography just feel like it came from the same universe instead of feeling like these separate elements. When I first moved to San Francisco, I moved to San Francisco from New York, and as a New Yorker, I had an apartment with a full kitchen that never got used. I just ate at restaurants and did takeout for the seven years or whatever that I lived in New York.\n\n(00:23:51):\nLearning to cook, at first, when you learn how to cook, it's like you're making a pot full of ingredients and none of the ingredients are actually working together. But then the more you do it and the more you understand how these things are meant to blend and cook at different temperatures at different times, you start having this cohesive dish rather than hot ham water. You know what I mean? I feel like a lot of clients come to me and they have hot ham water when it comes to their brand. It's just about turning that into a soup, something that feels real.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:25):\nI want to take a quick tangent. Most people listening to this podcast are not designers. They're product managers, founders, engineers, and folks building product. I've always wanted to see the world through the eyes of a designer, because there's so much I don't see and there's so much that affects how I think about something that I don't understand when I look at a logo, and so I thought it might be helpful just to spend a little time helping people see a designer a little bit. Let me just ask you this question. When people look at a logo or a brand, what are just elements that make it what it is, that make you feel the thing you want to feel that we may not recognize?\n\nJessica Hische (00:25:06):\nI think most people are better at understanding the feelings and sensations that typography and logos give us than they give themselves credit for, because what we are as people are endless absorbers of patterns, and information, and all this kind of stuff as we move throughout the world. We don't take time to sit and digest it, but it's still coming in and getting logged. That's why if you see something funky in the world, you're like, \"That's weird. I don't like that. I don't know why I don't like it, but I know I don't like it.\" I think even as a non-designer, you can see that in typography. The whole being able to recognize patterns thing, I talked about this a bit at config, it's like it's a safety thing. Looking into the world, your eyes can spot that thing that's a little bit off, and that thing that's off feels not safe to you.\n\n(00:26:08):\nIt's thinking about when we look at a meal and there's a thing on the plate that looks like it's moldy or something like that. You understand that doesn't look right to me, this doesn't smell right to me. Your body knows it before your brain knows it. Even as a non-designer, I think you can look at examples of logos where something's not quite right and be like, \"Something's not right here, I just don't know how to name it.\" But I think a good exercise is just looking at fonts that are available in the world and asking yourself, \"What feeling does this give me?\" and just write them down. It doesn't matter, just give yourself permission to say whatever is happening in your mind, the first thing. Don't overanalyze it. Just look at it and be like, \"That feels calm to me. That feels exciting to me. That feels whatever to me.\"\n\n(00:27:00):\nThe more you do that, the more you can start seeing similarities in the ones that feel exciting, and the ones that feel calm, and the ones that feel whatever, and then get into analyze mode of, \"Oh, these 10 things that I said feel calm are a lighter weight, have more generous spacing, have rounded edges, have rounder bowls to the letter forms.\" You just start seeing commonalities between the things. It's just about seeing them all together to understand what those similarities are. I think anybody can do that. I mean, you're not going to have the language of the leg of the R and the tittle of the I. Don't worry about that. You don't have to know typography language to think about it, but anybody's capable of doing that. It can be really fun to just stop and ask yourself and notice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:58):\nThis is great. I want to go actually a little deeper. What I'm hearing is look at something, tap into the feeling you feel when you look at it, actually pay attention to it because there's wisdom in that. The specific things that you pointed out that impact that feeling are, you mentioned, spacing between the letters, the edges. I imagine there's just the color of it. What other specific elements impact the way someone feels when they look at a logo?\n\nJessica Hische (00:28:26):\nThere's the width of the letter, so if it's really narrow versus really wide. I always think about the width, the weight, [inaudible 00:28:35] facing, sort of detailed treatment of things, whether things are very hard and jagged or soft and how soft it is. Sometimes we just add a tiny bit of softness so that it just feels printed. You can take a typeface like Helvetica, just the one everybody knows. But if you take Helvetica and just ever so slightly round the edges just a little bit, all of a sudden, you have this typeface that feels more vintage, or softer, or whatever, because we're perceiving it, we would perceive it if it were printed on paper versus perceiving it as this hard geometric piece of technology that we're viewing. You know what I mean?\n\n(00:29:20):\nI know that it's because when you look at stuff printed on a page, it bleeds into the paper a little bit, which means that that softness reminds us in our bodies of a thing that we've seen that was printed. It's cool to sort of walk back your feelings also. You'll look at something and go, \"That feels like this,\" and then ask yourself why does it feel like that. It might be because you saw it on a flyer for a band when you were 22, and it brought out that feeling in you of what it felt like to be 22 at that thing. That's a very specific feeling to you, but it can inform your decisions about design, because you can be like, \"Oh, I'm not that much of a special snowflake.\" Other people might have that same reaction but have different experiences that are adjacent to that reaction.\n\n(00:30:08):\nIt's cool because you are reverse-justifying decisions. I think that's a really fun exercise to do, is to Song Exploder your intuition. You make a decision intuitively or look at something and intuit what you feel from it, and then really try to dive in, \"Why do I feel that way? What could this have reminded me of that made me feel that way?\" You have to be just so forgiving and loose with yourself as you do it because then you'll get into some really weird stuff, and that's really great inspiration juice for picking other things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:51):\nI love the exercise that you gave. The one you gave earlier is look at a bunch of fonts, look at your font folder. Is that a place to go, just open up your font folder and just go through them?\n\nJessica Hische (00:30:55):\nTotally. Look at your font folder, or go to MyFonts, or a place where there's a ton of fonts, and just search for something. Search for sans serif or whatever. Search for a really basic category of fonts. Serif, sans serif, script, whatever, the top level edge of stuff, and then just page through, page through, page through. Screenshot stuff that you like and make a folder full of screenshots, and then you can take those screenshots and start categorizing them. \"Oh, this one feels feminine. This one feels masculine, this one feels aggressive. This one feels whatever.\" Just take some notes on it. Then, you ask yourself, \"Well, why did I feel that way?\" You're like, \"Oh, well, this feels feminine because it reminds me of wedding invitations,\" and wedding invitations feel inherently bridey versus groomy. All of a sudden, you're like, \"Okay. Well, now I know that if I'm going to use a script for something, this zone of script feels very wedding, so maybe I avoid that for this brand that's actually a cutting edge food packaging company or whatever because it feels too aligned with that industry.\"\n\n(00:32:10):\nStereotypes are real and trends are real, and what can sometimes happen is some industry usurps an entire style for a period of time. If you use anything within that style, it's like you're aligning yourself to that industry. I mean, everybody that does branding, one of the things that they do is they analyze the competitors of the company. You just look at a landscape of what are all the competitors doing, what is their visual vibe, and do I lean into that or do I avoid that? If I lean into it, then I'm immediately getting this... Everyone that looks at it understands I'm a FinTech company because I look like a FinTech company. If my whole thing is I'm trying to be divergent from that, I'm trying to show how different I am from the status quo, then you use it as a reactionary thing of I want to do nothing like that and do something really different so people understand this isn't just another FinTech company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:09):\nYeah. I'm thinking green. The color green has to be a part of the logo if you want to be a FinTech company.\n\nJessica Hische (00:33:13):\nYeah, exactly. If you're trying to be weird, then you're like teal.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:19):\nOn this topic of seeing a designer, is there any other tip, just before we move on to a different topic, of just how someone could learn to see a designer a little bit more?\n\nJessica Hische (00:33:30):\nYeah. Another thing to notice, because I'm assuming you're... Product people, I feel like a lot of product people end up having some engineering background, whether or not they're engineers themselves. They have to interface with the engineers and they build stuff, and so they come at it from a data standpoint. I can always tell when there's an engineer that has suddenly got taken an interest in type design and is now a type designer, because everything is very, very regular. You can draw a grid on top of everything and the lines all line up perfectly. You see lots of reverse justification of that when people are making logos and they have a more engineering background. The thing to notice, that is interesting within type, is that, yes, you're absolutely following rules, but you're breaking those rules quite often to correct for optical tricks.\n\n(00:34:24):\nIf you look at a geometric sans serif, for instance, that's like a category of sans serifs, and they're meant to have a lot of really strong geometry, be very regular, like most of the sans that you think of that you're like, \"I'm in love with this over the last 10 years,\" like geometric sanses. But when you really start to examine them, you notice that there's all these little things that people are doing to make them look perfectly geometric even though they are not mathematically perfectly geometric. That's another thing that you can do, whether you're doing it in Figma or doing it somewhere else, is just type out a couple of lowercase letters. Lowercase specifically are really good for analyzing this because they're smaller than the uppercase letters. You usually have to accommodate for the weight a little bit differently. You'll notice that when strokes combine, so say I have an A and I'm combining the lower bowl of the A, I'm going to get a little thinner as I come into that.\n\n(00:35:23):\nOr say I have a two-storey A, so a two-storey A is the one that's like this and then a bowl, you might notice that this vertical of the A there, the bowl actually eats into that stroke a little bit to erase a little bit of that added weight that would've been perceived optically had you kept everything perfectly regular. It's weird because you end up creating something that's perfect and then have to make it not perfect in order to make it be perceived as perfect. That's another just fun thing to start noticing. You notice it a lot more on typefaces and typography that is heavier in weight, because when things are heavier weight, you're constantly managing these really inky moments where things join together and you have to subtract a bunch of weight from that so that it doesn't get perceived as this dark mark where the letter is happening.\n\n(00:36:22):\nI think about lowercase Rs and lowercase Ns, where the shoulder of the N or the R comes out, sometimes the top of the R is actually narrower at the top than it is on the bottom, and that's to try to subtract some of that weight in there where that join happens. Anyway, that's just a fun thing to notice that you have to do that. Once you start seeing it, you start seeing where it happens more often, and the answer of why it happens is because correcting for this optical weight issue. You're like, \"Oh, man. Now I have x-ray vision. I can see all these weird things I've never seen before.\" It's very fun. But anyway, a lot of people, when they first start out doing typography, whether you're an engineer or whether you are a designer, they don't account for that. I can always just look at something and see whether someone is truly an expert at typography or whether this is a fun hobby for them when they're pretty fresh at it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:20):\nThe exercise here is open up Figma, start typing, and make it really big so you can basically see the font really zoomed in.\n\nJessica Hische (00:37:20):\nA single letter.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:27):\nA single letter.\n\nJessica Hische (00:37:28):\nMake a single letter the whole page and then just draw some vertical lines, or do the thing where you draw a little circle or whatever and see if that circle is the same size at the point where two strokes join together or the point where the stroke is just vertical and on its own. You'll notice that there's differences even in typography that's meant to look extremely rigid and geometric.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:53):\nI want to come back to my logo just to close the loop there. Talk about just the final result that we landed on, and why you think that was the final answer, and what you think people might get from it, whatever comes to mind.\n\nJessica Hische (00:38:07):\nYeah, totally. I think the final answer or the final logo, we took it down a lot of different paths trying to see where it was going to land, but ultimately ended up keeping it pretty close to home and really focusing on that asset of the fire. We tried so many different versions of it's microphones with the fire and marshmallows with the fire, et cetera. It was just about sometimes the simplest solution is the correct solution. I don't know, I just feel like in terms of what we were doing for blowing it out and making it really cohesive, we went a lot of directions where there might've been multiple versions of the logo depending on the scale and ultimately ended up in a place where it's much more in line and consistent across the bar.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:55):\nYeah. Maybe what I'll do is we'll share, I don't know if you're comfortable with that, we could just share all the iterations somewhere that we went through.\n\nJessica Hische (00:39:01):\nOh, yeah. I love sharing iterations. It's very fun. Yeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:03):\nOkay, cool. Sweet. The biggest issue we had with the podcast logo specifically is, originally, I was thinking the mic made sense to differentiate it from the newsletter. At the end of it, it's just like, \"Why do we have this freaking mic in there? It just feels strange.\" That's where we revisited the whole idea and killed the mic and went back to a different version of the fireplace but with marshmallows.\n\nJessica Hische (00:39:24):\nYeah, I love the marshmallows.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:26):\nAwesome. I love it. That was my wife's... My wife loves the marshmallows also, and it's so versatile. We can use it in so many different ways.\n\nJessica Hische (00:39:33):\nIndeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:34):\nI guess maybe one last thread there is we explored handwritten typography that you created from scratch, and then there's the block letters. Maybe just thoughts on those two options and benefits and why go one direction versus another?\n\nJessica Hische (00:39:51):\nThe handwritten one, I really liked because I felt like we could bring the line quality of the illustration into the handwriting, but then the only problem with the handwriting is that if you want to blow that out, if you want to include other handwriting throughout the rest of the brand, finding something that matches that perfectly without creating a custom typeface is a whole thing. I really like being able to combine the two, where we have this broader visual vocabulary that we can pull from, because you're going to have headlines, you're going to have subheads, you're going to have all these other uses for typography moving forward. If you just have one thing to pull from, it's a lot harder to work with. It's just nicer when you have a few elements to play with. It's like having a wardrobe. If you have only one shirt and one pair of pants, there's only so many things that you can do. But if you have all these things that work together and can recombine, then you can blow out a brand system much more easily.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:40:44):\nYeah. That's one of my favorite things about working with you, is you create all these different variations of ways to use it. It doesn't always have to be the handwritten one. It could be the blocky outlining one. It's not like, \"This is it, don't change anything about this. This is the only way to use it.\"\n\nJessica Hische (00:40:57):\nWell, part of that is because some brands, if you have a massive company, like hundreds of employees generating hundreds of things, sometimes having too many assets can overcomplicate stuff. Because unless you have a really, really well-written brand book outlining how to do everything that people are adhering to very closely, you can get the assets running rampant throughout all of the stuff and being used incorrectly. But because you're not a massive company and you have creative control over the things that are happening and can help direct that, we can be much more playful with the assets and give you the ability to use things in different ways. It depends on how much you trust all the people that are handling your assets.\n\n(00:41:43):\nI am of the mind that you shouldn't need a 500-page brand book in order to direct how the brand is used moving forward, and that if you do, the brand might be quite complicated, or there might be even just parts of the logo that make it difficult to work with. My goal always when designing a logo is to design a logo that's so easy to use that you don't have to be an extremely skilled designer to design well with it. That's my number one goal, because I know not everybody is going to be at a stage where they have an internal brand team or a designer that's a rock star designer that can work with really complicated assets and make them look good.\n\n(00:42:28):\nI just want the assets to teach you themselves, by just how they exist, how to use it. You, as a person that has any taste whatsoever, and hopefully people that you're hiring for any job at your company have some degree of taste. If you hire an engineer, they have to have taste about how that happens. If you hire a marketing person, they have to have taste about how that happens. They should be able to look at that and intuit most of the way that you should be able to use it without being explicitly told, \"Do not do this.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:01):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge. Product leaders, yes, like you, cringe when they hear the word integration. They're not fun for you to scope, build, launch, or maintain, and integrations probably aren't what led you to product work in the first place. Lucky for you, the folks at Merge are obsessed with integrations. Their single API helps SaaS companies launch over 200 product integrations in weeks, not quarters. Think of Merge like Plaid, but for everything B2B SaaS. Organizations like Ramp, Dorado, and Electric use Merge to access their customer's accounting data to reconcile bill payments, file storage data to create searchable databases and their product, or HRAS data to auto provision and deprovision access for the customer's employees. Yes, if you need AI-ready data for your SaaS product, then Merge is the fastest way to get it. Want to solve your organization's integration dilemma once and for all, book and attend a meeting at merge.dev/lenny and receive a $50 Amazon gift card. That's merge.dev/lenny.\n\n(00:44:08):\nThis is a good circle back to something you touched on earlier that I wanted to come back to, which is a lot of companies, in your opinion, put too much weight on the power of brand, and rebranding, and how much a brand can fix their problems. Can you just again share your perspective on just how this might be an issue for people where they almost overemphasize the power of brand? [inaudible 00:44:32]\n\nJessica Hische (00:44:31):\nYeah. Well, there's different companies. There's companies where brand is literally everything, where they're doing something that's not crazy innovative in the first place and the brand is the thing that is the whole company, and that's fine. That's a completely valid way to do stuff. It's like people that can take in information and recommunicate it in a way to another audience or whatever that they hit that audience in a way that the original information couldn't do. Think about all of the people who write books on psychology, and medicine, and all kinds of stuff that write it for a broader popular audience. They're the ones reading the medical papers, they're the ones digesting all of this really huge complicated data, and turning it into something that normal people can read. I think that there are companies that are doing that. They're taking a thing that is not innovative or isn't like they're not the only ones doing it, but they're repackaging it in a way that takes that and makes it so accessible to so many people.\n\n(00:45:34):\nIn that case, brand can matter immensely, where the brand really is the thing that shows people that the thing that you're doing has value. But for a lot of people, the brand should be somewhat invisible so that the thing itself becomes the star. If we think about the experiences that we have using products, sometimes there's products where there's a ton of fun and delight built into how you use it, and that can happen through brand through design choices and things like that. Sometimes the delight is the fact that nothing is getting in your way as you're using that product. You just figure out what's your ethos of your company. Is the whole thing about doing a thing well, doing it simply, and making sure that everything gets out of the way of that experience, or is it like we're trying to generate this delightful thing or we're trying to open it up to a new audience or whatever? Depending on whatever that goal is, brand can have a different place in that equation.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:42):\nI think some of this unique perspective on the power brand and the need for it in tech companies comes from you're not like a tech person. You work with tech people, you work with tech companies. Do you feel like that has an impact on the way you think and the value that you bring to companies to give them this very outside perspective?\n\nJessica Hische (00:47:01):\nI mean, most of the folks that I know that work in brand or traditional graphic design, print design, they don't necessarily have a lot of insight into how building companies works. They're not friends with a ton of startup founders and things like that. I've just had been in this very fun position being like everyone's token creative person in The Bay for a while, and this been for a long time. I remember speaking at a Silicon Valley event that was women in Silicon Valley in 2009 or 2010, something like that. It's interesting to be a person that has never actually, themselves, worked at a tech company but felt so involved and understanding about how all of that works. My partner, the reason why we're in The Bay is because he got hired by Facebook back in 2011. We were olds at the time. Take that with a grain of salt, don't judge me.\n\n(00:48:02):\nBecause we were 28, 29 coming over to work at Facebook and everybody there was 23, 24, and so all the people that we ended up meeting in The Bay were more people our age that were moving on to start companies and things like that. We just got to see that perspective so clearly of what it is to branch out on your own, to fundraise, to do all this stuff, to pivot, to do little experimental apps and see where that goes to get acquired as a team versus getting acquired as a technology or whatever. I've been able to see that in a way that I feel like a lot of people that do my job don't get to see. That makes me very sympathetic and towards what it is to want to build a brand as a founder. I understand that you have limited resources and those resources aren't necessarily going to get devoted to doing a $200,000 brand exploration, because when you have $500,000 of money at all for a year to try to get things going, you certainly should not spend half of that money on branding.\n\n(00:49:12):\nThat's my opinion, but that's not to say that brand can't be important and can't come in at some level or can't be thought of as a partnership between you and someone else where... There's this whole idea of fractional leadership now, which I feel like hasn't really infiltrated my world as much, but I don't know why it hasn't, because most people don't have internal comms teams, internal brand teams, until the company is very mature. The idea that you could bring someone in who is a real expert in whatever it's that they do, just as you need them, and they just get consultant equity kind of thing, that should be more present because people don't necessarily need to have internal brand teams for the first six months to a year of when they're doing stuff unless they grow really significantly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:05):\nAlong these lines, you have a pretty unique way of pricing your work. For people that may want to explore this with you, share whatever you can about just how you think about pricing and ideally even an order magnitude of pricing so they're like, \"Oh, okay. We should actually do this.\"\n\nJessica Hische (00:50:21):\nTo go back to the process how it's always about figuring out what people are trying to accomplish, so a lot of my process scales depending on how broad of an exploration that we're doing. The way that I treat it is I treat my branding work not dissimilarly to how I treat commercial lettering, which is atypical. Brand people, what they typically do is because the client has to own the assets outright at the end no matter what, they tend to do is bill everything that the client owns everything as you are moving along. It's all sort of work for hire, but the idea being that it's a buyout of everything that is being made. What that means is that when a branding agency is pricing stuff for you, they're taking the buyout rights and baking it into every round of work so that every round gets more expensive because you are owning all of the work.\n\n(00:51:14):\nWhat I do is I treat it much more like a commercial lettering project where I say, \"You have to own the rights to this eventually, but hey, let's break that out and let's keep the creative process lighter and less expensive so then we have more room to explore. So then if some stakeholder comes in last minute and blows everything else up and we need to start over, you haven't already paid to own everything that we've created, you just pay to own the thing that we create in the end that gets chosen.\" I really like the idea of keeping the creation process more flexible and to try to scale to what people need versus having a really rigid way of approaching everything. Sometimes people will bring me on really early in the process, where if they have an internal team or if they're working with an external agency or something, they want me there from the get out.\n\n(00:52:04):\nSome people are like, \"We have no money and we are going to try to do this as much as we can inside of our business, but then can we hire you at the end to make it look good? If we can get everybody bought in and get it 80% of the way there.\" Depending on what people's budgets are, I have different ways of working, or just depending on what their needs are. Because my whole thing too is I don't want to step on anybody's toes, because sometimes companies have these really amazing designers that are working in-house, and it sucks as a designer who started at a company and thinks that you might be able to get a chance to work on what is considered the most important asset in terms of the brand and they just farm it out to someone else instead of letting you touch it. To me, that's a recipe for anything that I create to be immediately killed, because someone inside is going to be like, \"It's time to shine,\" and then they're just going to kill all my work.\n\n(00:52:56):\nI'm always like, \"How do we collaborate? How do I make it so that I'm an asset to you? Not that I'm trying to step on your toes, not that I'm trying to take over what's the cool juicy work from the people who inside that are really excited to do it.\" I just want them to feel as bought in as I can be. But yeah, it becomes interesting. I feel like I get told by branding people that I'm too inexpensive because they're like, \"Oh, for what you do, it should be 60 or $70,000 at a minimum to do all this kind of stuff.\" I'm like, I feel like the majority of the projects that I do end up being between 25 and 35, but depending on how you bring me in, it can be less if it's just as a consultant. It's not out of the realm of possibilities to hire a proper crazy expert at stuff. It's not like you're thinking about sinking half a million dollars into the brand. That's a very different experience.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:51):\nAwesome. Thank you for sharing that. Before we get into other stuff that you do, because like you said at the top, there are many other things you do outside of this specific time of work, is there anything else you think might be helpful or important for people to know about working with you on a logo refresh or just thinking about logos and this whole space we talked about?\n\nJessica Hische (00:54:11):\nThe best thing is just seeing what's there and really being able to understand what's not working about it and what your goals are. Like I said with that reverse justification of intuition, I think if you know that the logo is not quite where you want it to be, just spend a couple days asking yourself why. \"What is the thing about this that bothers me?\" Don't get specific. Don't be like, \"The way the R is,\" or whatever. Maybe that's the thing that we talk about down the line, but always think big picture before you think minutiae, because sometimes people think that... They'll throw a bunch of minutiae stuff at me, but it's because they haven't really stopped to think about what is the overall thing that's bothering them.\n\n(00:54:59):\nYou just never get there if you're always trying to address detail before you address the big picture stuff. You have to just always start super top level, and really ask yourself very broad questions about why you think it's not working, and then go tighter, and tighter, and tighter, and be like... It really could be like, \"This C has always bothered me,\" and then we can get real specific about that when I'm doing the refresh. But I think I also need to understand the overall reason why we're doing this, not just the little bugaboo that bothers you specifically but might not bother anybody else.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:35):\nYeah. When I was thinking about this, it feels like my whole feeling was this could be better. That's all it was for me initially, is just like I feel like it could be a lot better. I imagine that's enough for some people, just like, \"I think this could be better,\" and then here's things [inaudible 00:55:50].\n\nJessica Hische (00:55:49):\nYeah. That's definitely enough for some people, because I think sometimes... I think you, specifically, had a very clear vibe going on with all of your brand stuff. Some people, it's totally like a mishmash grab bag of random trends and there's no real voice that's coming through. But I feel like you've been doing this for a while, and when you see everything together, there's definitely a very clear vision and vibe that you get from everything. I always tell people that having terrible vision can be your best asset when it comes to logo and brand, because it allows you...\n\n(00:56:30):\nJust take your glasses off if you have terrible vision, and look at it, and get the feeling when you can't see the detail. You have to be looking at it with blurred eyes. What is the overall look of this thing? Just trying to get as broad and noodly as you can with it instead of it being about those really specific one by one stuff. I think when you blur your eyes on your brand, there was a really clear cohesiveness to it already. It was just about massaging it into a more consistent professional-looking place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:57:07):\nWell, I can't look at the old logo anymore now that I've gotten this thing coming together, so I'm really excited for this to come out. Just a couple closing questions. One is you have a lot of other stuff going on that is not just typography and logo refreshes. You have children's books, you do lettering for classics, you have a store in Oakland. Talk about all these other things you got going on in case it might interest people.\n\nJessica Hische (00:57:32):\nSure. Yeah, of course. I'm based here in The Bay, as we've talked about, and I have a studio in Downtown Oakland. My studio is like Barbie's creative Dream house, where the top floor is my office, that's where I'm right now, and then the bottom floor on one side is a workshop. I do a lot of printmaking. I went to college at a school that was very focused on interdisciplinary work, and I feel like I bring a lot of manual analog processes into my work a lot. I find it really important to make physical things as a part of my creative process, so I do a lot of printmaking. On the other side downstairs is a brick and mortar store. I've always wanted to have a brick and mortar store because, as an artist, I think having people have a physical connection to your work can be really important.\n\n(00:58:20):\nI think one of the reasons why people hire me to do things for them is because one of the gifts of working with someone that is a real nerd professional about whatever it is that they do is that they bring you along the journey and give you the language to talk about the thing through their eyes and through their experience. To me, the funnest thing for me is actually telling clients and teaching them about all the things that we are doing along the way so then they go out into the world as a newly-minted type nerd and can communicate all of these things to other people. That connection is just really important. The connection to the work, the story behind it, I feel like that's one of the ways that we create lasting work, is understanding that the work exists because there's a story behind it. Things, if they're just created because of the aesthetics or they're just created quickly or whatever, it's really easy to discard them because there's not a story behind it.\n\n(00:59:22):\nBut if you think about all the objects in your life that have followed you throughout your life, what's a thing that you've had since you were in fifth grade or whatever that is still magically in your possession in your house? You have that because the story of that thing is so important to you. I think that the work that we create, the design that we create, can have that. It can be imbued with so much story and meaning, that when we think about moving on from it, we're like, \"Ugh, but this.\" I think that's one of the ways to build a lasting brand, is to just make sure that the story of creating it feels so real, and visceral, and important. The store is a way for people to have a physical connection to other work that I create, like the prints and things like that.\n\n(01:00:07):\nWith the kids' book stuff, that's also about creating lasting stuff. I like creating physical things in the world. I like repackaging things that I've learned in therapy in a way that kids will appreciate and enjoy. I'm just always thinking about what's a way that I can say a thing that has been said before but hasn't been said in this way. If I can turn that into a physical object that people can have and appreciate, all the better. But yeah, I don't know. While, professionally, what I do is considered very niche, I feel like all the things that I do are quite diverse, because they tickle different parts of my brain. I have to use my hands in different ways and my mind in different ways. It's how I've been able to generally avoid feeling burnt out as a creative, is just being able to move on between different kinds of work and just feel excited about different things at different times.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:05):\nFor folks that want to maybe check out the store, how do they find it? It's called Jessica and Friends, is that right?\n\nJessica Hische (01:01:08):\nYes. It's called Jessica Hische and Friends.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:10):\nJessica Hische and Friends.\n\nJessica Hische (01:01:13):\nYou can just Google JH&F.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:14):\nGoogle Maps, yeah. [inaudible 01:01:17]\n\nJessica Hische (01:01:18):\nYeah. I put JH&F on as a part of the Google Maps name so I don't have to spell my name to strangers, because I have a weird German spelling last name. I also have a second store called Drawling, which is drawing with an L thrown in there. That one is an all-ages art supply store that's sort of a kids' art supply store. That one grew out of JH&F as well. Those two stores exist. With my books, if you just look up my last name on any of your favorite booksellers, you'll find me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:01:49):\nLast question. I'm just going to throw this out there in case something interesting comes up. We have a segment on this podcast called AI Corner, where I like to see how people have found ways to use AI in their work, in their life to be more productive, do cool things. Is there some way that you've found a way to use AI in the work that you do that makes you do more interesting stuff?\n\nJessica Hische (01:02:09):\nA little bit. I am in this really interesting position in terms of AI where my partner works at Meta on GenAI stuff. He's a director on the GenAI team at Meta and is very bought into AI as a whole thing. I am a little [inaudible 01:02:28] about its impact on a lot of the things that we do. I think, overall, it will become a tool and be very useful, especially in a lot of different fields. But I think this timeframe in which it's more novelty is going to have not the best impact on things like illustration, but eventually, we'll all come out of it and it'll be fine. In terms of how I've been able to integrate it into my process, I did some work for Salesforce last year where the theme for Dreamforce was going to be very AI-driven. I felt like I needed to explore AI as a part of the generative process for creating that art.\n\n(01:03:08):\nI did have fun creating custom lettering and then trying to run it through stable diffusion to get stable diffusion to generate instances of my lettering in different styles. We were making these clouds. We ultimately didn't end up using it, but it was still really neat to see. I could see the validity of that in the creative iterative process. I think the biggest thing for me is that I find that the sloggy, slow dregs of work is very fulfilling to me, that a lot of the evangelists of AI are like, \"Oh, imagine if you could spend all of your time high level thinking, and coming up with the concepts, and guiding the vision, and whatever, and then just get AI to do everything else that you don't care about.\" For me, that just sounds like not the most holistic approach to how I work, because the reason why I do all the things that I do and why my process is the way that it is because while I love thinking and I love coming up with conceptual stuff, I find it to be very cerebrally taxing.\n\n(01:04:17):\nI need a break from that by doing the more low-key production end of stuff. That's my favorite part of the process, is we know what we're doing, and now it's just about going in. When it comes to judging logos, for instance, the days that I spend knowing exactly what I'm going to do and all it is me just moving little Bezier handles around and getting it feeling right and whatever, those are pure therapeutic zen for me. I think I will always have that as a part of my work and will probably not have AI be outputting that part. But I have been able to have it be helpful in the iterative process a little bit, both through generating sketches with that project and then also through a lot of stuff with writing with my kids' books and things like that, is coming up with lists of words and concepts that are adjacent to each other, whatever.\n\n(01:05:17):\nI have found that Claude and ChatGPT are very good for things like that. I'm working on another kids' book now, and I'm trying to think of the directions that it can take. One of them is sort of illustrating different feelings and things like that. I could sit there and brainstorm what are the different emotions or whatever, or I can just ask Claude like, \"List 50 emotions,\" and then I can cherry-pick the ones that come up that feel right. I do find it's really good for that early brainstorming stuff, and that's been really nice.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:05:50):\nIs there anything else that you want to share or leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJessica Hische (01:05:58):\nYes. Well, I do have a new kid's book coming out in October.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:02):\nOh, [inaudible 01:06:02].\n\nJessica Hische (01:06:02):\nAside from all the logo stuff, please do check out my kids' books. It's called My First Book of Fancy Letters, and it is like a new spin on an alphabet book, but instead of it being an alphabet book for brand new babies, which you could totally buy it for brand new babies because it is very simple, and fun, and they'll like the bright pictures, it's for the age where kids can recognize letters but can't necessarily read and write yet because they get so into seeing letters drawn in these different styles and imagining what other letters could be drawn in. Each of the letters is drawn to represent the word that it sounds like. Letters can be athletic, bubbly, or creepy, and then it's like, \"Well, what does a creepy C look like?\"\n\n(01:06:49):\nWhen kids are starting to understand letter sounds and recognizing letters, they can start thinking about what other words start with that letter sound, and then they start listing stuff out and become immediate over-the-shoulder art directors. It's been really fun showing it to other preschoolers, and TK, and kindergarten kids, because they're immediately like, \"Well, R should be a river. It should be a river.\" I'm like, \"Well, how do you draw a river?\" It becomes this fun imagination exercise too, so definitely check that out. It's up for pre-order now and comes out October 22nd.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:21):\nThat is so delightful. I know you have multiple kids. Do you start to see the idea with one age of kid and then by the time the next kid reaches that age, it's ready and published? Does that work timing-wise?\n\nJessica Hische (01:07:31):\nYeah, the only thing is both of my... Well, my oldest child is a real super reader. She's always ahead of the game. The second that she could read, she was like, \"Oh, picture books are for babies.\" Now she's reading, she goes into Pegasus books and is just like, \"Where are your books for teenagers?\" They're like, \"You're nine. We're not going to show you that, but here are the middle grade books or whatever.\" There is a little bit of that. You are a parent, but you are a parent of a very young person. Kids don't want to buy anything you're selling as a parent. There's a little bit of that where I feel like I get so many wonderful letters from other families about how it's their favorite book, and they read it every night, and it's so important, and then my kids are like, \"Yeah, yeah. It's just mom's book, whatever.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:23):\nYeah, that's bittersweet. Well, with that, Jessica, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nJessica Hische (01:08:30):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:31):\nSpeaking of books, first question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJessica Hische (01:08:36):\nRick Reuben's creativity book is so good. Definitely recommend that. I haven't listened to it on audiobook. I read the physical book, but I also heard the audiobook is very zen. I feel like it's just a very good palate cleanser in terms of being an artist and creating because it feels both high level but also very actionable, so really recommend that. In terms of learning about and understanding typography, there's this book called Inside Paragraphs by Cyrus Highsmith. It's very small and very digestible. You can read it in one bathroom visit, and it's illustrated really well. It has cool illustrations. If you want to learn about some basics of type and typography, it's a really great book, and incredibly accessible, and not like reading Bringhurst or something like that, so big ups to that book. Oh, what's another book?\n\n(01:09:33):\nI don't know. I feel like I'm just going to end up recommending all the books that I'm currently reading. This month, I read both Patti Smith's Just Kids, which I loved also and was also... I feel like I'm reading a lot of books about being an artist more so than being a designer. That book, I found really interesting, just hearing her story of moving to New York and having nothing. Just trying to be an artist, and make art, and having that be the thing that drove everything that she and Robert Mapplethorpe did. I don't know, I just feel like I'm looking for ways to get out of my very business-driven sensibilities around art making and get into a space that's more loose, and free, and driven by passions and feelings more so than necessarily career-based milestones and things like that. This is a wild card one too. I just finished The Emperor of All Maladies. I'm just a big fan of reading things about human biology and things like that and found it totally fascinating, so do read that one too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):\nI can't help but ask, how do you have time to read, raise children, work on so many projects, have a run a store? What is your secret?\n\nJessica Hische (01:10:50):\nWell, you get pretty ruthless about your schedule when you're a parent, where when you're at the office, you are just heads in working, and so I think just trying to stay as focused as possible in that way. I do this thing where I bounce back and forth between projects a lot as I'm losing steam, and so having multiple things to work on keeps me motivated to keep working. I think it's kind of an ADHD thing, where I will start my day one way and then as soon as I start losing steam, I switch to a different thing, lose steam, switch to a different thing, lose steam, switch to a different thing. Rather than taking breaks, I just take a break by working on something that feels fresh. That can be super helpful.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:11:35):\nThat's an awesome tip.\n\nJessica Hische (01:11:36):\nYeah. I mean, it's incredible. I also would tell people when I had first started out, I had a full-time job and then was doing freelance in the evenings. People were like, \"How do you not get burnt out, whatever?\" It's because my day job was so different from my night job that it felt like I was doing two separate eight-hour shifts instead of one continual sixteen-hour shift. I think that's something to sort of think about, is that there's always going to be things that need to get done as a part of your work or things that you're interested in and passionate about. Just having enough diversity in what that means is going to allow you to maintain enthusiasm for doing all those different things for much longer. Actually, the more homogenous your life and career and job is, the faster you're going to burn out, so just making sure that you have enough variety and all the things that you do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:27):\nThat was an awesome tip. I'm glad I went there. Okay, back on track to our lightning round. Is there a recent favorite movie or TV show you've really enjoyed?\n\nJessica Hische (01:12:34):\nSeverance was my favorite TV show I think I've ever watched.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:38):\nThe second season's coming out.\n\nJessica Hische (01:12:40):\nI know. That came to mind because I knew the second season was coming out, so I'm just really excited about it, but I think that was probably tops for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:48):\nIs there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?\n\nJessica Hische (01:12:51):\nOh, yeah. Well, there's a few things. Well, there was one that's just a super random one that was just pure delight. There's a Japanese brand, Penco, and they make a lot of wonderful stuff. I carry a lot of their stuff in my store. One of the things I bought recently from them is a pen cup, a pencil cup. It's ceramic, but it looks like a paper bag, a lightly crumpled paper bag, and then it just has printed on it Penco, whatever. I just really like it when you take an existing object and give it a new form. I find that to be very delightful, and so that was, I think, one of the things that I really loved recently that I bought for the store.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:28):\nAwesome. Pick two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often think about, come back to share with folks, find useful, and work your life?\n\nJessica Hische (01:13:38):\nIt's funny being a lettering artist because I'm not much of a quotes gal, all things considered. I should be because I could make a million dollars by just making \"live, laugh, love\" pillows or whatever, but I am not usually continually collecting quotes. But I was just at a conference up in Portland called XOXO, and one of the presenters showed a quote on the screen that resonated with me more than most things that I've seen in recent memory. I feel like this is my new... It was one of those quotes that I was like maybe I should get a tattoo of that. When it gets to that level where you're considering a tattoo, you're like, \"Okay, that's official.\" It was \"hope is a discipline\". I just really loved that. It's by Mariame Kaba or Mariame Kaba.\n\n(01:14:25):\nThe idea that we have to choose to create positivity, that it's like a choice, and that in order to dream of these things, you can actually create structure and discipline around it, and that it's not just something that is just inherent and comes, you have to actually have a practice around being hopeful and positive. I just really liked that as a concept because I feel that way just about navigating through life, that everything that we do is a choice and that we can choose to frame things one way or frame things another way. Understanding that you have power in that, I think, is really important, and so I just really loved that. Hope is a discipline.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:14):\nI really love that. I love any quote that inspires you to not feel like a victim, and gives you agency, and reminds you that you have agency over.\n\nJessica Hische (01:15:23):\nExactly. That's, I think, was the biggest thing for me is just... Because I feel very well-resourced in being able to deal with hardship because I'm always able to recontextualize and reframe. I think part of that is doing so much intuition justification, which is what we talked about, is walking through things, being like, \"Why is this? Why does that happen, la, la, la?\" When something bad happens, it's understanding why it happened and then understanding the paths that it can take forward and the different attitudes that you can bring to it that can help you come out of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:59):\nThat's beautiful. Okay, final question. I know that you recently remodeled your home. It's quite stunning. You share photos of it online. You worked with this amazing architect to help make it as amazing as it is. As a designer, here's the question, how do you find the balance between trusting someone, their own perspective and design approach, versus pushing into a direction you think that it should go? How do you find a balance as a designer?\n\nJessica Hische (01:16:28):\nWell, I actually feel like it's quite easy for me to trust people to do their own thing, because as long as I go to them as being like, \"I appreciate you and your vision and that's why I'm paying you,\" then the last thing that I want to do is micromanage them, because the reason why I'm paying them is because I don't have the bandwidth to do that myself. Because honestly, I'm one of those people that if I had nothing going on, if my job totally blew up or whatever, I would probably be one of those people that just specialize in a different thing every six months and would be like, \"I'm going to build a house now from the ground up. I'm going to do this from now, whatever.\" I just feel very capable of doing anything that I want to do because I understand that I can find the resources for it.\n\n(01:17:16):\nWhen I hire people to help me do a thing, it's because there is this implicit trust in what they do and that that's why I want to work with them. With the house, I definitely had opinions about stuff. But in general, I'm just like, \"Hey, this is your thing. You're the expert. What do you think? Let me give you the parameters and the things that we have to think about. Because you know more about wood resources, and you know more about the cabinet spacing, and whatever, you tell me what you think is going to work best based on all these things that I laid out for you.\" I found it to be quite easy. I only got really wigged out about a couple of different fine tune-y stuff.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:01):\nI imagine architects and designers are like, \"Oh no, it's going to be a designer I'm working with. They have opinions.\" I'm glad it wasn't that bad.\n\nJessica Hische (01:18:09):\nI feel like my strength with the work that I do in general is just being incredibly decisive and understanding that there's 10 good answers to every one question. Some people are real maximalists about decision-making and need to look at every gray sofa that exists before they can choose the one gray sofa. Whereas I feel like I can look at 10 gray sofas and go, it feels like there's two or three categories of sofa here, and then within those categories, there's a couple of good options. Here's a brand that I recognize is known for being of high quality. That one's good enough. I can get to it really quickly, and I feel like not everybody can do that. And I think that that permeates through everything that I do in my life. It definitely is a huge part of the logo work, because you really can do anything when it comes to typography.\n\n(01:18:57):\nIt can go in 50 million directions. It's just about having someone tell you, \"Yes, we could take this anywhere, but these are the valid paths. If we go down this path, this is the most intuitive and most correct way to do it that is closest and most accessible to us. We can noodle on it until kingdom come, but do we have to? This is good.\" I don't know. I feel like there's some weird knowledge around understanding that nothing is ever 100% perfect, and the most you can aspire and get to is 99.8 or whatever. That last 0.2%, you could spend your whole life trying to do that, or you could move on and do other things and understand that it's nearly perfect.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:49):\nThat is really good advice and a freeing piece of advice. Jessica, it's been an honor to work with you on this logo. I am really excited for people to see it, for it to be the new look of everything I'm doing. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more and potentially work with you, and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJessica Hische (01:20:07):\nOh, yeah. Of course. I have a website that I occasionally update. It is jessicahische.is/awesome. You'll notice I have a bunch of weird URLs on my website. That's a place to find me. Otherwise, I am on Instagram and Threads a lot. I was formerly a very active Twitter person, and now I'm not really there so much and I bop around with the Twitter clones, but I'm on Threads quite a bit. Instagram and Threads are good for social. Email, I'm easy, hello@jessicaHische.com. What your readers could do for me, I think it's the work that I do in terms of the logo refresh stuff. I feel like this audience is just totally my perfect audience for it because you guys are all a bunch of smart, awesome founders that want beautiful logos, but understand that sometimes you just got to get that first viable option out the door. Once you're ready, you come to me and I help you and it's great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:12):\nA match made in heaven. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJessica Hische (01:21:17):\nHappy to be here. Great convo.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:21:19):\nSo good. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# The social radar: Y Combinator’s secret weapon | Jessica Livingston (co-founder of YC, author)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:00):\nI want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham, \"Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC.\"\n\nJessica Livingston (00:00:10):\nMy three co-founders were deeply technical, but I would look at other things about founders. All these little social cues.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:17):\nYour nickname was the Social Radar. Every interview, everyone always turned to you and they're like, \"Jessica, what does their social radar say?\"\n\nJessica Livingston (00:00:24):\nI would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:33):\nIs there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:00:36):\nHe hated their idea, and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. But I remember specifically Joe brought out the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n McCain's, and I just thought, oh my God, they're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:52):\nYou just talk a bit about this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:00:56):\nDo you sort of need that desperation. You have to burn the boat.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:03):\nToday, my guest is Jessica Livingston. Jessica is the co-founder of Y Combinator, the first and most famous startup accelerator, which since 2005 has funded over 5,000 companies, including over 200 unicorns now worth over a billion dollars, including companies like Airbnb, Stripe, DoorDash, Coinbase, Dropbox, Instacart, Reddit, the list goes on. Jessica is also the author of one of the bestselling books about startups, Founders at Work, and hosts the Social Radars Podcast. She lives in England with her husband, who you may know, and her two sons. In our conversation, we dive deep into Jessica's superpower of being the Social Radar. She got this nickname in the early days of YC because she can read people incredibly well. This becomes a huge unfair advantage when you're evaluating and investing in early stage startups and founders, but also becomes useful in every part of your life. There's actually a quiz that I'm going to link to in the show notes called Reading the Mind in the Eyes that I suggest you take to see how you do, and it'll give you a sense of how well you are at reading people.\n\n(00:02:08):\nJessica got a perfect score, just as an example of her unique talents, reading people's emotions along with her superpower and tips on how you can develop your own social radar. We also talk about her fabulous podcast called The Social Radars, some wild early YC stories, including how the interview with the Airbnb founders actually went down, and so much more. If you enjoy this podcast, don't forget to subscribe and follow it in your favorite podcasting app or YouTube. It's the best way to avoid missing feature episodes and it helps the podcast tremendously. With that, I bring you Jessica Livingston.\n\n(00:02:45):\nJessica, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:02:50):\nThanks, Lenny. I'm glad to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:52):\nI want to start with a quote by someone you may know, Paul Graham. So he wrote, \"A few months ago an article about Y Combinator said that early on it had been a one-man show. It's sadly common to read that sort of thing, but the problem with that description is not just that it's unfair, it's also misleading. Much of what's novel about YC is due to Jessica Livingston. If you don't know her, you don't understand YC.\" I'm hoping with this conversation we help a lot more people understand you. Kind of an implication of this quote that I wanted to ask you about is that there's an implication that you've never gotten the credit that you deserve for starting YC, for helping YC become what it's become. I'm just curious what that's been like for you.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:03:41):\nIt's sort of a hard question. It is true, I was one of the co-founders of Y Combinator, and yet I'm often sort of left out of news articles, Wikipedia people want to take my entry off of Wikipedia all the time. I'm not as notable and I'm sort of like, \"Gosh, I'm a founder of Y Combinator, author of a best-selling book on startups. What does a girl have to do?\" But it is what it is. It's the external views, and it doesn't matter to me. Do you know what I mean? People within YC know what I've done, the Y Combinator alumni know what I've done, my friends and family and people I respect in the Silicon Valley community know what I've done, most of them do. So that's fine.\n\n(00:04:35):\nBut it is true, I've often been sort of erased, and in some cases it's annoying because it's a lot of people who have a certain narrative about Y Combinator that don't want me to exist, I'm maybe making that up a little bit, or the people that don't want me to be part of the narrative are the ones that think that Y Combinator, it's run by white men, only invests in white men. And gosh, if there was a woman on the founding team making choices of who to fund, that would undermine their narrative. So I think sometimes that's what happens too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:05:15):\nFascinating. Just a convenient story to tell sometimes.\n\n(00:05:20):\nThis episode is brought to you by Enterpret. Enterpret unifies all of your customer interactions, from Gong calls to Zendesk tickets, to Twitter threads, to app store reviews, and makes it available for your product team. It's used by leading product orgs like Canva, Notion, Loom, Linear, and Descript to accurately integrate the voice of the customer into your product development process, helping you build best-in-class products.\n\n(00:05:45):\nWhat makes Enterpret special is its ability to build customer-specific adaptive AI models that provide the most granular and accurate categorization of all your customer feedback, and also connect customer feedback to revenue impact, to help product leaders confidently prioritize things that will actually move the needle for your business. If you want a custom model built for your organization so that you can automate your feedback loops and prioritize your roadmap with confidence, get in touch with the team at enterpret.com/Lenny. That's E-N-T-E-R-P-R-E-T dot com slash Lenny.\n\n(00:06:24):\nThis episode is brought to you by Anvil. Their document SDK helps product teams build and launch software for documents fast. Companies like Carta and Vouch Insurance use Anvil to accelerate the development of their document workflows. Getting to market fast is a top priority for product teams. And the last thing that you or your developers want is to build document workflows from scratch; it's time-consuming, expensive and distracts from core work. You could stitch together multiple tools and manage those integrations, or you can use an all-in-one document SDK. Most product managers will tell you, \"Paperwork sucks.\" Anvil's document SDK helps teams get to market fast, incorporate your brand style and give you back time to focus on your company's core differentiated features.\n\n(00:07:11):\nFor your users, paperwork often starts with an AI-powered web form styled and embedded in your application. From there, you can route data to your backend systems and to the correct fields in your PDFs via API. Complete the process with a white labeled e-signature. The best part about Anvil is the level of customization their SDK provides. Non-technical folks love Anvil's drag and drop builder, and developers love their flexible APIs and easy to understand documentation. Build documents software fast with Anvil.

Your podcast is called The Social Radars. I haven't seen you talk too much about this skill anywhere else, and that's what I want to spend our time on together to better understand the skill that you've built of being this social radar. How does that sound?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:08:13):\nI will try Lenny, I will try. I don't talk much about it because it's hard to talk about. I don't understand. It's hard to put into words exactly what it is about me, but it's true that my nickname at Y Combinator was the Social Radar. And I think it was because my three co-founders were deeply technical people, and I was not. But I would look at other things about founders. When we'd have these 10-minute interviews, I would look at, do the co-founders get along? Are these people committed? Do they really know about their product? Do they care? Are they going to quit their job? Or are they telling us that they are going to quit their job, but really aren't? All these little social cues that I'd try to pick up on.\n\n(00:09:10):\nAnd in a lot of cases, red flags about them that I'd add to the decision-making process. And so that's why they called me the Social Radar, and it just sort of stuck. And it's because I love people and the dynamics and understanding what's motivating people. I just love it and I love founder psychology, founders personalities. I am absolutely fascinated with it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:38):\nI love it. Okay, so we're going to try to unpack as much as we can with the context that you're not exactly sure if you're able to articulate exactly how this power of yours works.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:09:46):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:48):\nThere's this line you wrote somewhere, and Paul's written this, and other people, that every interview that you all did early on at YC, everyone always turned to you and they're like, \"Jessica, what do you think? What does their social radar say?\" Can you just talk a bit about that role that you played in the early days of YC of kind of seeing that side of candidates?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:10:06):\nWell, in the early days, especially before I knew a lot, as much as I know now, about startups and founders, early on, I was learning a lot in the first few years. And in the first few years, it was just the four of us. So I would be in charge of going out telling people, \"Wait here while we do the interview, come on in.\" I'd be in charge of the stopwatch that would time us. And I'd say, \"Okay, our time's up.\" And it was very administrative, and I would observe. Paul, Robert and Trevor, my co-founders would be asking them all sorts of questions about their product and their technology and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I would occasionally ask questions, but I'd usually remain pretty silent. And so I don't think people even really noticed me. But I would be just watching them and sort of trying to observe as much as I could, not understanding sometimes even the technology that they were talking about. I let my co-founders do that.\n\n(00:11:06):\nAnd then after, we'd be talking, they'd look at me and they'd be like, \"Should we fund them? Jessica, should we fund them?\" And sometimes I could tell based on the conversation whether they thought that the technology was good or how they felt, and sometimes I'd say, \"Absolutely we should.\" Or sometimes I'd say, \"Guys, I'm a little nervous. Did you see how that founder interrupted the other founder and wouldn't let the other founder talk?\" Because my three co-founders sometimes wouldn't notice this.\n\n(00:11:39):\nThey'd be so caught up in the conversation they were having about the technology, especially Paul. Paul would get really into things. And sometimes I always tease Paul, because one of his defining qualities is that sometimes someone would have an idea that he'd get so excited about that by the end of the interview he'd be giving them ideas about how to grow their product and what they could become. And they'd sit there saying, \"Yeah, yeah, that's a great idea.\" And then he'd say, \"Fund them.\" And I'd say, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa, Paul, you can't just fund this because you love the idea. Let's take a step back and let's look. Like these two founders are working at Google and they don't say they're going to quit. That's not good.\" And I'd point out these things that I had observed. But I mean, we always agreed. It was very rare that we wouldn't agree on funding something. We were usually on the same page.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:33):\nI see. It's interesting that you talk about these behaviors, co-founders interrupting each other, or being kind of aggressive here and there. Some people believe that's okay for founders to be like this. A lot of successful founders, Elon, for example, Steve Jobs, who are kind of assholes a lot of times, I imagine, and I've read part of the reason you thought about just the type of person is you're trying to build a specific culture in the early days of YC and you're going to be around these people. So maybe can you talk a bit about just why those elements were important to you and why'd you look for those?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:13:08):\nI've definitely heard that Steve Jobs could be an. I've heard stories. But I think I would've funded him because he's so incredible and he was so smart and so interested in the product and knew... I'm very persuaded by people who know what they're talking about and love their product and are domain experts. But I did consciously, especially early on, less so later on, early on, I did sometimes tend to say, \"I really think this person's an asshole, I do not want to fund them.\" And we often wouldn't. And very early on when we were just funding 10, 20, 30 startups a batch, sometimes I have been known to say, \"I don't know if I can have dinner with them every week.\" It was that point. And I don't think we've ever regretted any of those. It didn't happen all the time, that was rare. But life's too short, and I wanted to be able to work with these founders.\n\n(00:14:16):\nAnd as it turns out, it was sort of important early on in weeding out explicit assholes because that was the basis of our Y Combinator community, which is now thousands of founders. Now, of course, all the founders aren't all running their company anymore, but I would say most all of the founders bring something useful and valuable to the table. So if you ask a question on Bookface, on our forum for founders, someone is going to be there to help you. And it's amazing. And that all started very early on, there was this culture of older batch mates helping newer ones, and this pay-it-forward mentality where everyone helped one another and rooted for one another and made introductions for each other. And I think it's a big part of our Y Combinator community now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:15:12):\nSo I wrote down a few of the things that you mentioned you look for, and you looked for in the early days. So let me just share a few of them and let's spend a little more time here. So you looked for, did the founders get along? Are they committed to the idea? Are they ready to quit their job? Are there any red flags? So is there anything else that you remember you spent a lot of time thinking about or looking for then or even now?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:15:36):\nThere's looking for in the application and then there's looking for in the interview, and now we have software that looks for all of the red flags in the application that I used to do by hand. In the application, I'd look for just weird things, like was there a huge gap in the equity allocation? Did one founder have 99% and one founder have 1%? That's weird. I'd want to dig in on that. That doesn't feel right. Are they going to quit their job? Are they going to move to Silicon Valley? What are their current shareholders? Is like 90% of their company already owned by someone else? There all these weird things that we like to just flag. And we wouldn't necessarily not fund someone because of them, but it's just more data. So that was in the application that I'd look through all of those.\n\n(00:16:33):\nBut in the interview I definitely was sort of, one thing I remember I would always look for was, when you'd have a conversation with us, a lot of times, Paul especially, but Robert and Trevor, would really be getting right into the idea and questioning you, and how do you know this? And what about this? And if a founder would get defensive, that was always a bad sign, always a bad sign. The best founders would say, \"Gosh, I have thought about it and here's what I figured out.\" Or, they just have this almost a tennis match and a conversation rather than closing up and feeling like, oh, this person's interrogating me. You could just sort of, the open-mindedness, the flexible-mindedness of people was really important. I'd get really excited about domain expertise. Like my co-founders, we all loved that. If someone was fixing their own problem in a broken industry, we loved that.\n\n(00:17:39):\nDefinitely, I'd look for co-founder relationships. And again, I'm not saying I was always right, but you could tell if... One founder, I'll give a story, one founder, once we asked a question and one person started to respond and the other founder put his arm in front of him and said, \"I'll answer that question.\" And it was just so weird that he wouldn't let his co-founder speak. We'd have situations where we'd call people like hackers in a cage, where it's kind of obvious there'd be a business founder, business person, who had clearly convinced a programmer to join the team. They were given, the programmer was given, very little equity and just we called them programmers in a cage, like hackers in a cage. And sometimes that works out, I'm not saying it doesn't. But I'd always try to observe, okay, does this hacker in a cage have any say in the company, the direction of the product? That sort of thing. Because the programmer needs to have opinions.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:18:50):\nIt's so funny. I love this metaphor. And I totally get what you mean. I want to unpack a couple of these, because this is exactly where I was hoping we'd go. So this idea of looking for defensiveness and being open to change and being flexible, why do you think that was so important to successful founders? Why did you look for that? Why was that a predictor of success?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:19:10):\nSeveral things. First of all, being defensive is really bad, if you're a startup founder, because you're always going to get people who question you. And it's your job to educate them, if it's a new area, you're doing something presumably pretty new, you're always going to have people who question it or say, \"That product's already out there, why is yours better?\" You have to educate them. You don't want to be defensive about it. Also, a lot of times, the first idea isn't bang right on, the right idea, and you have to be open-minded and maybe adjust it in a certain direction. The famous PayPal story, how it started off being the PalmPilot, or money transfer. And money transfer between the PalmPilots or whatever. And then all the customers were using a janky version on the web, and they were begging for this to be on the web. And finally, the founder said, \"Oh, I see what most people want this for.\" You have to be open-minded to see what direction really is what your users want. And so if you find someone is defensive, usually they're not open-minded.\n\n(00:20:26):\nThe other thing is that the best founders will want to learn from other people and listen to other people. You talk to the Collison brothers and say something, they ask you a question, they're listening to your answer. So many founders think, oh, I can't learn from anyone. But the best founders are always listening and having spirited debates about things. I mean, that's part of the process. And so I think when someone's defensive, it's just a bad sign. So I would look for that.\n\n(00:21:01):\nI loved when I'd find someone sort of showcase that they'd make something happen no matter what; they're scrappy, they're hustlers. I remember... Can I tell the story about the Airbnb interview?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:21:17):\nPlease.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:21:17):\nOkay, because that was definitely one I'll never forget. That was one that was clear the founders were really good. The market had just crashed basically with all the banks going out of business and everything. And so we were only funding startups that we felt had really scrappy founders and could be cockroaches, meaning could live off of very little amounts of money, or could charge customers and make money. And we didn't fund that many people in that winter '09 batch. So we're being very strict with ourselves, very disciplined about things. And the Airbnb guys came in, and I just remember they had a contagious amount of energy. They just had an energy about them the way that they talked about their product, which was crazy at the time, staying in someone's bed or airbed. In fact, it's a famous part of the story, we hated their idea and Paul tried to get Brian and Joe and Nate to change it. So we didn't even like the idea. But I remember specifically they brought, at the end, Joe brought out these, the cereal boxes, the Obama O's and Cap'n Crunch's or Cap'n McCain's or whatever.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:33):\nCap'n McCain's, yeah.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:22:34):\nYeah, Cap'n McCain's. They were saying that they went to some Costco or something and bought off-brand Cheerios and off-brand Cap'n Crunch's, took them out of the box, put them in this new box, glue-gunned it shut. And I just thought, oh my God, these guys are really going to great lengths for this. And for some reason, it was silly, but it really appealed to me. They're going to work hard to do whatever they can to make this company succeed. And even though we were skeptical about the idea, I think we definitely made the right bet on the founders, and it was just very clear in that interview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:17):\nI'm so happy you shared that story, I was definitely going to ask about it. It's so funny because I've heard that story at least a hundred times working at Airbnb, they tell the beginning of Airbnb every chance they get at every all-hands. It's like a recurring theme. And it's great to hear that basically it went exactly the way they describe. Oftentimes, there's a myth around what happened, but that's exactly how they describe it.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:23:41):\nNo, it was definitely a whole crazy story and how Paul called them to accept them, and they were on the 280 or something or the 101 and the reception went down. And so he didn't hear if they were accepted or not. Did he tell that part?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:23:58):\nNo, I haven't heard that part.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:23:58):\nOh yeah, that's part of the story. And they had to keep driving to get to talk to Paul again and find out that they were accepted. Oh, yeah. It was just a crazy interview.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nThe element of the story I'm also curious about is, the way Joe tells it, is he had the box in his backpack. And as they were walking out, Paul or you is like, \"Hey, what's that? What's that cereal box doing there?\" Is that how it went, or is it more like, \"Hey, we have this cereal thing.\"?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:24:24):\nI don't think Paul and I looked in his backpack and asked. I think there was definitely some pressure on Joe not to show us the cereal boxes. I think Nate was really down on that, especially. And I think they were walking out the door and they're like, \"Hey, we just brought you a little something.\" I think Joe did pull it out, and we had an extra minute or so around the cereal boxes. That's how I heard about the glue gun story and everything. But I think Joe had been reluctant, but he did it at the end and I think it was a good call.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:00):\nThat's so funny. And after that meeting, what was that conversation like between you and Paul? Was it just like everyone's like, \"We definitely got to do this.\"? Or was it like you being like, \"Hey, these guys are really interesting.\"?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:25:10):\nNo, I think we all liked them. We all liked them. But I remember saying, \"We have got to...\" I just remember being like, \"We've got to fund these guys. I don't know about the idea. Maybe they'll change their idea, who knows? But they seem really great.\" Again, the energy level and the passion with which they spoke about their experience hosting, because they'd been around struggling, but had been a company with an idea for a little while before they applied to YC. We were there basically their Hail Mary, their last resort for them. And so they could tell us about their story about how they hosted the people at a conference, and there was definitely some magic to it, which was convincing.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:25:57):\nIs there anything else along the Airbnb story that would be interesting to share while we're on that topic?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:26:01):\nI mean, the only interesting thing as it relates to being the social radar is that there were just some interviews that I remember because I just thought, this is great. These founders are so good. I'm totally convinced. What they're working on might not work, but I feel like it's so worth the bet based on these founders. And that happened. There were definitely a couple other of our most successful companies that I clearly felt that way about. You just feel like they know what they're talking about, they thought about the problem. They're not solving this problem because it's sort of the problem du jour or fun and exciting. Some are very unsexy problems like when Parker Conrad applied with Zenefits, unsexy HR stuff, benefits stuff. But he knew how broken it was and was trying to fix it. And I love stories like that. There was one story in terms of... The one time I did sort of persuade the rest of the group to fund someone was, do you know the company GOAT, the sneaker?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:27:13):\nAbsolutely.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:27:13):\nOkay. When Eddie and Daishin applied, they were not doing the sneaker company, they were doing this group sort of book-a-group-dinner at a restaurant with people you don't know as a way to meet new people. And for some reason, I loved the idea because I thought maybe it could be a secret dating, like a Trojan Horse for a dating sort of site. But I really loved the two founders. And one of the reasons, again, they had this passion about their idea, but they had had this cream puff company before that they had run, and they just told these stories about how hard it was and all this stuff. And I, for some reason, just thought, these are hustlers. These guys are scrappy. They're going to make this succeed. And they didn't make that company succeed, but they pivoted and made GOAT succeed and it's doing really, really well. And I remember that one I definitely had to convince... I mean, not that Paul, Robert and Trevor didn't like them, but I think they really didn't think the idea was that great or just sort of were meh. I was like, \"We have to fund them.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:24):\nI love sharing these stories. If you have more to share, please keep throwing them out there.\n\n(00:28:27):\nSo a few things I've noted so far, of things that you look for, and I think it's important to note this is very early stage evaluation where the founder and the team is, it's incredibly important, because the idea often shifts.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:28:42):\nOh, yeah. This is as early as it gets, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:43):\nYeah. Oftentimes, just an idea, I imagine.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:28:47):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:28:48):\nSo a few things, so far, things that you found to be really valuable to look for. One is this idea of just making shit happen, showing signs of being hustlers, just getting shit done, Obama O's, things like that. And then I think along the same lines, just passion for this idea and just like almost charisma. Is that how you think about it? Or is it just like...\n\nJessica Livingston (00:29:11):\nI hate using the word charisma because there are a lot of charismatic people who are full of baloney, and are just doing a startup because it's a cool thing to do now. And I wouldn't want anyone to get fooled by charisma. There has to be some substance behind that charisma. Of course, we all love talking to more charismatic people than less, and I've certainly talked to my fair share of totally uncharismatic people, but sometimes they're really good founders too. If they know what they're doing and care about the user and are fixing a problem that they have a deep connection to. So I don't want to say someone who's charismatic, but it definitely helps because, as you know, as a founder, you have to do a lot of sales and you have to recruit people and you have to convince investors to fund you and you have to convince users to use your product and all of this stuff. So it does help being charismatic, definitely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:19):\nOkay. So there's being super hustler, making shit happen. Domain expertise, something you've mentioned a few times. Just like having deep domain expertise in an area, and I think that's probably where they probably don't pivot oftentimes, where they've actually have experience in that specific problem.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:30:33):\nThey might pivot a little bit, they might pivot a little in terms of the actual solution. They might be trying to solve a problem and the first attempt doesn't really work. I haven't mentioned earnestness though.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:45):\nOh, do tell.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:30:47):\nEarnestness is one of the most important because earnest, sort of to me, is bucketed with authenticity. And to be a successful startup founder, you have to care so much about the problem you're trying to solve, the users you're serving and being earnest about it is so key to success. There are so many wannabe founders, so many people doing it because it's cool or they think this idea is cool, but they don't really, deep down, have what it takes. And I think we always try to fund earnest people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:31:30):\nWhat does earnest look like in practice? And how does that come across?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:31:33):\nI think it means being sort of humble about... And if you get asked a question in the interview and you don't know the answer, they say, \"I don't know the answer to that. I'd have to think about it.\" Or, \"I don't know the answer. I've given it some thought and here's what I have come up with.\" And they're just honest about things, and they're not trying to do the whole smoke and mirrors thing, which we've definitely gotten people like that, that avoid the question or are doing it for the wrong reasons.\n\n(00:32:08):\nI remember there was one group that were 45-year-old men and they were building an app for teenagers in fashion. And I remember just thinking, we were asking them, \"Why have you chosen teenagers in fashion?\" And it was so clear that they thought they could make easy money, and it wasn't because they cared about fashion. It wasn't because, \"Oh, I have a daughter who's really into fashion and I've seen this need.\" It was just like, they made up the idea. And that is not earnest, that is not authentic to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:47):\nYou talked about it, so there's this earnestness you look for, also not being defensive. There's this also spectrum of confidence and people believing in what they're doing. Do you have any thoughts on just how to find that? What does that look like when they're too defensive versus they're just confident and then they know what they're talking about?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:33:03):\nConfidence is good. You definitely want confidence. It's hard to... I think you can see it when you experience it. Like someone who's confident in answering your questions but isn't defensive, there's definitely a difference. And I don't know, this is why I'm saying it's sort of hard to articulate these things, but confidence means you can say, \"I've thought about that and I don't know the answer.\" That's confidence. And they'll say, \"But here's what I do to try to figure it out. Here are my plans to address that.\" Confidence, I should have put that upfront because that's very important, especially when it comes to fundraising, you cannot go into an investor meeting lacking confidence. You can come into YC's interview lacking confidence, but we will then help you in the next three months to gain more confidence.\n\n(00:33:58):\nAnd by the way, one of the things we do to help people gain more confidence is to make them believe that their startup is a great investment, to help them create a startup that truly is possibly going to make money or at least worth being a good bet. That's the thing, early stage, the best you can offer is like, \"I might not succeed, but I'm definitely a good bet.\" And we help them with their product, we help them with their ideas, and we help them that, by demo day, they can get up on stage and legitimately say, \"We're a good bet and here's why. Let me tell you about our idea.\" And so we definitely help with confidence.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:43):\nAwesome. A couple other things you mentioned earlier, just to unpack a little bit. So being committed, something you look for, and co-founders getting along. In terms of committed, I imagine, these are very practical things. How are they actually going to stick to this? Are they actually excited to work on this? Maybe talk about that a little bit.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:35:00):\nWe all know how hard startups are, but I think you don't really know how hard it is until you actually do it. A lot of people would start a startup still having a job at Google or wherever, and they do it on the side. I do recommend, if people are just getting started and don't want to raise money yet, starting it on the side is a great way to get going, but at some point you have to commit, you have to burn the boat, because we found that founders who were still getting a paycheck and health insurance, once the going got tough, they did not quit their job. And you sort of need that desperation like, \"I have to make this startup succeed because it's my job.\" Not like, \"Oh, I'll just stay at Google.\" You need that. And we found that founders who weren't leaving their jobs, it was just not working out. Or that co-founder would always wind up leaving the company because they didn't want to actually leave their job.\n\n(00:36:01):\nAnd that's fine, there are people that can't leave their jobs for financial reasons. That's fine. You just shouldn't be starting a startup if you're not going to be prepared to leave your job. So that's the leaving of the job thing. And the co-founders getting along, oh my. I spent a lot of my time at Y Combinator when I was there all the time, full time, mediating co-founder disputes. And so many startups died or had near-death experiences because the co-founders didn't get along or broke up. It just happens all the time. And so that's why I think, during interviews, I was desperately trying to search for any clues that the co-founders didn't get along, or if they blatantly contradicted each other. But you could also tell if they were answering, finishing each other's sentences.\n\n(00:36:59):\nI love co-founders that have a history together; either they went to school together, they went to college together, work together, maybe they're siblings. Because when you have a long-term relationship, you trust each other and you know each other's weaknesses, and you're usually on the same page with your aspirations and everything. It's really scary when two founders get together just to start the startup and don't have any history. Massive red flag. Sometimes it works out like in the case of Dropbox, Drew and Arash both went to MIT, but I think they didn't know each other before they started Dropbox, and it worked out. But most of the time it doesn't.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:37:46):\nSo we've talked about co-founders getting along, looking for defensiveness, domain expertise, the sign of making shit happen, earnestness. Is there anything else that we've missed that you look for in the founders that tell you maybe we should, maybe we shouldn't?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:38:02):\nRelentlessly resourceful. Paul wrote a whole essay on that. Every founder is different, I never try to say, \"Oh, this person doesn't have this. I'm not going to fund them.\" You always have to... Everyone's different. But I mean, you're an investor. I'm curious, do any of these things surprise you or do you care about these things too?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:24):\nNo, absolutely not. Absolutely. And I actually try to avoid pre-seed and early stage because I'm not amazing at it, maybe. This is why I want to learn how to build my social radar skill.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:38:37):\nOh gosh, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:38:38):\nYeah. Tough. It's so tough. It's like so few things actually work out.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:38:42):\nWell, it's because you don't have a lot of data. If someone is just applying with an idea, you have very little data. You can look at where they went to college, what have they built in the past, that's always a great predictor of their ability. And so on the YC's application, we ask them, \"What project have you worked on before?\" Or whatever. But it's really hard to tell when you're the first investor.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:07):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta.

Before I was a social radar, I was Detective Livingston. I cannot help myself noticing weird things, just dumb things, like if Paul had on a yellow T-shirt and then an hour later came in with a blue T-shirt, I'd be like, \"Why do you have a blue T-shirt on?\" I have to understand what happened in that hour where that T-shirt is different. Or people's what, their relationships, what drives them? I was always like this, and I think it goes back to my childhood.\n\n(00:40:44):\nI spent hours and hours on the phone with people, with my girlfriends, dissecting situations, and then all through high school, and college, I mean the amount of time we wasted discussing social matters with people, and boys, and things like that. It was just frightening how much time I wasted, but I just was genuinely interested in it. And what drives people and why did this happen? I don't know if I ever noticed I did this, but it was just, my point is, it's always been a part of me. And I definitely notice and having an aversion to phony people. I always have. I've never been one to fall for someone who's super phony and tried to have them as a friend or anything. I just can tell, and ugh, I hate it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:34):\nDo you feel like it's almost all genetic or do you think there was something in your childhood that pushed you to be good at this?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:41:42):\nI don't know. I really don't know. So this is why I think I'm going to be a bad guest, because I can't give a practical understanding. I mean, I don't really think... I can't say other people in my family are like that, and I can't say that it was part of my upbringing. I just notice these things. I don't know. I should be paying attention to other things, but I'm not, but I'm paying attention to this. I'll give you an example with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:41:42):\nPlease.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:42:13):\nSo I looked up your bio to read a little bit about you, and I loved the Dalton Caldwell Podcast. I listened to that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:23):\nFourth most popular of all time.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:42:26):\nDalton's was?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:42:27):\nYes.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:42:28):\nOh, go Dalton. That's awesome. Yeah, it was really good. I learned a lot from it. I love listening to Dalton. But what I really want to know about you is, on the release that you sent, or on the instructions for this podcast, you said, \"There might be some edge cases where your podcast isn't good enough to go out. We just want to warn you.\" And all I could think of is, what prompted that? There has to be a story of what prompted that. No one else would pay attention to that, but I'm just so curious. It's so weird. I'm just a weird person like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:07):\nYes, I did add that. There's a story, basically, it was just an episode that wasn't amazing and we didn't have that caveat in the prep beforehand, and it felt bad to tell the person.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:43:19):\nSee, I knew it. I knew that that had happened.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:23):\nThat's exactly right. Is there kind of a way you've thought about honing this skill over time? Once you kind of got a sense, \"Hey, people keep telling me I'm really good at this.\" Is there something you've done to help strengthen it?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:43:35):\nNo, but one of the things I do try to do is sort of reinforce. Sometimes I'll have a feeling about someone, maybe we fund them, maybe we don't. I'd sort of like to know what happens a few years later. I like to follow up. There definitely have been some situations where I haven't liked someone that we funded and it's taken 5 to 10 years before they failed. And in some cases, for a bad reason. Where I'll say, \"Oh, thank God, I was right about that. I did have this feeling.\" Or, \"I knew they'd be successful.\" Like the GOAT guys who I was saying before, there was definitely a period when Grubwithus, their first startup wasn't doing well, and they were starting, that maybe some people would've given up on them. And now I can say, \"I was right about them. That feeling was right.\"\n\n(00:44:35):\nSo I do try to sort of follow up with some of the really strong gut instincts that I had, to see if I was right. Often, when I have a gut instinct, it's like a negative thing. So we wind up not funding someone. So I really need to know if that person went on to be super successful. And I will answer your question right now, there's no one that I had a strong dislike for that I sort of said, \"We should not fund them,\" that has gone on to be a super success. Thank God.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):\nWow, interesting.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:45:12):\nI mean, it doesn't happen all the time that I really put my foot down, but sometimes I have.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:18):\nAnd this feeling, is it like a visceral body thing for you? Or is it like intellectually, you notice, \"Hey, this guy's interrupting her and this person doesn't...\"?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:45:26):\nMore intellectual. But it does come from inside. I don't know how to hone it. It has to come naturally. You have to have a natural interest in people. And so I'm sometimes not listening to all the words and I'm sort of just observing them, I don't know.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:45):\nHave you ever been tricked by someone where you didn't see something you should have seen? Is there anything there?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:45:52):\nOh, yeah, for sure. I can't really talk about the times I have been tricked just because I don't want to say anything really negative about people, but... Well, there was one example that I do feel comfortable sharing. Ilya Lichtenstein of MixRank. Do you know the guy that stole billions of dollars in Bitcoin from a crypto wallet? Do you not know this crazy, crazy story?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:52):\nPlease share.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:46:21):\nI think he's in the joint now. He was definitely convicted of this, and his wife, and they stole billions of dollars. And I definitely don't remember thinking anything bad about him or thinking he could be that kind of person. So that definitely, there've been some doozies like that, where, did not see that one coming.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:48):\nOh my God. I think what's extraordinary about the fact that that happens rarely is that your interviews are 10 minutes long, and so you have very little time to actually find all these things. And plus, the actual product and the idea and growth strategy and all these things.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:47:04):\nWell, you find a lot can come in reading the application. That's a lot of legwork at the beginning. You read the application. But then the 10 minutes is kind of as long as you need, in most cases. Because we found when they were longer, like 20 minutes, you'd know in 10 minutes and be twiddling your thumbs trying to get through the interview for the next 10 minutes. So we kept them short so we could interview more people. But there have definitely been cases where we've interviewed people, accepted them, and then very soon afterward, we're sort of like, crestfallen like, \"Oh, these people are very limp. What were we thinking?\" Definitely, we've been tricked in that respect all the time. Or, \"Oh gosh, they seem so impressive in the interview and now they're just posers who can't really do anything.\" Definitely, I'm tricked all the time in little ways. Or, I didn't notice two founders didn't get along and then one co-founder goes missing a week into the program or something crazy. There's all sorts of crazy stuff like that that happen.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:14):\nI think in the game you're playing, I would expect some things to slip through.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:48:21):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:48:21):\nYou said that there's been kind of an operationalization of some of the things you used to look for in founders, now that you're not actually in the process. Is there a Jessica-as-a-service sort of thing? What kind of stuff have they built that looks for the sorts of things you used to look for in the interview process?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:48:38):\nNo, it's all just stuff in application that automatically flags certain things. I actually don't remember all of them, but it's just, all it is, is a, \"Please pay attention to this, reader of the application.\" It's not, \"This disqualifies anyone.\" It's, \"Just please pay attention.\" And those are things like I mentioned, a really crazy equity structure, founders not quitting their job, things like that, that it's important that someone is voting on them and then interviewing them knows. Because I would often, some of the questions I'd ask at the end of the interview, I'd say, \"It looks like you have 90% of the stock and your co-founder only has one. Can you tell us why that's the case?\" And maybe they could make a case for it, who knows? But at least I'd ask. So the flags just say, \"Pay attention to it.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:49:37):\nAmazing. So if we were to zoom out, in early stage investing, the main thing you need to get right and evaluate as the founder, the social radar skill that you've had from childhood is such an incredible advantage in doing this well, and you could basically say YC is what it is because of this unfair advantage that you all had in the early days. I'm guessing many people listening to this are like, \"We need a Jessica on our team. We need to build this skill ourselves. We need to figure out how to integrate social radar into our process.\" I know you're going to hate this question, but just, do you have any advice for people that want to try to build the skill, get better at this, notice some of these things?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:50:20):\nI really think that our advantage was that my three co-founders were deeply technical people. And I think a lot of investors back then weren't, didn't have that background. And I think that that background really helped YC choose good founders. So I don't want to make it sound like it was that big of a deal, but advice? Advice for how to hone... I mean, I think just try to pay attention to subtle cues. If you really feel like, gosh, I'm so clueless about these things, try to just tell yourself, \"Okay, I'm going in to evaluate these founders, evaluate this investment opportunity. I know I'm bad at these kind of judgments. I'm going to remember, do they seem like they get along?\" Because there are no trick questions. I don't have any trick questions that you could ask, or it's just paying attention. Have a conversation.\n\n(00:51:26):\nDo they understand their product well? Are they defensive? Maybe have your own little checklist that you think about. You don't have to have it written down, but you think about, and then afterward, you spend some time thinking, were they defensive? When I asked them why this is better than the competitor, how did that go? Or ask them, maybe do have some questions, if you don't know how long they've known each other, ask them that question. \"How did you two meet? Have you ever worked together before? How's it going?\" Just be a little bit more conscious about asking these types of questions to reveal some key information for your investment decision.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:09):\nThat was an awesome summary of a lot of the stuff we talked about. If anyone ever doubts that you are very good at this, Paul tweeted this quiz, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes quiz, that I took, it's incredibly hard. You basically see a bunch of eyes and you're supposed to judge their emotion, and it's really hard. And you got 36 out of 36, which blows my mind.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:52:33):\nI did nail it. I do have to tell a funny story about this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:33):\nPlease.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:52:36):\nSo Paul, sort of late at night, and he emailed me, because I had gone to bed, but I had my thing, and he emailed me. He's like, \"Check out this quiz. I got 25 out of 36. What can you get?\" So I got my computer out because I was like, I have to beat Paul. And I did it, and it was really hard. They'd only show the eyes and then it would say, what is this person thinking? Are they happy, sad? But some of them were really hard to distinguish. Are they irritated or are they angry? It's kind of hard to tell the difference between irritated and angry. And I remember looking into these people's eyes saying, \"What are they trying to communicate to me? Are they irritated with me or are they mad at me?\" Kind of thing.\n\n(00:53:24):\nAnd as I went through, it would tell you if you got it correct. As I almost got to the end, I was like, \"Oh my God, this is going to be a near-perfect score. I have to nail this.\" And when I got 36 out of 36, I was like, \"Yes.\" And I told Paul, he tweeted it. We then, a week later, had this YC event in London, and I swear to God, about 10 people came up to me to talk about this eye quiz and how they had not done well, and what was my secret? It was very amusing. I never thought that anyone would think it was that interesting.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:59):\nI love that there's this thing that totally shows this skill you have that is better than everyone else. I took it, all my friends have taken it after that tweet, and the highest we've gotten is 31 of all the people I know.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:54:11):\nReally?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:12):\nAnd I think when people take it, we'll link to it, they're going to be like, \"How can you get 36 out of 36? Impossible.\"\n\nJessica Livingston (00:54:19):\nYou have to look into their eyes and say, \"What are they trying to tell me?\" I hope you're not trying to tell me you're full of shit with your eyes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:28):\nI'm feeling despondent. Just kidding. That's one of the options. I'm like, \"What does that even mean?\"\n\nJessica Livingston (00:54:32):\nI know. Well, that's the other thing I told Paul, also the challenge is, you really have to understand what each feeling, what that word means. He's like, \"Oh, that didn't even occur to me.\" Because he's such a word person and knows the exact definition of every single word. But I thought some people will struggle understanding the complexities of the emotion.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:54:55):\nWith the words, I almost felt like I had to do what you did where just like, \"What does this word feel like when I'm reading it? Despondent, let's see if these eyes are despondent.\" I love that trick you shared. So basically you looked at the eyes and you're like, \"What is this person trying to tell me?\"\n\nJessica Livingston (00:55:09):\nYeah, that's the best I could do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):\nAmazing. So we're going to link to that quiz. I'm curious what people, if you take it, please leave your score in the comments, see if anyone can get anywhere near Jessica's score. Okay. So speaking of social radar-ing, you have a podcast called The Social Radars.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:55:12):\nYes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:12):\nLet's talk about it.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:55:27):\nYes, okay.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:28):\nFirst of all, just why did you decide to start a podcast? There's a lot of podcasts in the world. What made you decide to start one?\n\nJessica Livingston (00:55:32):\nWell, I'm really excited that you're asking that question because no one has ever asked me about The Social Radars. Yes, I mean, it's pretty new, but we launched last year. I decided to start The Social Radars because I live off in the English countryside, not really as connected as I'd like to be with Silicon Valley, partly by choice, but I do miss it a lot. And I was finding that as I was catching up with YC alumni that would come visit or I'd see, I just loved the conversations we were having, and I missed that. I missed that connection with these people, and sort of sharing their stories of triumph and failure in some cases, but mostly triumph. At the same time, I became obsessed with this podcast called SmartLess. Have you ever heard of it?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:56:20):\nI've heard of it, haven't listened.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:56:21):\nOkay. So just for the listeners, it is a podcast hosted by three actors; Jason Bateman, Will Arnett and Sean Hayes. And they invite Hollywood people, actors, directors, musicians, sometimes athletes, on the show. And the thing is, one person, one of the hosts invites the guests, the other two don't know. So there's no preparation, and it's the most fascinating thing. I love movies and I love television, and I can tell you another weird eccentric gift of mine is I remember every name in Hollywood and know all their children and all this stuff because I've been reading People Magazine since I was 13. So I loved, you'd learn so much about the actors as people because they weren't talking from a script or their media messages for promoting a movie. It was like just genuine conversations. Most of the time these actors knew the people and were friends, and I just found it fascinating. I could not stop.\n\n(00:57:25):\nAnd I thought there should be a really informal conversation like this with startup founders so people could understand the people behind the startups. And it's not too scripted and not too, maybe, I don't want to say professional, because I hope it's professional sounding, but it's very conversational and authentic. I was trying to mimic that a little bit. I convinced my colleague and friend, Carolynn Levy, who of course has a full-time job being one of the amazing lawyers within YC, and she's super busy. I convinced her to do it with me so I could have a partner in crime. And then we just started and I said, \"We'll do a few episodes, see how it goes, and we'll keep going if it's fun.\" And I have had so much fun catching up with all the people I've interviewed. At this point, I forget how many podcasts I've even done, but maybe-\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:58:24):\nI think about 27-ish.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:58:26):\n27 that have launched yet, and there's a few coming out. Season three, we're still in the middle of that, and still editing some and doing some. But it's been so much fun and I love it, and I hope that people enjoy listening. I hope I'm not just working this really small corner of the room. I hope people enjoy unstructured conversations. But people open up to me though, because what I copied from SmartLess that I liked, they'd say, \"Hey, remember when we were at that Oscars party and this happened...\" Because they had that relationship with the people they're interviewing, in a lot of cases, I feel like I've had that with a lot of people I'm interviewing and I could say, \"Hey, Brian, remember when you interviewed and brought the cereal boxes?\" And he could tell, he shared that story. I don't think I knew it before then that they were on the 101 and the phone went out, the reception went out before Paul said that they were accepted. So I learn a lot, and it's really just fascinating to me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:27):\nWell, it's an awesome podcast, I've been listening. I'm going to just read some of the guests that you've had on, just so people get a sense of who you're interviewing. So you actually just had Paul Graham on the podcast. He does very few podcast episodes. So that's an unfair advantage you have there. Patrick and John Collison, Brian Chesky, you mentioned Brian Armstrong, Emmett Shear, Tony Xu, like epic people.\n\nJessica Livingston (00:59:48):\nEmmett Shear, by the way, the week after he was named OpenAI CEO for like 72 hours, that one launched. I was like, I could not have planned that timing better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:59:58):\nIs there an episode you'd recommend people start with if they were start to explore your podcast and get into it?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:00:04):\nHonestly, I truly believe this, I'm not BS-ing you, I think they're all really, really good, and there's so many interesting takeaways from every single one. If I were coming to it for the first time, I'd probably choose, I'd look at the guests and say, \"Who am I interested in? Have I stayed at an Airbnb and I want to learn more about that?\" Or, \"Do I use Reddit?\" Just see who the guests are and start with someone you're kind of interested in, and I guarantee you'll learn more about this person.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:34):\nSo across the podcast episodes you've done, I hate when people ask me this question, but I'm going to ask you this question. Is there any big lessons you've learned, any stories that have stuck with you? Any takeaways so far from interviewing all these incredibly successful founders and people?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:00:48):\nMy God, I love that question. I don't hate that question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:48):\nOkay, I'm glad.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:00:52):\nI could talk for an hour just on... I want to learn from you as an expert podcaster, because I'm still a noob here. What I've learned the hard way, and you probably will nod your head when I say this, is that I talk way too much. I'm a huge windbag and I hate... I don't notice it now when I'm just talking to you and going off and talking, talking, talking. But when I'm editing the podcast and I'm listening to myself ask a question in 20 sentences when I could ask it in two. So I've really had to train myself to keep things short. You want regular short dialogue, you know this, but you also have to interrupt guests if they're going off too much. So the talking of the hosts should be frequent but short. That's the lesson that I've learned.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:52):\nTotally agree.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:01:46):\nIn terms of content, every single episode is a gem in its own right, and there aren't massive lessons because they're all sort of specific to that person, and I never know exactly which direction we're going to go in when we get into things. But it was interesting. There were definitely some themes with Adora Cheung and Tony Xu of DoorDash where they said they really made a mistake early on scaling into different cities before they had nailed the original city. And that's an important lesson. There's lessons for everyone, I think. In addition to really getting to know these founders, their personal side of their personality, there's some great lessons that they all tell.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:36):\nI love these lessons. Is there anything else you've learned about interviewing? That's something I'm always trying to get better at. I love this point you made. I say the same thing to every podcaster. You talk too much as a host, you should let the guest talk. Just ask the question and let them talk. Is there anything else that you've learned about just how to interview more effectively?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:02:54):\nRemember, I've been interviewing people since YC started because I was working on Founders at Work simultaneously when we started YC, and so that was a collection of interviews. And back then, I can't say I was that good at it. I've gotten much better. And then I've since gone, I used to do a lot of interviews at startup school on stage with people, and now the podcast. I think one thing that is that the guests trust me. They trust that I'm not going to try to have a gotcha moment. I'm not trying to lure them into saying anything controversial. Do I love it when they say something that hasn't been said before? Yes. But I'm not trying to trick them.\n\n(01:03:37):\nAnd just like you, I tell them, \"You will have a chance to review this before it goes public.\" And I think that disarms people and they say, \"Okay, I can open up because I know if I regret saying something, it's not like talking to a reporter who's going to publish it.\" I care about them. I care about making them look good, and I'd never want to betray their trust, and they know that. So that's part of it too. For me, with the podcast, I have some questions that I do ahead of time just so I have something down, but I also just let the conversation go where it's going, and we get into some random tangents that I find are really fascinating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:04:26):\nIs there a story that stand out to you just that sticks with you from the interviews that just like, \"Wow, that was such an incredible story someone shared with me,\" or, \"a lesson learnt.\"?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:04:29):\nThe podcast that really sticks with me is the Parker Conrad episode, of Rippling, but we spent a lot of time on Zenefits because if you didn't follow that story years ago, the press annihilated him. And in talking to him, I learned why. There was a smear campaign paid for by someone still at Zenefits. There were legal threats made to force him to sign this legal document that would allow them to have a non-compete in California so that he couldn't another company, basically making his life miserable, disparaging him. Stories planted in the press. And I had him come on and I had him tell what really happened.\n\n(01:05:29):\nAnd even I, who have seen so much shit behind the scenes with startups in Silicon Valley over the years, stuff you just couldn't believe. This was unbelievable. And the thing that really sticks with me is that no reporter ever, maybe no reporters listened to it, but no one said, \"Hey, I got that wrong years ago. I shouldn't have written that. That wasn't true. Let me set the record straight.\" So he doesn't care. Parker's moved on, he's successful with Rippling, he doesn't think about this stuff. But I do. I care about justice. And it was a horrible thing that was done to him and it affected his health, it affected his life, and I just am glad to have sort of been a conduit to set the record straight.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:06:24):\nThat's an awesome episode maybe for people to start with if they want to check out the podcast. And then generally, I just love this rise of ways for tech people to share their story without this drive to create clicks and create gotcha moments and things like that. Just this, I think people call it techno optimism, this idea of just like tech is great, technology is doing great things for us, let's just tell these stories in a really positive way versus look at all the harm they're causing, technology stop, slow it down.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:06:50):\nAnd I just want to have conversations that I personally find interesting. I'm very selfish about it, Lenny. As long as I have an interesting conversation, I tell Carolyn this all the time, as long as we have 20 listeners, that's all I need. 20 really interested listeners, we'll keep doing it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:10):\nI love that attitude. I wish I had that same feeling. What I look for is, is it growing? That's the thing. I'm like, is it growing at least? If it's growing, no matter what it is, I'm feeling good.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:07:20):\nI need to be a little bit more like that. I don't know any of my statistics. What statistic, you tell me as an experience podcaster, what statistics should I have taped up to my mirror every day and track?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:34):\nThere's the correct one and there's a simple one that I look at, which is just downloads of the episode. It's the most basic one you see everywhere. And downloads is a weird one because they might download and not listen to it, but that's just the one that podcast platforms tell you how many people have downloaded it. And that's the one that just tells you generally, are people listening? Are people continuing to listen? Did they remove it from their phone? In theory, you should be looking at retention like how many people are finishing the podcast episode?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:08:02):\nCan you tell that though? I thought these platforms don't share that with you.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:06):\nSome do, some do. Spotify gives you some of that. Apple, gives you. The worst part about podcasting is the analytics are extremely bad and inconsistent, but there are some of those stats. The other one, okay, here's one to pay attention to, is number of subscribers on the different platforms, people that follow you. That actually is a really important metric to watch.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:08:26):\nNumber of subscribers, okay. One thing I also, this is just my personality, I can't bring myself to do what I want to, is ask people if you like The Social Radars, please subscribe and leave a rating and a review. I would do anything to have people leave rating and reviews.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:46):\nIf you're listening and you either checking out the podcast or you're already a listener, please leave a rating and a review and subscribe and follow.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:08:54):\nThank you. Can I ask you a question about podcasting really quickly?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:58):\nSure, let's do it.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:08:59):\nWhen you do a podcast, after you hang up with a person, can you tell, do you have a gut instinct like, \"Oh, that was a really great \"?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:07):\nWhat's interesting is, the ones that I sometimes think, holy moly, that was incredible, don't do as well as I would think. And sometimes ones I think didn't go amazing, actually do a lot better than I think. And I think there's a difference between the energy and the fun of it versus the content and the interesting value of the actual conversation. And so sometimes you feel like that was so fun, so good, I loved it, but people are like, \"Nah, I didn't learn anything.\" So those are interesting. That's something I've learned.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:09:37):\nOkay. Yeah, because people come to yours expecting to learn things. Now I'm a little nervous, I'm going to get axed because I'm not teaching them anything valuable.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:46):\nYou're so modest. This was incredible. I think we've taught people a lot of really important and really actionable things and I know you don't think you did, but you did. And with that, we've covered a ton of ground. We've talked through every single thing that I was hoping we talked through. Is there anything else you wanted to share or maybe leave listeners with before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:10:08):\nNo, I mean, honestly I can't think of... I think I windbagged enough.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:14):\nThis was incredible. You talked exactly the right amount of time. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:10:24):\nReady as I'll ever be.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:26):\nOkay. First question, what are two or three books that you recommended most to other people?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:10:31):\nWell, I definitely would recommend my first, second and third books would all be P.G. Wodehouse books. Do you know him as an author?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):\nNo.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:10:41):\nAsk Jeeves. Okay, so he was an old school author and he wrote the Ask Jeeves books about the Butler and Bertie Wooster.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:52):\nNot the search engine.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:10:54):\nThey're so funny and fabulously written. His use of words makes me laugh so hard. And so I would specifically recommend the starter books that... He wrote tons of books and he lived till he was like a hundred. Start with Very Good, Jeeves or Right ho, Jeeves, Carry On, Jeeves. Those three are really good books. And then I tend to read, so Paul's the big reader in the family, he reads riveting books on Roman grains and anything that has to do with medieval history. I tend to read biographies of people, especially musicians, especially English musicians, strangely. And so I've recommended, to a lot of people, if you really want a good autobiography, because I sometimes hate autobiographies because I feel like people hold back and don't really share everything. Keith Richards, his autobiography called Life, is really good if you're a fan of the Rolling Stones at all. That was really good.\n\n(01:12:04):\nAnd then I recently read Barbra Streisand's biography called, I think it's called, My Name is Barbra something, and I kept thinking as I was reading this, every female founder should read this book. And you're looking at me like that's so random, but it's because she was such a success within this totally male-dominated world of Hollywood and just treated like garbage and dismissed and called a diva when she was very particular about something. Whereas, a man would be called a great director and she was called a diva, and I felt like every woman should just read this to inspire them. It was such a great book. Long, but very good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:52):\nIncredible recommendations. Next question, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:12:57):\nI don't tend to watch recent movies. I watch old school movies from the 50s through the 90s and stuff. My favorite new TV show, just off the top of my head right now, is Clarkson's Farm. Have you heard of that, on Amazon?\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:13:12):\nNope.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:13:13):\nJeremy Clarkson, he's in the show called Top Gear. I don't watch that. But he lives out in the English countryside. He has a farm, and he decided that he'd farm it. And the whole show is about him getting into this business that he knows nothing about, everything goes wrong, but it is hysterical and heartbreaking at the same time. I've learned so much about England and about where I live and the crops that are grown, and how hard it is for farmers. He's really shone a light on the difficulty of being a farmer these days and it's fabulous. Clarkson's Farm. And it has some bad language in it, but I do recommend that kids watch it, because it's just a good show to watch as a family if you can deal with a little foul language. The Brits drop a lot of F-bombs.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:09):\nDo you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to, share with people, find useful in work or in life?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:14:16):\nIt's so boring, but I always try to treat people the way I'd like to be treated myself, really, is fundamental life lesson.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:26):\nIt's like boring but so powerful and important. And I try to live that same way. And I think it's a good reminder to people, sometimes the most, I think it was Michael Pollan had said that, \"Cliches are cliches because they're so true.\" They're so true, we're tired of hearing it. Sometimes it's important to be reminded of them. Who's most influenced you in your career? Who do you think of when you're like, this person's really had the most influence on me?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:14:51):\nIn my career, I definitely have to say my husband, Paul Graham. I've just learned so much from him over the years, and he's such a good person and I think people who know him, all know that he is. It's just, he has such a big online personality either through Twitter or through his essays. And so he has a lot of people that don't like him, because he also speaks what he believes. And he is not afraid to say anything if he believes it's true and needs to be said. Whereas, I'm the exact opposite. I'm like, \"Oh, I'm not going near that. I'm not touching that with a ten-foot pole. I don't even want to get in someone's crosshairs or fight with someone.\" And I admire that so much. There's so much that he's done with Y Combinator and just in our personal life that is just so admirable and I've really learned a lot from him.\n\n(01:15:53):\nIt's such a boring thing to learn from your husband, but at the same time, I'm going to extend this, I'm going to windbag a little bit longer. I have learned so much from the founders that we funded. Some of them are just incredible people and have been through so much and survived so much and built these amazing companies that I couldn't have even imagined when we funded them, that these companies would be as successful as they are, and they're all, so many of them, are just great people. And they now teach me things, honestly. Like Brian Chesky teaches me things. The student has become the master. He knows so much more about me and running a business, and I often will go to him for advice. And so I'm really lucky to be surrounded by so many smart people in the startup world, because as a startup nerd, I could talk about startups and think about them all the time, and it's so great to have all these people around sort of lifting me up.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:16:58):\nWould you believe that a cereal experience led to a 92 billion business today? I just looked it up, how big they've gotten.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:17:09):\nHonestly, I wouldn't. I wish I could say, \"Oh, I knew they'd be this big.\" But the truth is, with all of the super successful startups, yeah you can remember feeling very positively about them and certainly feeling like, as they went along in the first few years, like they're doing really well, they're really determined, they're doing a great job, but you just never really think. They themselves, probably didn't realize that they'd ever be that big. Let's face it. That's just the way startups are.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:43):\nOkay. Here's the actual final question. Is there a fun story of early days YC, whether it's with Airbnb founders or Paul or anything that comes to mind as just like, wow, what a different time that was, or what a surprising thing that happened then?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:17:58):\nIt's funny you ask, because actually one of my ideas I've had lately is that I want to start thinking about writing sort of a YC biography kind of book. I don't know when the time is, but the point is, I have to remember things because it's hard. When it's been 20 years to go way back, you have to remember specific things that happened. YC, I just remember the early days being so magical and so pure. When we started, no one knew about us, no one was bothering us. We just did what we were doing with no distractions. We were helping, albeit a very small group of founders, eight in that first summer, we were just doing what we loved doing and growing organically. And no one was scrutinizing us or blaming us for things or writing negative news stories about us. The negative stories in the press, because I'm a people-person and I'm very sensitive, Paul's not as sensitive as me, and so he doesn't care if there's a negative story in the press that's not true.\n\n(01:19:09):\nI do. It really affected me, and I hated when we got big enough that people would lie about us and say bad things. So I look back fondly when we first started of it was the most fun time of my life, the most productive time of my life, didn't have kids then, and I could just help the founders and learn about all these exciting things that happened in the startup world, because it was new to me then, the startup world was new when we started Y Combinator, so I had a lot of learning to do. And I met all these cool people, and it was just very authentic, no one was doing it to be cool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:19:48):\nOkay. Well, let me ask maybe one other question. Was there a moment when you felt like YC was working? When it felt like, wow, maybe this is going to make it?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:19:56):\nThere were sort of two moments that I remember I felt like YC was working, because remember, we started Y Combinator as 100% like an experiment. Could we fund younger founders with small amounts of money? That was it. Then that summer we created this batch investment idea, and then that became the idea of funding them in batches. And that was the first aha moment was after that first summer when we invited people to participate in the Summer Founders Program, which is what it was called. And remember, that first summer had Sam Altman, Emmett Shear, Justin Kan, Alexis and Steve of Reddit, they were in the first batch. And the batch thing worked really well because they all became friends. We could have dinner every week, and bring in guest speakers and then introduce them to investors at demo day, and that whole batch-investing thing was an aha moment and we said, \"Oh my gosh, let's keep doing this. This really works.\" And so that was a moment where we knew we were onto something, and that's when we then did it in California in the winter.\n\n(01:21:11):\nBut the second big moment was probably, I remember it was like a year later, and no reporter would write about us, investors really didn't think that much of us, but I remember when Reddit got bought by Condé Nast in 2006. It was that, and then at the same time, I think it was like Charles River Ventures or one of these Boston, maybe it wasn't even Boston, but it was a VC firm, did the seed program where they invested maybe a 100K in startups, and the press loved that. They wrote all about this $100,000 investment, and they'd sort of mentioned Y Combinator as doing small investments. And then that, coupled with the Reddit press, sort of made us feel like, oh my gosh, we are sort of legitimate, and the eyes of outsiders became sort of aware of who we were. And I sort of felt like we've arrived, we've been in the press, people are finally paying attention.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:17):\nThat's amazing. And it's funny that Reddit just went public, it's kind of the other side of that coin.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:22:21):\nI know. Pretty impressive. Definitely didn't necessarily think that was going to be happening.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:22:27):\nI know you have to run, but I can't help but ask around what you just talked about where you decided to invest in batches. You wrote this really interesting point that none of us had any experience angel investing, and that's where the idea of funding startups and batches came from. We decided to fund a bunch of startups at once during the summer so that we could learn how to invest. And I love that your inexperience in doing it, created this structure. That unique weakness/strength is what led to the way YC operates, and I think that's really interesting.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:22:59):\nYeah, we definitely wanted to learn more about how to be investors, so that's when we decided to do this summer founders program where we could invest in a whole bunch at once, and then the plan was to go to asynchronous investing like normal investors, but we realized that there was something magical about this batch thing. So sometimes, I always say we love domain experts, but sometimes maybe ignorance is sort of bliss and you just discover new things.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:27):\nJessica, this was everything I hoped it would be. We covered so much ground. I think people are going to love it no matter what you think.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:23:33):\nOh, good. Good, good, good.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:23:35):\nTwo final questions. Where can folks check out The Social Radars and anything else you want people to know about? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJessica Livingston (01:23:41):\nWell, you check out The Social Radars on all the podcast platforms; Apple, Spotify, Amazon, all of those. And then there's a website, socialradars.com. And they can be helpful by just listening to it and spreading the word because I don't do any marketing for it besides posting on Twitter, just because it's expensive doing a podcast and stuff. So I don't do any marketing. So if it resonates with you, if you find an episode interesting, please spread the word and write a review and rating.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:21):\nI was just going to add that, I'm glad you threw that in there. Jessica, thank you so much for being here.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:24:25):\nThank you so much, Lenny. It was a lot of fun.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:28):\nSame for me. Bye, everyone.\n\nJessica Livingston (01:24:30):\nBye.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:24:32):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Building minimum lovable products, stories from WeWork & Airbnb, and thriving as a PM | Jiaona Zhang\n\n## Transcript\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:00:00):\nI think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. You could be known for shepherding like the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking. Working with go-to--market teams and cross-functional stakeholders that could be like your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems, find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.\n\nLenny (00:00:43):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is JZ. JZ is senior vice president of product at Webflow. She's also a lecture at Stanford, teaching a course on product management. Before this, she was senior director of product management at WeWork, a longtime product leader at Airbnb, where I got to work with JZ for a number of years and she's also PM at Dropbox and at a gaming company called Pocket Gems.\n\n(00:01:12):\nIn her conversation, we dig into the most common mistakes early product managers make in their career. Plus JZ's biggest product mistake. We cover the concept of minimal lovable products versus minimal viable products. We talk about JZ's unique frameworks for road mapping and prioritization and OKRs and her take on how to structure your first 90 days as a product leader at a new company, plus what she's learned from her wild year at WeWork. Also, the best advice she's ever gotten around product and leadership and the story of Airbnb Plus and where it went wrong.\n\n(00:01:43):\nI've been hoping to get JZ on the podcast for a while and I'm really happy that we finally made this happen. With that, I bring you JZ after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:53):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Brave Search and their newest product, the Brave Search API, an independent global search index you can use to power your search or AI apps. If your work involves AI, then you know how important new data is to train your LLMs and to power your AI applications. You might be building an incredible AI product, but if you are using the same datasets as your competitors to train your models, you don't have much of an advantage. Brave Search is the fastest growing search engine since Bing, and it's 100% independent from the big tech companies. Its index features billions of pages of high quality data from real humans and it's constantly updated thanks to being the default search engine in the Brave browser.\n\n(00:02:35):\nIf you're building products with search capabilities, you're probably experiencing soaring API costs or lack of viable global alternatives to Bing or Google. It's only going to be become harder to afford these challenges. The Brave Search API gives you access to its novel web scale data with competitive features, intuitive structuring and affordable costs. AI devs will particularly benefit from data containing thorough coverage of recent events. Lenny's podcast listeners can get started testing the API for free at brave.com/lenny. That's brave.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:10):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online collaborative whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours. The best way to see what Miro is all about and how it can help your team collaborate better is not to listen to me talk about it, but to go check it out for yourself. Go to miro.com/lenny. With the help of the Miro team, I created a super cool Miro board with two of my own favorite templates, my one-pager template and my managing up template that you can plug and play and start using immediately with your team. I've also embedded a handful of my favorite templates that other people publish in the Miro verse.\n\n(00:03:45):\nWhen you get to the board, you can also leave suggestions for the podcast, answer a question that I have for you, and generally just play around to get a sense of how it all works. Miro is a killer tool for brainstorming with your team, laying out your strategy, sharing user research findings, capturing ideas, giving feedback on wireframes, and generally just collaborating with your colleagues. Actually used Miro to collaborate with the Miro team on creating my own board, and it was super fun and super easy. Go check it out at miro.com/lenny. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\n(00:04:22):\nJZ, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:04:24):\nThanks for having me. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:26):\nIt's 100% my pleasure. Amongst your many accomplishments, you teach product management at Stanford, which sounds very fancy. How long have you been doing this at this point?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:04:37):\nI think six years. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:04:40):\nOkay. So my question, the real question I want to ask about this is, in that time you've seen a lot of new PMs and you've seen these PMs succeed, you've seen some fail. What are the most common mistakes that you find new PMs make in this experience of helping new PMs get into the field?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:04:56):\nI think something that is really hard to untrain, but I think every human does it, is you jump to solutions. And so one of the biggest things I see, not just in my course but also just as a PM and some of the mistakes that you make as a PM is the idea of you get really attached to a solution, a way of implementing something that you can see in your head that you want to build.\n\n(00:05:16):\nAnd so that's the first thing I really want to unteach in our course. And so a lot of people will literally come in, they'll be like, \"I want to build X startup\" or \"I want to do this thing,\" or \"I'm in blank school and I've been doing a lot of research on this particular area.\" And so untraining that and being like, \"Hey, we're going to go out there. We are not going to think at all about the thing that you want to build, but instead we're going to be focused on users and people in the real world and their problems. And the first step is to understand their problems and then understand if there's an opportunity here as opposed to, 'Hey, you want to build X thing for Y person.'\" So that's the biggest mistake that you really have to unteach and retrain thinking around.\n\nLenny (00:05:55):\nDoes a lot of this come from people want to get into product management because they think \"Finally I'll have the power, finally I'll be able to tell people what to build, finally my ideas really going to matter?\" Is that where a lot lobby comes from?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:06:06):\nI think there's a part of that. One of the first things I teach is you're not a CEO, you're, you're not here... You actually have very little true authority because you don't actually manage anyone. A lot of it is all through influence, and so that is also a piece where you have to kind of untrain that thinking. I do think a lot of people come into the product role thinking that I get to call the shots, I get to make the decisions, I get to decide what gets built. And really your job is not that. Your job is to understand here are the opportunities, and then you're kind of pulling together all the different possibilities and you're really editing. So I do think it comes from desire for a lot of people thinking that's what the product role is when it actually isn't.\n\nLenny (00:06:44):\nSo let's go to the other side of this question. We talked about what mistakes new PMs make. I'm curious, what's the biggest product mistake that you've made?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:06:53):\nWow, that's a good one. It's so interesting. I feel like as product people, we're always making mistakes and we're always learning. Maybe I'll give an example from Airbnb since you and I were both there. And this one does stand out to me, we were working on this concept called Airbnb Plus. If you took a step back, what we were really trying to do is to be like, \"Hey, not everyone trusts Airbnb in terms of... It's a platform. It's not like it's managed inventory, it's not a hotel. How do you go in and really make sure that all the Airbnbs are meeting the quality bar?\" But I do think we were very solution-first, and I think we're also competitor afraid at the time. So it was during a time where there were managed marketplaces, there were the Sonders out there, and I think that as a company we're very much like \"[inaudible 00:07:36] what are we going to do in the world of managed marketplaces?\"\n\n(00:07:38):\nAnd so we went really hard down the solution space. We essentially were like, \"Let's go inspect our inventory, let's actually try to manage our inventory more.\" And really what we should have done is taken a step back and be like, \"What's the real problem? The real problem is people want to know what they're getting themselves into. We need to represent the homes a lot better.\" And I think the other piece here that's really important is, what, as a company is your strategic strength and what's in your wheelhouse? So for example, Airbnb, we weren't that strong in operations. Again, we're this platform with this marketplace. And so if you don't have that muscle and then you're asking the company, the teams to essentially build it from the ground up, that's really, really difficult. Not to mention the unit economics, are the unit economics actually going to work even as you scale?\n\nLenny (00:08:22):\nYeah, I feel like Airbnb Plus is an untold story that somebody should tell and that could be its own podcast, I guess.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:08:28):\nYou and I can tell it.\n\nLenny (00:08:30):\nWe could tell this could be Airbnb Plus The Hidden Story. As you said, the problem it was trying to solve was people don't really trust... They don't want to even consider Airbnb because it's like, \"No, I don't want to stay in someone's home. I don't know what it'll be. It's unpredictable.\" And so as an outsider, it felt like a really clever approach. \"We're going to vet them, we're going to make sure they're awesome. There's a minimum bar.\" And I guess this is the question is do you think it was just like \"This is never possible because we'll never make money as a business doing this because we don't make that much per booking and investing time, resources, sending people pillows, all that stuff is ever going to be economical\"? Or do you think there was a path that was just not executed well?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:09:10):\nI think there wasn't really a clear path. I think there was less of-\n\nLenny (00:09:10):\nYeah, that's my impression.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:09:15):\nExactly. And it was more just like if you understood... Again, this is what my point around unit economics, there are things where I think you have magical thinking around unit economics. You're like, \"When we get to the scale of X, it's all going to work out. We can make these things happen.\" I think you actually need to really make sure that unit economics work quite at the beginning. That is definitely one lesson. And I think the other thing is, and going back to spirit of what are you trying to achieve. If you're trying to achieve this idea of really knowing the quality of the place, and for a platform like Airbnb, the right way to go about doing is through our reviews, through our guest reviews, which are essentially free as opposed to literally sending out inspectors.\n\n(00:09:51):\nAnd I think that the other things are if you can get signal on what are the things around quality that people care about, is it cleaning? Is it, \"Hey, I'm locked out\"? And I think that there are other solutions besides inspection that then get at that. So for example, it is actually cheaper to go send everyone a lockbox than to deploy an inspector and go look at your property. It is actually cheaper to maybe do a partnership with a bunch of cleaners in different local areas and then get that as part of the fee, as opposed to doing the inspection. So again, it's really about what are you really trying to achieve? What is the user problem in each of these areas and can you target that problem with the particular listing that you're looking at?\n\n(00:10:33):\nAnd so I personally don't believe the unit economics ever would've really worked out. I think we should have known that or we should have dug into that more at the very beginning and then to get very tailored instead of one blunt instrument to solve it all, \"Hey, we're going to go inspect.\" It's like what is the problem for this listing and what's the best solution to fix that problem?\n\nLenny (00:10:51):\nThere's a couple things that I think are important product leadership lessons here. One is Airbnb and Brian and many great leaders are famous for imagining the ideal situation, imagining the great end result and then working backwards. And often that leads to great results when you're being really ambitious and \"I don't know how we're going to get there, we're just going to shoot big and hopefully we figure it out.\" Sometimes it works out. In this case it didn't work out. And what you're finding, maybe you even knew this early on, is just like there's no possible world where this could have worked in this approach. Is there anything you've learned about just when to think big and not even like \"Forget it. We're going to figure it out. I know this seems impossible, but we're just going to try it anyway\"? Do you have any kind of framework of when to think big, then just go for it? Versus, \"Oh, let's just work out the math today,\" is this ever possible?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:11:42):\nI think it's really important for every company to be dreaming big. If you don't have a big vision, it's really hard for you to innovate, but you got to couple that really big vision with thoughtfulness around your execution. And so I think that one of the biggest tips I have is how do to be clear about the phase that you're in? So I think it's totally fine to be like, \"Hey, we are going to try X for six months, three months, whatever it is, and we're explicitly going to go learn these types of things. We're going to learn why are people? Are there signals that we would that would indicate that again, the communication with host isn't great or this type of listing, if it's hosted by a person with multiple property?\" I think there are factors we can be like, \"Hey, we can learn this very explicit thing in a given period of time.\"\n\n(00:12:32):\nAnd you can do what I call unscalable things in that prototyping phase, in that early phase to go learn those lessons. But you just have to be very, very clear with your team on what phase you're in. \"Hey, we're in the learning phase and we explicitly are trying to learn these things\" versus, \"Hey, we have this really big vision and we're just going to go at it.\" That is not recommended in my mind. It's breaking it down into these smaller chunks. That I think gets you the balance of thinking really, really big, but also being able to be like, \"Okay, we are still going to be able to say, 'Okay, this path is not going to work out. We ran at it for a short period of time. We got these learnings, now let's go down this other path.'\"\n\nLenny (00:13:11):\nYeah, there's also some cost fallacy that kicks in of just like, \"Oh, I spend so much time and money and resources on this thing. Let's just go a little bit longer. Let's just see if we give it another quarter, maybe it'll work out.\"\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:13:21):\nYou should articulate what success looks like and the milestones you want to hit in the small intervals that I talked about. So you don't get into this world where you're like, \"Hey, I've gone for two years investing in this thing. Now we got to cut it.\" It's like, what is the quarter long milestone? Okay, what's the next quarter long milestone? And every single point, what is a go and no-go? And I think that really can help a team and a company say \"It's okay. I invested a quarter in it, but I didn't invest two years.\"\n\nLenny (00:13:46):\nThe other important lesson here is about the importance of as a product leader pushing back and convincing leadership that you are wrong and this shouldn't happen. I remember talking to one of our colleagues, Mike Lewis, who was leading a different team with Airbnb, and he was just like, \"Oh, I realized I'm the person that should be saying, 'No, we shouldn't do this now'\" because he was the head of product for one of the new [inaudible 00:14:09]. And I know maybe in that situation it was impossible because Brian was very into this and everyone was like, \"We need to do this thing.\"\n\n(00:14:18):\nI guess is there anything you've learned about how to push back on these sorts of things that the founder's really into when it makes sense to go along? Like \"Cool, let's do it. Let's buy in.\" As a leader, you have to be excited and he needs to feel like, \"Oh, JZ is really excited about this too. We got to try it.\" Even though maybe you feel like it's not going to work out. So I guess the question is when do you think it makes sense to try convince the founder, \"No, this is the bad idea\" versus like \"Let's go for it\"?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:14:42):\nI think first it comes down to your conviction. Do you actually have conviction that this is a bad idea or are you personally still learning? Right. I think if you're at the point, if you're like, \"I have total conviction,\" then your job is to say, no, you really... If you do not, you're not doing your job. And then the question is what are the tips in how to convince someone who's very bought into an idea that that's not the right idea? And there what I would say is it's understanding the spirit of what they're trying to achieve. Being able to go back with, \"Hey, I understand the spirit. The spirit is that we're trying to get people who previously didn't consider Airbnb before to come and use Airbnb, but the right way to do it is not this very time-intensive, cost-intensive way to inspect all these homes. The way to do it is to be much more granular in what we ask people when they upload their home and more checks in that. And that could be automated and through technology as opposed to through humans.\"\n\n(00:15:37):\nIt's coming back with actual options. It's like saying... And I think we did that a little bit to be honest, when we as a team evolve, we learn and we're like, \"This isn't going to work.\" And I explicitly moved off the team and I was like, \"I'm going to work on the review system. I'm going to continue to evolve this and make it better because that is the actual scalable way to do this as opposed to keep going at it in the very manual process.\"\n\n(00:15:59):\nAnd so I think that the biggest tip I would have for people in this situation is really understand whether it's the founder or your manager or whoever it is, what is it that they're trying to accomplish for the user and for the business? Remind them of that, get aligned on that. And then come back with better options. A lot of these people, they're very smart and they're very motivated. They ultimately want to just do the right thing for their users. When you come back with a much better solution and you have the data and you have the thinking behind it's very rare that someone will be like, \"I still want to go after this solution despite the fact that it's not working and you proposed a much better path forward.\"\n\nLenny (00:16:37):\nAnd I think to touch on what you've already said is also make sure it's actually... There's a world where this could work. Do some math to figure out if this is a business that will actually make some money in the future.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:16:49):\nTotally.\n\nLenny (00:16:50):\nOkay. I'm going to bounce around a little bit. I have a bunch of different questions around different topics. You popularized this concept of minimal lovable product versus this idea that everyone always comes back to, which is minimal viable product. Can you just talk about what is a minimal lovable product and then when does it make sense to go in that direction versus a traditional MVP?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:17:10):\nThe reason I care so much about minimal lovable product is because I do think in a world where there are so many different options, it's hard to just feel like, \"Hey, use this thing. It barely meets a quality bar.\" And so I think this idea of actually deeply understanding for the thing that you're working on, what is a lovable experience? What is the quality bar that resonates with your users? And again, especially in a world where there might be a lot of different options. Minimal lovable products is the new MVP. The new minimal viable product.\n\n(00:17:40):\nSo I think that's the real point, but at the end of the day, it does come back to what are the options that a user has and what are they trying to do? So there's a world where your quality bar, your \"Quality bar,\" or let's call it your polished bar, can be a little bit lower because the reality is the thing that you're \"Competing against\" or you're replacing is literally a manual workflow. It's like spreadsheets. It's doing something in a super terrible way.\n\n(00:18:05):\nSo you want to get your product to market as quickly as possible, so it doesn't make sense for you to be like, \"I'm going to build these 15 additional features.\" Because compared to what people are doing right now, your product without those 15 additional features is perfectly fine, perfectly usable, and perfectly quite honestly lovable. So it requires a lot of understanding of, again, your users and the space that you play in and the tolerance of your given user. So for example, a designer might have a lot higher of a bar of like \"This is the kind of workflow I want, this is the kind of bar for my product.\" But again, someone sitting on the finance team or the IT team, their bar might be like, \"Oh, I'm used to doing these 15 things and so your thing is just a lot better.\"\n\nLenny (00:18:53):\nI'd love to go even one level deeper. Is there an example of something you've worked on that was minimal lovable product that you think about? Or is there something out there that's an example of here's maybe an example of a minimal lovable product versus MVP?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:19:08):\nAgain, it's very hard. I think every product team, every product person struggles with this idea of what is the minimal viable. Even that concept itself is difficult and not to mention minimal lovable. I'll give a Webflow example. Very recently, so have been investing in a couple of new features, memberships and logic, new functionality for our users. And what we realized at the end of the day after investing in these areas, we were like, \"Hey, we can get to minimal viable, but we don't know if we can actually get to minimal lovable in a way that our users really, really want. And so does it make sense for us to continue to go down this path of continues to chip away to get to minimal lovable when we are maybe hitting diminishing returns for our user base? Or does it actually make sense to release what we have but then encourage our ecosystem to contribute the lovable piece?\"\n\n(00:19:56):\nAnd again, it's not just like you put it out there and you hope, you have to have a very strong point of view of are we at minimal viable, are we at minimal lovable? Where in between are we? And so having that point of view and then being able to say, \"Are we going to be able to meet it as a company? Are we going to rely on our ecosystem to help us meet it? What are we actually going to do?\" And then even within the feature set, it's very much a how do we do some things well as opposed to do a little bit of everything? I think that is a big piece of minimal lovable, which is again... To me it's better to do five things instead of the 15 things in a really, really great way with a high degree of polish with a, \"Oh, this really meets my need,\" versus trying to do everything and just doing a little bit of everything. And so every part of the experience feels a little bit clunky. It's not quite there.\n\n(00:20:45):\nPeople I think would actually respect this idea of \"You've given me minimal lovable in five areas as opposed to minimal viable in 15 areas.\"\n\nLenny (00:20:53):\nIs there anything you've seen of just that makes something lovable? I don't know. I know it's not easy to define, but what are things you've seen that makes something lovable? Is it delightful features? Or is it what you're saying, which is just things are actually good, there's fewer things, but they're each really good?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:21:08):\nThere's definitely this idea of the thing is just good. It has all. High quality, it's not janky, it doesn't feel weird. I'll give you a very small example again, just from Webflow, this idea of keyboard shortcuts, feels small, but that is a piece that creates a lot of love from user base who are power users. And then there's this concept of pixie dusts, and maybe I'll pull out of call it like design tool space and we'll talk about some of the other things, whether it's Dropbox or Airbnb, but you can just do a little bit of that extra pixie dusts. So an example from Airbnb when we're doing the mobile app revamp where like \"There's like these basic table stakes, but if we actually added in templates and we made it so that these templates could be maybe pre-populated in certain ways from the content they already have,\" that is lovable, that is that extra little bit of pixie dust and spending the time to do that.\n\n(00:21:55):\nAgain, you can't pixie dust everything. At the end of the day, you basically have your time, your staffing and the scope of your project and something has to give. And so at the end of the day, you can't just keep investing, keep investing because it's going to push out your launch timeline, but can you pick a few different areas where you're like, \"I'm going to scatter that pixie dust, I'm going to do a little bit more than what users are expecting\"? And that creates that lovability.\n\nLenny (00:22:20):\nShifting to a different topic, I know you have strong opinions about road mapping and OKRs, improvisation, and I know that's a big topic, but let me just ask, what's the most common advice you give around how to roadmap well, do OKRs, prioritize and/or just, I don't know, common mantras or things you always come back to be successful in these areas?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:22:40):\nRoad mapping prioritization are one bucket for me. And then OKRs is another. So I'll maybe give you my biggest tip in each one of these buckets.\n\n(00:22:46):\nSo for road mapping, my biggest thing that I tell my teams is \"You're telling a story. So what I want from you is I want themes, I want a story. Why are these things the biggest things to invest in these levers, the biggest ones to pull?\" And what I really don't want, what I think is a very common mistake from road mapping is people thinking a spreadsheet with a bunch of projects, the RICE framework, everything has an impact, a cost and an effort column filled out. They think that is prioritization and that is a roadmap. If you just do that right and then you present that to your team, they're off to the races.\n\n(00:23:26):\nBut what people, what humans really crave is like, \"Why am I doing this body of work?\" And I think it's also really, really important to have that really crisply articulated in your own head because ultimately what happens is you'll learn things as a product person. You'll be like, \"Oh, I assumed this in the narrative in my head about my users or about my product area, and then I learned why and therefore my thinking changed.\" So instead of it being this massive spreadsheet where you're going in, you're tweaking all the values, what is the story that you're telling about your roadmap that these inputs can then go and influence?\n\n(00:23:59):\nIt could be like, \"Hey, I just realized I didn't know before that we have a lot more power users on our,\" or \"Maybe we have a lot more non-technical users.\" That input changes my roadmap and changes my themes in a pretty dramatic way. So skating at that level is really, really critical, I think for a roadmap as opposed to going down to the really granular details of the how. So that's the biggest thing on road mapping, which is like tell a story. What are your themes? Make it so that your team can come up with the actual how and the projects and all the little details, but really create that scaffolding for them to know what's important.\n\nLenny (00:24:33):\nCan I ask a follow-up question on that?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:24:35):\nTotally, yeah.\n\nLenny (00:24:36):\nIt's easy to visualize the roadmap of a spreadsheet to help people visualize what you're suggesting there. What does that actual artifact look like? Is it a doc with maybe an ancillary spreadsheet of the actual prioritization? Is it a deck? How do you actually deliver this to you with like \"JZ, here's our proposal for our team\"?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:24:55):\nYeah, I'm a big fan of docs and decks are obviously helpful if you're talking live, but I do think in a remote-first culture or lots of us are in hybrid remote cultures it's hard because decks typically require a voiceover. And so we have been doing a big push even on my teams where I'm like, \"Write it down and document. Force yourself to write the pros because when you write the pros, you can actually add that level of granularity.\" So very much so the same way like \"I'm a roadmap is a story. You're telling themes, you write a story in a notebook, you write a story on pages,\" and so a doc is definitely preferred. And even in the doc just being like, \"Here's what we're trying to achieve, here are the big areas I want to invest in, here are my big themes.\" And then going into each of those themes and being like, \"These are the big projects.\"\n\n(00:25:40):\nAnd then linking out, again, not even to a spreadsheet, but linking out to the artifacts and the systems that your team actually uses. So if your team uses Jira, go ahead and link out to Jira because so often docs get out of... Or spreadsheets get out of date, because they're like a snapshot of whatever it is that you needed at that point in time. But instead you link out to the actual things that your teams are working out of, you can always be like, \"These are the themes. I will edit these if I learn major things that would change my themes. And then let's go link out to the Jira where you can just see the snapshot of the roadmap at any given point in time.\"\n\nLenny (00:26:12):\nDo you have a template or common structure you suggest to teams for laying out this story or is it just depends on the quarter, it depends on the year?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:26:21):\nI'll give a plug for a new thing coming out of Reforge, which is this concept of artifacts. And so we do have a lot of artifacts out there, so what's our general product development process? What are our templates for our specs? What are our templates for some of these things that we're talking about, a roadmap, like a broader roadmap instead of just a feature spec. So yes, we have a ton of those artifacts, are always evolving. I think every team takes it and tweaks it a little bit, but I'm a big believer of bringing those artifacts back and then sharing them across the team. And so product operations is also a function that we've invested in because it just really greases the wheels, gets all of our teams speaking the same language.\n\nLenny (00:26:57):\nAwesome.\n\n(00:26:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Superhuman.

What do you find most often is the blocker or thing holding them back or something they can change that'll accelerate things?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:28:18):\nThere's so many parts to it, but I'll pick one. And there are many frameworks even beyond the one, but let's pick one for your question, which is I think it's really important to become really good at and also known for something. And what I mean by that is when you're known in your company for a particular thing.... I'll give you a couple examples. You could be known for shepherding the most complex launches because you're just so good at quarterbacking, working with go-to market teams and cross-functional stakeholders, that could be your thing. You could be known for working on the most technically complex problems. You could be known for working on things that are really regulatory complex. Find something that you can be really, really good at. And the reason I give that advice is because when you do that, you can crush the projects that you get. Because you're making a name for yourself, reputation, and then you are giving more responsibility. People tend to flock and give responsibility to the people that are known for being excellent at something.\n\nLenny (00:29:16):\nIs there something you were known to be excellent at in the course of your career?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:29:20):\nI would say early on in my career, it was actually the fact that I had a strong analytics background. And so when I joined gaming, I came from consulting, I didn't have any CS background or design background, and so it was really creating a reputation around being very analytical, around being able to analyze the datasets of my game and then make decisions. I also learned as I was doing that I was actually really good at execution, and so being able to keep a lot of plates spinning and working on the largest studio and managing all the complex pieces of that, that was what I discovered. I didn't know this, but I discovered as I started working in the role.\n\n(00:29:58):\nAnd so that was something I brought to Dropbox. When I joined Dropbox. It was like I knew that I could work with a lot of different teams and make sure that we hit a launch deadline, and so I would find myself trying to lean into that superpower and then when delivering upon that, getting more responsibility, \"Hey, you just launched this really complex thing, this was a project that had to work across a lot of different platforms. We're using Griddle APIs.\" And it was a very, very small team and it had a very, very tight deadline.\n\n(00:30:29):\nSo when you're like, \"I can do something like this,\" you end up getting more responsibility because people were like, \"Oh, she was able to do something that was really hard with a small team,\" and so that's how you get more responsibility. But it has evolved in my career. I think that at the beginning of your career, you do want to lean into some of these pieces. It makes sense, but also even when you start to manage, it shifts dramatically. Being known as the best executor is not necessarily the thing that gives you and your team the most responsibility. So as I've grown my career, whether it's at Airbnb or WeWork or other places I flex into maybe a different... It's like taking your core strength but then flexing it and finding different ways to bring it to life.\n\nLenny (00:31:09):\nMuch of what I just heard is you just worked incredibly hard and just got shit done. And I think that's very, very important and often leads to a lot of success.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:31:20):\nPMs have to get shit done. Yeah, ultimately you're responsible for the outcome just no matter what happens.\n\nLenny (00:31:26):\nYeah. I like that. Be known for getting shit done and working really hard, and that's never going to serve you badly. I think that is just lasting advice for being successful as a PM. I realized that we were talking about your tips on prioritization, road mapping and then OKRs, and then I shifted topics and you never got to the OKR bucket. So let me come back to that.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:31:47):\nYes. My biggest tip on OKRs is actually get really, really crisp on qualitatively. What would make you say \"Yes, we did a great job\"? And the reason I pushed so hard on that is because I see so many teams get really mucked down by OKRs. They're like, \"Oh man, if I don't hit my OKR, I feel like I'm going to have a really bad reputation, or maybe I won't get promoted.\" You just get all this fear around OKRs. And so you see people, you see people sandbagging, you see people being hesitant to put in numbers until the very last second until they're super, super confident. And that results in ultimately a failure for your company to innovate and move quickly.\n\n(00:32:29):\nAnd so what I really push on for OKRs is are you actually... What's the spirit... I think I asked this question maybe too much to my team, but what is the spirit of what you're trying to achieve and what would make you say, 'I really, really crushed it this past quarter'? And so it's less about I would rather have all the OKRs be red or yellow and we missed everything and we learned around why we missed it than everything to be green. In fact, when everything's green, you're like, \"We definitely did not set ambitious enough OKRs.\" And so it really pushed a lot on what does it truly mean to crush it and be successful? What does it mean for our users? What does it mean for our business? What does that... For our users to feel X, can you describe that? Can you write that out? For our business to see this in terms of the revenue growth?\n\n(00:33:17):\nAnd I think it's really hard because a lot of times, you get your data scientists, you get the PM themselves being like, \"Oh man, I'm owning an input metric, not an output metric. And so I definitely can't sign up for that revenue target because I have an input metric.\" And all of those things are true, but if you don't do the homework of really drawing that line of being like, \"This is the ultimate thing I want to do for the company and for my users,\" then a lot of times you end up hitting all your OKRs, but the company and your users at large are like, \"I don't feel anything different.\" Your company doesn't look at the things that you've worked on and they don't say like \"This is a smashing success.\" Your users are feeling no differently. And so that is the worst outcome in my head where your OKRs, you're almost like doing OKRs for the sake of OKRs, as opposed to letting them be a guide to delivering really great product to your end customer.\n\nLenny (00:34:09):\nI like the idea of that, but imagine what often happens is you sign up for an ambitious OKR, you don't wait till the last second to commit to it and then ends up being red, and then you go into performance reviews and like, \"Oh, Lenny didn't hit his OKRs. Look at this guy. His team is not doing great.\" How do you think about that as a product leader understanding if the team actually did well and the PM is performing well when they sign up for these really ambitious OKRs and their story's great and they're doing the right thing, but they fail?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:34:37):\nFirst of all, I think it's creating a culture where you are not punished for that. Because I definitely don't want a culture where it's like you took a risk and you failed and therefore your performance is impacted. I'd much rather people take risks than to be safe. So I think that's the first thing. That being said, you're also not doing a good job as a PM if you're like, \"This is my super, super ambitious thing,\" and you're like, \"I have no idea how to achieve it.\" Your job is to dream big and also have a plan to go tackle it. And so what I would expect the PM to be able to say is, \"This is my North Star. I'm not going to be able to do that in a quarter, that just is unreasonable, but here are the five milestones,\" whatever number, some number of milestones \"That it's going to take me to do quarter over quarter to achieve this really, really ambitious thing. And let me draw you that path. Here's the milestone all the way across, and this is the first one. This is why it's so meaningful.\"\n\n(00:35:24):\nSo I expect that combination where you're like, \"I know where I'm going. It's really, really ambitious.\" And then you can then break it down. But again, I would much rather have someone shoot for the moon, even for someone to say like \"This is the thing I really want to do. I don't know my path yet\" than to be really, really safe. Because when you're safe, you're always going to be building something suboptimal. It's going to be suboptimal use of your resources as opposed to actually trying to figure out what the best swing that you can take is.\n\nLenny (00:35:50):\nSo it sounds like it comes back to the story of the roadmap and what they're trying to accomplish, and just as long as it feels like the story made sense, there's a path there. The team did their best, I think we know it was really ambitious. We kind of knew maybe they wouldn't get there. It sounds like that's kind of the thing you look for in a performance of the PM.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:36:07):\nTotally. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:36:10):\nAwesome. I mentioned WeWork and I want to spend a little time on WeWork. You were at WeWork for about a year, and I think it was in the middle of a lot of the craziness that went on at WeWork.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:36:18):\nIt was. It was 2019, I feel like that year it was either headlines were either about Trump or about WeWork in the news.\n\nLenny (00:36:26):\nThat's tough. So what was that like being a PM leader at a company in that craziness? And is there a takeaway from that experience that helps you be a better product manager, a leader, person?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:36:37):\nYeah, I learned a lot from my time there. I think the most important lesson I learned was really around... I think there's like a people leader management lesson, and then there's also just like a how do you build an org period. The people lesson I learned was just really around empathy. In fact, essentially what I was doing was I built a team. I spent the first six months of my time there actually growing my team a lot, and not just in the US but in Asia and in Europe. And then the second half of my time there was actually being like, \"What do we do? If this is what's happening with WeWork, what are we actually going to do with all of these people who have come to WeWork to work?\"\n\n(00:37:19):\nAnd there was so many lessons there around leadership, around how do you think about people? How do you think about giving them the right transition plans? It was a lot of learning. And I think probably a lot of people, even right now through the macroeconomic downturn, they're learning that lesson in a really hard way. And so it was definitely something that I got a crash course on, I think early.\n\n(00:37:44):\nAnd the second lesson really was around not over-hiring. And so I think that was huge, and I think I personally learned that lesson through my time there. And it's something that I'm very conscious of at any company that I go to. Just because laying off half your team is a terrible feeling. Literally having hired people and then having to let them go, it's not something you want to do. And so being really thoughtful around how do we not over-hire? How are we really clear about, again, these milestones of we got to get through these gates, we got to be able to show these types of results, and then we unlock hiring in X, Y, Z ways? That hygiene is really, really important.\n\nLenny (00:38:22):\nFeels like this connects back to the Airbnb Plus story of \"Let's just be really ambitious. We don't have any idea how we're going to get there, but we're just going to go for it, hire like crazy, scale, put a lot of investment in this thing and hopefully we'll figure it out.\"\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:38:34):\nI do think there was a little bit of that in the ethos of how WeWork was functioning, for sure. I think that what was really important for us to do was to be like, \"We have this.\" Operationally, WeWork is really strong. In fact, I went to WeWork because having been at Airbnb, I was like, \"I don't feel like we've dialed this operational muscle down,\" but I know from what I've seen and the way WeWork has expanded, that they're really, really excellent at the operations. But I think it was, again, we hired beyond our skis on the tech side. It's like we don't need a team of this size to go do the things that are needed for the product to feel really great. At the end of the day, it's about booking. And yes, there's technology that would accelerate that, but do we need it to be super platform aware? Do we need it to be super futuristic? That's actually not what people care about.\n\n(00:39:19):\nSo this all goes back to what are people's core desires in whatever product that they're using, whatever thing that your business is trying to serve them? And so really understanding that will help you have a sense of, \"Hey, you can still be really ambitious.\" Again, in a hybrid world, it's like why have real dedicated office space? Every company could go through WeWork as opposed to this dedicated space. That's still a really good idea, that's still a really big vision and a relevant vision, but what's the key piece of that vision? The key piece of that vision is around inventory, and then you make that inventory management easier. You make all of these things easier, but that's not a technology play in the same way as it is an operational play. So just really understanding, again, you can still dream really big, but you don't have to dream big and hire big in all the things in order to have a very ambitious vision that you deliver to the market.\n\nLenny (00:40:13):\nIf you think back to WeWork, what was your favorite memory and what was your hardest, least happy memory if anything comes to mind?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:40:23):\nI think this idea dream really big. I think everyone who had joined WeWork, they were like, \"We could do a lot here.\" The idea of really the physical space infusing technology. I just feel like the people at WeWork were dreamers in the best possible way. So that definitely... I feel like for every company that I've been at, it's really about, you join... I personally joined for the product, but I stayed for the people you joined because you're like, \"I want to work on this mission. This product is really motivating.\" And then you really stay for the people. And the people at We WeWork were really great. So that was definitely my favorite memory.\n\n(00:40:58):\nI think the hardest memory was, this gets a little bit personal, but I was actually in my first trimester when we were going through all of these layoffs and I basically was faced with a choice. It was like, \"Hey, do I stay at WeWork? I would be guaranteed maternity leave.\" I was going to be moved onto this other team that was definitely going to stay. \"Do I do that or do I actually...\" And I think there just a last piece of... The thing I was wrestling with is I hired a lot of these people and I felt really responsible for the fact that I convinced them to come to this company that now was going through a lot of change.\n\n(00:41:33):\nAnd I specifically remember someone when I hired them, we had a long conversation about their visa and in my head I was like, \"I just don't feel right. Again, laying someone off. That's only going to have so many days to be able to go find their new role.\" And so the hardest moment, I actually remember this very vividly, \"Am I going to take this new role or am I going to put myself on a layoff list essentially and give the role to someone else on the team?\" When I really think about it, yes, I was pregnant, but I would have more time and more freedom to go find my next thing versus someone who I brought to the company who was on a visa.\n\n(00:42:09):\nThat to me just really stood out and goes back to this concept around leadership is so much about empathy and people as much as it's about understanding your market, your customers, and the strategy of your product.\n\nLenny (00:42:24):\nDamn. What convinced you eventually to take off and try something different?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:42:31):\nI made the call of, in that particular case, I'd give the role to someone else. And then once I made that call, I was like, \"I got to go find something. I know that this is my last day, so I have to go find something.\" And it was really interesting because I actually... I went through an interview process. I was in my second trimester and then ultimately I chose to join Webflow and I joined when I was literally at the beginning of my third trimester. So I had exactly 90 days before my first son was born.\n\nLenny (00:43:01):\nThat's a great segue to the question I was going to ask is around your 90-day plan that I know you put a lot of thought into how to think about the first 90 days, but before we get there, the movie on WeWork with Jared Leto, how similar to reality was that brought?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:43:16):\nI actually have not watched it. Parent life, you don't have any time. And I do think there's... I feel like if you ask people at Uber, if they've watched some of the [inaudible 00:43:26] they're like, \"It's not for me.\" Same way why I haven't watched Silicon Valley. You're like, \"It's a little too close to home.\"\n\nLenny (00:43:35):\nIt was quite a great movie and I really enjoyed it. I'm curious how close it was to real life. Okay, so then back to the 90-day questions. So I know you spent a lot of time thinking about your first 90 days at Webflow, you're pregnant as you described, and you have a perspective on just how to think about the first 90 days when you join a company. Can you just share what you've learned there, what you recommend there?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:43:55):\nYeah, I do think the first 90 days, depending on your role is very different. But maybe I'll just talk a little bit about the first 90 days as a head of product. Because you're like, \"Whoa.\" Or even just as a leader, how do you go in, how do you really absorb all the information and get all the context you need and then affect change? And I think what was unique about my first 90 days is it was time bound. It was literally something where you're like, \"Sure, I'd love to absorb information for many months, but I just don't have the luxury of the time\" and so-\n\nLenny (00:44:21):\nBecause you're going to go on mat leave right after?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:44:23):\nBecause yeah, essentially I was going to go on mat leave.\n\nLenny (00:44:25):\nGot it.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:44:25):\nThat's right. And so the biggest things that I thought a lot about for my first 90 days was at the end of the day, yes, you have to really... The most important thing for anyone's for assigning days is to build context and to build context well. But what I had to think about a lot was, \"How do I quickly build context probably faster than I would be given the luxury any other time in my life?\" And so I thought a lot about who do I speak to at the company? How do I create even just a calendar of speaking to people? Yes, my leadership team, but also across a bunch of functions and then across a bunch of levels. So it was really important for me to even start talking to some of the engineers from the team, some of the engineers who had been there for the longest time to really understand, what's hard about our tech stack? What's going on? What's hard about your day to day?\n\n(00:45:15):\nAnd so I actually took time to really think about, \"I want to speak to all of these types of people at the company.\" And I packed my first couple weeks with a lot of those meetings. And so I think that was one piece, which is like how do you build context as quickly as possible? And my tip there is again, it's not just with your peers, it's not even just with your team, but to really think across all the different functions and then think about where you're going to get the most amount of information in that particular function. I think that was one piece of it.\n\n(00:45:43):\nThe other piece was I was like, \"I'm going to be out.\" I was only out for two months, but I was like, \"That's still a long period of time in the life of a startup.\" And so what it was really important to me was like, I did not go out having just listened and like \"Great, I have the context, I'll see you in two months.\" But it was really important for me to actually have a plan in place before I went out for my team.\n\n(00:46:03):\nAnd so there were pieces where I was like, \"I want to first, again, get that lay of the land. I want to have enough of a strategic, 'Hey, these things make sense. Keep going, keep executing.' 'These things don't make sense, let's identify what those things are and let's actually start to do research around these things so that when I do come back, we have a body of work that we can look at and be like, \"Okay, this information, this data is making us choose to go down the path.\" Or \"This is a go or no-go decision. We can make that decision now where we couldn't make that decision before.\"'\"\n\n(00:46:34):\nSo that was another big piece, which is getting all the strategic pieces in place, having a plan laid out and explicitly articulating in that plan, \"Keep moving. These are things that we got to do a lot more research on.\" And then assigning people like, \"Hey, you're going to do this research and then we're going to come back and talk about it in the two months that I was out.\" And I also took the time, I actually... Funny story, I think I literally had a board meeting the day before I went in for a checkup, and then in the checkup they're like, \"You're in labor.\" And it was really important for me to do that because I was like, \"For the things that I'm seeing, for the gaps that I'm seeing. I want everyone to be aware. I don't want to just be with one founder. I want the whole leadership team. I want all the founders, I want the board. I want everyone to be aware that.\"\n\n(00:47:14):\nFor example, engineering hiring was really, really important. And I was communicating, \"Hey, we are just not staffed in a way where we can deliver some of the ambitious things that we want to do.\" And so explicitly calling those things out and creating awareness around them and then asking other executives to step in and be accountable, those were big pieces of what I wanted to achieve in my first 90 days.\n\nLenny (00:47:34):\nSo I take notes on this. So the first is just get context, figure out who you need to talk to. Is there a tip there of just how many people? Because you could do this infinitely, meet everyone eventually. How many people did you end up maybe scheduling meetings with?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:47:47):\nDefinitely everyone on my direct team and definitely everyone on the leadership team, so call it those two combined were maybe, I don't know, like 20 or so people, 25 people. But then it was really about finding the people in the other functions. And to me, for any given function, it was really getting a read from, again, that leader, but also someone closer to the actual work. And so you look at the functions, whether it's product marketing or engineering, whatever it was. Back then I didn't have designs, like design. And really getting a couple of data points for each one of those functions. So if you add that up, that probably was like 40 to 50 conversations. But again, if you're doing them back to back and you're really synthesizing, you're actually getting a really good picture of what's going on.\n\nLenny (00:48:35):\nAnd then the second bucket was identify things that need to be shifted, changed, flagged. I imagine there's also an element of trust and building trust. Was that a part of this, of how you thought about it? Or do you feel like as a product leader coming in that's less essential versus say an new PM joining it? A team as an IC?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:48:53):\nTrust is so important. Trust is everything. As a PM, the trust that your cross-functional partners have in you, the trust that the CEO has is you... It's huge. Trust is everything. And maybe here, I'll even talk about some of the mistakes I made in the first 90 days. I think I was so much like, \"I only have 90 days. I got to go, go, go. We got to go.\" I was almost pushing too hard. I was pushing too hard for change. I think that's the tricky part that every product leader, especially if they're coming into a new role, has to figure out how do I gain trust and then take that trust and then push for change as opposed to push for change too quickly before I have that trust?\n\n(00:49:33):\nSo again, it was a personal learning and I think part of it was really driven by the time-bound nature of it, but hopefully not everyone has only 90 days. So if you take that learning into mind, it's really thinking about your trust as a bank. It's like you're putting money into your bank and then at some point you're going to take money out, you're going to use that social capital, you're going to use that trust to go push for things, push for change, but you have to be thoughtful about how full your piggy bank is and you don't want to be spending when you don't have the trust in the bank.\n\nLenny (00:50:06):\nWhat were signs maybe looking back that you didn't necessarily have the trust that you thought you did or you should have had?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:50:13):\nI think something, a product like Webflow is a very complex product and there are so many pieces to it. It's very difficult to learn the product in the first 90 days, especially if I was also prioritizing all these conversations with the team. And so I think that again, without the time constraint, what I would recommend is to be like, \"Hey, every product leader has to take the time to really go deep on the product.\" Given the complexity of Webflow and given the time-bound nature of when I had to go out, and given the fact I really also wanted to build that social context around what is working and not working from a function working together? Not just what the product is. What I wasn't able to do was spend enough time with the product to be able to have all of that in my back pocket to be able to be like, \"Oh, I know how this, this and this works because I've literally used it a bunch.\"\n\n(00:51:06):\nSo you had to choose. And in my head I was like, \"I would much rather understand how the team is functioning together.\" And the reality is the team was comprised of a lot of people with a lot of deep product context. So ultimately as all things in product, you know this Lenny, everything's a trade off. And so it's a trade off. And so you had to make the call of what you wanted to trade off. And the thing I traded off the most was that product context in my first 90 days. And again, it got me some things because I was able to have the time to go deep on the things I mentioned, but it didn't give me enough trust in the piggy bank around the actual product fundamentals or product, the actual thing we're building as opposed to the discipline.\n\nLenny (00:51:48):\nSo at this point you've worked at four legendary companies, Dropbox, Airbnb, WeWork, Webflow. If we were to just go through each one, what's just one lesson that you take away from each of these companies in terms of how it's informed either how you build product or lead people, anything along those lines?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:52:06):\nI'm going to actually give you my biggest thing across all four on the product side. And then on the people side. There are so many nuances also, and we could spend another two hours talking about each one of these. But I think just to impart my biggest high level learning. On the product side, it's about really understanding why people love you and not forgetting to invest deeply in that core concept and then building everything around that. And so I'll walk you through the different companies. So specifically for Dropbox, I think we did waste cycles where we would be like, \"Oh, we see X happening in the market. Slack is really taking off. Why don't we build a Slack competitor? Or why don't we build chat?\" And I think that it really missed this idea of, \"Why do people love Dropbox and what do we need to do to continue investing in that so that remains true?\" People love Dropbox for simplicity, for how delightful it is, how easy it is to use.\n\n(00:53:08):\nI think we actually went for a period of time where we didn't invest enough in just performance of our client. How long it takes for the thing to sync is a big part of the experience of using Dropbox. And so I think that is a big, big learning where it's really understanding that would've shifted your investments into doing that performance work as opposed to chasing the competitive space. And I think going back to chasing the competitive space, it's this idea of what is your alpha? Again, why do people come to you? People come to Dropbox again for all the things I mentioned, but also ultimately we have your files. So if you're going and building a chat product, that's fine, but really the best chat experience or collaboration experience is going to be more around your files as opposed to around just the conversation. So I think really understanding that is a huge, huge learning.\n\n(00:54:01):\nAnd I think that same lesson can be... It's very true for Airbnb. So at the end of the day, Airbnb is known for all the homes, the fact that these are homes that real people put on the platform. We spent some time talking about Airbnb Plus. When you are thinking \"I got to go in and I got to manage the inventory and inspect it,\" you're almost like taking away from the thing that is what makes Air Airbnb special as opposed to leaning into it. We also spend a lot of time on experiences. We dabbled in transportation, we spent a bunch of times on other things. But if you really sat back and you're like, \"What makes Air Airbnb special and how do you double down on your strength?\" It's spending the time to make that experience of really understanding what's in a home so people don't go and get surprised. Making that onboarding journey for the host and then discovery journey and guest booking journey really, really great.\n\n(00:54:52):\nSo I think that that same lesson when applied to Airbnb, would've in my head changed the way we invested and I think we would've gotten more returns, as opposed to spreading ourselves and then having things that sort of work but then didn't quite work. And then again, same principle applies to WeWork, what is the thing that makes you really special? It's the inventory it. It's not actually like, \"Oh, it's so amazing that I get to use this key card and this key card does 10 different things.\" That's not what makes the WeWork experience special. And so again, if you knew that you wouldn't spend all that time being like, \"I'm going to really deeply invest in the tech team, I'm going to do all these interesting things.\" You'd be like, \"I just need to make inventory management great. I need to make it so that the sales team, the operations team, they have the tools they need to go out and get the inventory on the platform.\" You wouldn't do all this other stuff that's just not the core.\n\n(00:55:44):\nAnd then finally, even at Webflow, we are learning this lesson all the time where at the end of the day, people really love our designer. They love the fact that they can use it. It does so much for them, it's so powerful. And then you add our CMS and it's really powerful. You can design with data. So investing deeply there as opposed to spreading ourselves too thin is also a lesson. I think across so many companies this lesson around understand why people love you, double down on that and then whatever else you build around it... Because again, you don't want to also be like... You're not like a single product company, you're not like a one trick pony. You are going to invest in these multi products, but when you invest in a new product, really go back to, again, what's the core of our advantage and how can that be something we leverage in delivering a really great product experience for our users in X adjacent area or x add-on?\n\nLenny (00:56:34):\nFinal question before we get to a very exciting lightning round.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:56:38):\nOkay.\n\nLenny (00:56:38):\nWhat is the best advice that you've gotten that has transformed or impacted the way you build product or hire or lead? Does anything come to mind?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:56:48):\nI can't remember where I explicitly got this advice, but I feel like I got it in multiple forms and it just really sat with me. It's this idea of asking for help. I do think about that a lot because I think there are so many times when you're like, \"Oh, I'm the leader of X thing, everyone's looking to me like the [inaudible 00:57:04] stops in me. I need to have my act together. I can't be asking for help. If I'm asking for help, is everyone feel like I don't know what I'm doing?\"\n\n(00:57:13):\nAnd ever since I've been people managing, I've been pushing myself to be like, \"I know it feels non-intuitive to go ask for help when everyone is looking to for you to give them advice, but if you don't ask for help, there's so many times where you're just going to be sitting there with your problems. Whatever you have in your mind is just not the global best thing and you have to go ask for help. You have to go ask for help from your partners, your peers, even your team, even being my team, I don't know. I really don't know. Here's the guidelines, here's how you might want to think about it, but I don't know the answer, you know the answer.\" Going out and getting mentorship. I think this idea of really being able to say, \"Be honest about what you know and what you don't know and ask for help when you don't know something,\" that's probably the biggest thing that I hold as a core principle and just helps me build better products.\n\nLenny (00:58:03):\nWhat's something that you've asked for help about recently as an example?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:58:06):\nSo I'm working on our product strategy for the next three years. I'm thinking a lot about how do we really leverage AI to support all of our service providers and support all our users who come into Webflow and have a hard time sometimes learning how to use our product. And so I'm not an AI expert, so asking for help from the founders, from external folks, from engineers to be like, \"What's happening?\" Every single week I feel like LLMs are changing. What's possible in the world is changing. And so constantly asking for help to iterate on the strategy is a huge part of... It's happening every day for me and my job.\n\nLenny (00:58:40):\nJZ, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:58:44):\nAll right, let's do it.\n\nLenny (00:58:46):\nWhat are two or three books that you've most recommended to other people?\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:58:50):\nI love the Design Sprint by Google. I also really Julie's book around managing people how to be a good manager. That one's really great. And so those are my more business side of the house books. And then we can also talk about fantasy stuff if you want. But-\n\nLenny (00:59:07):\nYeah, give us some recs there.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:59:09):\nI'm a big fan of Brandon Sanderson. He completed the Wheel of Time series on behalf of the [inaudible 00:59:14] author. He has the Mistborn series and so he's a great one. He actually has this... During the pandemic, he holed up and wrote a bunch of books and Vince was like, \"I have a confession to make. I wrote four extra books.\" And the latest one is Tress by the Emerald Sea that I really love.\n\nLenny (00:59:32):\nI saw the video of him sharing that news and he's just like, \"I wrote a book during COVID\" and then, \"Okay, I wrote a second book and then, oh, I wrote a third book also\" and it just keeps going.\n\nJiaona Zhang (00:59:43):\nI think he was like, \"I have a secret or I have a confession to make.\" And everyone was like, \"Oh no, are you going to say that you have a ghost writer because you're so prolific?\" And he's like, \"Nope, I just wrote four more books.\"\n\nLenny (00:59:51):\nWhat a beast. Next question on that topic a little bit. What's a favorite recent movie or a TV show that you watched? And I know you said you don't get to watch much, but anything come to mind?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:00:01):\nI feel like every night I'm watching Sesame Street like songs. We don't do TV, but we do do YouTube songs. I honestly don't have an answer to that other than we watch the Elmo song and the ABC song with my three year old.\n\nLenny (01:00:18):\nThere's been a lot of parenting advice on this podcast with my child coming soon. And so this is very on brand. Before we started this, you mentioned the painting behind you is referenced in like Arcane, it's connected to or the show Arcane, which I imagine-\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:00:31):\nYes. I'm a big fan. So painted this a long time ago before Jinx and Vi were a thing, and when Arcane was made, both my husband and I were like, \"What? How did we predict this? This is amazing.\" So it's a good one.\n\nLenny (01:00:45):\nThere we go. Some adult content. What is a favorite interview question that you like to ask candidates?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:00:53):\nI do like to do behavioral questions, just really understanding when they've been in challenging situations, when they've been in ambiguous situations, how do they navigate ambiguity? Is a big one for me because at the end of the day, the PM job is really ambiguous. It's really hard to describe on a piece of paper all the things that you're going to encounter. So asking a lot of behavioral questions around that.\n\nLenny (01:01:14):\nAnd is there anything specific you look for in their answer that tells you this is a good answer or not a good answer?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:01:20):\nYeah. Good answers are people who put structure and a way forward through the ambiguity. That's what you look for. You want your PM to not just be like, \"Oh no, we're swimming in ambiguity,\" but actually put a path forward. I think also looking for people who are seeking help, seeking those inputs as opposed to being like, \"Yep, this is the way. This is very clear.\" Because again, the chances of whatever path you chart out for any product, for anything that you're doing is the right path from the first time that you do it, so rare. And so I want to see someone be able to get those inputs, be able to say, \"This is the path, this is how I learned why I put this path together.\" And then going back to a lot of the stuff I think we touched upon in this podcast is like, what are the little milestones that make you say, \"Hey, is this working? Is this not working?\" And then make you either make a different decision. Seeing people do that really well is a big thing I look for.\n\nLenny (01:02:12):\nAwesome. What is a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:02:17):\nI love... It's not recent, but I do love the SNOO and it's very top of mind because I just graduated my second son from the SNOO and it was a little bit like, \"Oh my gosh, no more rocking of the baby.\" But I do think it does a good job of actually doing the thing and I'm also giving parents peace of mind.\n\n(01:02:34):\nThe other thing I'm a big fan of, again, you'll see where my head's at, lots of child related things. Midjourney for your toddler is actually great because instead of it being absolute instant gratification of \"I want to see a firetruck,\" and \"Here you go, here's my phone.\" It's like, \"Let's wait for Midjourney to create the firetruck.\" And specifically you can even tell Midjourney what you want. It could be like, \"I would like it to be blue.\" He's obsessed with Jungle Book, \"Wearing a fire hat next to a firetruck.\" And so you can actually create, and I do believe in the future, so much of what we are going to be doing as humans is literally what is the creative process? What's the idea? It's less about executing all the pieces of it, but it's so important to still be able to be like \"This is the idea that I want to bring to life.\" And so I just think training that is huge.\n\nLenny (01:03:24):\nFeels like you've just defined your three-year strategy for Webflow right there with AI.\n\n(01:03:30):\nNext question, what is something that you've changed in the way you build product that might be relatively minor that had a big impact in your team's ability to execute?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:03:40):\nThere's so many different things that we've done at all the different companies. It really depends on the company. And what I mean by that is at a company like Webflow, where the tech stack is complex and where a given feature has so many different interactions, you're like \"People depend on this workflow, this thing interacts with this thing. It's a whole platform.\" One of the biggest things we've been tweaking is like how do we do more of a tech spike at the beginning to be like, \"Do we have a good sense of how difficult this is going to be? The unknowns? Can we get a little bit more detail on them so that we don't go down a path and be like, 'Oh, this doesn't make sense'?\" So I feel like that that's a tweak in the process that has really made a big difference at a company like Webflow.\n\n(01:04:20):\nBut when I look back to other companies, again, that might not be your biggest problem. Another problem could be like, \"Hey, it's just so difficult to work with cross-functional partners and doing a little tweak in the process where you bring them in a kickoff meeting.\" That might be the thing that just changes that dynamic of how you work with teams. So it's really... I don't know if there's one thing, but it's almost like every day I'm thinking about small tweaks and process to make all of us more efficient.\n\nLenny (01:04:44):\nFinal question, what is your number one pro-tip for using Webflow and being successful with Webflow?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:04:49):\nMy number one pro-tip is there's a lot of stuff coming out that I'm very excited about. I do think Webflow has traditionally had a high learning curve, and it's because we're a pro tool, we're a professional tool. We do really amazing stuff, so much power that we deliver you, but with that power has come with it's hard to learn. And so one of the things that I'm really excited about pro-tip for using Webflow in the future is we're really going to bring the magic of Webflow University, the magic of AI, all together so that you can just use and learn Webflow so much faster, learn webflow in the context of what you're doing as opposed to going into a different tab and looking for the Webflow University stuff. It's going to be in context to the product, being able to actually take action directly, prompting Webflow to be able to do things for you. It's just going to be so much easier in the future to use the product. That's what I'm excited about. We're working on it and it will be out in the future.\n\nLenny (01:05:42):\nOkay. No specific dates yet. Yeah, you could share, this sounds like breaking news of cool stuff coming.\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:05:47):\nSome things are in alpha and [inaudible 01:05:49] beta, but we do want to be developing it with our users and really learning is this the power that you're looking for? Is this thing that's going to get you over the activation hump that you've struggled with in the past?\n\nLenny (01:06:00):\nJZ, I think we've made a maximally lovable podcast episode. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions. How can listeners find you online if they want to reach out and how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:06:11):\nI always love feedback, so if there's feedback on the podcast, send it my way. Or even just what would you want to learn? Send it my way. And the reason I ask that is because I'm actually working on a course, another course through Reforge, which is around managing your PM career. And so really just... I've talked to so many people advice around their career, but if you want to reach out and be like, \"These are the problems that I'm facing,\" it would actually really help me as I am creating this course, which is going to launch in a couple of months. And so I'm excited to... Find me there if you want to chat more and send the problems that you're struggling with when it comes to your career, and that would help me refine my course.\n\nLenny (01:06:47):\nAnd that's just reforge.com? There's no URL yet specifically for that course?\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:06:51):\nNot yet, but it will come soon. And maybe what I'll do is I'll post it on my website, which is built in Webflow, so my full name dotcom.\n\nLenny (01:06:59):\nGot it. JZ, thank you so much for being here, and thanks again.\n\nJiaona Zhang (01:07:03):\nThanks for having me.\n\nLenny (01:07:05):\nBye, everyone.\n\n(01:07:08):\nThank you so much for listening.

Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:20):\nWhat the hell? Why would... Why does this... You have this really amazing insight. The voice in your head is often telling you bullshit.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:00:27):\nWhat most people try to do is they try to stop it, and that doesn't work very well. I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day. One of my favorite responses is, \"Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you.\"\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:43):\nYou're really big on helping people feel joy.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:00:45):\nIt's such an important tool for productivity. If you say, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient. Not only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:00:57):\nIs there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone try to experiment with?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:01:02):\nYeah, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:01:09):\nToday, my guest is Joe Hudson. Joe is one of the most sought-after executive coaches amongst tech leaders and has worked with folks from OpenAI, SpaceX, Apple, and other world-class companies. Joe's unique approach to coaching draws from his spiritual, psychological, and neurological practices. In his intimate courses that he runs a few times a year, and in his podcast, he helps people create the life that they want with enjoyment and ease. In our conversation, Joe shares the two things that he finds most often keep people stuck in their life and in their job, and how to work on getting these things unstuck. Why the critical voice in your head is always wrong, contradictory, and telling you bullshit, and how to build a different relationship with that voice.\n\n(00:01:51):\nWhy falling in love with your emotions is so important and so powerful. Why you'd be better off focusing on what you want versus what you think you should do or think that you need to do, plus a bunch of amazing advice on how to make better decisions, help your team run more effectively, and why a seven-minute daily gratitude practice will change your life. This episode is basically for every single person. It will make your life and your work better.

With that, I bring you Joe Hudson. Joe, thank you so much for being here and welcome to the podcast.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:02:34):\nOh, thanks. Good to be here.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:02:36):\nIt's good to have you. I'm curious if there's any common themes that emerge often in terms of what is holding people back from success or just living the life that they want, especially ambitious tech people, which I know is a lot of the folks that you work with. Are there archetypes of like, here's the thing, often come up most often and hold people back?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:02:57):\nA nonspecific answer to that would be a critical voice in their head and a relationship with that critical voice that is not productive. Oftentimes, the critical voice in the head says, \"You need me to be productive,\" but it's usually a huge detriment to being able to really be successful. Even if you are successful with a really critical voice in your head, you never get to enjoy it. You might have the money, but then you're like, \"Oh, shit, I'm still miserable.\" Or, \"I got the car, I got the house, I got the money, I got the successful career, and why am I unhappy all the time?\" That would be, I would say one of the biggest ones. Another really big one that in a large category I would say is their relationship with emotions is all fakata. They are either trying to pretend they don't have them or compartmentalizing them or trying to manage them rather than harnessing them and falling in love with them. That would be a big place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:04:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by BuildBetter.ai.

If you're building a SaaS app, at some point your customers will start asking for enterprise features like SAML authentication and SCIM provisioning. That's where WorkOS comes in, making it fast and painless to add enterprise features to your app. Their APIs are easy to understand so that you can ship quickly and get back to building other features. Today, hundreds of companies are already powered by WorkOS, including ones you probably know, like Vercel, Webflow and Loom. WorkOS also recently acquired Warrant, the fine-grained authorization service. Warrant's product is based on a groundbreaking authorization system called Zanzibar, which was originally designed for Google to power Google Docs and YouTube.\n\n(00:06:05):\nThis enables fast authorization checks at enormous scale while maintaining a flexible model that can be adapted to even the most complex use cases. If you're currently looking to build role-based access control or other enterprise features like single sign-on SCIM or user management, you should consider WorkOS. It's a drop-in replacement for Auth0 and supports up to one million monthly active users for free. Check it out at workos.com to learn more. That's workos.com. These are awesome. Okay, so the voice in your head, you have this really amazing insight that I heard on one of your podcast episodes that the voice in your head is often wrong, often contradictory, often telling you, and that your advice is to learn how to work very differently with this voice in your head, which a lot of people just assume, oh, that's just like what it is. It's telling me how it's trying to help me, but it turns out it's not. Can you talk about that?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:07:04):\nI would say every single time the voice in your head is wrong. That critical voice in your head. To be specific, I'm talking about the voice in your head that is critical and repeats. There's the voice that says the same thing over and over again. You got to work out more, you got to work out more, you got to work out more. Whatever that is, it's always wrong, and that doesn't mean there isn't truth to what it says, but it's incorrect. As an example of this, you should work out more, you should work out more, you should work out more, or you need me or you just sit around on the couch as a great example of one. If I was your boss and I was sitting right next to you and I was criticizing you every couple of minutes, there's no way that you would say, \"Wow, I really need you. I couldn't be productive without you.\" It's a bunch of crap. Or you should work out, you should work out.\n\n(00:07:58):\nI see the truth that I'd be healthier if I work out. I get that. Should I? Is it really a should? There's another question. What makes it not say, \"Oh, hey, why don't you enjoy working out? How do we get you to enjoy working out? What would motivate you to work?\" It's not doing any of that. It's, \"You should work out, you should work out.\" It's never an accurate thing that's happening inside of your head. Until you can see through that, it's hard to work with the voice in your head. You can do it, but until you see through it. The second part that I would say is that if you want to work with the voice in your head a new way, what most people try to do is they try to stop it. They try to control the voice in the head, and that doesn't work very well. Instead, I say, change the way that you relate to the negative voice in your head.\n\n(00:08:46):\nInstead of being, \"Okay, stop doing that, stop doing that.\" Say, \"Oh, I see that you're really scared and I'm right here with you.\" Or sing a musical to it or just go, \"Eh, I don't believe you.\" As a matter of fact, I think the best way to work with the voice in the head is to pick an experiment every day and respond to the voice in the head in a new way every day to have an experimental approach and say, \"Oh, what's the relationship I want with this negative voice in my head?\" Because right now, what it's typically doing for most people is that it says something and the person's like, \"Yeah.\" Or, \"Yeah, but I'm not going to do that, so fuck off.\" Or, \"Yeah, that'll never work.\" Something like that is the response. What happens if you change the response to the voice in your head? That gives you a crap ton of freedom, and it's the beginning of what can be a state where the negative voice in the head disappears, which is really, really quite lovely.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:09:43):\nOh, wow. I love this so much because there's so much that comes from this thing in your head just shooting you down or scaring you about stuff. It's so hard. I hear this, but it's so hard. Next time I'm, I don't know, giving a big presentation, I'm going to hear like, \"Oh, something could go wrong. You could look really stupid or you could totally forget what you're saying.\" It's hard to really intellectualize, okay, I don't have to listen to this. Is there anything more there just how to turn that around and be like, just shut up?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:10:11):\nThe shut up usually doesn't work. Experiment with all of it. To me, one of my favorite responses is, \"Oh, I see that you're really scared. Don't worry. I'm right here with you. I got you.\" Because part of the deal is that the voice in the head has assumed the position that it's like the boss, but it's really a little kid having a temper tantrum. If you listen to it, if you just dictated everything it said, it sounds like usually like a five-year-old having a temper tantrum, or it sounds like the way your mom used to chastise you or the way your dad used to chastise you or whatever, a teacher. It isn't, it's not logical, it's not thoughtful, it's typically not thoughtful, it's usually abusive. It's a lot of fear. It's one of my favorites, one of my favorite ways to respond.\n\n(00:11:06):\nI've tried, I mean, gosh, dozens of ways, and there's a lot of neat effective ways. I particularly think it's really good to set up a series of experiments rather than just take the one that I have because the experimental mindset means that you can never really fail. Typically, somebody, like worse with the voice in the head, they fail and they go, \"Ah, fuck it.\" Because we have this part of our brain called the habenula, and the habenula basically is the part of our brain that is trying to teach us not to fail over and over again. It's the thing that when you go on a diet or you go to work out and then you don't do it one day and you say, \"Ah, fuck it, I messed up,\" and then you don't try anymore or you don't try for a couple of weeks or whatever, that's basically what's happening in that part of the brain.\n\n(00:11:48):\nIf you do it as an experimental thing, then you can't lose, you're just learning about yourself. You're learning about the voice in your head. The way I like thinking about that is people are like, \"I understand the problem, but I don't have a solution.\" I'm always like, \"If you understood the problem, there would be no question about the solution.\" If you fully understand the problem, you know the solution. All you have to do is really fully understand the voice in your head through a series of experiments and the whole thing goes away.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:12:16):\nThe advice here is next time you're hearing something in your head that you don't think is going to be helpful to you is try to respond to it in a different way from what you've been doing.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:12:25):\nI would be even more subtle than that, which is I really wouldn't care if you think it's helpful to you or not. I would just experiment with different ways of interacting with it. I wouldn't even do it as a goal of, okay, I want the voice in the head to be nicer to me. I would do it with the goal of just, hey, how do I learn? How do I understand this thing? It's a far more productive self-development. Generally, it's far more productive to learn, say about the river valley by walking through it, putting your feet in the river, going down the river with a canoe, smelling the soil, looking at the plants, than it is to say, \"Okay, I am going to dam this river valley and try to...\" You're not going to understand it the same way. You're going to make some mistakes.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:13:18):\nAmazing. The second bucket that you shared of what you find most often is the root of what's holding people back is the way you described is your relationship with your emotions, which I don't think a lot of people would think of as the thing that's holding them back. Can you talk a bit more about what that looks like?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:13:31):\nYeah, a great way to explain it. For the logical folks, so in 2012 or so, there was a person who wrote a book called Descartes' Error, and in Descartes' Error, the whole idea is that I think therefore I am, and this person's like, \"Yeah, that's the error.\" It's a neuroscientist who looked at people who had damage in the emotional center of their brain, and they just basically ceased to be able to make decisions. Their IQ would stay the same, but it would take them half an hour to decide where to have lunch or decide what color pen to use. It would take hours and hours to make simple decisions, so their IQ would stay high, but their entire life would completely fall apart. What it tells us, and this is not exact, I'm paraphrasing for a podcast, but we make decisions in the emotional center of our brain. We use logic to try to figure out how we're going to feel.\n\n(00:14:23):\nYou can see this just by asking yourself the question, how many decisions have you made to feel like a success or to not feel like a failure or to feel happier, to not feel trapped? There's these huge buckets of emotions that we are trying to feel and not feel, and we're making decisions based on those. There's no such thing as a logical decision. That idea is like, I'm just going to be logical and just make a logical decision, it doesn't. Neurologically, it's just untrue. If you learn to fall in love with all of your emotions, then solution sets become available that you didn't have before. If you are like, \"Oh, I can't feel like a failure.\" Well, then you're probably not going to take certain risks. If you are, \"Oh, I want to feel loved and I can't feel unliked by people.\" Well, then you're not going to say your truth, and then the world is going to not give you the things that are truthful to you.\n\n(00:15:20):\nI go into my boss, I say my truth, I get fired. Okay, I get fired, but then probably my next boss, I say my truth, I'm going to find a location where my truth is and how I want to be in the world is going to be acceptable. If I don't do that, if I'm constantly managing myself, then I'm not going to have that reality. It's really important, just for the decision-making part, how important emotions are to be able to fall in love with each of the emotional experiences so you're not making decisions based on your inability to feel stuff. That's like one, there's literally a thousand others. Most people, they feel stuck. They can have a big emotional release and they don't feel stuck anymore. When people feel overwhelmed, it's usually not the amount of crap that they have going on in their life. It's the fact that they have emotions that they are not sitting, feeling or expressing. That's another huge chunk of stuff.\n\n(00:16:11):\nDepression is usually unmoved anger, is another example. There's so many levels in which people not able to feel really limits their life. Just one that's like almost everybody can relate to is feeling excitement is something that most people can only do for about 10 to 20 seconds. Most people aren't like, \"Oh, I'm excited.\" If you walked into a Denny's and there was this person, a 60-year-old man and just excited and was excited for 10 minutes, you'd be like, \"What's wrong with this person?\" When we're excited, it's contagious. I walk into a meeting and I'm excited, probably other people are going to walk out excited. We're limiting just our ability to create collaboration by the fact that we're limited by our excitement. I could go on forever. There's so many experiences like this.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:17:06):\nWhat I'm hearing is the core issues, we're not able to feel our emotion, but there's something there, like we are angry or scared. Because we can't feel it, we just can't break through that.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:17:17):\nNot quite. If you have somebody who's experienced a lot of emotional abuse in their life, then they might not be able to feel the emotions that they're having, and particularly where you experienced the emotional abuse. That might be the case for them. For instance, if you had physical abuse and I put a quarter in one of your hands and a key in another one of your hands without telling you which was which, you wouldn't be able to tell me if you'd suffered enough physical abuse because you've literally cut that sensation off. Similarly, people who've experienced emotional abuse can often not tell what the emotions are. Now, emotional abuse is, it's a big word. Generally, people don't even like equating the two. Just to agree on terms here, when I say emotional abuse, I mean you were told that you weren't allowed to have a certain emotion. That's what I mean by emotional abuse.\n\n(00:18:08):\nMaybe you got fed every time you got angry or you got your love removed, or you got punished, or maybe every time you cried, you were made fun of. My particular background was that. It's when you weren't allowed to feel certain emotions, you were told to cut it off because it wasn't going to be safe because you're either going to get bribed out of it or punished out of it, or loved removed because of it or made fun of or whatever it is. That might be a step that one has to take, but the place you want to get to is where the emotions are fluid, where it just moves right through you. It doesn't mean that you lose control. As a matter of fact, losing control means that there's still resistance in it.\n\n(00:18:53):\nThe way I think about this is that emotions are like a tube, let's say, and there's water moving through the tube. You kink a tube one way, the water comes out a little funny. Kink the tube the other way, it comes a little funny. Let's say you have anger and that's the tube of, and you kink it one way and it's like, \"You son of a bitch. You blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" You kink get another way and it's like, \"Nice dress. You crank it another way and it's guilt. It's like, \"Why would you ever do that to me?\" Then if it's unkinked, then it's like Gandhi or Martin Luther king. It's this very loving boundary that's set. It's this clarity of purpose. That's how I think about it. The idea is to get to fluidity, to unkink the hose so that all of the emotional experiences come out with love.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:19:44):\nI did a meditation retreat, a 10-day silent meditation retreat, which I know is a big part of your practice and something that led to the work you do now. A term that's coming up for me is non-judgmental awareness. Basically, experiencing the thing you're feeling and just letting it go, not attaching to it, not judging it. Is that along the lines of stuff you'd recommend?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:20:03):\nYeah, it's definitely a huge part of it. There's a couple of things that I noticed get in the way, or the translation gets in the way there. One is it's like, think about emotions as like kids in your house. If a kid came into your house and you're like, \"I will be non-judgmentally aware of you.\" You're probably going to get a very different response from the kid than if you're like, \"Oh, I'm so excited to see you. I welcome you in my house.\" The emotions feel different if you're like, \"I am non-judgmentally aware of this emotion,\" or, \"Oh, cool. Oh cool, I'm sad. This is fantastic.\" If you have that welcoming invitation. One of the quotes that I'm most famous for is joy is the matriarch of a family of emotions and she won't come into a house where her children aren't welcome. A very joyful life is a life where all the other emotions are deeply welcomed, not accepted, not non-judgmentally aware of. I think those are really great steps, don't get me wrong. If you can be in non-judgmental awareness of an emotion, fantastic.\n\n(00:21:14):\nThe other thing that's a little bit different about what you said is that emotions do need to be felt. If you stop feeling an emotion, you have to constrict your muscles. I can watch somebody come in, come up for one of my coaching rapid coaching sessions. By the crease in their eyebrow, I can know that there's repressed anger. By the hunch in their shoulders, I can tell you about the critical parent that they had. The body takes on a shape that's based on the emotions that you've been taught to hold. You don't just by sitting there, well, it's not entirely true, if you just sit there and feel them in that way without the full expression, they will move eventually, but it might take a couple of decades. You can actually just move them. You can actually make the sound, move your body. All mammals do it. Like mammals releasing fear, they all shake. It's part of how we exist. That's also a really big part of emotional fluidity. It's not just being still and feeling them, it's letting the muscles move, making the sounds.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:22:22):\nFor someone that wants to get better at the skill of feeling emotions, being more in touch with emotions, helping their emotions be more fluid. I know this is a lifelong practice and not something you would just hear on a podcast, okay, I've installed this. Is there anything tactically you can recommend to a listener of just like, here's something you could do this week that'll help you, along these lines?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:22:40):\nWe have a free audio on our website called Emotional Inquiry, and that would be the easiest way that I would, that's a really good entry level first step into emotional fluidity. The bigger problem is that every step has a different thing. If you're in the not aware of emotions, then that step may not be the right step for you. Though, if you are aware two or three emotions and you can do emotional inquiry, usually, it'll open up a lot of the other ones. There might be a point where you really need expression, and so emotional inquiry is not going to work. Just generally, the emotional inquiry practice is a really good one. What it is, is imagine you're a little kid and you pick up a toad.\n\n(00:23:28):\nYou're going to pick it up, you're going to look at it, you're going to feel it, you're going to smell it. Some little kids are even going to lick it a little bit. They're going to really want to explore this toad, and that's what emotional inquiry is, is a somatic mental experiencing of an emotional experience in your body and what is it like and what happens when you welcome it. What happens when you love it. What happens when you resist it. It's a series of experiments that you're playing with the emotion and observations and felt sense of the emotion, and that I find to be incredibly, incredibly useful for people.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:05):\nJust getting very curious.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:24:06):\nYeah, a lot of wonder.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:09):\nBy the way, the quote you shared about joy being the matriarchy of all the other emotions, imagine people have said this, but inside out too, I think is exactly a representation of what you're talking about, where joy is actually, she's like the protagonist almost. I don't know if you've seen it yet.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:24:25):\nI think I've heard about this. I haven't watched it, but I think where you think it's all about being happy and you find out that you have to accept everything for happiness to really work, kind of.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:34):\nExactly.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:24:35):\nYeah, I have heard about it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:24:36):\nAnxiety takes over, and then things don't go well. Something else that I've noticed listening to a bunch of your conversations, you do these lightning round coaching sessions with people, and so I listen to a bunch of them. Something that was really interesting to me is that a lot of people come to you and they're like, \"Hey, I have this problem. I can't do this hard thing I know I need to do.\" Or, \"I have imposter syndrome just keeping me from doing this thing I need to do.\" you're often like, \"No, that's not actually what's going on here. I can see that's not a problem for you. It's really this other thing.\" Is that super common where people think they need to work on this one thing, and it turns out that's not at all, they're actually okay at that and something totally else?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:25:13):\nI'd maybe put it a little bit differently. They're living in a story that describes an old version of themselves or they don't see themselves clearly enough to be able to see the whole issue, and so they're just kind of living with a story that's in the past. That's a really common thing. Oftentimes, if I do that in a coaching session, typically it's because they're showing me right there that it's not true. Somebody's like, \"I'm so scared, I can't do anything.\" I'm like, \"You just got in front of a hundred people to ask me a question. Clearly, you're not so scared that you can't do anything, so I'm not buying it.\" I don't do it quite like that, I do it with a lot more love than that.\n\n(00:25:54):\nOftentimes, I see that people's stories are a culprit, like how they describe themselves. A great way that you can really see this in folks is that nine out of 10 times that you compliment somebody, I really appreciate this thing about you, they're going to go, \"Nah.\" Or, \"Well, my sister is even more.\" Or, \"If you knew me.\" They're going to do some sort of version like that. It basically is one of the indicators that they can't actually feel who they are. They would rather, in effect, call you a liar. You're lying to me or you're wrong than they would to actually accept the experience of being seen in that way. It does a couple of things. One of the things it does is it stops people from seeing themselves clearly. The other thing it does is it makes people forever want to be seen and complimented and acknowledged and validated because they're getting the food, but they can't digest it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:26:59):\nDo you have any advice other than working with you and you telling them, \"Hey, here's actually going on,\" for someone to like, okay, maybe revisit, maybe this isn't actually a problem to see what's actually going on?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:27:09):\nWe have a set of five kind of what we think are foundational tools for transformation, and we do these free workshops on them, and one of them is question the assumption. That's a really great way to have people start to see through their stories. At the beginning, I said, \"Nothing in the critical voice in your head says is true.\" This is how it applies, so typically, there's an assumption that you have to make for the problem to be real. If somebody says to you, for instance, if somebody comes to me and says, \"I am an asshole to my girlfriend.\" That's their problem. One, you have to assume that the girlfriend doesn't want you to be an asshole, as an example. Two, you have to assume that you know what being an asshole actually is. It's not just what your mom told you an asshole was.\n\n(00:28:04):\nThree, there's some validation, there's another assumption, there's some clear thing that says this in the world. Everyone's like, that's an asshole and that's not, rather than what actually happens in the world, which is 50% of the people think that this person is an asshole and 50% think they're a hero. It's something like that. Also, another assumption there is that the problem is that you're an asshole, instead of that you're resisting the fact that you are an asshole, and therefore, it comes out sideways instead of really clear. There's so many assumptions in there. If you see through those assumptions, usually the problem starts fading away.\n\n(00:28:40):\nIt's like, \"Oh, okay, what do I mean by asshole, exactly? How do I define that?\" It seems like a silly thing when I am using this example of asshole. I remember this moment in my own development, I was in Bodega Bay, out of all places, and this very good friend of mine at the time was like, \"Joe, you're an asshole.\" I was like, \"No, I'm not.\" He's like, \"Why resist it? Just fall in love with the fact that you're an asshole. Just allow yourself to be an asshole for just a minute, just one minute.\" I stopped, and I thought of like, I was doing venture capital at the time, and I could think of all the things that I had done that somebody would call an asshole, and all the ways in which I was unattuned to people, and I could, \"Oh, yeah, okay, I can totally see that I'm an asshole.\"\n\n(00:29:32):\nIn that scene, not only in the scene of it, but as the shame fell away, oh, this is nothing I have to defend. This isn't something that I'm a bad person because of, I don't need to be ashamed of it. This is just some actions that I took. As that faded away, then and then over the next couple weeks, lo and behold, I became less of an asshole. It's a strange thing when you really grok that, that it's often shame that holds bad habits in place. Is it a problem that I'm an asshole, or is the problem that I'm ashamed of being an asshole? Is the problem that you're a smoker, is the problem that you're ashamed of being a smoker? Typically, there's so many assumptions built into everything that we call a problem, and if we look through those assumptions, the problems disappear. As in this case, it disappeared for me.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:30:25):\nWow, okay. There's a lot there. It connects to something I know you recently talked about, which is the emotion we want to avoid is the thing we end up experiencing a lot by trying to avoid it. What's going on there?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:30:46):\nSince I'm coach executives, let's do an executive example, so conflict avoidant executive. I don't want to feel the out of control in this that I do when people argue. I don't want to feel that level of out of control, so I am going to be conflict avoidant. I'm going to avoid conflict. Every way that we go to avoid a feeling, becomes the way that, that feeling gets invited towards us. We all know what it's like to work for a conflict-avoidant CEO or a boss, people get really fucking upset. Eventually, people get really upset. Decisions aren't being made. There's all this tension. It's never relieved.\n\n(00:31:30):\nThen wow, sure enough, the conflict-avoidant CEO is dealing with a whole organization that's tense and they feel completely out of control and the fact that they can't do anything about, so that's an example. Or when I was younger, it was emotional abandonment. My dad was an alcoholic, and I didn't want to feel that emotional abandonment again, and so I would get really hard when I felt like people were leaving me, I'd be like, \"What the dah, dah, dah, dah, dah?\" Which of course, made them abandon me quicker, or I would try to caretaker people, which would build resentment, which would make people abandon me. Whatever emotion that you're trying to avoid, you are inviting into your life in exactly the way that you're trying to avoid it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):\nWhat the hell? Why does this happen?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:32:14):\nThat doesn't sound right.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:32:14):\nThis is counterproductive.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:32:20):\nIt is counterproductive. I think that the really cool thing about it is you can look at any issue that you're having in your life, so you can say, oh, one of the problems that I have in my life is that I am constantly in an argument with my girlfriend or boyfriend, let's say. What is the thing that you don't want to feel in that argument? I don't want to feel ashamed. You're getting in arguments because you don't want to feel ashamed, and that's making you feel more ashamed. What am I doing at that first time to not feel ashamed? I'm defending myself. Oh, and me defending myself is actually the thing that's starting the fight. You can backward engineer it to, oh, I don't want to feel ashamed, therefore I'm going to defend myself, which creates the fight, which makes me feel more ashamed.\n\n(00:33:10):\nAny problem that you're having, you can actually backwards engineer it and see, oh, I can solve that problem by just being okay with that feeling. God damn it, you didn't take out the trash. Oh, that's a shame I don't want to feel. I'm not going to defend myself. I'm going to feel that shame. Oh, yeah, then maybe I'm going to say I'm sorry I didn't take out the trash, or I'm going to say, I don't feel ashamed, I don't want to take out the trash. I have to defend myself to get in the fight, and then I'm going to feel ashamed. You can reverse engineer all your problems this way. It's like it's such a cool hack, but it's very hard. For somehow or another, it's very simple, but very hard for people to utilize.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:33:53):\nThis is amazing. The advice is basically feel the thing and just come to terms with this is the emotion I'm feeling, and maybe, like an example, the asshole. Well, maybe I'm an asshole.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:34:03):\nIt's what's required for you to love and accept yourself would be, and love and accept the emotion that you're having in the moment instead of resist it. There's that saying, what we resist persists. How do you fall in love with and stop resisting the reality on the ground? In doing so, it changes the reality on the ground.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:34:30):\nIn this argument with your supposed girlfriend, say you disagree about her perspective on what's going on. I guess that's not the root issue here. It's your feeling, it's not her perception.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:34:41):\nHey, sweetheart, I really hear you want me to take out the trash, and that's not my truth. That's going to be very different than defending that shame. The defending the shame is going to be like, no, it's not my job to take out the chat. You're trying not to feel the experience, which is what's going to do it. The response isn't the important thing. It's really where the response comes from. It's so interesting because people are taught constantly, this is something we teach in the connection courses that it's really not about the conversation, it's about where you're at in the conversation. For instance, when my friend said to me, \"Hey, you're a dick.\" Here's what he didn't do, he's like, he didn't go, \"You're a dick. You asshole. You're being an asshole. You're being a dick. Fucking stop it.\" He was like, \"Eh, you're a dick, so what? What's the problem?\" He was coming from a place of love for me, and so I could not be defended in my response to him. It's really where you come from.\n\n(00:35:49):\nIt's the emotionally where you come from, that's the important part. Not as much what you say. You can see this, a perfect example of this is, this happens all the time in my work. Let's say there's a person who has a CEO and the person is scared of their CEO. Let's say this is the CMO, and they're, \"I'm scared of the CEO. I can't say my truth. They're always getting upset. They're going to yell, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.\" I'll say, yeah, there's one person who says it though. The answer is always yes. That CEO has one person who they don't yell at, who they listen to, who they'll take the objection from, that they don't get angry with. It's because there's somebody who doesn't approach them in fear. It's because somebody approaches them a different way. Not with judgment, but like, \"Hey, look, this is what we have to pay attention to.\" It's really about how you're coming at it and not what you're saying typically.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:36:52):\nThis episode is brought to you by Coda.

I'm very happy with what advice we've already shared and there's more I want to tap into.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:38:04):\nYou keep using the word advice, and I just want to, so for anybody who's listening, do not take my advice. Do not, do not, do not. Test it. Experiment. Set up an experiment, try it out. See if it's true for you. It's one, I just made this shit up. Somebody else could make up something different. It's like Jeff Bezos made up Amazon. We make stuff up, but we're humans. Two, is if you instead of just listen to it as a soundbite, if you actually do it and make an experiment out of it, you get to learn. It's in your bones. You get to see what's actually real for you. What's real for you in this moment might not be real for you what's in the next moment. For instance, I could give the advice that says, hey, you can't even control your thoughts.\n\n(00:38:55):\nYou can't even decide what thought you are going to have next is, it's just going to fucking happen. you're completely out of control, and so it's all a gift. Can you look at life as all a gift? Wow, that could be really useful for one person, but the other person, they feel so disempowered that they're like, \"I can't even control my own thoughts. Man, I am totally trapped.\" They might really need at that moment to learn that, \"Oh, I have empowerment, I have choice.\" That's the advice that they need to hear. Do the experiment, find out what's true for you in this moment. If there's a piece of advice, that's the one I want to give.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:39:40):\nlet's share more experiments people can run. Another is this thread that I feel comes up a lot in your work is you're just really big on helping people feel joy. Feels like that's the core of what you're trying to help people is feel more joy. Why is that so important? Why is joy so important, so powerful?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:39:57):\nI definitely would not want anyone to feel joy. I wouldn't want to push somebody into or like, \"Hey, you should feel joy.\" What I would say that's a close cousin to that is that enjoyment is such an important tool for productivity. Enjoyment is such an important tool for living a meaningful life. Enjoyment is an amazing tool. As an example, let's say you drive a Ferrari, you're not going to say, hey, that's an efficient car. That's a super-efficient car. You're going to say, no, that's a fast car. Somehow in our own lives, if we get something done quickly, we're efficient, but that's not efficient. You can go and get something done quickly and then you're so exhausted. What's efficient is if at the end of whatever you did, you feel like you have more energy, like you're stoked, like, oh, I can't wait to do this again tomorrow. That's efficiency, is that you've actually used the least amount of energy to get something done. If you say, oh, I'm going to figure out how to enjoy what I do 10% more and you succeed, you are 10% more efficient.\n\n(00:41:13):\nNot only that, usually, the quality is going to get a lot better too. If you enjoy running, you're probably going to run more than if you don't enjoy running. If you enjoy doing a podcast, you're probably going to make a better podcast and you're going to do it for longer if you enjoy doing it. There's something really, really important about enjoyment because it's not only a measure of efficiency, it also has a strong correlation with hire in most things has a strong correlation with how long you're going to do it, your staying power, the quality of what you're going to do, all of that. That's one of the reasons that I think enjoyment is really great. The other thing is that if you enjoy things, they feel different. I think one of the things that people do is they say this, they say, \"I want to enjoy my life more, so I'm going to do less things, take out the trash, and I'm going to do more things like go on vacation.\"\n\n(00:42:14):\nThat's not how enjoyment works. You can enjoy taking out the trash or you can hate taking out the trash. That's a choice. Right now, somebody listening to this as an experiment that they can run is like, okay, you're going to stay listening to this for the next minute. How do you enjoy it 10% more? Typically, what will happen is somebody will take a deeper breath, they'll settle into their body a little bit more, they'll relax a little bit more. They might physically get more comfortable. There's a thousand things that they might do to just enjoy the experience 10% more. That, and in that, they're becoming more efficient in that the quality is getting better in that they're hearing what I'm saying differently. It's just a really powerful tool. What I know the problem to be is that some people will go, \"Okay, now I have to enjoy life. I'm going to disregard all these negative emotions so that I'm in enjoyment.\" That doesn't work. It's horrendous. It's just a recipe for shit stew.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:43:18):\nAlong these lines, how much of the work is learning to enjoy the thing you're doing more versus finding something that you innately enjoy? Which one is more powerful? I guess, which do you point people to? Which experiments do you find people should run more?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:43:31):\nIn our society, typically, it's how to enjoy what you're doing more. What happens typically is that if you find a way to enjoy the thing that you're doing more, you're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. It's just an order of operations thing. As compared to there's people, a lot of the people in my circles because of who I coach and everything, they're billionaires and they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to try to arrange life that they enjoy and it doesn't fucking work. They actually have more power to make everything that they're doing exactly what they want to do, but that doesn't work. Flying the jet or buying the island or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, doesn't do it.\n\n(00:44:25):\nWhereas if you really learn to enjoy what's in front of you, all of a sudden, one thing that happens is that you're not as scared of enjoyment. You start saying, \"Oh, wow, enjoyment makes me really effective, and so I'm want to do the things that I enjoy.\" You're more likely to do the things that you enjoy. Instead of having this story, I have to do X, Y, and Z so that at one point in the future, I can do what I enjoy. It's just an order of operations things. If you learn to enjoy the things that you're doing, you're going to naturally start doing the things you enjoy. If you only do the things you enjoy, you will not learn how to enjoy what you're doing very well.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:03):\nYou show this tip of how can I enjoy this 10% more? Just ask yourself, how can I enjoy this 10% more?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:45:09):\nYes, right now.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:10):\nIs there anything else that you find helpful for helping? Yeah, right now, how can I enjoy this 10% right now?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:45:14):\nThat's right. It's not about changing anything in the external world.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:19):\nGot it. Internally, what can I do? What can I change about the way I'm experiencing this?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:45:23):\nYeah. I like to ask it as how do you enjoy it 10% more, because if it's what can I change, then there's trying, trying is usually not more enjoyment. It's actually usually letting go of trying that creates more enjoyment. The phrasing can really make or break the question.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:41):\nEnjoy it 10% more. Say someone's sitting in a boring meeting that's really sucking their soul, look, they should ask themselves this question, how can I enjoy this 10% more?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:45:51):\nWell, should, they can. They get to, it's a great experiment.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:45:54):\nIt's an experiment. Okay, perfect.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:45:58):\nThe reason I do the should thing is that as soon as you say you should and then you don't then you can fail. If you fail, then you're less likely to try it again. That's why the should, it ends up usually in stagnation. If you think about the way it feels in your body when you say, I should do something, and there's a stagnation, there's a, hmm. whereas if you say something like, oh, I want to do it, or here's an experiment I can do, or here's what I enjoy, there's less stagnation, there's more movement.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:46:31):\nThis touches on something else that you talk a lot about, and we've been circling around this idea of authenticity versus improvement, where you help people realize that you are good as you are, you don't need to necessarily improve. We've talked a lot about these sorts of things already, but just what else can you share there just how to help people learn this?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:46:49):\nMy favorite metaphor on this one is at what time in the journey of an oak tree is it perfect? Is it when it's an acorn, when it's sprout, when it's 20 years old, 40 years old, 150 years old, 200 years old, depending on the oak tree? Now, I'm perfect. The idea is ridiculous. It's a similar thing for us. The idea that I need to improve myself, it really disturbs the natural process that's at hand, which is we evolve. We as human beings evolve. If it's like, oh, I'm evolving and I can enjoy it, and I'm acting from my authenticity, then that has a lot of alacrity. That moves quick. If it's I need to improve, there's something wrong with me, I need to improve, I should do it, that all goes really fucking slow. Because there's a lot of emotional stagnation in that.\n\n(00:47:55):\nThere's a lot of should shame. There's a lot of stagnation in that, and so you don't actually get that natural flow of life. The Taoist talk about this as kind of like a river always finds its way, it just always goes in that direction. We are naturally evolving. That is our nature. Then to put a whole bunch of shoulds and shits in the way just slows the process down. The other thing about authenticity that I think is really important too, is that if you are one of the few people, I'd say 10, 15%, who can say, I should be this way, this way, and this way, and then you do it, which is very few people can actually do that. What most people do is they say, I should do this, should do that, should do that, and then a decade later, they're still saying they should do the same things. Let's say you're one of those really successful people, then you have a life for not you. Then you have a life of who you think you should be, not for who you actually are.\n\n(00:49:02):\nIf you move from authenticity, naturally, certain things aren't going to work, certain things are going to work. Certain people are going to work, certain people aren't going to work. Certain jobs are going to work. The ones that you end up with over time are going to be the ones that are right for you, not right, for who you think you should be. The most obvious of this is you meet a woman and you're like, oh, this is how I should be for them to love me, and you just do it. You just do everything that you think you should do, and then you get married, and then they love not you, they love who you think you should be. They don't love who you are. What kind of marriage is that? As opposed to, this is who I am and I'm going to be as genuine. I'm going to show you all my parts. I'm going to be as genuine as I can with you. Then if you do get married, you're married to the right person, you're married to the person who actually sees all that and loves that and wants that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:50:01):\nHow do you hold that idea with I also want to get better, I want to develop myself, I want to feel my emotions more, those sorts of things?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:50:10):\nI love that I want to, the better part is kind of just, gets a little bit in the way. We all want to, like a little kid wants to run faster. They might want to be a better runner, but the part that they missed, the reason that they develop so fucking quickly is because they don't think they're going to be a better person if they run faster. The idea is like, yeah, you have this natural want, that want is the thing that moves evolution. A plant is like, \"Oh, there's sun. I want to move in that direction.\" As compared to I should. Both of them are human concepts, but the want, it's the thing that what allows us to know that's our evolutionary path. Oh, I have this want to be closer to people. Oh, I have this want for great sex. Oh, I have this want for being able to have a business that supports me.\n\n(00:51:07):\nThese are great wants, and they show where the growth is occurring or wants to occur. It's like that's our natural evolution. It's great. What makes it need to be better? I want to be better. It just slows it down instead of, it's like saying that what I am is broken and therefore, the whole thing slows down. We try to word everything as more in the experimental framework, but also, we try to word everything as self-awareness, self-experimentation, self-discovery, instead of self-improvement. Because if you understand the problem, then the problem goes away. Just explore it. Just understand it as compared to making a list of things that you should do to get better, that you will eventually fail and then you'll just be stuck in this should loop where you beat yourself up and where most people hang out a lot.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:52:10):\nThe experiment here that I'm taking away is think more about your want versus the should, and then things you think you need is okay.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:52:20):\nBecause typically, when you say, I want to improve, it means the subtext in that is once I do X, Y, and Z, then I'm lovable. Once I do X, Y and Z, then I'm okay. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be worthy. Once I do X, Y and Z, I'll be enlightened, whatever the fuck, the thing is. That's just not how it works. What works is the person who loves themselves has loving relationships. It's not the person who's done X, Y, and Z so that they can be lovable, has loving relationships. The people who do X, Y and Z, so they can be lovable have relationships where people are critical and constantly telling them that they have to be better.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:01):\nComing back, you just said this interesting quote that you also shared at the beginning. This idea, once we understand the problem, it goes away.\n\nJoe Hudson (00:53:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:53:07):\nLet's make sure people understand what that means. Is it related to this idea once you feel like I'm an asshole, okay, and then like, oh, okay, and then it starts to kind of away, is that the core?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:53:15):\nI just mean practically. It's like, can you really fully understand a problem if you don't understand the solution to it? There's a principle, and I can't remember the name of it, like it's Strickland principle or something. It's something that this CFO that I used to work with said, and he would say, \"Problems get solved if you spend time on them. If you just give enough attention to a problem, the problem will solve.\" That's the way it works in business. An unsolvable problem, obviously, it's not going to work that way. The reason that, that works is because the more you spend time on a problem, the more you understand it.\n\n(00:53:58):\nAnother one, love him or hate him, one of the things that Elon Musk has said that I found it very valuable in my time, is that if you really want to interview somebody and they claim that they've done something, you ask them six levels down. You improved sales. How did you do that, exactly? Well, we improved the pipeline. How'd you do that, exactly? Oh, well, we made the pipeline more measurable by having things that could be. How did you know? What were the seven stages of the pipeline and what made you pick them? You go six levels down and you can really understand if somebody was the person who solved the problem or if they're the person who is claiming that they solved the problem. It's the same thing.\n\n(00:54:47):\nIf we just explore a problem enough, the solution is apparent. If we understand the problem enough, the solution is apparent. Typically, if we come to a problem with a kid's mind, wonder, if we come to it, what could I learn here? What's exciting? What are the experiments I can run? Then typically, that's the most efficient way, enjoyable way to solve a problem as compared to, I have to get to this problem by this time and we're going to do it this way. Usually, that doesn't work. I could geek out on why that lets democracies win over autocracies because they're far more experimental by nature, and it's not one person saying how things are going, but just generally, just we're more efficient when we're exploring. We're more efficient when we're exploring ourselves and understanding ourselves and trying to improve ourselves.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (00:55:46):\nThere's a couple of more experiments I want to help people try to run. One is you have some really good advice around decision-making and how emotions and getting better at understanding and working with your emotions helps you make better decisions. Can you talk about that?\n\nJoe Hudson (00:55:59):\nThat's similar to what I said before, which is if you learn to fall in love with the emotional experiences, then you have more solution sets. Let's say I want to have all human beings, I want to be a part of a great team. Nobody has ever raised their hand and said, \"I'd like to be a part of a team.\" Yet, grand majority of people at their work right now have shitty teams or not A teams, not great teams, even though nobody wants that. If one of the things you're unwilling to feel is that conflict, that tension, as we talked about if you're conflict avoidant, you're not going to be able to make an A team because there's nothing that is alive doesn't require tension. A cell requires tension. Breathing requires tension. Playing pickleball requires tension. A good team requires tension. If you're going to avoid that experience, you're not going to be as easily, if at all, be able to create a quality team.\n\n(00:57:05):\nTo be able to look forward to any emotional experience, creates more and more solution sets for more and more optionality. In creating a great team, for instance, you need to be good with people hating you. You need to be good with drawing boundaries and having people upset. You need to be able to have high expectations. You have to be okay with somebody being disappointed with themselves. You have to be okay being disappointed with yourself. All these emotional experiences have to be available to you if you're going to find the solutions to make an A quality team. The more you can fall in love with each emotional experience, the more you have and then the clearer the decision making gets. That's one thing for making great decisions. The other one that I find really, really useful and very hard to execute on until you really understand it is creating a set of principles to live by.\n\n(00:58:06):\nWe all have a set of principles to live by that we're doing it. For a lot of people, those principles are what do I have to do to get likes on Facebook? I'm going to make a decision based on getting likes on Facebook. I'm going to make decisions based on whatever it is. Pretending that I want to get wealthy or trying to get wealthy or there's a series of things. If you really take a look at what it is you're making your decisions on and then really think about, well, what would be the five or six things that if I made decisions with these principles, I'm guaranteed success? Then experiment with them and then refine those principles and then experiment with them. Then there'll be these moments where you don't want to do it, but those are your principles, so you're going to go and do it.\n\n(00:59:03):\nAs an example for this, one of the principles that I live by is embrace intensity. It's not create intensity, it's embrace intensity. It means that right now, any moment in my body, for instance, there's going to be a sensation that's more intense. How do I welcome that sensation? At any moment in running my business, there's going to be something that we don't want to talk about. How do we lean in and talk about that? We start all of our meetings with what are you scared to say in our business? What are you scared to say? Not all of our meetings, but some of our meetings are started with what are you scared to say? Because we want to embrace that intensity because we know that if we lean into the thing that we're trying to avoid, our life is going to get better, our business is going to get better.\n\n(00:59:57):\nIf you can see what those principles are for you, and then run experiments to see if they work and then refine them every once in a while. Because of that embrace intensity, if somebody comes to me and says, \"You're fucking up this business. You're doing it all wrong.\" I don't have to think about what I'm going to do. I'm like, \"Oh, cool. Tell me what I'm missing.\" It's going to be immediate because I live this way. Maybe I don't want to hear it. Maybe I'm having a bad day. Whatever it is. Maybe I'll say, \"Hey, I want hear you give me, I'm not able to, give me a day and I'll come back to you.\" all of a sudden, my decisions get made automatically if I live by a set of principles and very effective, I find very effective living by a set of principles\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:00:51):\nFor someone that wants to create their own set of principles. Is there a guide you have? Is there any advice for how to actually go about starting this list, putting it together?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:00:58):\nWe have a decisions course, which is a large part of it is about how to do that. It's a difficult one to explain because there's a lot of nuance in it. Just as for instance, one of the nuances is defining the principles, not just by what it is, but what it isn't is a really significant, very minor thing, but it ends up being incredibly major. If you're going to do your set of principles and you want to do them on your own, the main thing I would say is keep it to five. I wouldn't even do six. I don't do six, but I keep it to five. I would test each one of them for five days.\n\n(01:01:39):\nMake your principle and then see if it works for you for five days and then keep on experimenting until you find five. When you look at those five and you say, \"If I do that, if I live by those principles, I am just almost a hundred, if not a hundred percent confident that, that's going to create the life I want if I live by those principles.\" Then you have a really good start and make them simple. Mine are things like embrace intensity or connection first or everything is in iteration. As soon as I live by them, things work, company works.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:20):\nAmazing. We'll point folks to that course if they want to take it themselves. Cool.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:02:25):\nIt's only once a year, so it's a rare one.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:27):\nOh, wow. When is the next one?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:02:29):\nJanuary.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:02:30):\nOkay. Not too far away for folks to want to wait. Again, the two pieces of advice you shared, and that's our experiments that we can run to help become better decision makers. One is create a list of life principles, and there's a course that will point people to, to take that. The other is the thing you keep coming back to over and over and over, this idea of falling in love with your emotions, embracing your emotions, welcoming your emotions. There's also, I know you do a lot of work with teams. I imagine there's very similar advice for how to help your team be more effective. Principles, I imagine is a part of it, falling in love.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:03:02):\nWe've run principles for teams, yeah. That's one of them. Teams would be more effective. We have a lot of, I mean I think I have, at this point, I have 12 things that I'll go into a company and do with a company. Typically, the way I like to do it is I will go in and I'll talk to the leader typically and they'll say, \"This is what I want.\" Then I really want to assess. Typically, if the person who is a big part of creating the problem has a hard time seeing the way through the problem, or it wouldn't have been created generally. This is not demeaning any leader, we all have these issues. Usually, what I like to do is I like to go in and I like to talk to three or four people, see what their perspective, not just the leader's perspective.\n\n(01:03:57):\nThen I like to sit in a meeting or two and just see actually what the dynamic is. One of the things I like to say about how to change a company is that the atomic structure of a company is the meetings and the decisions. It's particularly true in Silicon Valley, but it's really true in all businesses that all we are as a company is a group of people's relationships and ideas. Especially, like Amazon, you got a couple of buildings and some servers. There's not a lot of hardware there, and they wouldn't be useful without the people anyways. Anybody, whether you're running a farm or a shoe factory or anybody's successful is going to tell you it's all about the people. The atomic structure is what are our meetings like and how do we make decisions? I'll just really pay attention to a meeting. One of the things we do is we talk about what we call five-star meetings, which is how do you make every meeting enjoyable?\n\n(01:05:04):\nLiterally, how is it that everybody when they walk out of a meeting, they're like, oh, fuck, that was great? It turns out, we've all been in meetings that are hard as shit, and we've walked out and gone, oh, those are great meetings. We've all been in meetings where nothing happens and we're like, \"Oh, God. Fuck, another one to just drive a nail through my head. I don't want to sit there.\" What's required to make one of your meetings five stars? If you do that, that's one of the things we'll do inside of a company is work with them to figure that out. If you do that, every single problem with your company will come to the surface. Every single one of them. I had ten five -tar meetings, but these two meetings sucked. That tells me exactly where we need to focus as a company.\n\n(01:05:53):\nThat tells me exactly where to look for the problem that's happening. It's the same thing with decisions. If you really start unpacking how the decisions are made where people are frustrated in the decision-making process, you're going to find exactly the problems in the company. An example of this, I was working with a friend and he's a content person, and we were just talking about how do you make every one of your meetings a five-star meeting? He's like, \"Okay, great.\" He's like, \"Yeah, I'm never going to do this.\" I was like, \"Really? Tell me why.\" He's, \"My YouTube meetings fucking suck.\" That's not where he makes most of his money, but these YouTube meetings suck. They're never going to get better.\n\n(01:06:39):\nLuckily, there's a couple other people around at the time and everyone's like, \"No, wait, I love my YouTube meetings. What do you mean? How could this not work for you?\" He noticed, oh, the team didn't, the content, none of it was working for him. None of it was him. He was just like, \"Ugh.\" He changed it. He was like, \"Okay, I'm going to commit to that. I'm going to see what it's like for me to just say every one of my YouTube meetings have to be something that's super enjoyable to me.\" When he did it, his YouTube numbers went off the charts in a very short period of time. It's just that common. Wherever the meeting is that sucks, it means there's something else that's a problem that needs to be worked on. That's typically how. I can just look at, usually sit in any team meeting and see at least three or four of the major problems that are happening in the company.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:07:29):\nSuch a cool way of thinking about where to focus decision-making meetings. I love that the story comes back to something you shared earlier with the more you enjoy something, the more joy there is, the better it's going to go anyway. The more you can find those moments and make things enjoyable, the better.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:07:45):\nThe other cool thing is most of the executives or the CEOs that I've worked with, when they get to a point, and it usually takes them like, we always have the goal of a month, it usually takes two months to make sure every one of their meetings is five-star meetings. Once they've done that, then it's like, how do you make sure all of your teams have five-star meetings? Usually, it's like within two months and they usually have half the amount of meetings at the end of it. Half the amount of meetings in their companies are more effective. It's an incredible tool.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:08:18):\nI could see why people enjoy that if you were meeting as well. Is there anything more along those lines before we start to close out our conversation, either around teams or decision-making?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:08:30):\nI'll say for anybody who's running a team, Harvard has got a couple of these, but we used to do these tiny pulses. As a VC, one of the strategies that was really effective that I saw very few VCs doing was I would want these pulse, I would like to read the pulse of teams with these short surveys and stuff. It was the most effective way of not very happy, didn't want to come to work on Monday. They weren't going to make their numbers. The likelihood of them making their numbers is going down. There was this interesting thing that just about how Drucker, I think said it first and then the Virgin guy.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:09:15):\nBranson?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:09:16):\nBranson said it. He's like, \"Culture eats strategy for breakfast,\" or some such. If that's true, then it's measurable and it can be a leading indicator, and it absolutely is. If you really pay attention to the culture on a team-by-team basis, it's an amazing, very effective way to drive results, but also, a very effective way to know when bad results are coming. What's interesting to me is most people feel like they can't control the culture, like most people feel like.\n\n(01:09:52):\nMost people, I notice, they feel like, it's more likely for me to hear from a CEO, \"God damn it, everybody agrees when I get out of the table. When I get off the table, everyone's like, yeah, we're going to do it. Then they don't do it. Why aren't they doing it?\" I'm going to hear that more often than I'm going to hear a CEO say, \"Oh, wow. I really noticed that the way the email system was working in our company, we were disempowering people by not requiring an action after every...\" I'm going to hear more complaints about why shit isn't working than I'm going to hear about strategies, like very gentle, simple strategies to change the culture. it's an amazing thing to me that it's so powerful and yet people feel so out of control with it\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:10:40):\nTo give people something they can do, say today or tomorrow to work on a lot of these things we've been talking about. Is there just one thing you recommend that basically everyone should try to experiment with in the next day, couple of days or weeks, just to help them be better and more successful and happier?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:11:00):\nI would do seven minutes, no less than seven minutes. You can do more than seven minutes. Seven minutes of gratitude with another person every day. It can't be, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this, I'm grateful for this. It has to be feeling the gratitude and then seeing what comes out of your mouth when you're coming from the felt sense of gratitude and doing it back and forth. You're savoring the experience of gratitude and you're going back and forth with another human being. Call mom, dad, sister, brother, business partner, friend, and every day just express gratitude back and forth for seven minutes, coming from the feeling, not from the thought. If you have a full body sensation of gratitude and you experience that for seven minutes a day, it'll change your life dramatically really quickly. Really, really quickly.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:02):\nWow. I already feel it. The practice is you are expressing gratitude to the person you're with.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:12:09):\nIt can be gratitude for anything in your life. As a matter of fact, I would say do it for a couple of weeks and then do it on the places where you feel lack. That's where the superpower comes in. In my own personal life, I was meditating. I spent seven, eight hours a day meditating for years.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:12:31):\nThat's a lot of hours.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:12:32):\nYou can imagine, I didn't have a lot of money. The joke I used to make is I would meditate and worry about money most of my day. It's funny, but it's truth. One day, I was thinking about money and thinking I was driving in my car and I was thinking about this billionaire I knew and I was thinking about how I didn't have enough and then I thought, \"Oh, this billionaire doesn't think they have enough either. I know I'm well enough.\" I'm like, \"Oh, I have the experience of a billionaire right now.\" I was like, \"He's probably driving in a car somewhere thinking he doesn't have enough, and I'm driving in a car somewhere thinking I don't have enough. This is great. I'm a billionaire.\"\n\n(01:13:20):\nIt tickled me, the idea tickled me. Then I was like, well, what happens if I start focusing on everything I do have instead of focusing on what I don't have? Which is where the gratitude practice came from. My wife and I would sit every day and just be grateful for all the physical stuff that we had. We were living in a hobble, were living 15-year-old year cars. We had no money. I was in debt. I was in, I think $40,000 in credit card debt or some crazy shit. We just did it. Literally, was it three months later, my credit card debt was gone. Six months later, I had $60,000 in the bank. Entire life changed because I no longer defined myself by somebody who didn't have, I defined myself as somebody who did have. All of a sudden, I could look out the window and it wasn't, \"Oh, shit, I can't have that. I can't have that. I can't have that.\"\n\n(01:14:18):\nI look out the window, I'd say somebody made money on that. Somebody made money on that. Every fucking thing I looked at, somebody made money on. 20 people, 20 companies made money on the fucking lamppost. The person who installed it, the energy company, the rubber company, there's just, holy crap, it's all over the place. Then in that definition, all of a sudden, it became really clear. It doesn't matter if the thing that you feel like you lack is time, or the thing that you feel like you lack is love or the thing that you feel like you lack is money. If you can really do a gratitude practice on the thing that you lack, there's a superpower in that one, changes everything.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:14:57):\nDo you still do this?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:15:00):\nI do gratitude, yes. Do I do gratitude on stuff I lack? I don't really have an experience of lack. That's not really...\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:07):\nYou still do this gratitude, seven minutes?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:15:09):\nOf course, yes. That's like asking if I still have sex. Why would I give that up? It feels great.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:16):\nJust to be clear, you find someone seven minutes every morning, probably think about things you're grateful for and share back. Focus not on your intellectual thing you're grateful for, but just what's coming out of your emotional body.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:15:28):\nFeel the gratitude.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:30):\nYeah, then gratitude.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:15:30):\nLet the feeling of gratitude speak rather than your mind, so that you get the felt sense of it.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:15:38):\nJoe, I'm incredibly grateful for you. I really appreciate you sharing so many experiments for people to run. I think this is going to make a real impact on a lot of people's lives. Two final questions. Where can folks find your courses? I know you have a podcast. Where can folks find the stuff they do online, and then how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:15:55):\nFirst of all, Art of Accomplishment, the podcast, it's Art of Accomplishment with Brett Kistler and Joe Hudson, I think. Then Art of Accomplishment, the website will show you where all the courses are. It'll give you a whole bunch of experiments you can run. There's all sorts of really great information there. The other thing that we just mentioned also is just that we really want to make sure that you think that the courses are for you. The way we do courses is that it's a very felt experience thing. It's not intellectual at all. It's really in your body. The way we like doing it is that you bring real problems that you're having and you use the tools that we teach you. The foundational course for that is called the Connection Course. If you want to get into it, go to the Connection Course.\n\n(01:16:45):\nTo find out if it's right for you, if you're not already know that it's right for you, we do these little hour and a half free workshops and it'll give you a taste of what it is that we do because it's like anything that's going on out there. It's people doing, they're like, \"What the hell was that?\" It's just a completely different thing. It's not like learning in the normal way. You literally sit down with another person and run experiments face-to-face with how you're being in the moment. You learn all this stuff through direct experimentation. If you find out it's right for you, you can do it through these workshops, and I'm sure there'll be a place where they can find out where to go for that.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:27):\nThere's one coming up in September, I believe.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:17:30):\nThe Connection Course is coming up in September. It's a great place to start. It's foundational for everything else we do.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:17:37):\nThen how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJoe Hudson (01:17:39):\nI want my children to grow up in a fantastic world. The best way that, that can happen is that if the people listening to this discover who they are and their nature and the truth of how they operate. Not for them, but for their children and their children's children. You want to do me a favor and make my daughter's world a better place.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:08):\nI also just had a son, and so I totally resonate with that.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:18:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:13):\nJoe, thank you so much for being here. What an amazing podcast episode. This ended up being as I expected.\n\nJoe Hudson (01:18:19):\nPleasure. Thanks for having me. Appreciate it, Lenny.\n\nLenny Rachitsky (01:18:22):\nBye, everyone.

Episode 135: What differentiates the highest-performing product teams | John Cutler (The Beautiful Mess)

  "title": "What differentiates the highest-performing product teams | John Cutler (The Beautiful Mess)",
  "transcript": "# What differentiates the highest-performing product teams | John Cutler (The Beautiful Mess)\n\n## Transcript\n\nJohn Cutler (00:00:00):\nLet's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, should I invest more on processes, or should I invest more in people. The first thing is introspection. What do you believe in, really? What do you believe in, and what do the people around you believe in, and how can you be a coherent leader? And you know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy plate, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from like a process-driven meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to like I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of a consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe, and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives.\n\nLenny (00:00:49):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny, and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and scaling today's most successful companies. Today my guest is John Cutler. John is one of the most prolific, beloved, and longtime writers and sharers of product wisdom online, and as you'll hear at the start of this episode, thanks to his really unique role at Amplitude, he's worked with a large percentage of product teams and product managers around the world. I've learned a lot from John's writings over the years and share his stuff often, and so it was a real honor to chat in depth with John. I anticipated this would happen and it happened, this ended up being the longest episode I've done yet, and honestly, we could have kept going for a lot longer.\n\n(00:01:35):\nWe chat about what differentiates the highest performing product teams from less well performing product teams, what it takes to create real change within a company, why you should be skeptical of frameworks and tools that you read about online, why all underperforming teams fail in similar ways but high performing teams succeed in many different ways, and so much more. I am confident you will love this episode and I cannot wait for you to hear it. With that, I bring you John Cutler after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(00:02:05):\nThis episode is brought to you by Merge.

Visit merge.dev/ lenny to get started and integrate up to five customers for free.\n\n(00:03:06):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern growth team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools, or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics, and then set you to North Star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine-learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com, and 10 x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:04:18):\nJohn Cutler, welcome to the podcast.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:04:21):\nYeah, thanks for having me, Lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:23):\nI kind of know you as John Cutler. I feel weird to call you just John. Do you find that to be true, and also do people call you John Cuttlefish because of your Twitter handle?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:04:32):\nYeah, John Cuttlefish. There is this, I learned yesterday, there's a DJ, a famous DJ called Jon Cutler without the H, so I don't know if are people into house music knew that. Yeah, I think usually it just, like most Johns, it forms into Cutler or JC or something like that, but just John is good, yeah, for now, or Cuttlefish, you could just call me Cuttlefish. That'd be fine.\n\nLenny (00:04:51):\nYou said that actually, we were talking before this, you said you do some music, so is that DJ actually you?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:04:57):\nNo, but that would be really funny. In fact, the person yesterday who reached out over Twitter said, \"Dude, I don't know what you're doing now in your career, but I really like your earlier work.\" But that would've been pretty cool to be Jon Cutler, the DJ. I wrote songs and played rock music and stuff, not like a house DJ.\n\nLenny (00:05:15):\nOkay, this could be the next phase of your career which we'll talk a bit about. But let me just say that I'm so incredibly excited for this conversation. I've been hoping to do this for a long time, and now that you're between gigs, we finally found an opportunity to do this, and I just have a feeling this is going to be one of the longest episodes we've done because there's so much I want to ask you, and there's so much interesting stuff that you've had access to and that I think that you can share. So, I hope you're ready for potentially a marathon of an episode.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:05:40):\nSure, yeah, I'm ready. This is exciting. I'm on vacation now between jobs, so this is the highlight of my day. We can go all day if you want.\n\nLenny (00:05:47):\nAll right. Eight hours. Let's do it.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:05:49):\nTerrific.\n\nLenny (00:05:50):\nSo, I was thinking that we start with a little bit about this unique role that you had at Amplitude which you just left after about four years, and what's most interesting about it is it give you access to an incredible number of product teams and product managers, unlike anything else I've seen or any other role I've seen before. So, could you just talk a little bit about this role that you had at Amplitude, and what it was like to work with so many product teams and so many product managers?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:06:16):\nYeah, absolutely. So, first off, I remember almost specifically the day that Sandhya from Amplitude reached out and was sort of floated this idea of this role to me, and I'm so grateful for Sandhya, and Justin, Matt Althauser, Spencer, the whole team, because it was really, it was really kind of a weird role from the beginning. They were starting to get more and more customers who were not traditional startups or kind of growth stage startups showing up, and they needed to figure out how to convey expertise and convey things to the broader product public in a way that would land with those companies, right? I guess, kudos to them thinking this weird idea could work. So, I'm really, really grateful for that.\n\n(00:07:06):\nBut yeah, my official title was product evangelist. I don't think that I super fit that role, but that was the title that we had, and basically my job was to wake up every morning and do things that would overlap Amplitude the product, but then help uplevel our customers, sort of uplevel the broader product community. I call them current customers and future customers. That's how I woke up every day, I'm either talking to a current customer, I'm talking to a future customer. This product transformation's happening all around the world, just means it's a matter of time, eventually they'll become Amplitude customers, so I should just try to make them awesome and try to help them with different expertise.\n\n(00:07:46):\nBut my day-to-day was spent a lot advocating for different ways of working, doing coaching, doing workshops. I wrote the North Star Playbook in partnership with Jason who was a co-writer with that. We did a lot of one-to-one coaching sessions. I had these things called product therapy sessions when I would just wake up in the morning and just kind of soak in whatever problem people were having for the day. I did meet with hundreds and hundreds of people and did workshops for thousands and thousands of people and talks for more than that, tens of thousands, really, in terms of the talks. So, it was just a, yeah, crazy experience doing that. So, the technical details is I predominantly reported into marketing and product marketing, and then I did a stint actually where I was on our product team as we were sort of getting our education efforts going, ultimately we moved that over to customer success, and I went back to marketing. So, that's the technical side of it, I reported into marketing.\n\n(00:08:45):\nBut I do remember the day I arrived and probably a couple weeks later, we had our all hands annual kickoff, and there was a big presentation about our goal being the trusted expert, and that still resonates with me the whole time I was there that an evangelist is there to help uplevel the world with trusted expertise, and in a product like analytics product, there's the product analytics, but then there's whole other ways of working that overlap that. So, yeah, generally that was my role. It kind of is a crazy role, for sure.\n\nLenny (00:09:16):\nThat is wild. You're basically like a free product coach for product team. You just come in, help them uplevel the way they build product, and then Amplitude becomes... You need to figure out how to work with data, Amplitude can help you be more data informed. I imagine that's kind of the general idea.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:09:30):\nYeah, it's funny, I joke with our professional services team. I mean, so if you're a SaaS company, I think sometimes you have a professional services team. At Amplitude, especially the way that we saw that is companies put money in and that sort of creates skin in the game. They're really paying you less for the professional services and more for the accountability and the access to the expertise. So, I would joke with Jenna from that team that maybe we should have monetized all these workshops. I know Gibb and other people, they're charging a good chunk for North Star workshops and here we were just kind of doing them for free.\n\n(00:10:04):\nSo, ultimately, maybe there was another strategy there, but that we did those generally for free, and sometimes I kind of stuck my foot in it. In the middle of the pandemic at one point we were like, \"What are we going to do? We can't travel for workshops.\" And I would put in my newsletter, \"Hey, anyone want a workshop?\" And then suddenly, our sales team, we had to grapple with what are we going to do with these 120 leads, how are we going to work with them. It was funny having to deal with it.\n\n(00:10:32):\nBut yeah, in general, this is a unique role. I would definitely consider a SaaS company's think about a role like this, but it's really nuanced. We can share some links later as I reflected on what we did right and wrong, but ultimately, I think you shouldn't rely on individual people. You should think of evangelists as almost like concentric circles of your community and some people who just happen to have more expertise. Look, our internal team's amazing, Ibrahim, Justin, and Abbie, and when Sandhya was at the company, and just, everyone's an advocate. Everyone's a potential evangelist. It's just that there's only so many hours in the day. So, you could think of your community as just these concentric circles of evangelists and advocates. It's just like how you design it right that does it. So, yeah, recommended. It's a little tricky, but yeah, it was a cool move to do.\n\nLenny (00:11:19):\nThat sounds like a future post, how to do this in a different way where they don't have a John Cutler in place. You said you worked with hundreds of teams. Maybe just give us some numbers roughly of how many companies have you worked with, how many product managers do you think you've spoken to in this career.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:11:32):\nOh geez.\n\nLenny (00:11:33):\nThis phase of your career.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:11:34):\nSo, I think I did it... There might have been over the four years, maybe 800 one-on-ones, individual leader one-on-ones. I'm thinking it was at the peak, it was in one year's 150 workshops and then overlapped in the next year, then between 200, but mostly the average maybe let's say three or 400 workshops, a hundred a year. It's heavy. And then there was these just general conference talks and other things that we're doing. I tried to total, I exported all my Google Calendar invites, I tried to categorize all them at some point, but really also you have to think about it is that what we did with the North Star Playbook, it was truly a team effort at Amplitude.\n\n(00:12:19):\nWe started to have our, I think it was Sandhya who needed to like, we had three days to go in to close a customer and they were looking for us for trusted expertise, and she pulled together this workshop and she came up with these three games of product which is a really tricky and cool way to describe how your North Star inputs and North Star should be, and it started this ball rolling, and then they wrote a blog post about it.\n\n(00:12:42):\nSo, if you search North Star, you get to Sandhya's post. It's an amazing post, and then our CSM started to learn how to do it, and then we were like, \"We should write a playbook for it.\" And then it got to the point where if you go on LinkedIn, people are like, \"We used,\" and I made a whole point of saying we did not invent this thing, but people will say, \"We use Amplitude's North Star framework,\" and I have to always chime in, like, \"No, we did not invent that thing. You should go to Sean or you should go to any of these people who've done it in the past.\" But yeah, the whole point is that a lot of this stuff was evolved over time. It wasn't just some snap marketing campaign to do it.\n\n(00:13:17):\nSame thing are our retention playbooks and engagement playbooks. When I arrived at Amplitude, people would send pictures of those playbooks sitting on their desks and people thought, \"Oh, it's just this piece of marketing content. How did they pull it together?\" I did some research and our CS team developed 110-page bulk of research from working directly with customers around retention engagement, then we had a PM and a great content writer, Archana, zero in and kind of make it palatable, then we did ARC for it. So, it didn't just magically appear. People think that these artifacts that Amplitude has just magically appeared, but they were just... It's a company filled with passionate experts of these things, and it was like tested, iterated, tested, iterated, expanded, tested, put into motion, put into practice, and that's how you create these kind of franchise cornerstone pieces of content for your company. You don't just snap your fingers one day. So, anyway, I wanted to point that out. Huge group effort for all these things.\n\nLenny (00:14:22):\nHow does it feel to have left Amplitude at this point? I imagine you're going through some rollercoaster emotions.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:14:26):\nOh geez. Well, the immense amount of gratitude, definitely, mention that, wonderful people, wonderful customers. Just imagine like if you're a product nerd, one day you're with Amazon, one day you're with Ikea, one day you're with LEGO, one day you're with Intercom, then you're with a two-person startup, and then you're with Figma. So, really, once in a lifetime experience to be able to do that. In fact, if I had been a paid consultant, I never would've been able to do that. Another thing too is that there's this sort of selection bias. If you're a consultant, people come to you to work with you, but often I just had to talk to whatever team wanted access to expertise at Amplitude, not necessarily me. So, I didn't get to dictate A lot of times the conversation. It's like, shit, I'm not doing a very good job here. This person thinks in a very different way to do that.\n\n(00:15:18):\nSo, yeah, a lot of gratitude. I would say it got really heavy a lot in the sense that my son was born, three months later, I start the job, and then the pandemic kicks in, and every day you're absorbing just attention from teams. You're meeting leaders who are about to leave. Five days later, you're meeting people who are trying to save their team from the pandemic, imploding everything they're doing. Yeah, I'm joke about the product therapy thing, but I would finish the day at 2:00 or 3:00 and then have to do another one. Wake up at 5:00 to do an EMEA workshop, 5:00 to 7:00, be two in workshop, then take a break, then do another two-hour workshop, and then talk to a leader about how everything was going to explode, and then another leader. And then I was still on a team in Amplitude, so I might go to my own meeting where we're working through our own challenges, and then it's 4:00 or 5:00 in the afternoon. I'm done. Oh, to be able to do that.\n\n(00:16:16):\nAnd then I think it also left me with a couple key lessons we could probably go into later when we're doing it. One, you are talking to a bunch of different companies, achieving the almost similar results in very, very different ways. They behave in different ways, the context in the pandemic or the economy. You would see the pandemic kick in and then you would talk to 50 companies that were dealing with the ramifications of it. So, it's kind of funny, I joked with someone at Amplitude, they're like, \"We were going through our own shit,\" and I'm like, \"Yeah, and I've seen how 50 other companies are going through their own shit,\" where this is you're doing it. So, the power of context.\n\n(00:16:52):\nThe regional differences were so fascinating. I was on with a teen that was based in India and just the passion and curiosity. There was not one jaded person in the room. There was not one person like, \"Been there, done that. When's the performance review cycle ending?\" or anything like that. It was just all-out passion and hunger for information. So, those days were amazing. So, yeah, you talk a lot about it, but it definitely, it feels like a relief in some ways because the amount of tension to do it. And so, for my next plan actually what I'm doing is I'm going to work at Toast in a couple weeks, and I've been in touch with a leader there, Craig Daniel, for a long time, kind of really liked what he did at Drift.\n\n(00:17:40):\nBut I think that what I realized over the course of these four years is that I wanted to pivot back to help put most of my energy into helping my own company. They're growing super fast, so the numbers are in the hundreds of everything or in the thousands of everything, and they're not just the POS business. They've got these different businesses, like guest services and back office stuff and things. Amplitude is a super horizontal, if you think about it, it's almost like a diagonal, and so it made your head spin, and I kind of wanted to go back to a vertical SaaS. There's a company here in Santa Barbara called AppFolio that I like working at, and I really had a soft spot for vertical SaaS, but I'm thinking put my energy into an internal team for a little bit to pivot back into that. And so, I'll be helping enable product teams and sort of doing what I was doing, but within a company as well. So, it's going to be an interesting shift.\n\nLenny (00:18:29):\nYou touched on so many topics that I want to dig further into, and you also talked about where you're heading next, which I was going to ask, so that's great. Thank you for covering all that. By the way, I was just going to also say, lucky Toast, wow, to get John Cutler. Go them.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:18:42):\nOh, lucky me. I mean, Jesus, Toast is this gem. I just was joking with Craig the other day. I was like, \"I did not know all that stuff was going on at Toast.\"\n\nLenny (00:18:52):\nAwesome. Okay. So, before we dig into some of the stuff that you brought up like cultural differences between companies, what the best teams are doing differently, things like that, I actually, and you noticed, I asked on Twitter what I should ask you. You have a lot of fans on Twitter and there's a ton of questions, and one actually got pretty spicy and I want to touch on it briefly. This guy, Jason Cohen pointed out that a lot of the stuff you share online in your newsletter and tweets and things like that, it often doesn't have a clear recommendation of here's what you should do or concrete piece of advice you could take away. It's kind of messy which is appropriate because your newsletter is called A Beautiful Mess. And so, my question to you is why have you found that you like to embrace the mess in your writing and your thinking and your advice?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:19:38):\nI was reflecting that the newsletter, it's almost like an emo band, The Beautiful Mess, it's so angsty. It couldn't have been more... If I had a band, I did not have an emo band when I was 16, but if I did, I would've called it The Beautiful Mess. So, it's probably pretty consistent with personality to do those things. I mean, I actually really appreciated Jason pointing that out, and in fact, at the end of this year, I put this post out to people saying, \"Hey, here are things I'm grappling with, like the actionability of the content that I put out there, diversity of product advice, it's important to me,\" and then what it's like to just be a weirdo. We all have our weird freak things to do these things. And so, what does it mean to embrace those things? So, it was really timely I thought that Jason put that out there, and so maybe I'll give a little background about the newsletter and what I was looking for that.\n\n(00:20:29):\nAnd so, I think that the first thing that I did was four years ago, I kind of scanned the product advice landscape and I noticed three things. First, there's sort of three perspectives that pervaded, and again, I just want to make a huge caveat, this is not a judgment on any of these particular perspectives. It's more like I noticed a lot of it. And the first was that to be successful, number one, maybe success is tools, skills, mindset. So, that's kind of one group of particular things. The second that in terms of worldviews, we mentioned international worldviews too, but there was a high percentage of product advice that was kind of grounded where you think it would be grounded. So, it was grounded in this idea of meritocracy. Success is primarily about merit, very highly individualistic, and we don't realize that in the US until you do meetings with other teams, just how individualistic we can be when it comes to how we think about teams should be set up and stuff.\n\n(00:21:28):\nAnd then I think the third thing I realized was that it was very often very context free, and I mean that actually in the nicest way. It was optimized to make sure that it could be actionable, that someone could take that away. That's what I really like about the content that you put out there, and I like about a lot of the guests on the podcast. They kind of lay it out in those particular things. And so, to kind of go through, yeah, those tools, skills, mindset, that makes sense, right? Who does not want tools to be better? In fact, a lot of the podcasts I like, we can get into that later, are like, \"We're going to give you the tools and tactics that the best people do.\" So, I really like that kind of stuff as well.\n\n(00:22:04):\nThe second part of that is this idea of success be mostly about individual skills in jobs. So, this idea of great leaders, high performing teams, 10 x people, kind of go on and on. And then the product mindset stuff which is a little bit like you have it or you don't, or you develop or you don't. It's very mysterious. So, again, I'm going to go through these things and then think about how they inspire me. Part of me was like, \"Okay, there's a lot of that stuff, but maybe not as much stuff kind of unraveling the dynamics that happen behind those things.\"\n\n(00:22:36):\nSo, the meritocracy stuff and the individualism stuff, it's basically the people rise to the top, they try the hardest, they work the hardest, the best in companies employ them. There's top tier companies, there's second tier companies. So, there's this very hierarchical view, and as I started to also dig in more into the stuff in Amplitude, I was like, \"Wait, there's something right and wrong about this at the same time, there's something true but not true at the same time.\" So, that's something that I wanted to be able to explore in doing it. And then the context free advice was obviously I noticed more and more that people trying to put tools in play out of context sometimes had worse effects than them just not doing it at all to do that.\n\n(00:23:18):\nSo, anyway, I kind of thought about it as a product, like, \"Okay, what's my opportunity here? There's a lot of this great advice. It's very actionable. I don't know. In the US were pretty individualistic, so the advice probably lands with people really, really well, and then also it's really actionable,\" and said, \"Okay, well, what would be my particular angle?\" So, I thought about the angle, about wanted to explore three things. I think the first one is this idea we do work in these complex adaptive systems, and so I really went deep in that particular area.\n\n(00:23:47):\nSo, we work in environments. There's lots of things that are interdependent on each other. We don't work in closed systems. I mean, if you're in the Bay Area, you're in this broader system called the Bay Area that's in this broader system called California that's in this broader system called the United States. Your team is in a team of many, many teams in your company. The systems are non-linear. The bird flapping its wings in Brazil creates the tornado type of stuff. And so, I wanted to make sure that we got dug into that particular stuff in The Beautiful Mess stuff.\n\n(00:24:21):\nThe next thing is that I'm a sucker for weird counterintuitive dynamics in companies. I don't know what it is. I absolutely love that. And so, maybe I'll give two examples. One, I'm obsessed with this idea of high work in progress, from a human level and a team level. How even though we know that if you try to do less at once, you'll be more effective, teams routinely just load themself up with work? And so, in the newsletter, I wanted to explore stuff like that, like why, when a bunch of people know irrationally that you should not load yourself up with work, why do really, really smart, capable, intelligent, passionate people in their personal lives and on their teams just load themself up with work? What are they optimizing about? So, that'd be like one example of counterintuitive stuff.\n\n(00:25:09):\nThe other stuff is strategy stuff. Every company has these three pillars, and it seems really smart for the CEO to have this really clear three pillars, but then everyone walks away from the meeting and be like, \"I don't know what we're with doing.\" That's another example of a counterintuitive thing. So, that was the second thing, the counterintuitive stuff. I love the complex stuff. And then frankly, I think the other thing is I just wanted to help people who are weird like me do those things. So, I would say I'm really, really triggered. People will say, \"But it's probably triggered by Jason.\" He said, \"Why? Bring solutions not just problems.\" That's my krypton, right? I like the systems thinking stuff. I like all that. So, anyway, long story short, wanted to help people like me. I like the complexity stuff. I like all these weird counterintuitive dynamics. And then I thought that there's a lot of representation for the very deterministic advice that people have.\n\nLenny (00:26:02):\nThat's a really good explanation. There-\n\nJohn Cutler (00:26:00):\n... advice that people have.\n\nLenny (00:26:02):\nThat's a really good explanation. There's a piece of what does the market want and let me deliver it, and then there's a piece of how is my brain working?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:26:10):\nI love the fact that people scan the market and say, \"People want to know about prioritization and so I'm going to tell the world about prioritization.\" I really like that. In fact, I admire, I'm jealous of people who can produce that kind of content realistically. Interestingly enough, probably in my doodling in post I've probably given frameworks to do that. I just don't think too much about it. I just kind of go in these things. There's always this balance and one way that I think about is to get anything done, we need to reduce the world a little bit. That's the difference.\n\n(00:26:41):\nBack to this thing of complex problems, I think it's the difference between oversimplification and focusing. You can have a really complex problem and you can oversimplify it and that's not great, but you can have a complex problem and be like, \"You know what? I need to hold some things constant.\" Not going to make any progress unless we hold some things constant to do that. That's, to me, the balance I'm playing all the time between how many variables to hold constant to make sure that people can get some value out of it. I don't know about you, but that's the tension I have. But you write really actionable stuff and so I really admire that too. I'm jealous.\n\nLenny (00:27:15):\nI try, but then I'm jealous of always having to nail it down to something very concrete and simple. This last post actually was a little bit of an balancing act where I wrote about how virality is mostly a myth, and I added the word mostly to it at the end. Then I was like, \"Should I just go for it and be like virality is fully a myth?\" But no, it's not actually, so I can't really go that far.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:27:35):\nSee, it's kind of messy.\n\nLenny (00:27:36):\nIt's kind of messy.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:27:38):\nI love that. In the spectrum of advice, every post of mine will say mostly, maybe, it depends, so we all have some opportunity to flex into the other direction.\n\nLenny (00:27:49):\nShifting a little bit, coming back to just the bigger picture of John Cutler, you've had more exposure I think to product teams and product managers, you're definitely in the top 1% of people that have talked to and met with and seen what happens within product teams. There's a lot of stuff I want to dig into there and the first is around what you've found differentiates the highest performing teams. Let me just ask you this very succinct question and see where it goes. If you had to just boil it down, what have you seen most differentiates the highest performing product teams?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:28:26):\nFirst of all, they're top 1%, they're super, super productive, they can levitate, they can do ... they have no emotion. No, I'm just kidding. No. Okay, this is my tack for answering the question. First of all, I have this friend Josh Arnold and he had this great principle that held true in my experience talking with teams and he calls it the reverse Anna Karenina principle. In Anna Karenina, Tolstoy is basically the like, \"The dysfunctional families are all different and the happy families are the same,\" and what he said is it's the reverse of that with product teams, that actually the dysfunctional companies are all the same and then the happy companies or the higher performing companies can be very, very different.\n\n(00:29:07):\nThat's something that stuck with me because either you have easy to identify anti patterns, and I'm going to admit earlier in my career, maybe five or six years ago, my content was about identifying things that people would be like, \"How did you know that was working in my company?\" and I would just be like, \"Well, I just know.\" Even Spencer and I had this thing. I put something on Twitter and Spencer writes me, he's like, \"John, is this about amplitude?\" and I'm like, \"No man. It's like that Carly Simon song, Spencer. You probably think this song is about you, but it's not.\" It just is. It's just like those things. Either you have the very easy to identify anti patterns or you have the high level principles, like you must trust each other or you must do something like that.\n\n(00:29:50):\nBut the way that companies achieve those particular high performing things can be vastly, vastly, vastly different. Let's just start with that as a basic thing, which is one reason why it makes me hard to answer the question. A great example here is great product leadership. We need great product leaders. But you meet [inaudible 00:30:11] product leaders and you see that some people are these humble, curious servant product leaders. They're not really talking a lot and they're just growing the system that way. You know what? There's other companies with really successful people that are just badass, strong, dominant, they like to spar. I need people who can spar with me. That's just one potential example there of okay, you meet enough teams and you see that there's many ways to achieve great leadership [inaudible 00:30:41] example.\n\n(00:30:42):\nAnother example would be, and then I'm going to start listing these things off and then hopefully this makes more sense.\n\nLenny (00:30:46):\nYeah, it feels great.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:30:48):\nYou meet lots of great teams and the better teams make high, better decisions faster. Now, that's like that high level thing that I say that to you and you're probably like, \"Well, no shit. That's what I would assume to do that.\" But if you think about good decisions and stuff, like what do you need for good decisions? You need information, pays to have diverse perspectives, you need to be able to analyze the data. You probably need chops, some kind of chops in the domain to be able to do it. You usually need a goal in mind, like what are you optimizing for? It's very hard to make a decision just to make a decision to be able to do that.\n\n(00:31:21):\nThose are the basics, but still none of that's all that interesting, right? You're like, \"Oh, you're saying you need information to make decisions and it's kind of not very satisfying to do that.\" But then if you think about three companies. We could even play the game together. I'll give you two, you could give me the third one. But let's say company A buys into the whole idea of an extremely rigorous decision-making process. It's very process driven. It's like you do this, you do that, we red team our decisions, we bring in people to push back, we've got this particular thing. Maybe that's how they achieve it. Company B, maybe they're just all about this kind of mushy, diverse perspectives thing. They're not very process driven, but they achieve really good decisions by making sure that there's these serendipitous connections between people at the right time with the right set of [inaudible 00:32:08].\n\n(00:32:08):\nThere are highly successful companies that achieve both of those particular things. I don't know, what am I missing? Lenny, you think about it. There's the rigorous process driven approach, then there's the company that's all about the ad hoc work together collaborative approach. What's another way that some companies make really good decisions all the time?\n\nLenny (00:32:28):\nWhat comes to mind is a very top down CEO driven, here's what we're doing, here's the roadmap.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:32:32):\nAbsolutely. So this is the thing, I'm sitting there and the very idealistic product managers are like, \"You got to have empowered teams and you got to push decision-making down to the bottom,\" and I'm like, \"Huh, well that company's doing pretty well and the CEO just tells everyone what to do and in fact, they attracted people who just don't mind that and like their vision and they do it.\" You find people who really like the process driven approach and you find people who do those things. That's one principle done a different way. But then I'll just take a couple principles. I just wanted to get that out of the way, that every one of these I mentioned could be achieved in a couple different ways.\n\n(00:33:10):\nThe first thing you notice is the companies that are very high performing have coherence between the structure of their company and their current strategy. This is a structural thing, I think when there's startups, things are very fluid and the strategy's in flux, and so they have a fluid structure, but then as companies grow, there's sort of a physics to the problem that starts to catch up to the particular things. Their funding approach, their incentives, the org structure, the architecture, even their technical architecture supports their strategy back and forth. The reason why I mentioned this one is you can have brilliant teams. You meet these brilliant teams where they've just hired in the best of the best and they're just struggling with a strategy structure mismatch and no amount of let's empower people or no amount of doing whatever is going to knock them out of that.\n\n(00:34:01):\nSo what do you need? You need a strategy, then you need to line the structure around it. This is different than saying ... you're asking me what do I observe when they're doing really well? Now, the tactics to achieve this might be different depending on the company, but you could get that. I think the second thing, if I admit it, is the strong opinions loosely held, which is there is this balance of believing in certain things, believing maybe in the power of products or the power of connecting with customers or maybe key strategic things that they need to do, or even believing that this is a done deal and you just need to move faster than everyone else in the space, or even the belief that you need to just go straight to commodity pricing like Amazon with whatever you're doing.\n\n(00:34:41):\nThere is just a stubborn, strongly held belief that is then balanced with their ability to have the loosely held thing. I would just observed this in meeting after meeting with these teams that seem to be having a bout of being more high performing. They would be stubborn about some things that they were doing even when it didn't make sense in the short term and then they would do that. I think that that's another thing. I think related to that when it comes to the product world is just a core belief in the power of products. The Jeff Bezos thing, that the success of today was set in motion three years ago, that product is a layer cake and that you are layering on decisions, the success you're having now is a layer cake of decisions from the last bunch of years that you're doing it.\n\n(00:35:26):\nYou could rationalize that all you want, but at the end of the day, it's often because either the founders or other people involved have seen how that can work because there is a leap of faith and there's a leap of faith that no amount of data or no amount of AB testing or no amount of rationalizing or no amount of spreadsheet math to figure out the ROI of what you're doing will ever help you. It's just not. I just noticed that pattern over and over that there was just a slightly irrational belief in the power of what it would take to have a nine craft level product versus a seven craft level product or six craft level product. I think that that's another component. I have a couple more in depth like that.\n\n(00:36:10):\nDefinitely the leadership is coherent, so that's walking the walk, talking the talk and I think this is one of the most fascinating ones because it's very much about being who you are and not being embarrassed about that thing. There are companies probably all know that outspoken, domineering believe that the company just should be run a certain way and they set this vibe, this coherent ... that their actions and words match together. When you think about it that way, it makes more sense. The company that's like, \"Oh, well we want to empower our teams and do whatever and we believe in our customers,\" and their actions don't match those particular things, that's not very, very coherent to do these particular things. I think that that's one, the coherent things.\n\n(00:37:06):\nOkay, so you've got those high level ones. I think you can definitely add skills and experience. I mean, those definitely matter. I think one thing that happens a lot is how the company views its skills. Here's a challenge we had in Amplitude, just sharing this, is you could view Amplitude as just another B2B SaaS company or maybe just an analytics company. But one of the challenges we had when it was how to build our team is to think about where do you draw the line between someone who's just done B2B SaaS for the last 10 years, is a pro at what they're doing and then how someone could embrace this kind of weird problem, sort of bottom-up motion, top-down motion. It's in product, it's a messy space. You need to be more strategic to do that so the skills need to be mediated obviously between the environment to do those things.\n\n(00:37:51):\nThen like all the other, they know how to build software, things don't break, they can experiment without risks. I don't know. They have positive habits. I could go on and on. Hopefully this is helpful just hearing my thought process to go through these things. But I think that the TLDR of this whole thing is those top ones I mentioned seem like common sense and it's like how do you put it in motion in your company? I was just reading that working backwards book about Amazon and they're in this chapter about basically their bar raisers thing and I share it with my partner who's the head of HR at a company. She's like, \"Yeah, this is sort of common sense hiring. They're just talking about de-biasing the hiring and having standards and having those linked into the jobs and just not rushing it.\"\n\n(00:38:41):\nIt's like these things that seem so common sense are actually hard with what they're doing. I don't know if you've noticed that, but it's like a lot of the advice is common sense. That doesn't mean it's easy to put in motion.\n\nLenny (00:38:53):\nYeah, and there's also a lot of power to just making it a very important value to the company. Just calling it bar raisers-\n\nJohn Cutler (00:39:02):\n[inaudible 00:39:02]. I'll use the example of a company. I mentioned this company AppFolio here in Santa Barbara, but Klaus and Jon who founded that company, it's just a gem of a company, it's an amazing vertical B2B SaaS company. But I think in the story that they tell us when they started AppFolio, they're like, \"We want to find a place where the money flows and we want to be really close to customers and we just want to ...\" Well, they were engineers who had seen the light around customer development, just getting close to customers, just being in service to the customers, not just gold plating every technical decision you did. They bought in early to the ideas of test-driven development, pair programming because they believe that the quality ... you should never be worried about the quality. They just believe that quality wasn't something you sacrifice as the norm. It's just got to work.\n\n(00:39:51):\nThey believed that was possible and when you think about it, those things are always debated. Like, \"Oh, should we get technical debt or not? Or how much customer contact is it not?\" These two founders basically are like, \"That's it. We don't sacrifice on those things.\" They've done really well with that.\n\nLenny (00:40:08):\nThat's a thread I want to actually follow up on, is just the power of culture and values and things like that. But before we do that, let me just summarize maybe the top five attributes and kind of traits you just shared and then I have a two part question around this. I wrote these down. Basically the things you've found are true for the companies that seem to be best at building product and software and running product teams. One is coherence between what they're doing and what their strategy is. Two is strong opinions loosely held. Three is belief in the power of product. Four is the leadership is coherent, that their advice matches their words and their actions. Then five is just the necessary skills and experience in building stuff they're building.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:40:51):\nContextual skills too. Yeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:40:54):\nKind of a two part question. One is if there's a pie chart of what contributes to this working out, what percentage would you say is just the people that they hire that contributes to them succeeding here? Then related question is just like can you change a team to be high performing? Does that happen or is it often just like this is just the way they are and their culture and their founders are this way and it's really hard?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:41:18):\nThe pie chart, that's the problem. I mean, that is the trillion dollar question so I don't really have an answer. I have a couple thoughts on it. What do we know? We know that you can have a bunch of geniuses in the room and if there's not coherent leadership and there's not coherent structure in what you're doing, they'll fail. Okay, so we know there's a limit on one side of this particular problem and we know on the other side of the problem is if no one's done this before, who knows? Because how many startups were started by people who hadn't done it before, who had passion for doing something? Now, they made a lot of mistakes. Now, granted people would say, \"All right, now after three failures, I'm going to tell you what we need to do to succeed,\" so maybe they have to fail a couple times to do that.\n\n(00:42:03):\nWith the right things in motion, you can do that. Also, another data point. At a lot of companies that are known to be higher performing, they're one of two categories. Either everyone in the company is this extremely vetted genius at what they're doing, or they have a culture where people stay for three, four, five, six years, they build their career or seven, eight, nine years. There is a concentration of people who are very skilled, but they have a knack for bringing people up. They have a knack for taking someone who has some of the raw materials to be able to do it and making them really good at their job to be able to do it. I'm not going to throw out a percentage point into it. I'm just going to note that I think that the biggest challenge is that we all need to challenge our biases.\n\n(00:42:46):\nI do too. Four or five years ago, I would've said, well, personal skill's nothing. It's all the environment. There's people on Twitter who do this all the time. They're like, \"Bad management kills everything. Skills aren't important. You should just be able to do anything with anyone.\" I used to be one of those particular people and I also have this sort of humanist bent to what I'm doing, and so I very much want to believe ... I'm always the person that's like, \"Oh, we should give them the seventh chance.\" I know myself right to do that and I would suggest that there's people on the other end of the spectrum who could benefit from shifting a little bit to embrace some other ideas too. They're the people who are like, \"Well, it's 100% their skill. We will hire complete A plus players all a particular time. Everything will work out as expected.\" Or they trace everything back to leadership anyway. So when anything's wrong, they're like, \"Well, this happened under this person's watch, therefore they are a failure.\"\n\n(00:43:37):\nBut how many companies in general will hire a string of highly qualified people into a particular department and then fail each particular time? I don't know. I don't have the answer for you on that one, but I think that everyone can benefit from challenging maybe their happy place, me included [inaudible 00:43:57].\n\nLenny (00:43:57):\nI like that. It's like it's an optimistic perspective basically and anyone can change, anyone can improve. Don't assume that it's just not possible.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:44:05):\nAnd give it a shot and then can you create a coherent environment where maybe that could happen. Frankly, we're maybe getting into this later, there's a lot of companies that were flying high and are not flying high anymore. High performance is not this state you achieve. It's actually a continuum that you're always ... we have this in our personal lives too. We're flying high and we think we do everything and then we get to that point and then we go back down into feeling we don't know anything again and we feel those lows. That's kind of how I think about that particular thing.\n\nLenny (00:44:37):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements. Also, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table. But getting SOC 2 to your report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious and expensive.\n\n(00:45:24):\nEnter Vanta. Over 3000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes. For a limited time, Lenny's podcast listeners, get $1,000 off Vanta.

Or you're saying it's sometimes the right amazing people? Sometimes it's the process, sometimes it's the market, [inaudible 00:46:12]\n\nJohn Cutler (00:46:12):\nIt's the latter and I think that's why I called the damn thing the beautiful mess. Because I think we all have confirmation bias. We'll point to that company and say ... I mean, let me just use an example. Satya Nadella and Microsoft. You could argue you obviously have someone who's this very humble, very capable leader in that particular thing. But I imagine that at some point in the future there'll be books written about that and they'll say like, \"Hey, it was kind of that. But you know what he did? He got rid of some bad people and created the air cover and set in motion the couple of strategic imperatives that we're going to let the things going.\" Now imagine Microsoft didn't have all the wealth of talent that it had, or all the wealth of structures or the good parts of the tradition, or let's say the bad parts served them well for a long time, but maybe they started to become a little bit outdated and then they were putting them in a competitively bad situation.\n\n(00:47:07):\nEven that situation, you can idolize that particular leader for doing it, but there's many things that could happen to be able to do that. There's this idea of great man theory, and this is something I talk about a lot where in great man theory success is the result of these highly influential, highly effective men, in a lot of cases, and that you can explain history through these heroic men. That's sort of a thing. A lot of people base history on doing that. I think that this, again, just the other perspective here is that things are a lot messier and you can't just trace everything to these sort of single heroes men in many cases that make it happen. I'm just presenting both sides of it as we kind of dig into it. I think, though, let's say you're a founder and you're trying to decide, \"Should I invest more on processes or should I invest more in people?\"\n\n(00:47:57):\nThe first thing is introspection. What do you believe in really? Not just what do I believe in that you think the whole rest of the world ... I think the rules of the world are that blank happens. It's like what do you believe in and what do the people around you believe in and how can you be a coherent leader? You know what? You can nudge yourself a little bit away from your happy place, but you're not going to go super far. You're not going to go from a process-driven, meritocratic, X, Y, Z person all the way to I'm going to start a collectivist company where everything is sort of the consensus decision to do that. You're not going to do that. But I think it starts with self-awareness and then that's how people form their authentic leadership vibe and then they flex a little bit and then they embrace other perspectives. That's just my perspective on it.\n\nLenny (00:48:49):\nThat really resonates. It makes me think about companies, especially in the past couple years, that did really well because the market was pulling them and everything was just killing it. They're just growing crazy and you would assume it's the founder, the CEO, that's the result of that. But then when the market tanks, things stop working, and that's a really good, I think, example of just, it's not necessarily the person. Could just be other factors that make it feel like everything's going great.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:49:16):\nAnd people are great. There are people that have an outsized effect in particular companies. A great example there is people forget that, for example, leaders or CEOs also have a lot of formal structural power at their disposal to be able to change things. So well, there's that great man leaders, genius. They do have more knobs to move, and even then they're not the boss. You know what? There's a board, there's investors. If you talk to any CEO, they'll be like, \"You think [inaudible 00:49:47]. I've got people bossing me around too.\" It's always a mix. That's the way I see it.\n\nLenny (00:49:54):\nWhich is why if things don't go well, their ass is on the line.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:49:58):\nYeah, exactly.\n\nLenny (00:49:59):\nComing back to a thought I had as you were talking earlier about values and culture, it's interesting that wasn't on your list of just the power and importance of, I don't know, strong value, strong culture. Have you found that that's just not essential? What are your thoughts on-\n\nJohn Cutler (00:50:13):\nNo, I think it's kind of the fabric that creates those other things. It's the fabric that creates coherence. Coherent around what? If culture is what we're doing, is what we're acting and the way we act is sort of a function of some of the belief systems and the culture and the value systems that we have, maybe I just almost take it for granted that that's sitting underneath those particular things. But here's an example where sometimes nuances matter. I'll just use Amplitude. We had some values and we had HOG, humility, and it's this idea of ownership and a growth mindset to do these things.\n\n(00:50:52):\nOwnership defined in an individualistic culture is going to look very, very different than ownership defined in a collectivist culture. What I find with companies is that ... and certainly we struggled to communicate this too, and I think we were pretty good at communicating where we sat on this particular thing, but a lot of times people write up these cultural documents and they're just like, \"Well, this is our culture. We're into ownership.\" It's not saying much, saying that you believe in ownership without the addition of ... what we would do successfully and Spencer and other people do successfully is talk about the behaviors that represented that level of ownership, then that tells you something about what the culture is. Maybe when I was answering that, I kind of took that for granted. But there's a set of beliefs and values that sit underneath all those things, I bet.\n\nLenny (00:51:38):\nWhen you think of the companies you work with over the years, and you don't have to answer this if you don't want, but when you think of the companies with the best culture or the best way, or some of the best companies in terms of how they build product, who comes to mind?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:51:52):\nI will mention some companies, but I'm not going to mention what people think in doing this. I'm just going to mention moments where I was like, \"This thing is really clicking,\" and not because it wasn't easy-\n\nJohn Cutler (00:52:00):\nI was like, this thing is really clicking.\n\nLenny (00:52:01):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:52:02):\nAnd not because it wasn't easy, or there is a leader at Lego and her name is Angela. And when I'm talking to her, I'm just like, this person just has it dialed in. This is really hard. This business is transforming. They've got one of the biggest, most iconic brands in the whole world at their hands. And I'm sitting and I'm just going to single out her. Yeah, there's this situation here. It's not easy, it's not great. It's not high performing by any, you take a tiny Silicon Valley company. Yeah, it's hard to be Lego with thousands of people trying to build this and trying to take an iconic brand and turn it into something having to do with digital stuff. But I just want to give a shout out to her.\n\n(00:52:47):\nThat's what I got to say to this question. I think of it more of these moments where I'm like, \"Wow, this shits hard. It's not ideal.\" And that people are coming to work every day and there's a group of people in this room who are extremely well-meaning. And you know what? The impact of their work might not even be seen in their tenure at that company.\n\n(00:53:06):\nSome of these larger companies might take a decade to really work themselves through. And so I don't know, when you asked that question, I thought more about individual moments where I spent time with teams or like that team I mentioned to you in India where it's like everyone's super humble and whatever. So...\n\nLenny (00:53:21):\nAwesome.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:53:22):\nYeah, I'm not going to give a lot of names.\n\nLenny (00:53:22):\nNo, it's great.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:53:23):\nBut just shout out Angela. She's doing an awesome job.\n\nLenny (00:53:25):\nGo Angela. That reminds me of something I wanted to ask around the cultural differences between product teams in different countries. You talked about India, you talked about Lego. What have you found to be the main differences in how product teams operate and companies operate across different countries like say California versus Paris versus Australia?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:53:46):\nYeah. And again, I'm not an expert in this and I think Erin Meyer wrote that or Meyer, I'm not sure how to pronounce her name, wrote that book, The Culture Map. And so you should just find what those people wrote because they're much smarter than I am about this. But here's the individual things that I noticed is definitely the individualist and what I would call almost like communitarian vibe.\n\n(00:54:05):\nThe idea of individualism versus the idea of the team being sort of a community of people together. So that's one, and you pick up about that a lot when you go to different places. I mean, in the United States you'll find this situation where you've got this one engineering manager and they are brokering the projects with every single engineer on their team and everyone wants the promotion.\n\n(00:54:27):\nAnd there's this whole, instead of the PM working with the team, it's like the PM brokering stuff with an engineering manager to give everyone their premier project. No one's really working together. There's no pair programming. There's nothing like that. That's a whole other debate, but. And so that's highly individualistic and it might work in that particular environment.\n\n(00:54:47):\nIn fact, it might be optimized for environments where you're burning through people every 18 months or 24 months or... Because you just want to put another cog into the particular machine so that you can grow and so you can do stuff. And that's an extreme example, but then you compare that to other parts of the world, it's much more consensus driven. The team perceives itself as a team having a team goal.\n\n(00:55:08):\nThey have a team objective. And certainly even in the Bay Area, there's companies that are more the collectivist vibe and the more. So to say that it's just about the world is not really just right. So I think that yeah, the collectivist individualistic thing is important. I do think that certain cultures are much more sort of hierarchically oriented.\n\n(00:55:26):\nThere's much more deference to the hierarchy in the particular where people are sitting and the information flows in a certain way. And some companies tend to that being more bureaucratic. And then some countries tend to that being like, it's still a tall company, but it's very much like you manager, you own this, you do this. So it's not like rules are flowing from the top down. It's more just a pretty big org chart. So those are some of the things that come to mind, yeah, as we're going through it. So yeah.\n\nLenny (00:55:55):\nThis relates a lot to something else. You often talk about that much of the advice on the internet and books, newsletters like ours is geared towards Silicon Valley type tech startups.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:56:06):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:06):\nAnd in reality, most PMs don't work at companies like that. A lot of them are going through transformations.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:56:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:56:11):\nThey're trying to transform the way their culture works. And I imagine a lot of companies you work with are trying to get to that point and that just a lot of advice doesn't actually work for them. What have you found along those lines of just companies going through this and things you've learned there?\n\nJohn Cutler (00:56:24):\nSo putting myself in the shoes of those particular companies, like I said, I think some of my most rewarding interactions have been with these non Silicon Valley companies. I certainly learn a lot when I talk to companies in the Bay Area and in the United States to do those particular things.\n\n(00:56:41):\nI think that the first thing to keep in mind is that those, let's just take these bigger companies for a second, big enterprise companies. Part of the thing is just realizing how much inertia they're up against when you're chatting them. So I do believe that there's some structural things that probably they could avoid, but then there's also just structural things that are just part of the game to do that.\n\n(00:57:11):\nSo they'll be in situations where maybe none of the executives have shipped product before. They also assume that there's only one way to do things. Certainly in a lot of high performing companies, I have friends who will go and work at those companies. They're like, \"Oh no, no one changes the rules here. We just do it this way at Amazon or we just do it,\" whatever.\n\n(00:57:29):\nSo this similar thing happens in these particular companies, like there's only one way to do things. They've got these crazy annual budgeting cycles and planning cycles, or maybe there's a big IT industrial complex that they're sort of trying to transform into doing these things. So anyway, my point is, is that they, so many of these companies just have structural things that make it very difficult to just immediately convert that particular advice as they're doing that.\n\n(00:57:59):\nSo I think the first thing that comes to mind with that is how to adapt that advice maybe for some of those larger kind of transforming companies. And I think that the couple things that I sort of remark on is that one, reps matter in those particular situations. So in many of those companies, they should focus on creating these sort of areas or pods where a company can, a team can get in the reps that they're trying to be able to do.\n\n(00:58:29):\nSo it's sort of a little miniature version of that. And there's a whole problem with innovation labs. There's a whole problem with that kind of idea. But the idea that you can create these little bastions where a team can get in the reps is important.\n\nLenny (00:58:41):\nAnd reps meaning shipping, shipping product.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:58:43):\nShipping and learning, going through the full loop. Can they go through the full loop of what they're doing? And I think that the other thing that comes up with that is that most of those companies need to think of frameworks appropriately.\n\n(00:58:57):\nThey'll read about these particular frameworks or what particular companies do or don't do. And I think that for a lot of those companies, they see adopting the frameworks as the end goal. They kind of look there. And sometimes maybe even you write a post, it's like, \"Well, how does Figma work?\" And they're like, \"We use these frameworks.\"\n\nLenny (00:58:57):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (00:59:15):\nAnd so this company's like, \"Well, we've got to use these framework.\" And I think that the way that I tend to think about frameworks is that they're more like a job aid. They're more like a learning tool that the team kind of uses to keep themself on track. But part of the thing is that those companies will reinvent the things they're using when things aren't working out.\n\n(00:59:34):\nSo I think that that's another thing maybe some of those companies could benefit from doing, where we're getting kind of more into the kind of digital transformation or the big company space. But I think back to that particular question, I think you need to view a lot of advice coming from Silicon Valley just contextually. It's startup. There's a tradition of how these companies work. Many of them are just optimized very much for that first big arc of growth.\n\n(00:59:58):\nThey've never really been disrupted. The only disruption has come from scale, not from being a legacy, a huge global brand or huge global business, and then being disrupted by new things. The only problems, not the only because it's really hard, but the problems have been primarily scaling. So they're kind of optimized for wrapping their head around that.\n\n(01:00:20):\nAnd then many of them are just pure digital product companies. And so I think this is a thing that a lot of the big rideshare and food delivery conglomerates are figuring out. They're like, \" Oh, this is a lot harder than we thought.\" When you're dealing with moving people around and logistics and things, it's an order of magnitude more complex to do that.\n\n(01:00:42):\nSo I don't know if that helps kind of explain my perspective on that, but I think that it's like you have to adapt the advice and you also need to acknowledge that for some of these companies there are these sort of just structural areas of inertia that they're trying to work through and that a lot of them maybe need to adapt this advice on the small instead of thinking they're just going to install all the frameworks or install everything they're doing.\n\nLenny (01:01:02):\nYeah, this is really, really good advice. I imagine folks are listening that may be working at a company like that. It feels like there's two sides to it. One is there should just be an awareness of this may not work at us, we're not going to be Figma.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:01:02):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:01:15):\nAnd let's just get used to that. And then two, this good reflection for me that I'm probably causing some damage with people reading a post on here's how Figma builds product. And then not adding a little bit of, maybe this won't work at your company.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:01:29):\nBut maybe it can. And I talk about this a lot, this sort of I do believe there's sort of this fundamental attribution bias at play where people in these high performings don't acknowledge the amount that luck and inertia has been a part of what they're doing. And that the people in the big companies, or these not, these companies that believe that it's not the way that they can do that actually overestimate the kind of systemic drag in their organization and underestimate what can be possible.\n\n(01:01:57):\nAnd you think about that, we do that a lot in just our lives in general. We see someone being really successful and we'll say, \"Well, but my situation is this.\" And when things are working for us, we're like, \"I'm a genius. I'm a genius doing this particular thing.\" When things work, we're competent. When things don't, it's like the system and everyone else's incompetence to be able to do it.\n\n(01:02:18):\nSo I do think that there's opportunities. I think there's another thing too, that there's a vast spectrum of companies. We paint some of these large enterprises on one end of the spectrum and then these other company, these modern product companies. But I brought up that plumbing company in Australia. You meet these companies, you know what? Their revenue is literally 50 startups. They are not doing bad. They are not doing bad.\n\n(01:02:44):\nAnd you know what? They're actually doing interesting things. One of Amplitude's customers, Anheuser-Busch has this thing called BEES. And BEES is basically a liquor distribution app. And it's literally one of the biggest B2B companies in the world. And you know what? Anheuser-Busch, it's like what? We're going to distribute beer because the pandemic. And so we're going to have, and I think actually they started to become more even used for logistics.\n\n(01:03:06):\nYou're a bodega in one of those countries, you can order beer for doing it. So I think that we tend to kind of paint this world of, there's the big smoke companies and then there's the fast nimble companies, but there's everything in between. Another example is a lot of tech companies started 2000 to 2008, kind of are on their third or fourth act at the moment, second or third or fourth act, bought a lot of companies, they're trying to absorb them.\n\n(01:03:33):\nThey might be trying a product-led growth motion by spanning all the different acquisitions they had. You know what? They are on top of their game. This is not a slouch company, but it's really hard for them to do that. Or we at Amplitude, we'd have a lot of, not old FinTech, but not newest companies. They're printing money and they're just embracing this particular thing. And then compare that to, I did a big Northstar session or more of a coaching session at NewBank in Brazil when there was just 15 people in a room and now they're massive.\n\n(01:04:06):\nSo I think that we tend to paint things as a form of modern product adoption. There's the high performing companies and the low performing companies when in fact there's just a whole plethora and diversity of different companies riding different waves, adopting different things at different times. And many of them doing really wholesome, humble, good work, just dealing with their circumstances at the particular time.\n\n(01:04:33):\nSo I think everyone should absolutely know how Figma works, for example. And then we need to try to boost the stories of Angela and her team or some of these companies that you'd never even expect. There's a company here in Santa Barbara that's like, they do refrigeration, use AI to refrigerate industrial facilities. And Carrie, who's the leader there, that company is one of the best leaders I know.\n\n(01:04:57):\nAnd Jesse, who's one of the founders is Harvard PhD student who understands AI doing these things. And I actually would encourage a lot of PMs to think about, look, especially in this economy, what are these unsexy businesses that are kicking butt and small here, it's in sunny Santa Barbara? So I don't know. I think that there's a lot more diversity than just the high performing, low performing spectrum. There's just a whole universe of fun companies out there.\n\nLenny (01:05:26):\nWell, as you were talking, I was thinking about there's a small group of people like you and Marty Kagan and a few other folks that have worked with tons of different and diverse product teams and not just say, Silicon Valley teams. And I'm curious if there's any other names of folks you think listeners should follow if they work at maybe a non-Silicon Valley type team. Marty Kagan is who comes to mind first, but I don't know if you have anyone else. And if not, that's all good.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:05:52):\nWell, yeah, there's a couple people, but I feel like I should go back and just generate this full list for people. Maybe it would be interesting. Maybe I'll take that as an action item to...\n\nLenny (01:06:00):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:06:01):\nList a couple of these.\n\nLenny (01:06:01):\nWe'll put it in the show notes.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:06:02):\nAnd I'll give you an example of one guy, and his name is John Smart, and he wrote this book called Better, Sooner, Safer, Happier. And he, I think he was at Barclays Bank. I think that's how you say it in England. And what, he led this transformation. And then I think he's gone on to, he has a consultancy now for doing things. And the guy is just awesome to talk to.\n\n(01:06:27):\nHe's really, really humble about what the thing book, the book is really interesting. And the thing that I noticed when talking to John is the order of magnitude of complexity of problems that has unraveled and what he had to put in motion to take an old school bank and at least try to get some part of some kind of transformation working in that particular company, I think there's a whole realm of people like that. And I'm going to list a, maybe I'll follow up with a couple more lists of people.\n\nLenny (01:06:57):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:06:58):\nWho can do that. And then I do think there's the people like Teresa Torres and others that have come up with a technique that is universal. You can teach an element of product thinking with her techniques or this opportunity solution tree or this continuous discovery thing that everyone can find accessible no matter where your company is at. And I have a lot of respect for those types of techniques because they're more universal versus some very arcane niche activity.\n\nLenny (01:07:36):\nAwesome. Cool. And then we'll do our best to include whatever full list you come up with in the show notes.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:07:41):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:42):\nSo I've been asking a lot of very specific questions. I want to give us a chance to kind of zoom out a little bit.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:07:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:07:47):\nAnd see what other advice you may have for product managers and the product community broadly. It feels like you're in this kind of reflective phase after working with all these companies and you take time, you have more time to think. So I'm curious what comes to mind when you think of just, here's advice I have to share.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:04):\nYeah. I think kind of going back to the reps thing, I think that there's this fire hose of amazing information that's out there and I contributed to it and you contribute to it. And there's just, I mean, think what a time to be alive. You can literally just.\n\nLenny (01:08:04):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:19):\nGet these podcasts going. You can listen to anything you want.\n\nLenny (01:08:22):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:23):\nThat's pretty amazing. And I was thinking to myself the joke as I saw you put this thing about Andrew Huberman about who gives these sort of life hacks thing. It's like there is absolutely a place for this type of content. I just want someone to summarize what the hell I should do when I wake up in the morning.\n\nLenny (01:08:38):\nRight. Cold plunge.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:39):\nCan I be healthier.\n\nLenny (01:08:40):\nSunlight. Yeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:41):\nYeah. I got my sunlight. I went from my sunlight before screens to prepare for our talk today.\n\nLenny (01:08:47):\nWait, actually?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:47):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:08:48):\nThat's great.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:08:49):\nI have it in my habit tracker, sunlight before screens every day. Yeah, I got my watch that I got a couple, I'm on vacation. I'm between jobs now. So it's about all health.\n\nLenny (01:08:59):\nYeah. Optimizing.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:09:02):\nBut I think that you need to keep in mind that this is a skill and skill is knowledge times practice mediated by your environment, the habits you form and the motivation that you have and the particular things. And so I think that I learned about that a lot working with learning experience designers in Amplitude that we tend to think that this is just a function of the knowledge that we pick up and the number of podcasts that we listen to. But really it's about going through this loop. So in Amplitude, we have this data informed product loop that we would teach, and it's basically, you need a strategy, you need to develop qualitative models, you need to add measurement to those models. So Northstar framework would be an example of a qualitative model. You need to add measurement to those models, figure out how you're doing it.\n\n(01:09:48):\nYou need to prioritize where to focus. You need to design bets, you need to measure the impact of those bets. And then you need to circulate what you learned back into the strategy, back into your models, back into how you prioritize, et cetera. And it helps you figure out where you're kind of weak at the moment.\n\n(01:10:02):\nSo for example, you need a strategy. Without that, nothing is possible. But you could have an amazing strategy and you don't deploy it with the right models, no one can prioritize them. We could do all that right, but you don't design any bets and can't ship anything. Oh, that's kind of a problem. But you could do all that right and you don't know the impact of anything you ship.\n\n(01:10:18):\nBut you could even do all that right and not circulate the learning back in your company and then you're still not going to succeed in these things. So that's an example of when I mean by the loop. And so one thing you could think about for your career that I think people should focus on, and also in terms of sharing the content that they share.\n\n(01:10:33):\nSo we're sharing a lot of content around knowledge and job aids, knowledge and job aids, and maybe a little bit of motivation, like how did that person succeed and do that and... But if you think about your career, just think about how many times can you get around that loop and what are you putting, because I worry that people are loaded up with knowledge and feel almost... I meet some of these leaders and they feel beaten up by the advice industry.\n\n(01:11:03):\nThey feel beaten up that they can never be good enough. They cannot be like whatever company, or they feel like their company's never good enough, like they can't empower their team, they just can't follow anyone's advice. And so I think people are beating themselves up when I think that you shift for some people to focus to taking that knowledge and just getting that loop going for your teams or getting that loop going for your career or getting that loop going for your company is probably a pretty safe bet. So I would think that that's one thing that comes to mind.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nPartly being responsible for some of that is what I...\n\nJohn Cutler (01:11:34):\nYeah, me too.\n\nLenny (01:11:35):\nMy advice to people is don't feel like you need to read everything coming across your plate.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:11:40):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:11:40):\nIt's instead wait for the moment when you need that thing. I'm working on SEO right now. Cool.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:11:40):\nPerfect.\n\nLenny (01:11:45):\nI saved that thing about SEO, I'm going to go do it. Just like a just in time learning because you learn it so much better and like, \"Oh, shit. I have to load all the stuff in my head in case it becomes useful.\"\n\nJohn Cutler (01:11:53):\nAbsolutely. And I think one thing you think of is think about the podcast you listen to and think about that content is almost like you don't know what you don't know often. So I think that the challenge is, is that if you've been doing PM for a while, product management for a while, you don't really, I don't fit everything in my head.\n\n(01:12:13):\nI just, for example, pricing. I know pricing is a thing. I know that there's some people are amazing at pricing. I know that if someone told me like, \"Well, you should just price it like this,\" my spidey sense would say, \"You don't know what you're talking about because I know that there's more to it than just what you just said.\" You develop your spidey sense for things and you know that there's people. You have to dip your toes in understanding. That's the beauty of podcasts, your mind can get blown and then it puts in the back of your brain. You're like, there are some people who know a lot about that versus the founder who believes that they're going to figure everything out for themselves and is just like, no, it's actually a thing.\n\n(01:12:47):\nPricing is a thing or you know what? Meeting design is a thing. There's people who obsess about it or service design is a thing or interaction design or strategy [inaudible 01:12:56]. So that's building on what you said, I think that there is a, especially if you're starting out, there is a definite value of almost seeing the 501 level courses or hearing that genius lecturer.\n\n(01:13:07):\nWhen you're in college as a freshman, I remember, I dropped out, but you would see the genius professor and you wouldn't understand any of it, but you'd know it's a thing and then it helped you guide the way you're doing. So I think that you should kind of balance out those things. But to your point, at the end of the day, you got to just put this stuff in motion somehow.\n\nLenny (01:13:25):\nYeah.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:13:26):\nHow to do it.\n\nLenny (01:13:26):\nAnd then just know that it's there when you need it. Find some way to store it.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:13:30):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:13:30):\nSave it. Maybe even just assume Google will find it for you.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:13:33):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:13:33):\nOne more question along that same thread is you talked about the importance of going through these loops. At some companies, you just can't really, the company moves slowly, it's super waterfall, they plan really long. Do you have any advice for someone that's like, \"Oh, I want to go through loops more often? This is really good advice.\"\n\nJohn Cutler (01:13:47):\nPoint number one is you often underestimate what loops are available to you in that company. They throw up their hands. I've tried to mentor people like this and I think we've done a decent job, but the first thing I'm like, \"Just don't throw up your hands and say it's all going to shit.\" Just at least document what was the.\n\n(01:14:03):\nSo even if someone from on high says, \"Build X,\" you can at least say, \"You know what? Selected option is X. What would the one-pager look like if X was one of five options?\" Write the one-pager. Go and talk to that executive and say, \"Look, I know you've told me to do this, but what would we observe if this was working versus not working? I'm here to help you with that.\"\n\n(01:14:27):\nGreat. You've got some metrics along [inaudible 01:14:29] is what you're doing. Just nudge it. Just one little thing. Hey, nothing's stopping you from writing down all the potential assumptions and risks that you have. Even if someone's like, \"Forget all that, you're just going to build the thing.\" You've gone through the motions for doing it.\n\n(01:14:44):\nAnd I think people underestimate that because the environments are kind of feel like stellifying, I guess is one word, or stilted. And so they just sort of throw up their hands. But I would say that work with what you've got, because the last thing you want is to have a job opportunity two or three years from then and all you can do is shrug your shoulders and say, \"I worked at a fucked up. I worked at a messed up company.\"\n\nLenny (01:15:09):\nYou can curse. It's all good.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:15:10):\nYeah. Well, yeah. So you, \"I worked at a messed up company. It was all shit.\" You're not really honoring yourself for doing that. So I'd say that that's my point about the fundamental attribution bias. Is it hard? Yes. Is it easier in those Silicon Valley companies? Well, maybe not. Maybe those are a shit show too. I've talked to plenty of them that are shit shows.\n\n(01:15:28):\nBut do you have an opportunity to kind of nudge things forward in your space? Probably. And bring to the systems thing, is it true that some people don't have the privilege of leaving their company for whatever reason? That is true also. So many things can be true, but that doesn't mean that you can't try, I think to kind of almost write your portfolio as you go. Because if you wait two years, you're going to think it was just all a blur and messed up. Whereas the opportunities might be there in your day-to-day as you're working through.\n\nLenny (01:15:55):\nI love how much your advice is optimistic and empowering and not just, \"That's the way it is.\" And...\n\nJohn Cutler (01:16:00):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:16:02):\nAnd your point about how top tier companies can also be messed up and everything could be going to shit is very true. Especially a hyper-growth company where you're just...\n\nJohn Cutler (01:16:11):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:16:11):\nConstantly changing. It's also very chaotic and things are just breaking all the time.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:16:16):\nAnd there's people too who just assume it just has to be that way. I would say that one model that I use is the sort of the chronic and acute challenges of the companies. And especially in the last year, you meet a bunch of companies dealing with the same economic conditions. And I will tell you, no, not all companies are equally dysfunctional.\n\n(01:16:34):\nAnd no, not all high performing companies are equally beautiful in all roses. Legitimately some companies work down the chronic issues, which allows them to face the acute stressors, and other companies are just mired in acute issues to do those things. So it's kind of, again, both things can be true. It's like, yeah, there's nothing perfect in product. However, it is true that some companies are healthier than others.\n\n(01:16:58):\nAn example of that is the companies that leaned in to responding to the pandemic instead of counting the days until it was over. Massive difference. I've seen this over and over, probably with 15 to 20 companies. The companies that were intentional in designing their response to the pandemic versus being like, \"Just let managers deal with it, whatever, we're just going to sort it out,\" have had an order of magnitude better.\n\n(01:17:22):\nNow maybe the share price hasn't necessarily reflected it, but the happiness of the people there, they're going to come out of this stronger than the companies that were just like, \"It's going to go back to normal and we're going to delay all these org design decisions until some future date.\" So I don't know if that tells you about high performing, but it's like the high performing companies saw the threat of what existed and then took deliberate steps, coherent steps to frame what their response would be. So that's just an example of that.\n\nLenny (01:17:54):\nAwesome. I took us off track a little bit. I think you were going to go onto a second piece of advice.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:18:00):\nYeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one, definitely slightly annoy.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:18:00):\nYeah, I think that there's, well, okay, so one definitely slightly annoying to me recently... I'll just get into the stuff that annoys me is that-\n\nLenny (01:18:06):\nLet's do it.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:18:07):\nI personally don't think, I used to use words a lot, like product sense and product mindset and product things like that. I'm personally trying to do a better job this year about trying to unpack those things as legitimate skills and competencies. So if you think about product sense, what is it? Might be the ability to model problems, systems thinking, decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, facilitation tools that you have the ability to look at a competitive ecosystem and maybe see a thing and yeah, maybe there's a little bit of sense to it. It's like, \"I want to help customers,\" or whatever. But I think that I'm trying to make a concerted effort to unpack those things into things that could be taught.\n\n(01:18:50):\nAnd that's going to certainly be part of my role at toast. The last thing I want to do is be like you have a product mindset or you don't. A great example, I was even talking with Craig just the other day and we were talking about how in some environments there's this should/can divide, which I really like, which is some people are just locked into the can. They're uber pragmatic people, so it's like, \"Can we do this? Is it possible, given the debt, whatever constraints that you have?\" And then there's people who for some reason go in and say, \"Should we do it? What should we do here? If those things were not an issue, what should we do?\" So it's very easy to... I joked with Craig, it's like it's so easy to go down the path of being like, \"Well there's can people and should people, there's high agency people and low agency people, there's this person and that person.\"\n\n(01:19:44):\nIt's much more interesting to go and be like, \"Yeah, there might be a little bit of a personality component to it, but what skills is the should person bringing to bear on that particular situation?\" Maybe it's a level of systems thinking, maybe it's a level of looking at the environment and being able to decouple the current tactics from maybe the optimal tactics for doing it. So that's one thing that I'm excited about, to do that. And yeah, there's a bunch of other things. The diverse perspectives, diverse mental models, maybe working with someone like you to try to raise up some of this more diverse... I really want someone to be like who's working at some company X, to be able to go and say, \" Now that leader I can relate to, they're dealing with certain challenges that we are having to deal with at our company,\" and I'd love them to be able to have role models like that.\n\nLenny (01:20:41):\nLike highlight people that aren't on Twitter that are doing the work.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:20:46):\nAnd not like meeting here. Not any of these particular people where they can say, \"Well that leader...\" I was speaking to someone recently, I wrote about this in my newsletter and she was just sort of forlorn. She was like, \"I follow these people in this space and I know what my beliefs are and I know that that person has beliefs that I'm not sure vibing with completely. But the message to me is, the only way to get ahead in tech is to have those beliefs. And John, is that right? Do you need to believe this?\" In this case, it was this very individualistic, very meritocratic kind of get ahead, push ahead type of vibe, which I respect that thought leader for putting out there, but this person didn't buy into it, which would've all been okay except she said, \"Is there a place for me in this environment. Will I need to sacrifice my beliefs to get ahead?\"\n\n(01:21:42):\nAnd I told her about some companies that I know. I told her about Carrie, who I just mentioned, who's been working on building the diversity, even in a small company. I told her about different leaders in different companies that, \"Hey, there's some companies where it is a real team vibe and there's some companies that that\", and she was like, \"That's really good to know. So I think that that's one thing I want to work on in the next year, to make sure that people have role models and not the people talking like me, but actual... Maybe I could be a role model to people in my new role, but ideally there's role model leaders who they can relate to. That would be great.\n\nLenny (01:22:16):\nAwesome. I love that. I feel like you just talking about that makes an impact there. Something I'm definitely trying to do with this podcast is not just have all the same people that we see on Twitter all day and have a lot of people people have never heard of, but if you have suggestions, let's definitely talk offline. I'd love to do more and more of this.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:22:31):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:22:33):\nSo those are clearly some of the things on your mind as you're kind of in this period of reflection. I'm curious if you are going to keep writing and keep your newsletter up, maybe publish more books and then just broadly, how do you make time, while you have a day job, to write? Because a lot of people always wonder that. I'm curious if you have any pieces of advice.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:22:54):\nI'm obsessed with the writing, obviously, and I think a bit of background about me is I was pretty involved in music and song writing and it was similar kind of thing, I just liked writing lots of songs. I like that there's a certain buzz you get when you're creating. And in the case of music, it'd be like you record the demo and you get it out there. I think what people have correctly picked up on is because I have a full-time job, sometimes it'll be Thursday night and my kid's finally asleep and it's one in the morning and I'm just like, \"I've got to write this post.\" And so sometimes it comes off as being a little bit rough or even accentuating the fact that I don't give them an answer because it's like two o'clock in the morning now and I don't want to give them an answer. I want to go to sleep to do these things.\n\n(01:23:43):\nSo I think one of the things I'm going to hope to do is maybe be more deliberate about trying to provide at least maybe some mental models for dealing with the mess. I mean there's things like that out there. There's this thing [inaudible 01:23:57], which is a way to understand the systems and decision-making problems have, are you dealing with a clear system, a complicated system, a complex system, or a chaotic system? And I like things like that because that helps do two things I like. One, I want to give people something actionable to be able to address what they're doing, but it doesn't remove the complexity in the particular situation. So I have role models in that. This guy, Simon Wardly does this kind of mapping, which I think is great. There's these other techniques that I want to try to lean into and maybe develop some of my own that sort of help people have something actionable and embrace the mess, if that makes sense.\n\n(01:24:41):\nSo for example, I recently wrote about something called the leadership, the Pyramid of Leadership, self awareness. And it's a simple model, but it goes deep how I want it to go deep. So the idea is that at first we know nothing about ourself and then the next level is that we start to become self-aware, but believe the whole world is wired just like we're wired. And then you go up to the next level and you believe that the world thinks different things, but you still think your way is the best way to be able to do that. So an example is, I remember talking to an executive and they're like, \"People only stay because of their managers and because of their money. That's it.\" And I said, \"Everyone?\" They said, \"Yes.\" \"Do you believe that?\" \"Yes, because everyone believes it. It's a physical law of light.\" And here I am like, \"Oh my God, I joined a company because the mission of the company or whatever.\"\n\n(01:25:23):\nSo they're kind of stuck down on that second level where they believe that, \"Yeah, the world thinks different things, but I'm absolutely right.\" And then as you get up to the top, you become a little bit more aware that there's other valid views and then at the top you're sort of like, \"No, you don't dishonor yourself and throw away who you are, but you realize that this is a huge asset in the world, that there's diverse views that you can bring together to do really, really amazing things.\" So that's an example of some writing I've even done recently where I'm kind of like, it's a complex topic, but I try to make it more actionable to do that. So that's one whole thing. The other thing too is leveraging all the crap that I have. I think it's like 700, 800 posts, maybe 900.\n\nLenny (01:25:23):\nWow.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:26:07):\nI had this whole blog beforehand that I did it. And then I have these hundreds of images with these frameworks and then it's like 50, 70 talks that I've done floating on YouTube and then there's all the mural boards I made at Amplitude. It's a different model. So I kind of feel like I could pull some of that together to make it more actionable for people, give people almost like a meta guide to Cutler content so that they're not just dropped into me writing something at 1:00 AM and being like, \"Oh, just another one of those.\" Like, \"Damn it, you didn't give me an alternative to NPS. This newsletter sucks.\" I mean, frankly, I would say the same thing too if I just stumbled into the newsletter to do it. So those are a couple things that I'm thinking about for the content, definitely not going to stop doing those, sharing those things and doing that. So yeah, excited about this next year.\n\n(01:26:52):\nAlso, the question about writing, I mean, one thing with a full-time job where most of my work is internal, obviously I need to respect my team. Again, I go back to that funny thing with Spencer, he is like, \"You're writing about Amplitude.\" I'm like, \"No, dude, I'm not writing about Amplitude. It's like every company has that problem.\" But if I'm working alongside people, I obviously can't be like, \"No,\" I can't say, \"Oh, your manager sucks.\" It's like Craig's going to read that to do that particular thing, but I can, what I'm really excited about is that part of my job will be involving doing a lot of writing and a lot of teaching, is hopefully work it out with the company so that I can share things that are not too specific about the company, but much more. They've got five different businesses at Toast, they've got all these people, so it's going to be a education every day. So I'm hoping to maybe get that inspiring my work in different ways.\n\nLenny (01:27:40):\nAmazing. I imagine you might rename your newsletter The Beautiful Mess, slightly less messy.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:27:46):\nYeah. Jam and Toast. The Jam and Toast decision. The addition.\n\nLenny (01:27:50):\nDelicious.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:27:51):\nYeah, there we go. 2023.\n\nLenny (01:27:52):\nAlso, as you were talking, I imagined a chat GBT three type chat bot powered by John Cutler content could be something to try.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:28:01):\nOh, it could be a funny, yeah, I mean I'm sort of obsessed. I like the ChatGPT thing because I like having things, having a developer inspired by Hemmingway debate, a developer inspired by Tolstoy discussing how to resolve a GIT issue. So that's what I've been obsessed by lately is when you know how ChatGPT works, you can actually make it do really funny things. And back to the worldview things, it's actually really effective. This is a very actionable tip, if you feel you're heavily grounded in let's say the, I don't know, maybe you're like a hardcore objectivist or you believe in individualism, you can just type into ChatGPT and say, \"Take this situation and interpret it by five different worldviews.\" And it'll be like, you'll get the humanist view and you'll get the communitarian view and you'll get the collectivist view. You'll do that. So anyway, it's a fun tool for that. It's really cool.\n\nLenny (01:28:52):\nIt is awesome. We checked the checkbox talking about AI, very, very hot these days.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:28:57):\nYep. Score.\n\nLenny (01:28:57):\nScore. One final question before we get to our exciting lightning round, I'm going to come back to the questions that folks asked you on Twitter. And there's a question that I saved up and the question, it was by Jeff Fedor and his question to you, he was, \"What have you always wanted to say but couldn't now that you're between gigs?\"\n\nJohn Cutler (01:29:18):\nOh, that's good. So one thing is I didn't really need to filter myself very much when I was at Amplitude, which is kind of the beauty of the gig. I wrote this blog post, probably six years ago called How to Know You're Working in a Feature Factory. And I've always, this has all been my jam. The outcome, outcome and impact focus thing. So it's not like I've really had to hide anything. And so one thing I could say is the power of qualitative data, but even Spencer says that too. He's talking about early on in Amplitude you can rely a lot on qualitative data. So that wouldn't be all that controversial. That's a funny thing. There's not that much, I pretty much say what I say partially under the guise that I'm talking to so many teams. So therefore it's never about Amplitude. Absolutely not.\n\n(01:30:07):\nI think the one thing that I would change, I don't think that many people in the company would disagree with me, but one anti pattern I see a lot on the part of implementing analytics is that people go in and undertake this huge implementation. They want to implement all their events, they want to get, they want to treat it like this big project. And again, I don't think it's too controversial internally, but I think I might have been much more adamant to people that's just like use our free plan and get 20 events going and you might wipe them out later, but you don't even know what you don't know yet. You would see these companies that are really qualified companies and it would be a couple months of back and forth of them trying to document every question they have and every metric they need and everything that you had.\n\n(01:31:02):\nAnd I would watch them and I understood why they were doing that, but I really just wanted to shake them, which again, I wouldn't have done this because then I would've been talking about the companies I was talking about every day. I just wanted to shake them and just, \"Sit me down with the developers at your company for three hours and let's like Hello world, a couple events here, this is, you could be getting value this whole time.\" And again, I don't think that people at Amplitude would disagree, but I think that that's, I wasn't going to talk about that all day because that would be sort of belittling customers who do want this big implementation thing. So pretty kind of inside baseball for analytics, but that's one thing that I was thinking about for Jeff.\n\nLenny (01:31:41):\nAwesome. Great answer. Also actionable advice. How about that?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:31:44):\nYeah, can do. You just need to find it. You just send me a message and say, \"Do you have the actionable advice for it?\" I probably do somewhere. I just maybe didn't have the time to organize it.\n\nLenny (01:31:53):\nGood tip. You're going to get a lot of DMs. With that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. I'm just going to go through and whatever comes to mind fire away. Are you ready?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:32:06):\nYeah, yeah, absolutely.\n\nLenny (01:32:07):\nWhat are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:32:11):\nYeah, this one's pretty easy because they are fairly similar lately. So I really like the book How to Measure Anything, finding Intangibles or Finding the Value of Intangibles in Business. So that's by Douglas Hubbard. And the reason why I like that is again, at Amplitude the number of people who would come in like, \"What are all our competitors measuring? We want to know exactly which metric to measure.\" And again, I'm laughing with you because I know you have these posts. Here's exactly the metrics that you should track. I really respect those posts and that's the power that you have. That's all really good. But what Hubbard reminds you is why the hell are you measuring things to begin with? It's to reduce uncertainty for critical decisions or to achieve certain objectives that you have. The reason why it's important to read that book is A, you figure out someone who's again, actionable, has thought this through. So he gives you kind of a framework to thinking about it.\n\n(01:33:02):\nBut B, he really challenges this idea of when making decisions in conditions of uncertainty, you only need to reduce the uncertainty to an acceptable amount to be able to make the next decision that you need to make. And we never have, people are like, \"Product is science.\" It's really an art, like a game that's being played out. You never have complete information to do it. So I think that's a good book to remind people about what... To be more creative and thinking about measurement instead of thinking about measurement and metrics is just about adopting the exact metrics that everyone has and doing that.\n\n(01:33:36):\nThe second one I think would probably be Accelerate. So Nicole Forsgren, Gene Kim, Jez Humble, that's just one of the best books in the world about the factors contributing to performance. And it's built on many... It's six, I don't know, it's been out for a while now, 10 years? They did the Dora report, which was their yearly report where they did big surveys, like 10, 20, 30, 40,000 people responding to it. And Nicole Forsgren is an amazing scientist. So they structure their thing correctly. They would have a hypothesis about what is equal to performance and how all these individual practices contribute to it.\n\n(01:34:19):\nAnd then they've updated it over time. And I think that Google bought Dora, I don't know exactly how all the parts came into place, but that book is amazing, just sort of teaching you how to think about the idea of performance because they'll include things like the Western topology, which is your company operating a bureaucracy or... These certain culture elements to it, but then also the practices and things that you're doing. So that's a great book when you're trying to think about, \"How do I model performance?\" And then it's also an amazing book because you can just literally put the stuff into motion about improving your development practices and things you're doing.\n\n(01:34:58):\nAnd then I think probably the last one, man, I just love this book, this Jeff Patton book about user story mapping. I love what Jeff Patton did. He took this extremely simple idea, which is that you can lay out a customer journey and then organize, take a slice across that journey and develop it. And he gives this pretty basic straightforward method to do it. But I tell you, I'll go into companies like a year after they had Jeff in and learned this and they're still like buzzing about, \"Hey, user story map.\" And it's just, he's a super humble guy and he would never outstate the value of this. He'd be like, \"Yeah, it's just a journey map with a couple sticky notes on it.\" But I always, when someone's new at product management, I'm like, \"Hey, this is a deceptively simple book. You'll learn this very basic idea, but it'll teach you a lot about product when I do that.\" So those are three that come to mind.\n\nLenny (01:35:50):\nKiller suggestions, I love answers of books I've never heard of that seem really amazing. So you check the checkbox there. Thank you. Next question. Favorite other podcast other than the one you're currently on?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:36:02):\nI'm in a... I got a four-year-old. I don't really spend a lot of time... I'm the sort of, I'm such a lightweight, it's like I'll do knowledge project because Shane sent me, you know what I mean? I'll just listen to some, I'll binge things, but I do really like, I've actually been going through old episodes of Maggie Crowley's podcast that she did when she was at Drift. Lots of good guests and I really like Maggie's perspective and I like the guests that she had on there. So sometimes I'll go back to an old podcast. He does these really great memes and stuff, but Jason Knight actually has a fun podcast that I listen to and some of those things. So I think that, but realistically I'm not a huge podcast listener. I'd like to go back to a podcast that hasn't been out for a while, like Maggie's and just sort of catch up on all the guests because I thought that was really good.\n\nLenny (01:36:52):\nAwesome. Jason, we love hearing that. Next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:36:57):\nOh man, again, I have a kid. It's nothing. There's this thing called, there's a show called Sunny Bunnies. It's these fluffy bunnies. That's really good. And then there's this animated series called Booba and he's this funny guy. I like Booba [inaudible 01:37:13].\n\nLenny (01:37:13):\nGreat. I'm sure these will be useful to families.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:37:17):\nHardcore product, movies. Really, those are going to up your game a lot.\n\nLenny (01:37:22):\nYeah, I'm sure there's something to learn. Two more questions. Favorite interview question that you like to ask folks?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:37:30):\nOh, so one that I like to do is, I do the behavioral questions like, \"Tell me about stuff,\" but then I'll ask them like, \"Imagine I'm interviewing a person you worked with. Now answer in there, tell me about of the same situation.\" So you'll be like, \"Oh, Lenny, tell me about a time that you were faced with adversity and you did this and then you worked with the team to do it. And you would go through it and then you'd answer it.\n\n(01:37:55):\nAnd then maybe in the process of doing that, you mentioned someone you work with and I'll be like, \"Now imagine that you're Mary, who you just spoke about, and things, and how would she answer the tell me about thing as it relates to you?\" And so I think it can show some really interesting self awareness. Often people answer that question like they are the hero of the story and the other people are the accomplices in it, but then if you challenge them, \"What was that story from the perspective of one of the people you worked with?\" I think it's really interesting.\n\nLenny (01:38:21):\nAwesome. [inaudible 01:38:23].\n\nJohn Cutler (01:38:23):\nSo it is a behavioral question. I do think that's the right way and if you dig enough you can really get the depth of the story, but I do think it's fun to challenge people to see how flexible their thinking could be about that situation. I don't know if that's right from an HR perspective, but I like it.\n\nLenny (01:38:39):\nI like it too. Final question, you mentioned you have kids. What's the best lesson someone taught you about raising kids?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:38:45):\nIt's a challenge every day. I just think they operate better when they are fed. The kid as a product is like if you feed the product, then they were just, everything's better. And when you don't, like everything falls apart. So just have snacks with you. That's basically the advice that I have for people.\n\nLenny (01:39:04):\nVery practical. Look at you, actionable advice left and right.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:39:07):\nYeah. You got it.\n\nLenny (01:39:09):\nJohn, and I feel comfortable calling you John now, I feel like I just got to know you. You're just like, \"I'm John now.\" We hit our goal of, I think it's going to be the longest episode I've done. This was amazing. John, we've reached the end. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to learn more, reach out, ask questions if you want them to? And then two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nJohn Cutler (01:39:32):\nI still am using Twitter a fair amount I think, but LinkedIn could be good. John Cuttlefish on Twitter and then just John Cutler at LinkedIn. Yeah, I think what I would love to hear from people is just send recommendations of people we should hear more from. I think that would be really helpful. Even in the role that I have, I want to start like a guest speaker series to bring people in to talk to our team. And so I think that that would be something that I can work on.\n\nLenny (01:40:02):\nAmazing. John, thank you so much for doing this. I'm really excited for this new adventure that you're on, and I'm excited to maybe follow up maybe in a couple years of just what you've learned from this next phase of life.\n\nJohn Cutler (01:40:14):\nI really enjoyed the show and thank you for having me.\n\nLenny (01:40:17):\nAwesome. Thanks, John.\n\n(01:40:20):\nThank you so much for listening.
