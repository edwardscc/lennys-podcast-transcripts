She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting, and she pulls up her screen. She goes, \"Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish and the customers keep coming.\" You sit there and your first reaction is \"This is great. We're growing.\" And she's like, \"It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out of product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie.\" She's like, \"So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business.\"\nLenny (00:00:56):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast, where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard-won experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Modi. Laura and I actually worked together at Airbnb for many years where she was director of hospitality, leading all of the work around strengthening the host community and also improving marketplace quality. After leaving Airbnb, she went on to found a company called Bobbie, the only female-founded and mom-led organic infant formula company in the US which basically every mom I know uses.\n(00:01:26):\nI rarely have CEOs or founders on this podcast, and when I do, it's because I'm confident that product leaders and growth teams and other founders can learn a lot from this person. Laura is a great example of this and I've been incredibly impressed with watching Laura execute and build this company. In our conversation, we talk about how to build and maintain momentum within your organization, how sometimes slowing growth down is the best way to grow long term, why the most innovative ideas often come from people with no experience in the problem space, how to lead through tough times, why manufacturing fake deadlines is so powerful and effective and so much more. Laura is such a great leader and such a great human, and I'm really excited for you to learn from her. With that, I bring you Laura Modi, after a short word from our sponsors.\n(00:02:11):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate your growth.

I just recently discovered the stuff actually from another podcast, and it is such sweet, salty goodness. Element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with a science-backed electrolyte ratio. And, unlike most electrolyte drinks, there's no sugar, coloring, artificial ingredients, gluten or any other BS. Getting enough electrolytes helps prevent and eliminate headaches, muscle cramps, fatigue, sleeplessness, and other common symptoms of electrolyte deficiency. Element is the exclusive hydration partner to Team USA Weightlifting and many other Olympic athletes.\n(00:03:42):\nAlso, dozens of NBA and NFL teams and players rely on Element to stay hydrated, along with Navy SEAL teams, FBI sniper teams and the Marines. You can try Element totally risk-free. If you don't like it, you can share it with a salty friend and they'll give you your money back, no questions asked. To give it a shot, go to drinklmnt.com/lenny and you'll get a free sample pack with any purchase, which includes one packet of every flavor. My favorite is watermelon salt. You won't find this offer publicly available, so you have to head to drinklmnt.com/lenny to take advantage of this offer. Stay salty.\n(00:04:20):\nLaura, welcome to the podcast.\nLaura Modi (00:04:22):\nHi, I'm so happy to be here. It's a Friday, Lenny, this is amazing.\nLenny (00:04:26):\nOh, my God, already starting strong. I was looking forward to this chat for a few weeks already. I knew that we booked it a couple of weeks ago. Just as context, we worked together at Airbnb for a while and, not something I expected, but you went on to now become a magnate in the baby formula industry, which I'm excited to dig into. And so thank you again for being here.\nLaura Modi (00:04:45):\nThank you. This is going to be exciting. Hope you don't mind. I am going to have a little bit of wine as we go through this.\nLenny (00:04:50):\nIt's highly encouraged. Maybe I need to start drinking more on the show. That might help.\nLaura Modi (00:04:54):\nHighly approved.\nLenny (00:04:56):\nWe'll see. We'll see how it ends up. It'll be a good retrospective.\nLaura Modi (00:05:00):\nMerlot's so good.\nLenny (00:05:00):\nSo I thought it'd be fun to start with just your time at Airbnb where we got to work together. You spent five and a half years there. Everyone that spends that amount of time at Airbnb, and let me know if you agree, always ends up being in this transformative time in their life and their career. Yeah, okay, you're nodding.\nLaura Modi (00:05:15):\nI can't imagine a world where I would be without Airbnb.\nLenny (00:05:21):\nYeah, I feel the same way. And so I want to spend a little time on what you learned from that experience and what you took away there. But just to start, can you just share briefly what you worked on while you were at Airbnb?\nLaura Modi (00:05:28):\nI mean, what didn't we work on? Just, I reflect back and it's one of those experiences where it probably was transformative because you do get an opportunity to work on so many different things. So I remember joining and I was just put in charge of leading and growing parts of customer service, vendor management. I mean, we were scaling the team so fast on that side. It quickly shifted into taking me to Europe where I led our consolidation of our European offices in Dublin. It was so funny. I remember at the time being asked to go do it and thinking, am I being asked purely because I'm just the only Irish person in the company right now? But it was one of the biggest operational changes that we went through there. And then for the last few years I was the director of hospitality leading global host community and host operations.\nLenny (00:06:22):\nI think you're underselling that last part. Can you just share a little bit more of what that actually means?\nLaura Modi (00:06:26):\nOur product really wasn't our technology. It wasn't the technology that we were building, although for a few years we all thought it was. And then it got to a place where we realized Airbnb is nothing without its hosts, nothing. If anything, Airbnb's product was its hosts. So there was a moment, and I can't remember, it was two or three years in, where that narrative was building up more and more and we realized that there was a need to have a central team, which we called Hospitality, dedicated to equipping and recognizing and holding this product of our hosts accountable to their job.\nLenny (00:07:09):\nYeah, I think we could go down that. Maybe let me ask one question there because I think that's really interesting. For a company where the product, as you said, and marketplaces in general, the product you're selling is the supply, in our case Airbnb hosts. Is there something maybe you learned from that experience, I don't know, working at a software, company about how to think about the supply as the product and how that maybe informs, I don't know, what you're building today or just something in general?\nLaura Modi (00:07:37):\nI think it maybe just starts internally where you have to be able to create a culture first, to all understand that. Because otherwise you're going to be in a position where you're focused on optimizing the technology, efficiency, growth, looking at tools for tools' sake versus tools for users' sake. And I mean, I remember a very pivotal shift when we started realizing that we really needed to understand our hosts far more than we had leading up to that. And I think growth just follows. I mean, we certainly saw that at Airbnb. If we put the hosts first and we thought about building tools for them versus what do we need just to drive more bookings, users begets users, and that's exactly what we saw.\nLenny (00:08:29):\nWhat are some lasting lessons from your time at Airbnb that you bring to what you're working on now?\nLaura Modi (00:08:33):\nThe most obvious kind of cliched one is culture. It is bread and butter to everything you do, from the people you hire to how you build the right mindset to just keeping the energy. I mean, energy at Airbnb was the currency. It was like, unless you didn't have that energy, nothing was happening. And I think about that every day. How do you keep energy going? And my God, they did that for a decade, just keeping it going. I think the other big takeaway is if you can get people excited behind a vision and storytelling, it again kind of carries through that cross-functional work.\n(00:09:16):\nI now reflect back on just how powerful our storytelling was at Airbnb to get people pumped up. I mean, even for some of the smallest features that we would build, Lenny, they would kick off with the most powerful storytelling. I mean, we were changing lives. And again, it makes you wake up every day going, \"Fuck, yeah, I want to work on this.\" And you're not just going in to fix something, you actually feel like you're having very large impact. And that has to be felt the whole way down the org.\nLenny (00:09:44):\nI love that you're already getting into the specifics of what culture actually... how it manifests and how to build a culture. And so I want to maybe ask another question there. You talked about keeping the energy up is a big part of creating the culture. You want to create strong storytelling, either in one of those buckets or another example. What do you do at Bobbie, which we're going to talk about, to build a strong culture? What else do you do to actually do that? Because people hear about building a strong culture and they're like, \"What do I do? How do I do that?\" So I'd love to hear anything you've actually done there.\nLaura Modi (00:10:11):\nI think one of the biggest ones I would say is that you need to get to know people personally as much as you do professionally. And that was maybe something I also maybe took a little bit for granted at Airbnb. We had built a culture where people really personally loved each other. They loved working together. Now, fast-forward to today and you're building a company that's completely remote, how do you build a personal relationship?\n(00:10:36):\nFor example, we make sure that we take time to have personal and professional check-ins. And cross-functional people in the org who maybe have no idea someone else as a kid or what they're doing in their lives. Because those personal connections, I mean, again, it's your second family, you're waking up every day to spend time with them. I think those personal connections are some of the biggest.\nLenny (00:10:56):\nIt's interesting because there's also this movement away from your workmates or your family. Airbnb I think is very... Everyone called themselves AirFam, but that becomes challenging when you have to let people go and there's challenging times. So is your perspective, that's where you find value, to kind of stay close to that?\nLaura Modi (00:11:14):\nI think you need a hybrid. I do. I think looking at work for transactions' sake, are your colleagues purely as the people who are just there to get the job done with you? That's not inspiring. No. Do I think that there's a balance and maybe some of the things that get introduced in a culture probably don't need to go that far? Yeah. But no matter what, I do believe building personal connections and actually caring about the people you work for is imperative for building a lasting business.\nLenny (00:11:45):\nWhat's the story of going from Airbnb to building a baby formula?\nLaura Modi (00:11:48):\nOh, my god. You mean leaving one of the fastest growing companies to start powdered milk? It was so funny. I don't know if I ever shared this with you, Lenny. I remember telling my dad and he was like, \"Hold on a second, Laura. I don't understand.\" He's like, \"You're lactose intolerant. Why are you starting a milk company?\" He just couldn't fathom why I would, I mean in many ways, leave an established business that had established parental leave benefits, everything that in many ways, as you grow through your career, become more and more what you need and you need the stability.\n(00:12:30):\nSo that shift, I suppose, just socializing it is probably one of the hardest. And it's a big thing to take a risk because you're taking 10 steps backwards in hopes of making major leaps forward. And I think that's just always kind of been a narrative mostly in my career, which is I don't believe there's such a thing as taking a big leap without first taking a major risk, and that was. I mean, it was a very big risk, obviously. But then also, keep in mind, even before I joined Airbnb, I had a good job at Google. And Airbnb at the time, I think, just had one of its most major crises back in 2011.\nLenny (00:13:09):\nCJ or EJ?\nLaura Modi (00:13:11):\nEJ. EJ incident. It was all over the papers. It was a small company. I wasn't really given a title. And I'll never forget as well, exactly the same narrative. My parents going, \"Hold on a second. You're leaving Google to go start a B&B.\" Like, \"No, I'm not starting a B&B. I really believe this company's going somewhere.\" So anyway, the moral of the story is the move into starting my own business, it was a big risk and it was one that I felt so confident on that was needed, it was worth it.\nLenny (00:13:41):\nSome people do what you did there, where you take a big risk and kind of maybe stick backwards and it doesn't work out. And in your case it's worked out many times. Is there a thread across the decisions you've made that you think people maybe should look for or you think is important in taking that big risk? Or do you think it was a lot of super luck?\nLaura Modi (00:14:02):\nSuper luck. I mean, I have a folder of businesses and product ideas that, prior to Bobbie, I had dreamt of. And we can always get into that again in the future. Some of them I still dream of doing one day, but a big reason for not taking the risk is because I didn't feel the conviction. So, yes, while I think it's luck, I think I put a lot of intention into researching the marketplace, understanding the business, determining how much of a risk I'm really able to take, even financially. Sitting with my husband and determining how long I may need to be in this position before raising capital and is it possible? It certainly isn't what sometimes it can appear on the surface, which is, \"Oh, she had an idea and she left.\" There's a lot of work that goes into determining is this actually going to be something that's viable?\nLenny (00:14:57):\nI like that lesson. It may seem like Laura went to here, to Airbnb and was just like, \"Oh, how lucky she picked Airbnb of all the companies.\" But what you're saying is you spent the time researching, seeing what the company started.\nLaura Modi (00:15:09):\nYeah.\nLenny (00:15:10):\nYeah. Okay. So let's talk about Bobbie, just broadly. Can you just talk about what is Bobbie and then what is the scale of Bobbie these days? What stats can you share to give people a sense of how large this has gotten?\nLaura Modi (00:15:20):\nBobbie is a powdered milk company. We are an infant formula. And prior to infant formula, the formula-gate of 2022, which everyone is now familiar with. The short of it is that this is an industry that is owned by a duopoly. It's one of the last remaining industries in the CPG space that has seen any disruption or change in probably 40 years. And my desire was to create a formula that parents could feel proud of, an infant formula that felt modern and met where science is today. Because frankly, none of the infant formulas on the market really had caught up to where science has evolved to.\n(00:16:00):\nNow, obviously, I only experienced this as becoming a mother myself. I knew nothing about this at all. And then I pick up a can of formula and I read the back of the can and there's ingredients in there I would never feed myself. And I think the thing that really hit me, and this was more of the business investor side of me, I just hated the product and I couldn't understand why, as something that is used by so many, 83% of parents, why is it that I'm embarrassed about it? I feel guilty feeding my child this and it's also ugly. It's sitting on my counter every day and this isn't what I want to see.\n(00:16:41):\nI remember saying to my husband, \"I feel like we have failed to breastfeed.\" And the alternative is that I need to give her a medical solution to survive, which it's milk. I should feel like I'm giving her food. But for whatever reason, society has set this up to make formula feel like you have failed. I mean, that was the impetus. I know you asked me, what is Bobbie? We are a better-for-you infant formula without the guilt.\nLenny (00:17:12):\nOoh, I like that. That was a good summary at the end. How about about the scale of Bobbie? What kind of numbers can you share? Just to give people a sense of how large this has become.\nLaura Modi (00:17:20):\nYeah. Oh, my god. I remember launching, it was 100% direct-to-consumer, it was at the top of 2021. And the moment you're about to launch, the first question all investors ask is what do you believe your growth is going to be? First question. It's the same question you get after you're married, when are you going to have a baby? I'm like, \"I have no clue what my growth is going to be. I've been on the market for a hot minute.\" I remember thinking hopefully four million, five million in our first year. So the growth has been fabulous and beyond our wildest dreams in what we had expected.\nLenny (00:17:54):\nAmazing. There's a bunch of questions I'm going to ask about how you grew Bobby, but you mentioned the COVID baby shortage crisis. And there's a couple stories I wanted to get into that was one of them. Can you just talk about what you went through in that period? Because I imagine it was both a blessing and a curse. Also, it reminds me, I have a friend who uses Bobbie and she just told me a story about how someone, she couldn't find any Bobbie during COVID, supply chain issues and all that, and an employee of Bobbie came to her house and brought her formula just to make sure she had enough. And obviously that created forever brand loyalty. And we'll talk a little bit about brand, but I'd love to hear about just that period of the journey and what you learned from it.\nLaura Modi (00:18:34):\nThere is nothing like a crisis that gives you more of an appreciation for what opportunity lies ahead. And I would thank my blessings every day that the only way to look at this positively was to be in a position of gratitude that I have an opportunity that most startups would wait a lifetime for. So what happened was I woke up one day and the President of the United States was talking about there being an infant formula shortage. And again, it's just being in the right place at the right time. A topic that never has really been brought up. Unfortunately, one of the large companies, one of the duopolies, had a recall and that recall basically left the nation without product and we were not able to feed babies in the US.\n(00:19:29):\nBeing one of the smallest companies here, we ended up seeing our customer count double the first week that that shortage happened. All of that would seem great, almost like a dream for any startup to be in, that you're going to see your product grow now because they're moving from one customer to another or from one product to another. But here's what happens. Infant formula is one of those products you can't run out of. It's not cool to be out of infant formula. It's not like a piece of furniture and you're at capacity for a certain amount of time.\n(00:20:03):\nSo our Head of Growth who, I mean this girl is just fabulous. She was watching our inventory levels very carefully and also watching how quickly we were growing. And I'll never forget that moment. I can visualize it, sitting in a meeting. And she pulls up her screen, she goes, \"Here's the dilemma. We are depleting inventory far quicker than our ability to replenish. And the customers keep coming.\" You sit there and your first reaction is, \"I mean, this is great. We're growing.\" And she's like, \"It's not that great, actually, because here's what's going to happen. We are going to run out a product for the babies that are on Bobbie today. That's a problem.\"\n(00:20:48):\nSo in my absorption of everything that's happening, and again, being a company that had only been on the market 14 months, saying to her, \"Well, Shireen, what do we do next?\" And she's like, \"We have about six days before we get to a place where we won't be able to serve those who've already made a commitment to Bobbie.\" She's like, \"So we need to turn off our site and stop growing the business.\" That's a big decision to make when you're like, \"Okay, so I'm going to turn to all of our investors and say we're turning off our site, we're closing down to ensure that we keep enough product.\"\n(00:21:23):\nBut honestly, in hindsight, it was a no-brainer. We were not going to run out of product on our current subscribers and we had no idea how long the crisis was going to last. So even though we didn't know how long we'd be off, I gave the thumbs up, sally forth, turn it off, and we went into hibernation mode. And in many ways we switched immediately into our customers come first. We now have 70,000 subscribers who are in a place of panic because they hear the news every day that there's formula running out and our job is to give them confidence and clarity that we have the products for them and we're never going to run out. And we did. For six months, six months, we kept our website off and we didn't grow the business last year and we continued to serve our current subscribers and in the end we became the only formula company that was able to reliably serve its current customers and never run out.\nLenny (00:22:21):\nThat's an amazing story. I haven't heard that before. You threw out this term at some point when we were emailing earlier of slowth, you called it a slowth. Slow growth, I think.\nLaura Modi (00:22:32):\nOh, my gosh.\nLenny (00:22:32):\nIs that how you think about this?\nLaura Modi (00:22:33):\nThat was part of also how do you change the culture internally? I had 60 people on the team who were all in a position of driving growth and many of them were probably only hired weeks before the shortage with the position of growth, email growth, paid acquisition. And all of a sudden you're telling someone who just left a cushy job to join a startup that we're no longer growing. And in fact, your job now is to completely flip what you thought you were going to do on its head. So we named the entire growth team, the slowth team.\nLenny (00:23:09):\nThat's awesome.\nLaura Modi (00:23:09):\nAnd I mean, they got creative. At some point we were emailing subscribers to nudge them to cancel because we were looking for a way to ensure that we could keep product, and my God, it was a mind-boggling moment.\nLenny (00:23:24):\nWhat else did you learn from that period that has either stuck with you in this time and/or is there something maybe you think you would've done differently if you could go back?\nLaura Modi (00:23:34):\nWell, I have a personal belief of never looking back and regretting or changing things, but there were definitely some learnings and I would say on the positive end, some of the biggest learnings were just the power of storytelling and bringing the impact of what we were doing back into the company. I'm in a fortunate position as the CEO where, whether I'm speaking to advisors or on panels or engaging the outside world a lot more, I was able to truly feel, I mean, viscerally feel the impact that we were having by doing this.\n(00:24:13):\nI'll never forget, I was speaking at Davos on this topic and I had a customer. Oh my God, Lenny, this moment. I was standing outside of this events area and this woman comes running up to me and she's bawling, crying, and this is at a global leader's conference and she's crying and she just held my hands. And she's like, \"Oh my God, you saved my life over the last year.\" She's like, \"You have no idea the impact that Bobbie played in our lives by making the decision and giving me confidence that you weren't going to run out of product on us.\"\n(00:24:53):\nAnd that emotional connection of just, wow, yes, we may have grown the business faster, we may have gotten product back, but at the end of the day, these 70,000 voices that are out there and the stories that they have and bringing those back to the company, it's undeniable the impact, by making that decision, we've had. And I think the rest of the company feels it, too.\nLenny (00:25:16):\nThis connects with something we've brought up a couple of times now, which is just brand and brand building. Clearly, it's something that you've spent a lot of energy on and something you've done incredibly well. I think every mom I know knows of Bobbie. By the way, let me just throw this out there. I don't know if I've told you this, but I'm having a kid and we're going to get some Bobbie.\nLaura Modi (00:25:34):\nWhat?\nLenny (00:25:36):\nYep.\nLaura Modi (00:25:37):\nOh my god, Lenny's going to be a dad. This is so exciting.\nLenny (00:25:42):\nOh man, this is going to be a whole new direction.\nLaura Modi (00:25:44):\nI've got your milk, if you need it, of course, if Michelle's in a position and she wants it, we're here for you.\nLenny (00:25:50):\nOkay, I appreciate that. We're going to get a deal.\nLaura Modi (00:25:53):\nOh, my God, I'm so excited for you.\nLenny (00:25:54):\nThank you. Laura, I feel like we need some formula just in case, right? Doesn't that-\nLaura Modi (00:25:58):\nYou do. You do. And the rule is you have to try it, as well.\nLenny (00:26:02):\nOh, okay.\nLaura Modi (00:26:03):\nYeah. If baby's going to try it, you need to give it a shot.\nLenny (00:26:06):\nOkay. Okay, okay. Oh, I'll get ready for that. I like that rule. I like that rule. Okay. There's so many things to get used to.\nLaura Modi (00:26:14):\nWe'll talk again.\nLenny (00:26:15):\nOkay, so going back to my question about brand, basically I just want to understand what have you learned about building a brand and when do you think it is important to invest there?\nLaura Modi (00:26:24):\nI mean, it all depends on what your product is, but the first thing I've learned about it is you have to build a brand that connects with what your customers are going through, and the experience. I once had someone say to me, \"Think about who your customer is and that one customer, the exact person, is going to wake up tomorrow morning and there's going to be three things that are just playing on them in the back of their mind, the things that keep them up at night. And if you are not solving for one of those, then you're going to be finding a way to build a brand and to get in the way of that, get in the way of their mindset, have them remember who you are or what you're about.\"\n(00:27:06):\nAnd it was very clear to us that everything, from who our brand was, what it stood for, the positioning, needed to be something that parents were really finding as a struggle in that first year in feeding. So you see it in our messaging, you see it in our creative. I have no desire to bombard people with something that isn't part of those top three things that they're experiencing. Otherwise, we will have companies out there and brands out there being loud for no reason. And I think that's continued to help us in every time we have to reframe or relaunch something, to keep remembering what do they care about, let's build a brand for them.\nLenny (00:27:48):\nI really like that. That is such a good reminder of just, you are not going to convince someone they have a problem unless you're just spending endless money hammering into their head there's a new problem you have. If you connect to something they already know is a problem and just make it clear this is a solution to a problem, life gets a lot easier.\nLaura Modi (00:28:06):\nThat's right.\nLenny (00:28:07):\nAlthough I know that you also have to kind of fight this breastfeeding-is-best kind of thing. So in a sense you also have to convince people this isn't what you think it is.\nLaura Modi (00:28:22):\nYeah. And then, what's the saying? If you're explaining, you're losing. And I think there's a part of this where there's going to be a large group of people that are always going to be in the mindset that breast is the only way to do it, and anyone who does otherwise is doing second best. And I'm not there to try and convince them. I think a part of this is amplifying those that are in need of our products, that are the 83% using formula and make sure that they feel heard. But that has been a learning. I mean, that's been a huge brand learning. How do you not lean into or amplify the voices that shouldn't be heard and in many ways just get distracted by it?\nLenny (00:29:03):\nThat's really interesting, and I don't know how much you want to talk about this, but I know initially the brand strategy was basically breast is not best. Formula is just as good. And what I'm hearing is you kind of realized you're not going to convince people of that and it's more lean into people that already understand.\nLaura Modi (00:29:19):\nYeah. And I think another major belief I have is no brand, and I do fundamentally believe this, no brand should ever be in a position of pointing fingers to something that's better or worse. Our only job, and I wish politics would also do this, our only job is to talk about what we do and why we exist and why we believe our product is good. And I would say the flip is the same in formula. If a mother out there has access to another brand of formula that is more accessible, maybe more affordable, and it suits their baby, then good for them. And I should never be a company in a position pointing to a competitor or another way of feeding saying that it's worse off, ever.\nLenny (00:30:04):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Assembly AI.

Can you just talk about what that's all about?\nLaura Modi (00:31:21):\nOh, my God. This is, I feel, like a secret sauce of just how to get it done half the time. And I really, really do believe the power of branding the mundane is so successful. I mean, we brand, to be fair, I actually feel like that this was a page out of the Airbnb book. Do you remember going back early days when we were doing customer service deep dives? What were the issues that customers were having? And we branded a program called Air Dives. Do you remember Air Dives?\nLenny (00:31:56):\nYeah.\nLaura Modi (00:31:57):\nAnd this program just became this thing where everyone wanted to know on a Friday what was the latest Air Dive. And really what an Air Dive was was an analysis of customer service tickets and customer service pain points. But how much better is Air Dive than a customer service analysis? So much better. So I think a lot of learnings on just the power of branding and storytelling your workflows and your frameworks and what it means to do your job, often keeps people motivated, too. And it creates memory recall a lot better, too. So now when you prefer Slack channels, they're all like, I don't even want to name them because I'm going to give you-\nLenny (00:32:43):\nNo, I was going to ask. I'd love some examples and I know they're going to sound ridiculous to an outsider, but what are some examples of things? And you can say like Bobbie Blank, or what's your naming convention?\nLaura Modi (00:32:52):\nOh, my God. Project Shamrock. I'm not going to tell you what that's about. Project Lumberjack. Ooh, Got B 2022. I can give you so much insight into what these are and I'll give you an example of it. We have legal approvals that need to get made and these legal approvals on content claims have to happen. And I was like, okay, well how do we make sure everyone sticks to the quality SOP that legal wants set for all of the claims we have to have in place? So we created a program called the Secret Shopping Program, and our regulatory legal team go out and they do their own secret shopping once a month and then they report back on any misleading claims or ones that aren't fully understood that Bobbie needs to go back and update. But having a secret shopping meeting is very different to potentially coming in and listening to legal report out in your claims mishaps.\nLenny (00:33:59):\nSpeaking of legal mishaps and copy nuances, one of my favorite memories of you is I was in San Francisco on Divisadero outside, I think, The Mill, and you were just running by heading somewhere and we started chatting. You were heading, I believe, to the warehouse that you're manufacturing the early versions of Bobbie, and apparently the FDA showed up and shut you down because of some misleading communication in the news, as you're launching. I'd love to hear that story because I love it.\nLaura Modi (00:34:26):\nBy the way, how you just transitioned from one example I just gave to that was absolutely exceptional, speaking of content mishaps.\nLenny (00:34:40):\nI appreciate that.\nLaura Modi (00:34:42):\nThis is why you're such a good podcast host, Lenny.\nLenny (00:34:44):\nYou're so kind.\nLaura Modi (00:34:44):\nYou're so good.\nLenny (00:34:45):\nThank you, Laura.\nLaura Modi (00:34:46):\nOh, my god, that moment. I do remember bumping into you. I was in an identity crisis. Yeah, early days. I think the one big learning I've had is that when you're in an industry where you are disrupting, I mean truly disrupting the status quo, you're going to be met with some reactions, people, or in our case government agencies who aren't happy about what you're doing. It was early days, we just launched a pilot and the FDA showed up at our warehouse and they didn't like the way that we were labeling the product. We had to pull all of our product from the market, we had to relabel everything and we had to work with the agency for another year before we could bring our products back. For startup world, that was a huge, I wouldn't even say it was a pivot, it was a patient pause, thinking sure that we could get back on track and build intentions with the FDA again.\nLenny (00:35:45):\nAnother example of slowth, maybe.\nLaura Modi (00:35:47):\nAnother example of slowth, yes.\nLenny (00:35:49):\nHow did you personally stay motivated and keep morale up within the company during that period?\nLaura Modi (00:35:55):\nWell, I found out I was pregnant with my third child right after.\nLenny (00:35:59):\nSuper.\nLaura Modi (00:36:01):\nThere's something about also growing your personal life while professionally it's happening. There's a little bit of give and take as well. So sometimes in moment of professional slowth, you might find that there's personal growth. That's exactly what I found. So I mean, yeah, during this journey I went on from being inspired by my first kid where I wasn't able to breastfeed and then had two more along the journey. And I don't know, I've actually never spoken about this, but I do think there's a beautiful marriage in that personal and professional growth that you can have and you kind of need to find moments where you lean into one and maybe the other. And then there's moments, like I kind of feel like I'm going through right now, where both of them are just on fire and you can't slow them down.\nLenny (00:36:44):\nIt might be a good time to chat about that. So you have this fast-growing business, you have three kids. Your partner is also a founder, also very busy. How do you manage all of these things?\nLaura Modi (00:36:59):\nThat question is actually probably the most common question I get from new founders, those that are aspiring entrepreneurs, on just like how do you do it all? I mean, a lot of it's your infrastructure, it's your... Actually, hold on a second. I'm going to do something I don't think you've done on a podcast before. Hold on. This is my EA. I'm going to pull this woman in. Everyone just needs to say hi to Kendra. This woman.\nLenny (00:37:25):\nHi, Kendra.\nLaura Modi (00:37:28):\nI'm introducing her because the power of a support system to be able to do what you do, I mean, you are an extension, my leverage, my everything. And never leave.\nKendra (00:37:42):\nI'm not going anywhere.\nLaura Modi (00:37:43):\nI'd be so screwed. And everyone should not only know the power and leverage of their person, but the level of appreciation and celebration you need to have for them is just huge.\nKendra (00:37:56):\nI always feel celebrated, so thank you. I appreciate it.\nLenny (00:37:59):\nHow do people find a Kendra of their own? That's the million-dollar question.\nLaura Modi (00:38:02):\nWell, first, you don't take this one. This is a poach-free podcast.\nLenny (00:38:02):\nHer name Lauren, not-\nLaura Modi (00:38:10):\nYes, that's right.\nKendra (00:38:11):\nWe should have code names.\nLaura Modi (00:38:12):\nThere's no last names here. How do you find your Kendra? I will say it took multiple interviews and it's all about chemistry. I think it's about chemistry and finding somebody that you genuinely care about. I genuinely care about you, your heart, your kids, your family, and I think finding that connection is really important.\nKendra (00:38:36):\nYeah.\nLaura Modi (00:38:37):\nYeah. You know what's also funny, too, I think there's this feeling, and I would hear this from folks, how do you do it all? And I think we also just need to be very transparent. It takes a lot of work to do it all. I, as an operator, am very proud of the infrastructure I have built. I mean, we have calendars on our walls, we have calendars for our kids. We have back and forth birthday planning. It's additional help in the house. My nanny is the other extension in our house.\n(00:39:10):\nI mean, I don't know what we would do without Clifford. He is everything for us and I also have to see him as an extension to our parenting. But that is, I think, the only way to get through the chaos and the only way to embrace the all, is you actually need to put in the work to build the infrastructure, the systems, the frameworks, and then every month, or sometimes in our case on a weekly basis, me and my husband, we have a meeting every Sunday and it's walking through the agendas. Who's going to what TaeKwonDo classes this week? Or who's trading off on birthday parties or parent-teacher meetings. Because you're right, a dual CEO-founder household and three kids, it will age you fast if you don't have it.\nLenny (00:39:58):\nIt also makes me think a little bit about what you talked about earlier where, when things slow down a little bit in the business, there's an opportunity to lean into that part of life and then kind of get ahead on some stuff, in theory.\nLaura Modi (00:40:09):\nTotally, totally.\nLenny (00:40:11):\nIn terms of the business, I imagine you never started a D2C business before this. Also, you mentioned you've never formulated a baby formula prior to this. Clearly, it's working out. What's a lesson there of just doing something you've never done? Is that something you imagined is a good idea? Maybe looking back, maybe it doesn't matter. What have you learned about just this idea of doing something totally new and different?\nLaura Modi (00:40:34):\nI think one of the biggest beliefs is that an ounce of naivety will be your biggest secret to success. And I think the word even naivety sometimes gets a bad rap, but naivety is the definition of creativity and innovation and canvas and white space and opportunity. And I definitely went into starting this company with a level of naivety to how regulated it was, to the stigma associated with it, to how hard it would be. But that has allowed me to continue to look at the status quo differently.\n(00:41:15):\nI don't, because I don't fully understand it, and I have applied those same principles even into how I hire people because I do think... I'm now wondering who's going to watch this on my team, because obviously we have some specialists, but this is generalists who make the world go round. I think sometimes putting the most unlikely people who have an ounce of naivety to what it takes to win and succeed are the ones that are going to drive the biggest impact.\nLenny (00:41:45):\nI love that. And it makes me think of a couple of things that I'll just share real quick. One is I was listening to an interview with Mr. Beast who is the number one YouTube creator on TikTok. I think he's got the biggest TikTok, and he talked about how he's got this business he's building, which is like a new way of creating content. And anytime he hires someone from a traditional Hollywood movie-making established kind of background, he's like, \"They know what they're doing. They're going to help me legitimize this thing, make it scale.\" He's like, \"Every time, they never work out. They just don't see what we're doing here. They don't understand how this is different and they just slow everything down.\" And he finds just finding really young, hungry, hardworking people that can learn and understand what he's done end up working a lot better.\nLaura Modi (00:42:27):\nAlways.\nLenny (00:42:28):\nThe other interesting insight is I'm doing a series right now on B2B businesses and how the biggest B2B companies started and so far I'm finding 70% of the founders had no specific background or skill in the area. They went in to say it's security or sales or something like that. So there's a lot of examples of this.\nLaura Modi (00:42:48):\nI'll give you one example of someone who's in C who's just an absolute rockstar. Our girl who leads marketing is an Emmy Award news anchor. She's not your traditional marketer. She came in asking me to... She was like, \"What does CAC mean? Do we need to look at this LTV number?\" And the reason I wanted her in C was because she was the complete antithesis to what we would normally define as a good performance marketer. I wanted someone in C who got media, who got brand and storytelling, and she operates like a news anchor. And in many ways I would look to the team that she's built and think that we maybe have more of a media company than we do a marketing team. And that has been the fuel for the brand that you see today, 100%. And then you hire, unlike the people in those positions and especially senior positions, they're going to do exactly the same throughout the business as well.\nLenny (00:43:53):\nThat is really interesting. It makes me think of Airbnb a bit. Also, the browser company. We had the founder of that company on here and they have a storytelling team within their company. Their job is tell the story.\nLaura Modi (00:44:01):\nI love that.\nLenny (00:44:03):\nSo you talked about how you're hiring people that aren't necessarily deep in a specific skill that you need them to do. What is it that you look for instead that you think is important for them to figure out what they need to be doing?\nLaura Modi (00:44:15):\nCuriosity. A lot of curiosity and just openness to what's out there. I definitely look for people who have the ability to make decisions and move fast and not get worried about the outcome. That is the biggest learning in a startup. The secret is momentum and just keeping momentum. And if we try and perfect everything, you just miss the boat. And I believe that, what's the common saying, perfect is the enemy of good, or something.\nLenny (00:44:52):\nYeah, I think that's the one.\nLaura Modi (00:44:54):\nI mean, it really is. So I look for people who just want to do it, just get it done. Again, part of that is just rolling up your sleeves and not questioning your job. When I find in interviews and people are really questioning the lanes they're going to be in and the job they're going to do, or \"I don't do that.\" That's saying, \"I don't do that.\" A huge flag. You do do it. If you're joining this company, if you're within a certain work stream or a certain department and you're behind what the company's working on, in many ways we need people who do do that. So I look for just optimistic doers.\nLenny (00:45:32):\nI love that. That's such a cool phrase of how to simplify it, what you want to hire and just optimistic doers. There's so many people that have big ideas and pontificate strategy, and you just need people doing the thing.\nLaura Modi (00:45:44):\n100%. I call it intellectual ejaculation, which, if that's not allowed of the podcast, [inaudible 00:45:52] totally wiped.\nLenny (00:45:52):\nThat's allowed. I'll allow it.\nLaura Modi (00:45:55):\nThank you.\nLenny (00:45:57):\nOkay, so you're talking about momentum. I want to talk about growth. A lot of this podcast is about growth strategy, how companies grow. You're building a D2C company. D2C is really hard. There's been so many attempts. Most fail, most people can't figure out how to do it scalably. So many challenges. What have you learned about growing D2C company? What's worked well for you?\nLaura Modi (00:46:17):\nThis narrative of D2C isn't working, or D2C is over, D2C is dead. It kills me. Because we're being way too reductionist in that message. D2C isn't dead. Just the approach for how people did D2C is a bit dated. We should not be paying for every customer and we should be very careful that people aren't getting hooked on the drug that is paid marketing or performance marketing. And I think that drug, and then obviously as we start to see changes on the way certain performance works, it just becomes more expensive and people are resetting how they do performance marketing. The short of it is D2C is not dead. How you drive people to D2C, how you acquire customers, how you build sustainable businesses, that needs to change.\nLenny (00:47:14):\nAnd what is it that you've done that allows you to do that? I imagine a lot of it is word-of-mouth, which everyone always wants. \"How do we do more word-of-mouth?\" So what's worked? How do you do that?\nLaura Modi (00:47:24):\nWell, I mean, the three major pieces of it is that the focus on commerce, content and community.\nLenny (00:47:30):\nCommerce, content and community.\nLaura Modi (00:47:33):\nSo commerce, content and community. But most D2C businesses have put commerce at the top of their list. We flipped it. It's now content, community and commerce, and building good content that is really smart SEO, that has the ability to drive people back to your site to be able to build you as a thought leader. That's really hard and it takes a lot of work. As an example, five years ago we started a platform called Milk Drunk, separate to Bobbie. Milk Drunk Blog. And the reason why we started it is because we realize that there was a dearth of education in the world of formula out there.\n(00:48:15):\nAnd what people were really looking for was good recommendations, usability charts, how to make formula, how long does formula last? So we wanted to become the content leaders in that, with the hypothesis, and it's holding true five years later, with the hypothesis that if we win on content and as a thought leader, that will drive back to Bobbie. And today I'm going to give you a totally random example. If you do a cursory Google search for something like \"How long does formula last?\" Milk Drunk is showing up between the CDC and the bum on the first page of Google? That SEO work and that content building and thought leadership and credibility does take a lot of work. And in the meantime, I've had to squat away requests to put another 100,000, another 300,000 every month into paid marketing because the moment that drug starts, it's very easy to keep it going.\nLenny (00:49:15):\nI think Airbnb is a great example of that. During COVID, they shut down paid growth and I think they've turned it on, but it's a tiny component, which is really unusual and really rare, where you have paid growth, you're sending tons of money, Facebook, and then you stop. It's so hard to stop because growth slows and no one ever wants to do that. And it's interesting, coming back to using a crisis as an opportunity, Airbnb use that as an opportunity to get off that drug.\nLaura Modi (00:49:40):\nThat's right. Yeah.\nLenny (00:49:42):\nIf you think about the pie chart of what helps Bobbie grow, how much of it would you say is just like make an awesome product that people talk about with other moms and it spreads like that, versus SEO and content and paid?\nLaura Modi (00:49:55):\n60% of it is your product and the package around the product, which is your brand. So even if you did nothing to market your brand, your product and brand is 60% of it. And then the last 40% is how do you get the word out there? How do you ensure the word-of-mouth, mom begets mom? That has to happen. That flywheel will only happen if they're able to look at a product that they fully believe in and a brand that speaks to them. And without that, you're going to be a fast-fashion company, which is also my worst nightmare, the fear that people get distracted by the 40% and the 60% actually is just mediocre.\nLenny (00:50:43):\nSomething I wasn't planning to ask, but I thought it'd be interesting and we can cut this if it's not interesting, is Emily Oster, she's one of the, I think, pioneers of breastfeeding is not as great as people say necessarily. Has that been really important to Bobbie in this industry? What do you think of Emily Oster? I'm a huge fan, so I hope you're also a big fan.\nLaura Modi (00:51:01):\nWe are massive fans of Emily and Emily's a massive fan of Bobbie. She is my idol. She's the one who got me through my first year of pregnancy and then beyond. She has been a really, really important voice. And actually she has kind of set the stage for the power of data to bust myths. I mean, just like you said, she's come out and said, \"There is no study, no study at all out there that you can point to that can qualify why breastfeeding is better.\" And to have an economist, a professor, come out and to be able to underscore that and point to where that is the case and why it is the case. I mean, it's so much better than a company. To be fair, companies are brands coming out trying to say that. So I am acutely aware that, as a business and as a brand, sometimes we need to bring in other credible voices. And my God, Emily is one of those.\nLenny (00:52:05):\nI love it. Okay, great. I'm glad. I'm glad you love her. I've been reading all our books. I think I just read that section.\nLaura Modi (00:52:11):\nYou read her books. I love it. You're not a dad yet, you'll like all of them, Family Firm.\nLenny (00:52:14):\nOkay, the first two. The first two. Cribsheet. I'll stop there, I think. And I was actually just reading the breastfeeding section and it's funny, one of the only remaining benefits of breastfeeding is less cow farts and creating methane. Unrelated to your child, there's a cow component.\nLaura Modi (00:52:32):\nWe do want to cut down on the farts.\nLenny (00:52:35):\nWe do. We do. Not what I thought of when I thought of why should I go with formula or not. Maybe just zooming out a little bit and to kind of close, are there any other lessons that you've learned along this journey about building a company, hiring, team building, anything along those lines? Creating urgency, creating momentum?\nLaura Modi (00:52:56):\nI mean, momentum. Momentum really is it. We did this a good bit at Airbnb too. I think as a founder and as a CEO or for any leader out there, your job is not just to keep people going on momentum. Your job is to make momentum. And sometimes that momentum has to be manufactured. And that has been one of my biggest lessons on just how, as leaders and people starting companies, how do you force yourself? And sometimes when it's early on, you're actually just doing it to yourself, creating manufactured deadlines and launch dates.\n(00:53:36):\nThe amount of times people say to me, \"Why are we launching this May 1st?\" And I'm like, \"Just because we said it. Because if we don't do it now, we may never do it.\" It was something we were talking about the last day on just how important it is to look at the fuel that keeps you going and how you have to kind of force those milestones to get you there. So yeah, I would say manufacture yourself some momentum.\nLenny (00:54:00):\nI so agree with that. One of my favorite things and one of our former colleagues, Vanessa, taught me this, which is just like, \"Let's all set an arbitrary deadline right now.\" And just make it clear, this is just arbitrary, but it's useful.\nLaura Modi (00:54:13):\nIt's so true.\nLenny (00:54:15):\nWell, with that, Laura, we've reached our very exciting lightning round.\nLaura Modi (00:54:18):\nWho?\nLenny (00:54:19):\nI don't know if I told you this was coming, but it is. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready for exciting lightning round?\nLaura Modi (00:54:26):\nI think I am. Let's do it.\nLenny (00:54:27):\nOkay, let's do it. What are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\nLaura Modi (00:54:33):\nOne recently, Great by Choice, the author of From Good to Great, amazing.\nLenny (00:54:40):\nJim Collins?\nLaura Modi (00:54:40):\nSome really, really good frameworks. Yes, that's right. Really good frameworks in there. Metabolical, very specific into the world of health, healthcare. Actually, very specifically the takeaway of Metabolical is we don't have a healthcare crisis in this country, we have a health crisis. And it really makes you think about the source, food and how we live our lives. It's amazing. And then I think you a really good traditional one, going back to just brand and for people who are really just looking for a good foundation, I love Purple Cow.\nLenny (00:55:13):\nI love that. I think I have it in my back around here.\nLaura Modi (00:55:15):\nYou do?\nLenny (00:55:15):\nThere it is, yeah. Tiny little book. It's so cute.\nLaura Modi (00:55:18):\nThat is so good.\nLenny (00:55:20):\nYeah. Also, we could mention Emily Oster's book, Laura, Expecting Better.\nLaura Modi (00:55:23):\nI mean, we should. Expecting Better is a good classic.\nLenny (00:55:27):\nYour list is reminding me of a new book by Peter Attia, that I don't know if you've seen, called Outlive, I think it's called. It's about longevity and how to live longer and all the latest sciences and how to live a longer life. But anyway, that's my answer and I'm asking you questions, so let's move on to the next question. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\nLaura Modi (00:55:44):\nBad Sisters. Do you have bad sisters?\nLenny (00:55:47):\nNo.\nLaura Modi (00:55:48):\nAbout a group of Irish sisters getting up to trouble. Highly recommended.\nLenny (00:55:53):\nAmazing. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask when you're hiring people?\nLaura Modi (00:55:57):\nTeach me something. Actually, we just talked about that today. Teach me something. Yeah. I love getting someone to, not related to work, not related to their job, something in your life, something you find interesting, just teach me about it.\nLenny (00:56:11):\nWhat is it that you look for in their answer that gives you a sense that they're someone that you want to hire?\nLaura Modi (00:56:16):\nCreative, but also just their ability to explain something, and it is a huge indicator. I mean, I'll never forget one guy teaching me how to cook the perfect steak, and now every time I cook a steak, I go back to the way he described it, to someone being able to teach me the foundation of Latin. But if someone's unable to take one thing that they find is core to who they are and what they've done or what they understand and their inability to explain that to you, they may struggle.\nLenny (00:56:49):\nI want to learn how to cook a perfect steak. I'm going to have to interview you at some point and ask you about that. What's a favorite product you've recently discovered that you love? And especially if it's a baby product, that'll be bonus.\nLaura Modi (00:57:01):\nI mean, yeah, I think Frida Baby's amazing, the nose sucker.\nLenny (00:57:06):\nOkay, great. The nose sucker.\nLaura Modi (00:57:08):\nActually, no. Sorry, the nose sucker. That's terrible. It's the snot sucker.\nLenny (00:57:13):\nOkay, great.\nLaura Modi (00:57:13):\nAs a new parent, you really, really need this, Lenny. Your poor little boy is going to get blocked up and you're going to want to get out that sucker and suck on it-\nLenny (00:57:23):\nOh, dear.\nLaura Modi (00:57:23):\n... and get it out. I can see you quickly looking for the next question. Move away from the snot sucker.\nLenny (00:57:30):\nNo, this is great.\nLaura Modi (00:57:31):\nSo I'll leave you with that.\nLenny (00:57:33):\nPerfect. We'll just call the episode The Snot Sucker. So many options. Okay, next question. What's something relatively minor that you've changed in the way that you build/ship product that was minor but had a tremendous impact on your team's ability to execute and ship?\nLaura Modi (00:57:51):\nMore recently, async work. Moving away from meeting culture and being able to be in a position where we can work async, whether it's one-hour sprint over Slack, make decisions and go back and forth, 20 people, and then everyone's made a decision by the end of the hour and we're moving forward.\nLenny (00:58:12):\nIs there a tool that helps you do that or is it just in Slack? \"Here's the question we're trying to answer,\" and everyone-\nLaura Modi (00:58:16):\nYou know what? Every so often we try and introduce tools and then it's like we've over-processed this entire thing, when what we really just need to do is all just get our head into the moment we're in and brand it and get it done. So even though I think we've introduced some tools, I know we use some video ones as well. I'm a little bit removed sometimes from everyone working through these tools, but I'm in the Slack world the most.\nLenny (00:58:40):\nFinal question, what is your best advice for a soon-to-be parent, aka, me?\nLaura Modi (00:58:45):\nHire a sitter who you love that you want to have on board every Thursday night and keep your date night with Michelle, whatever your date night is, and just don't worry about the price because the date is worth it, but just lock it in and do it.\nLenny (00:59:03):\nWe actually have a date night currently with another couple who has two kids, and so we could just maintain that. How early do you hire a sitter to do that, in their age?\nLaura Modi (00:59:13):\nSecond week.\nLenny (00:59:14):\nSecond week. Okay, great. Not first week.\nLaura Modi (00:59:16):\nOkay. Maybe second month. It totally depends on how you guys are feeling.\nLenny (00:59:23):\nNo. Okay, that early.\nLaura Modi (00:59:24):\nThat depends on how she's feeling, but I would say sometimes you just need to rip the bandaid and you need to go for it, even if it means the two of you are just going out for a quick meal and you're coming back, keep your date night.\nLenny (00:59:33):\nLaura, this was as fun and insightful as I expected. I'm going to go try some Bobbie, I'm going to go by snot suckers. Thank you so much for spending time here. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out, learn more, learn more about Bobbie, potentially, and how can listeners be useful to you?\nLaura Modi (00:59:51):\nOkay. Well, the first thing I'm going to say, how listeners can be useful. I am hiring a growth product manager right now and we are really focused on optimization. So now I'm moving away from everything I just said and I want a specialist who's really good at growth optimization. And how folks can find us, our website is hibobbie, H-I bobbie, B-O-B-B-I-E.com. And if folks just want to reach out to me, I would highly recommend just sending me an email, Laura@hibobbie.com.\nLenny (01:00:20):\nAnd for the hiring position, how do they go apply for that and learn more about it?\nLaura Modi (01:00:24):\nGreat question. I'm assuming it's on our careers page on the website.\nLenny (01:00:27):\nGreat. We'll make sure it's there before this all goes out.\nLaura Modi (01:00:29):\nAmazing.\nLenny (01:00:30):\nLaura, this is amazing. Thank you so much for being here.\nLaura Modi (01:00:33):\nIt's such a pleasure, Lenny. This is so fun.\nLenny (01:00:35):\nIt's my pleasure. And goodbye, everyone.\nLaura Modi (01:00:37):\nBye.\nLenny (01:00:41):\nThank you so much for listening.

And by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something on. I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the silent flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, \"Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting.\" And I was totally geared up thinking about written, started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. An improved conversion by like 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, \"What? Okay, what is going on here?\"\n\nLenny (00:00:50):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to learn from their hard one experiences building and growing today's most successful products. Today my guest is Laura Schaffer. The week we recorded this chat turned out to be Laura's first week in a new gig as head of growth for Amplitude taking over for a previous legendary guest, Elena Verna. Prior to Amplitude, Laura was VP of product and growth at a company called Rapid. Before that, she spent over seven years at Twilio as Head of Growth and PM lead of the growth platform and experimentation platform at Twilio. In our conversation, we dig into Laura's career growth framework and the importance of carving your own path versus waiting for one to be carved for you. We also get into a bunch of tactical and surprising advice around running experiments, making decisions on gut versus data, developing your growth strategy and how to sell your product to developers. Laura has a wealth of wisdom and I learned a lot from our conversation. With that, I bring you Laura Schaffer after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(00:01:55):\nThis episode is brought to you by public.com who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts, which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account, while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year-high. But buying US treasuries is super complicated. If you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash and the US treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account. You can access your cash whenever you want, even before your treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days. Just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield. And you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8% a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a treasury count at public.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:02):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation AB testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to waste of time building internal tools. We're trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue You discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click through metrics and instead you turn north star metrics like activation, retention, subscriptions and payments. An Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end e-mail marketing and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10 x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:04:15):\nLaura, welcome to the podcast.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:04:18):\nThanks, Lenny, it is so great to be here. Thanks for having me.\n\nLenny (00:04:21):\nIt's great to have you. So I asked Elena Elena, Elena, I'm not even sure how to pronounce her name, maybe. What is it?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:04:21):\nElena. You got it.\n\nLenny (00:04:27):\nElena. Okay. Okay. I think I've said it wrong all the time. All this time. Okay, Elena. So I asked Elena Ferna, who's a popular guest on this podcast who I should have on this podcast and you are the first person that immediately came to mind. And so I'm really excited that we're doing this and that you agreed to be on.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:04:42):\nWell, she's the best and I'm really happy that she referred me because I'm just stoked to be here. So thanks for listening to her guidance.\n\nLenny (00:04:50):\nAbsolutely. And it's a cool time to be chatting. You're the newly minted head of growth at Amplitude and so congrats, first of all.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:04:57):\nThank you. Appreciate that. Yeah, this is my day two and a half here. So very [inaudible 00:05:04].\n\nLenny (00:05:06):\nWow, you're a veteran.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:05:06):\nYeah, right.\n\nLenny (00:05:06):\nI love it. Some companies, there's a little percentage of that shows you how many people have joined before you and I wonder what that percentage already is [inaudible 00:05:12].\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:05:12):\nWe had that in Twilio and I got pretty, pretty high up there after a while. We had a stack rank and a spreadsheet. Yeah, but it is funny. So wherever that thing exists in Amplitude, I am right fresh there at the very bottom.\n\nLenny (00:05:25):\nSo what was the number you got to Twilio? Any, do you remember?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:05:28):\nYeah, no, I was very proud to crack the top 50. That was my claim the same because as people left, you move up. Right?\n\nLenny (00:05:36):\nRight. Yeah, it's bittersweet.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:05:39):\nWell, yeah, right. On one hand it's like, \"Ooh, very cool.\" And one of the OGs on the other hand, it's like, \"Oh my gosh, this person's [inaudible 00:05:47]. Bummer.\" It's a shift, but I'm excited about it for sure.\n\nLenny (00:05:51):\nSo you have this new exciting role and I thought it'd be fun to start to chat about career growth and just how you think about career growth. I know you have a framework of how you think about your own career growth and clearly it's worked out, so I'm curious to hear about it and see how it could be helpful to folks that are listening. So yeah, can you just tell us about how you think about career growth?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:06:11):\nCareer growth is definitely not a straight lineup, but there's definitely some frameworks and methods that have worked really well for me. And I think to dive into it, it's first good to just talk about the one that I most typically see people use to try to grow their career and why that can be a little problematic, which is that I see most people try to work really hard the job that they have within the role that they have at a company. Do whatever you can to grow there, show your manager all these things. I see people keep spreadsheets, it wins. So it can come up with performance reviews. Maybe you try to get better advocating for yourself, maybe try to get peers to notice or your manager's peers. And that's all good. It's all stuff.\n\n(00:06:52):\nBut the problem with it is that you're limited to what your manager's ability is to advocate for you, to promote you. And you're also limited by the explicit trajectory of your role at that company and where the there's room for that or not at the company. And then often that perception can sometimes be a little bit in contrast to what your perception is. And also other things that happen, your manager leaves and then you have to restart with someone else. So the method that I use tries to take that power back a little bit. And something that I learned really early on in my career, I was very lucky to learn by accident, was at a company called Bandwidth, which is my first real job. And Bandwidth is now a public company and they've done all kinds of crazy amazing things.\n\n(00:07:38):\nBut I joined when it was just 50 people and I actually joined in sales and I was just hungry to make it succeed and grow and bright eyes and everything, first real job. But I realized after a few months of being in sales that I was often repeating the same thing over again, using the same thing to sell over and over again. And it's like, gosh, this isn't ideal for the customer because [inaudible 00:08:04] call me and ask these questions and get these answers and all this stuff. And it's not ideal for the company because they're paying commission on this every time. That's not going to be efficient for our growth. And because we were small, I was able to catch our GM and I was just like, \"Hey, I've noticed this pattern where I'm repeating things over and over again and they're asking the same thing.\n\n(00:08:29):\nI think we should put that online. I think we should make that available so they can just see it and then buy it,\" because we had an online checkout process. And I was expecting him to be like, \"Oh, well, I know it's important but for this [inaudible 00:08:46] another, we need to do it this way, and obviously you've thought all about it.\" And thinking, \"Oh, I'm going to come in this new person, he's just going to help me understand what I'm missing here.\" There's a little bit of that that I was expecting. And he goes, \"Wait a minute, tell me more about that. What do you mean?\" And by the end of the conversation he was like, \"Hey, why don't you go do that? Why don't you go build that experience? Why don't you put that stuff in a self-serve flow?\"\n\n(00:09:06):\nAnd we called it e-commerce manager and it was like got a growth before this growth, this is like 2010. And that moved me into a totally new position. And the main learning that I had from that was, which really took life at Twilio and absolutely worked for me there and I'm happy to talk about that too. But the core that learning was, your executive team and executive teams at companies are often very sharp, but the nature of their day-to-day just does not link them with customers.\n\n(00:09:34):\nAnd that means that over time, especially as a company grows, they often lose access to some of the best insights and in the heartbeat of the people who they're providing value to in contrast to folks that are closer to the problem. And so that means that your superpower is in really pulling those insights in and bringing them to life, staying close to the customer. There's not a single leader or executive that isn't going to be stoked to hear about valuable customer insights that highlight problems they might not be seeing. And there's a lot of those. So especially when they align to North Star metrics, those ones are the powerful ones. That was the way that I grew my career at Phil and I'm happy to share that journey too.\n\nLenny (00:10:18):\nYeah, it'd actually be cool to hear maybe another example of that. But I think an interesting thing that comes up for me here is sometimes you may have an awesome idea and it may not immediately happen. It may not be like, yes or let's move on, that's right, immediately. And I think it's important to just recognize they're not going to follow all your ideas, but they're always looking for better ideas. And to your point, they may not have the information that will lead to an idea that you will have because you're on the ground dealing with real problems, day-to-day. So I think it's important to recognize you're not going to always get your way and that's normal.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:10:52):\nYeah, totally. And it's almost like building up your individual brand a little bit. And I think one of the most powerful and accessible ways is learning about your customers. There's always those people at companies who's like, \"Oh, well, she just knows our customers or he just knows our customers, they just know our customers. They just know.\" And it's like, \"Well, how?\" \"They just know. Let's ask that person. Let's get their feedback.\" And those people often have a good amount of brand recognition of powers within the company and they're often thought of when the company needs to do something new or different or if someone is hiring, maybe they're thinking about that person for a cross team thing.\n\n(00:11:31):\nSo it's one of the ways that you can build that brand. And again, I think it's a sweet spot because it's something that is very valuable to everyone, all the way up to the most senior leaders, which we can talk about here in a minute. And so it's going to be valuable for you in a valuable tool no matter where you're at in your career. And that's not always an immediate payoff, but it often does give you a trajectory outside of just your role and just your manager. It gives you something a little bit broader.\n\nLenny (00:12:05):\nSo maybe a simple way of describing to mirror back what you're saying is carve your own path. Don't necessarily assume your managers will give you the path that makes most sense for you or even give you the biggest opportunity. Just propose, \"Hey, I think this might be a better opportunity and I'd love to pursue it.\" I'd love to hear the Twilio example if that's generally-\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:12:25):\nYeah. So when I joined Twilio, there was no growth team at all, not even a breath of it. I joined in product marketing and I was leading our product marketing for our messaging lines, but I followed the same guy that I just mentioned. I made it my own personal policy to like, hey, I'm going to do my job. And I'm going to do well, I'm going to keep notes of things I'm doing well and all that stuff because it's good, but I'm also going to get to know our customers. And I'm going to get to know our customers really well and I'm going to pay attention when I'm connecting with them, not just about the space I'm in, but just broadly what are some of the pain points and things they're articulating that are relevant to the business and what we're trying to get done.\n\n(00:13:00):\nAnd one of the things that came up was that users were struggling and folks were struggling to get started and use Twilio. And that contrasted so deeply to some of the things that our executive team was saying and had high conviction in our company had high conviction, which is that Twilio was so easy to use. In fact, it was top three things about Twilio that we were really trying to get out of their brand. Were so easy. Developers love us, they say we're so easy. And there were tweets coming all the time, developers saying like, \"Oh my gosh, they got started in a couple of minutes.\" So there's all these things that made that compound and made that conviction stick. But as I was talking to customers, I was hearing a very different story and it made sense as we were penetrating new markets, adding more products, we were adding complexity and we were pulling in folks who were a little bit less motivated and those things contributed to people saying this is difficult.\n\n(00:13:55):\nAnd so at the time, this wasn't a 50 person in where I could just go to the floor and go to someone and be like, \"Hey, there's this thing I heard about, I think we should do something.\" But there was another tactic that I could take, and I just started sharing a voice of the customer report. I started sharing my insights, started writing down and just sharing them. And it became with digest and eventually people were like, \"Hey, can you share it with me? Can you share with me? Can you get on your list? Can share with me?\" And this was in a few months of me joining, I was doing this. And then that turned into, \"Hey, you should host a quarterly voice to the customer session or for all of product.\" And this was a request that was coming from some of the senior leaders at the company.\n\n(00:14:33):\nAnd when our Jeff Lawson is our CEO at the time heard about, he started attending too. So now in the session I started pulling in other people's insights too, because now they had a forum for this. I could do that and have people send that to me and I could compile it and all of these things. So then this established me as that person who knows about the customer even after short tenure. And then when came time to do annual planning that year, and I joined in 2014 at the end, so this is 2015, I pitched this idea, \"Hey, we think that it's easy. It is not. Here's data that I have, the information that I have and I think that we need to start a growth team here and that needs to be a core focus.\" And I was able to bring in a really critical partner to that and other folks who could support that because I had built up some of that trust.\n\n(00:15:28):\nSo by the time I was making that pitch, I had someone on Andre Crow who was the seventh hire at Twilio and got to number three on that spreadsheet or whatever who was really close to the CEO being like, \"Yeah, we desperately need this.\" I'm seeing this. He led a website, he basically created the Twilio brand and he led all the website stuff and he is like, \"Yeah, we definitely need this.\" So not only did I have that little bit of trust from the executive team, but I also had folks who were just trusted on their own advocating and supporting this that I was doing. And so it was approved just almost very easily. I put stuff together for it, but it was the meeting before the meeting had already been done by this other thing. So it helped me create the growth engineering, growth product team at Twilio.\n\nLenny (00:16:14):\nI love just how proactive your advice is here. There's a lot of people that don't do well and then just like, \"Oh, I never had the opportunity or I kept got looked over all this time.\" And I love that there's all this just like, here's things you can be doing to get in front of people to provide value, to just create opportunity for yourself. Any other advice along the lines of just like, here's the things you could do for yourself versus waiting for someone to come and give you opportunity?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:16:42):\nYeah, I think that's the most easily actual because to do all of our jobs, we need to know customers, we need to know about customer insights, product, we need to know. But then also customer facing teams, social, those want to crack into product. Your insights are extremely valuable. You're talking to customers every day more about their problems and their pain than a lot of other people do. And so that is by far and away to me the most powerful and accessible by anyone in any role in any space. But I'll also say that that broader concept of just, hey, there's things that, and things of value that you know that others can benefit from at your company and building your brand as someone that is supportive, smart, creative, able to solve problems, make sure that you're sharing that. And so maybe you're really freaking good at communicating with brevity.\n\n(00:17:35):\nI suck at that by the way. So more powered anyone that can do that, I'm actively working on it. So share that. Go to your general Slack channel or whatever and just be like, \"Hey, just wrote some tips for how to do it, some ways that I am good at this.\" And those kinds of things can really go a long way towards people starting to view you as an SME and not just the space that you're in, but in broader areas. And that can always present open doors for you and other people are looking up to you and seeing you, someone who's strong in ways outside of just the role that you're in.\n\nLenny (00:18:07):\nSME is a Subject Matter Expert, is that right?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:18:10):\nYes. Thank you for unpacking my acronyms. That's another thing that I am actively working on.\n\nLenny (00:18:16):\nI got you. I'll be on the lookout.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:18:16):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:18:19):\nMaybe one last question along these lines is do you have any advice for framing the proposal, framing an opportunity to your manager, higher ups that you see has worked best broadly?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:18:34):\nYeah. Yeah. And one thing I want to say too is with this stuff, I don't think that it necessarily does counter to what your manager's doing. It's more supporting them. I've done this stuff and then it's helped my manager promote me. So it's not necessarily, \"Oh, we'll do this if your manager's failing you.\" Or they are not the boarding you or they can't support you. It's more like do this because this is going to be an accelerator for yourself irrespective of your manager.\n\n(00:18:55):\nBut then also it'll be an accelerator for your manager in supporting you because one of the things that comes into play a lot when managers figure out promotions and doing those things is they'll sit in a room, often calibrations and with a bunch of people, and it makes it a lot easier when those people have had some access or exposure or whatever to you in a positive light. So these things can all run with your manager and not against, but it's just another way of you taking back the ability to build that momentum instead of relying on all of that going through one single other person.\n\nLenny (00:19:33):\nAnd what I like about your second example is you just did it. You just started doing that tenant report for the company. It wasn't like, \"Hey, I have a proposal, here's what I think you should do. Should we do it?\"\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:19:42):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:19:42):\nIt's just like, yeah, just do it.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:19:44):\nYeah, ungate your knowledge I think is the buzzword that I'm hearing.\n\nLenny (00:19:52):\nMm. Never heard that.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:19:52):\nI think that's an Elena, see how many times we can bring her up. But you can do that within your own company. Everybody is skilled at things that they aren't explicit to their role or their space. And I think that ungating that opens opportunities. And if you're not sure, then go to my favorite go-to, which is talk to customers, get insights. Those are incredibly valuable. So rarely do people share those when they find them. So be the person that does that.\n\nLenny (00:20:21):\nAnother area I want to chat about is experimentation and growth and data, which makes sense if strong perspectives is on being the new head of growth amplitude. So maybe we start with experimentation. You mentioned that there's a really interesting surprising result in an experiment you ran at Twilio that maybe changed your perspective on experimentation and what you think might work and not work.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:20:45):\nA hundred percent. Yeah, I'm through a fortune of two mind-blowing experiments that really shifted the way that I think about growth. So one of them, one of my favorite ones happened very early on at Twilio. So after I created this growth team, one of the things that I saw as to me an issue was that under signup flow, we just asked people for a username and an e-mail, like a password, and that was it. And that's actually relatively common at the time. This is a while ago now, everybody is [inaudible 00:21:16]. But we didn't, and actually there was a lot of existing conviction around that. I was like, \"Hey, we retarding developers. Developers, they just want to do, they just want to get their hands on things. Don't put anything in their way, it's going to be disastrous. We don't want any shenanigans here with these folks, let's just let them in the gates.\"\n\n(00:21:33):\nBut to me this was a really big assumption to make and a very costly one. It's like, okay, if that's the case, we're not going to know anything about anyone. And we didn't know who was signing up, we didn't know what they wanted to do. And that hurt our ability to understand how people were performing from a quantitative perspective. We were a little bit lost with prioritization. There's a number of implications here, but it's obviously a very contentious space. So this is the very first thing that I did and the first experiment that I ran. I did some research to understand say, okay, what are the most important questions to answer? What would I do really, really need to know? And it was stuff like what language are you coding in, what's your use case? What product you want to use?\n\n(00:22:14):\nAnd then there's one around, are you developer at all or were you use something else? Because there is rumors that we're having, not just developers sign up, which is this whole other interesting story. And I think of these questions that would also potentially be things that our developers signing up would understand why we're asking that it would feel natural. But anyway, again, adding anything to the signup was very contentious, but I really just wanted to get a little bit of data on it. So I wanted to run a test. I didn't have a team, I didn't have an engineering team yet and none of that stuff had built out. It was just me, myself and I. But like I said, I had started to build a little bit of trust and [inaudible 00:22:50], Andre, who I mentioned earlier who, because he was early employee and he had access to everything, one of those people, and he also was supportive of this and had similar haunches.\n\n(00:23:03):\nAnd so like the dead of the night, and by that, I mean 7:00 PM or something, I'm pretty sure it was a Friday. We just asked for forgiveness and put these questions into the signup flow and ran as Navy test with a small group. And I'm fully expecting, \"Okay, this is going to hurt our numbers, but maybe it won't be so bad and I'm going to be prepared to advocate the power of this data that we're getting.\" I was totally thinking with written... Started to write the framework for how I wanted to surface this. And we start to get the data for this thing. I'm not kidding, an improved conversion. There's no personalization, nothing past it, just the questions. It improved conversion by 5%, just improved signups. And it was one of those like, \"What? Okay, what is going on here?\" And I actually dug into it, and what I found from just talking to a few customers once through the flow, I'm just learning about [inaudible 00:24:00] about it.\n\n(00:24:01):\nIt was actually for folks, it was comforting. When you think about it, when users are signing up for your product for the very first time, it's new. This is new, that means it's scary. They're expecting it to be difficult. They're anticipating that there's going to be friction and challenges and that they're not going to figure it out. Almost like looking for the bogeyman. And that's the headspace. It's often the headspace that any of us are in when we're doing something new for the first time like ooh, this could be very challenging. And so by putting in these questions it's like, what's your language? It's like, \"Oh, I do. I code a JavaScript and I can select that.\" Well, that's something I'm uncomfortable with. That would make my journey easier. Like \"Yeah, bingo. That's my use case. Okay, I'm in the right place here.\"\n\n(00:24:51):\nIt was actually giving folks something comforting and challenging the notion that this was going to be difficult, just the questions because it was aligning to some of the things that they were organically thinking about, which is what if they don't support my language? Or can I even do this use case I want to do? And so it was just a really interesting, the takeaway for me for this, the really interest takeaway was the psyche of the user is so, so critical. That's just as important as understanding your product and the broader market you're applying to and all those things. Just the psyche of users, new people doing things for the first time in your user flow, understanding that is powerful. And the simple catchy thing I say is that ultimately the learning here is, bad friction is bad, and good friction is good. There's no such thing as it being simple. It's just all friction is bad, which is what I had assumed going into this.\n\nLenny (00:25:50):\nI love that you were new to Twilio and you just year-load an experiment to production.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:25:55):\nYear-load. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:25:56):\nThat's a big move.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:25:58):\nIt ended up being very helpful for everyone. I shared the insights from it and all these things. I've shared the [inaudible 00:26:05].\n\nLenny (00:26:05):\nAnd [inaudible 00:26:05] conversion.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:26:08):\nBut for sure, use such processes with caution for sure. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:08):\nI love it. It's amazing.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:26:15):\nThat the right way to do [inaudible 00:26:15] advocating for the engineers here is the right way to make any changes in production is through or with the approval of engineering, but it was the right move overall and definitely helped business, so yeah.\n\nLenny (00:26:33):\nYeah, I love it. No, that's great. I like that move. I think we need more of that probably. I want to dig into what you actually... So what is it you changed, you added how many questions and then what were the questions?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:26:37):\nThere was a question around what language are you coding in? And then as an option to that, it was like, \"Oh, I'm actually not coding, I'm not a developer.\" So for us, it actually gave us two really, really interesting data points. One was how many developers versus people who are not coding or in our flow? And then what language of the coding, which was massively helpful not just for growth and onboarding, but our documentation team, dos team. Would that end up being a critical way for us to gauge trends over time and catch things before whatever reports would come out at the end of the year, what people are doing, you start to see it. And then also product. What product are you interested in using? That was very critical for knowing the basics of how to organize someone's onboarding. Are you doing SMS? You're doing voice? To 281 or whatever. And then use case in use cases, you're doing a appointment reminders or are you doing a autoresponder or are you doing anonymous communications for a dating app or something. Right? So those were the very first questions.\n\nLenny (00:27:39):\nWow, okay. So it was four dropdown questions and that increased conversion. I love these examples where friction and increased conversion... There's so few of them. You hear about this could work and it's rare. And so what did you take away? What's the pattern you took from this? There's the idea, it's good friction, but is there something that you're like, what is a sign of this is going to be good friction?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:28:02):\nThere's still alleviated a problem. They alleviated the problem they had where they're coming in and worried that it was going to be difficult or that they weren't going to be able to figure it out, they weren't going to be able to get their footing. And I'd say that that's not unique to Twilio. That's something that I think users experience at any front door, at any company, any signup beginning the signup loads, it's like, \"Here we go, buckle up.\" Especially when it's in a work context and there might be extra pressure on you to succeed or for you to make as an accurate assessment. So I think that psyche of, \"Okay, am I in the right place? Is it's going to do what I need it to do? Can I figure it out? Am I capable?\" These are extremely common things for people to feel when they're signing up.\n\n(00:28:48):\nAnd so certainly, that I think can carry out to any place. I'd encourage absolutely everybody to be putting those experiences within their early onboarding, not just for you selfishly, so you can learn and segment them appropriately, but also so the user can feel more confident as they get going and like, \"Hey, I'm in the right place. This is going to do what I needed to do.\" But I think that the carry over there is just the psyche of the user and just being so aware that it's not so cookie cutter as, \"What is the problem my market experience is and what can my product do to help them?\" There's also this other thing in the room which is so important to people's success, their ability to succeed with your products and your self-serve experiences, which is, what is the mentality and the psyche of the person at the various stages in your journey?\n\n(00:29:37):\nAnd if you're not incorporating that or addressing that, you will absolutely miss things or things will fail and you'll be very confused as to why. We had a great experiment that I'm happy to talk about where same concept, a totally different situation, which is later in onboarding. One of the things that we tried to do over time to make Twilio less complex was to offer steps like, [inaudible 00:30:08] onboarding, welcome step one, here's what you want to build. Great, we all know that now, \"Okay, step one, go do this thing. Step two, go to this thing. Three, this thing. Four, this thing. Five, bam, you're live, congratulations, aha,\" all these things. So we shipped that, got that out there and I was like, yeah, it was improved conversion. It wasn't like that great. It's like, man. We went from there being absolutely nothing, \"Choose you're adventure, figure it out, go figure it out. Good luck.\" To this prescriptive thing. And it wasn't converting [inaudible 00:30:37].\n\n(00:30:38):\nSo to talk to some users and there wasn't anything particularly obvious that was coming out as to what the issue was. It was like, \"Oh yeah, Let's go to step one.\" And we did mock the people. \"Okay, now I know, I do step two.\" But there was one thing that I was hearing that was coming out that feels like something, and that was the telephone number, the telecom part. Developers when they were coming into Twilio, it was things that were familiar to them. APIs, the language they're coding in, code samples, documentation, things like the bogeyman, the things that would psychologically trip them up, telecom, phone numbers. These things that just were completely out of the zone of anything that they'd ever worked with before, especially earlier on in Twilio's journey.\n\n(00:31:28):\nBut even now, right? Telecom's very different beast for most developers. And guess what was step one? Get a phone number because that's step one. Anytime that anyone's trying to teach one to use Twilio one-on-one, always going to sit down, ask and be like, \"Okay, here we're going to go get a phone number and configure it.\" And that's what anyone every time will do. However, in a self-serve experience, when you don't have that safe person sitting next to you being like, \"Don't worry, it's going to be okay, I'm going to take you through this crazy telecom journey.\" They're on their own, but that's psyche telling is them like, \"Oh my god, telecom. Well, I can't do that. That sounds scary. We're getting a phone number configured. Whoa, I'm out of my debt.\"\n\n(00:32:01):\nAnd so what did we do to test this out? Test out whether that was the issue? Actually, and it's first we're in the MVP. They kicked them out of the portal entirely and put them into a docs page where we could manufacture an experience where the first thing they saw was code and they're in the docs safe place, the language that they're coding in and then snuck in there.\n\n(00:32:26):\nIt was like, \"Oh, get a phone number, let's go configure it.\" Not as step one, not as the leading thing, but embedded. And the analogy I have for this is pilling a hot dog. So if anyone's got a dog or an animal you have to feed a pill to, it's like you can't just feed the pill to the animal, it's never going to happen. But if you shove it inside of a hot dog, which looks good and that's exciting, then you can get them to consume it more easily. And so this was-\n\nLenny (00:32:53):\nYeah. We do peanut butter, that's [inaudible 00:32:55].\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:32:55):\nYeah, exactly, right? Yeah, hot hotdog, peanut butter, all that. You bury it. You embed the scary unpleasant thing. And so that's what you said with the phone number stuff, that telecom stuff. And guess what? Even though we're a good amount of the console and they're going off and we had no easy return button, it converted better because we were addressing the big problem that was there at the time, which is their psyche. They were not ready to come in and immediately thrown into a phone number experience. That was letting the bogeyman and out to party and that's not what was going to work. We needed to put that bogeyman pill and the hotdog.\n\n(00:33:31):\nAnd so then once that validated, then we can actually go through the business of putting that into the onboarding float correctly and then that could be even better. But so again, the psyche of your user is such a critical thing to be thinking about. And if something very logical isn't converting well sometimes, it means that you're battling against the psyche of a user and you want to take a step back and think about and learn about where someone is psychologically in your space.\n\nLenny (00:33:59):\nFeels like you had this experiment that was a complete redesign of the onboarding flow and that didn't work. And then your second attempt was a different approach that's like a full onboarding flow. And I'm curious, do you have a take on just when you run experiments? And it's something we dealt with a lot at Airbnb in other places is like, do you just redesign the whole thing or is it better to iteratively work from where you're today and just experiment piece by piece towards some future much better experience?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:34:26):\nHere's what I would say to this is that from a high level, it's always going to be better to be iterative. And the reason that it's better is that roughly 80% of the times, ORs in the time are hypotheses and the things that we believe will be true [inaudible 00:34:42]. And this is amazing. There's an amazing article out there I'm happy to share with you so you can put in the show notes.\n\nLenny (00:34:48):\nYeah, absolutely.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:34:49):\nThat really takes a scientific approach to proving that out. Companies like Netflix and Microsoft, there's over and over again 80 plus percent. Some companies say 90% of things fail. And so the closer you get to something that you go bear your head in the sand or go into an attic and build something for six months and ship it, the more likely it is that you are going to ship the 80% wrong stuff.\n\n(00:35:17):\nWhereas the more iterative you are, the more likely that you're going to catch it sooner. And failure doesn't have to be a wall, it can be a compass, it can be the thing that leads you to the right thing. And so you always want to as best you can, get stuff in front of customers so that you can get that compass and get that compass activated, know where to go.\n\n(00:35:40):\nSo that means doing ugly things. I tell my teams all the time, if it's not embarrassing, you've gone too far. Got to be embarrassing. The first thing, that was embarrassing, kicking people out, onboarding, spend all this money and whatever to get them into your center flow, and then the first thing we do, get out of here. That's nuts. But if it hadn't validated, that would've been a very cheap but very valuable learning. Instead, it was a very powerful cheap learning in the other direction. Okay, now we know we can invest in it. We know that's the right thing to do. So always better to be iterative so that you are letting failure work for you instead of having it be a trap that you fall into.\n\nLenny (00:36:22):\nI know that you just shared as per experiment, you're probably wrong 80% of the time. In my experience, launching a halt redesign is as negative a hundred percent of the time. I've grown weary to avoid that as much as possible, which is like, you know that, you're taught that as you go into growth and product, but you're just like, \"Nah, come on, let's just make it awesome. Just redesign this whole thing.\" Especially your designers is always like, \"No, let's start again. Let's make it amazing.\" But it always ends up being negative and you're like, \"Okay, well, it's too late now we got to launch this thing, we don't have time to start again.\"\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:36:52):\nWell, it's funny, in the articles, and you'll see it was written by somebody from Microsoft who built Implementation platform and did all these cool things, as he went into actually trying to apply a scientific method of figuring out how often people are wrong about their hypotheses and what they're planning to do. He's like, \"I wonder if that applies to us here at Microsoft.\" Even for him, that question of [inaudible 00:37:16]. And I think it's challenging when there's a lot of smart people in this space doing things and it's very difficult to think, \"Gosh, am I really wrong? 80 plus, 90% of the time?\" But when you think about it, makes total sense because what has to happen for something to be successful? You have to understand the problem perfectly. You have to then understand who's having the problem perfectly, the customer. At what time they're having the problem.\n\n(00:37:43):\nThen you've got to put the right solution in front of them to solve that problem. Maybe you've got the problem, all that stuff, but your solution something off. Or maybe your solution is right, but maybe it's just not presented, it communicated in the right way. You could have any one of those things off and it's not going to succeed. It's not going to have the metric impact you're expecting it to have. So in that context, it's almost like incredible. We do succeed 20 to 10% of the time given everything that has to line up. And so I think it's one of those things where you really want to go into it embracing that, \"Okay, this isn't about how smart I am or how good my team is or any of that stuff. It's just the logic of this is challenging to get it right and let's embrace that and let's lean into that knowledge and make it a part of our strategy,\" instead of finding against it.\n\nLenny (00:38:39):\nHave you found anything that helps you increase those odds or is just, this is the way of the world and you probably can't significantly increase the chances your experiment works out?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:38:51):\nSo here's the thing, I think there's very little that we can do to make that space easier. All those things have to be figured out. And so I definitely think that everybody is going to be in a space where their original ideas, untested ideas are going to be around that hit rate. However, the way that you go about validating those can be totally different and you can be very fast about validating those ideas and that's the key. And AB testing is one of the most expensive kinds of ways to validate an experiment. It often requires design and engineering and the PM or growth person or marketing person who's crafting it. All these things are investments that take a lot of time even for simple thing. And then you have the time factor, how long's the thing I have to run to have an impact?\n\n(00:39:47):\nSo all of that is extremely expensive. And so I think the key is to just think through, \"Okay, what are the things I can do to quickly validate what these ideas are that we [inaudible 00:39:59]?\" And you can do that with painted doors, which is where you test rate the concept and the idea before it exists versus the actual experience. You can do mocks. If you've got a designer, create those mocks for that experience, put it in front of people, see how they engage with it. That can be so powerful.\n\n(00:40:16):\nYou could invalidate tons of hypotheses at that state. The only things you want to get to that deep AB testing environment or ones that have been vetted along the way. And that way, you reduce your fail rate, because you're failing faster by using other methods. So I think I more advocate for that side. Let's fail fast by using those tools rather than figuring out a way that you can rise above where everyone else is operating and figure out ways to solve all that complex stuff better because that's going to be challenging, but you can always get better at experimenting and validating things faster.\n\nLenny (00:40:59):\nThis episode is brought to you by Writer.

Is it gut instinct type and experience bucket or is it data telling you like, \"Hey, or here's a huge opportunity,\" in your experience?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:42:15):\nI'm a very data-driven person. I self-describe and think of myself that way. In large part because of that, I feel you have to be constantly checking yourself and data is a really great way to do that. But I definitely think that I would be described as someone who's going more by their gut when looking at date end results just because of the way that I approach it, which is I'm very comfortable and very common in using qualitative responses and things like that and supplement to quantitative data to make a decision and that puts less of a burden on the quantitative to really make an assessment of whether something was working or not.\n\n(00:42:51):\nOne of the things I see, I think sometimes goes against what other folks do, although I'm seeing things shift a little, is that 95% confidence rate. My background in college, I was in a lab running experiments or really publishing two journal and stuff and we had to have that 95% confidence rate, had to because the things that were coming out of the lab and being published were influencing things like how we do education and how we understand how bias works and when it shows up and therefore how we can combat it.\n\n(00:43:23):\nThings were wrong. And sending a bunch of bologna, that can cause some significantly bad things like false positive, false negatives in that context can be very dangerous, for lack of a better word. And you think of other pharmaceuticals, the 95% confidence rate belongs in some companies and some industries because the risk of failure on the impact of a false success is very high.\n\n(00:43:47):\nBut those of us converting users and trying to upsell folks, we are very fortunate to not have that level of burden on us and we can take advantage of that. And so there are definitely times where I will advocate for and I will push for and I will myself use lower confidence intervals and 95%, especially if that doubles amount of experiments that you can run in a year. End of the day, these are all methods that we use to try to validate the hypotheses that we have. And if you're doing a 95% confidence in a role, you're still accepting a 5%, some amount of false success, do that a little bit more, challenge you to do that a little bit more. And then run way more experience. If you look at the net of what your team is doing over the course of year, what you're doing over the course of a year, you will be positive.\n\nLenny (00:44:42):\nWow, that is a big idea. Idea of releasing the P-value confidence interval for experimentation and data teams. Everyone would be excited about this. Probably maybe not some data scientists on teams. Do you do that? How do you act? Is that how you operate on your teams? Just like we don't need 95% competence?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:45:03):\nSo I'll say this, this is actually very critically important. You must have this game plan set before you run something. Failure mode that I see so many teams fall into is they'll run the experiment or whatever it is and then they'll make the data fit the hypothesis. Or sometimes they'll go without a hypothesis and just be like, \"This is going to do better things for our metrics,\" but not a core reason as to why or what exactly are we testing here. And so this is another area we could absolutely fall into that trap. \"Let's [inaudible 00:45:36] on good 80. I think it's good. That Laura person said it was cool. So I think that that's fine.\" That will always be a trap. So it needs to be very deliberately thought of in advance as a way of like, \"Hey, here's how we're going to validate this.\" And always, always, always, if you're going to accept more risk of a false success or false positive, false negative, you want to then be really thinking about how you're going to harden your validation of a hypothesis.\n\n(00:46:03):\nFor example, let's take that when we talked about with Twilio where we are kicking people out and we're sending them to the pilling hotdog experiment, and we're sending people to that experience to hide the phone number. Now in that case, let's say that we were going to accept a lower confidence interval. I would very much want to see qualitative feedback to confirm that that hypothesis was true. I want to be looking at the qualitative data from the ones where people were thrown into the existing flow and one's put into the dogs that one of them felt more confident and more like this was really easy to get through and they felt out of a territory and things like that. And I'd be wanting to hear from the ones who were in the other one, things like, \"Oh, I got stuck on that [inaudible 00:46:48].\" Like, \"Figure this out, but it feels like it's that amount of my depth.\"\n\n(00:46:52):\nI would want to be looking for other things to corroborate the hard data that I'm seeing. And yes, it opens the door to whenever you open the door to more risk acceptance, you are going to have some false successes there. But all of these things together can overall make it more likely that you're shipping more things that are going to positively influence the customer. And again, I can't say it enough. It is a huge risk in and of itself to not ship as much as you possibly could in a year. That is a huge risk given that very high fail rate. So to those data scientists, and I've chatted with a few of my time, what I try to explain is that that article, that data that the 80%, that's hard data about what a detriment it can be if you don't run an enough experiments.\n\n(00:47:51):\nIf you just run 10 in a year on there, maybe two around impact, two of a course of an entire year if you take that approach. So data scientists can understand, \"Hey, if we do this, if we run this down, we can double or triple whatever it is, the number of experiments where we can run and overall net that's going to result in more successes that will overall net us to a positive place.\" You can still tell a data story to the data scientist about why you're doing this. Again, this is why when you asked that question identify, as a very data-driven person. But I think some of the methods that I use can sound at the service level as more like, \"Oh, I'm going by my gut.\" But again, very data driven is just embracing the reality of some of the hard data that I don't think we all embrace or are even aware of sometimes about that fail rate.\n\nLenny (00:48:42):\nThis is awesome. This is a big idea. Have you written about this anywhere for folks that maybe want to try this approach at their company? And if not, you should.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:48:50):\nI appreciate that. It's funny, it's like all my general life to do is just start writing some of this down. I have three children, one of whom is five months old, and then I have two and four. And so sometimes I'll start to write and then one of them will crawl across the keyboard. And by one of them, I mean all of multiple times. But eventually, yeah, I'll be very happy to do that if folks would be interested. I'm always happy to do whatever I can to help folks, help empower folks with knowledge to do better because none of this is secret sauce really. It's just learn from experience and it's always better to learn from others' experience than your own. It's faster. So yeah, I would definitely [inaudible 00:49:35] is that, I think that's the best that I can say, but eventually my kids will get older. I hear this and maybe I can do so.\n\nLenny (00:49:42):\nHopefully. Cool. So maybe if you're watching us on YouTube, leave a comment and if you want Laura to write in depth about this idea and spread it to your company. Okay, I want to talk about growth, but I have one last question just along the lines of experimentation. Is there any other just, I don't know, big lessons or takeaways of running experiments that would be interesting to share?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:50:02):\nI think we got into this one a little bit, but I just really want to exclamation point, underline it, which is that notion of making the data wrap to fit a concept. I think a lot of teams feel and are under a lot of pressure to show progress and, \"What did you do this month? Where did the metrics move?\" And it can cause folks to feel like they have to do that, where it's like, \"Oh gosh, this experiment.\" Everyone's got the experience where you run an experiment and you're like looking at the data, refresh, refresh, refresh, oh my gosh, and actually perform worse. Or it's not the same and, \"Gosh, we got everyone really excited about this thing that we all worked on really hard. Like, oh my god, what are we going to say in the QBR or the monthly report?\" Whatever it is that the results come to light.\n\n(00:50:55):\nAnd to this, I'd say this, that it's incredibly important for growth teams to educate out and for folks outside of growth and leading growth, especially to understand that the best way for a growth team to succeed, the only way really for them to succeed is to embrace the fact that they're there to validate, to understand what the biggest opportunities are and to go after them.\n\n(00:51:24):\nAnd that is not something that can be done on a weekly timeline, sometimes even a monthly, depending on the space you're in and what's known and unknown. And so any growth team that's beholden to short timeline wins and improvement is always going to be dangerous. That's an environment that's conducive to vanity Metric usage and massaging the data [inaudible 00:51:47]. And ones that are more successful are ones that are reporting over longer periods of time. Because I think growth team, given enough time to fail, enough time to learn the right thing to do is absolutely going to show success, real success. Not that, \"Okay, we're going to make this data fit.\" But real moving the metrics success.\n\n(00:52:03):\nAnd so definitely educating out. If you find yourself in a position where you are beholden to that, share that 80% fail rate. Just math, statistics, data. You cannot be successful in an environment, but over time you can be. And so that's one thing I definitely would draw on. I end up spending a decent amount of my pie chart at Twilio and then also at Rapid where I was after that and I'm sure I'll spend some time at Amplitude as well. Just helping folks understand what is the healthiest ecosystem, most powerful ecosystem for a growth team to operate in. And time and expectations over time is a big part of that.\n\nLenny (00:52:46):\nWhen you say pie chart, it's like the pie chart of your time like a big chunk of your time goes to this?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:52:46):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:52:50):\nThat's awesome. I like that. I use white charts a lot as to describe that same idea. Just to be a little more concrete there, what is the timeframe you think is the minimum for a growth team to be thinking across?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:53:01):\nI think it's good, especially for newer teams, but even teams in general. Commit to something that you can do over the course of a year and low, medium, high is always helpful in that space. A lot times-\n\nLenny (00:53:01):\nWhat do you mean by that, by low, medium, high?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:53:17):\nLow, medium high, more like, \"Hey we've got a few bets that we have or few core hypotheses.\" And if they take off that's going to be our high bucket like, wow [inaudible 00:53:26]. We think these things could become lightening on a bottle here, but they could also be a bunch of [inaudible 00:53:31] missed. But until we run in, we're not going to know. And if those bear out though, then yeah, that's our high. And hey, we've got a few things that we think are safer. Maybe it was validated a bit in the previous year, what have you. And these looking really the metrics this amount.\n\n(00:53:45):\nSo it's helpful to give people though that construct, it deviates from it very hard deviates from this notion of like, here's the single number that we're going to hit. Just things that help people understand that space a little bit better and what to expect. And because of that it can be a little bit lumpy. There were some things that you released. Truly for the most number of years, can be easiest to talk about in this construct here, but there's one thing that we did that generated tens of millions of dollars in the pipeline, was really, really powerful and took, sometimes navigate and validate. Other times we did that onboarding stuff that I was talking about catching those things. That could happen on a little bit of a faster clip but still took some time to validate and understand. But yeah, over the course of a year you should generally be able to commit to movement. But help people understand the methods there so that they're not coming at you on a weekly basis being like, \"And what did you do these past couple days?\"\n\nLenny (00:54:44):\nOkay, I got to follow up on a couple of these things. What was that big change of Twilio that lead to tens of millions of dollars?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:54:50):\nThis is part of the course that I teach at Reforge.\n\nLenny (00:54:55):\nOh, amazing. You get to work for Reforge with [inaudible 00:54:57].\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:55:04):\nI'm actually interested in retention, I think is my part. Right now, I'll give you links so we can [inaudible 00:55:05] in the show notes. But yeah, the high level version, this was deeper into my journey at Twilio. This is fast-forward a few years, build up this team and some cool things going on. But I was really looking for what's the next big thing for us to do? What could that be? And I noticed, remember that question very back of the day when I asked about the developer versus not developer folks [inaudible 00:55:34]?\n\nLenny (00:55:33):\nMm. Yeah.\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:55:35):\nWe saw that little non-developer little dude ad was growing. We were actually the number of people in the ecosystem who were identifying themselves as not a developer were in the space.\n\n(00:55:46):\nBut very interestingly they were, as we got more refined in our understanding of those folks, a lot of them wanted to build with Twilio. There was a hypothesis of like, \"Oh well maybe they're lost, maybe this want pricing, maybe they [inaudible 00:56:00] mistake.\" And I was like, \"Nope, they're here to build, they won't build.\" And they struggled through the developer on onboarding and some of them would succeed and some would... But anyway, it was all about identifying what did they need to succeed. If we were made them successful, could it contribute to dollars? One of the core learnings I'd heard from sales at the time was, \"Hey, it's very challenging for us to get the folks when a developer's not involved yet to go from zero to one to get something off the ground. But man, if we can get them to do that, if I can get them in $1 and spend, I can get them to five. If I get them to five, and get them to 50, like 10,000, then I can get them to hundred thousand.\"\n\n(00:56:39):\nThis whole long journey like, \"Hey, Laura, if your team could just get them off the ground, man, we can do so much.\" So yeah, the journey is all about, okay, what were the things that were missing in the experience we were offering and ultimately was they couldn't write code from scratch. That was really difficult. And also we're going to stand up a server. That was difficult. But we ended up iteratively experiencing a way to validate those hypotheses and what's the right way to do this and yeah, that was great. It's called quick deploy on code exchange. Anyone can go there and deploy an app without having to write code and get an aha moment there with Twilio.\n\nLenny (00:57:16):\nThat is awesome. So basically it's like a low code Twilio app?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:57:20):\nYeah, it ended up being, we had a lot of pet names, nicknames for it. I think probably the one that most succinctly describes it as just, it ended up being a create your own demo experience which made you talk about the psyche of people. We talked about how developers telecom until can be intimidating. We'll talk about the non-development, sometimes the buyers or the people who are instantly buying decisions, for them, it was not only was it telco, but it was the developer stuff was inaccessible but they still wanted to jump in and they wanted to have that experience. And so this was a way for us to give them momentum, give them comfortable. Geez, I can get this running my development team, I'd definitely do it. And so it was a very powerful moment where we could really address the psyche of those users, get them excited about Twilio, and then give sales the ability to give something powerful to those non-engineering buyers and folks they're talking to.\n\nLenny (00:58:17):\nSo genius, looking back seems like an obvious win. One of my readers suggested that I start a series of the story of a feature and walk through the discovery ideation development iteration and this feels like a really interesting example of that. But anyway. I got just a couple more questions. I know we've been going for an hour now. But I have questions, I don't want to let you go just yet, and they're on growth. So one question is just you worked at Twilio, which is very product led growth. You're now Amplitude, which is more sales driven and I know you're trying to go more product led. I know Elena talks a lot about this, how every company needs to have product led motions, otherwise they're going to be disrupted by someone that comes product led. And I don't know what hires, which blanket would they fall into?\n\nLaura Schaffer (00:59:05):\nBetween the AI like SLG and PLG. Yeah, for me they're two sides of the same coin. Product growth and sales. It's all to me, very thematically the same stuff. The difference is that with growth, you are selling with your product, and with sales you're selling with person like one-to-one. And so companies need to be employing both of those forces to optimally convert their audience. We're in a world where people are expecting both. They're expecting to be sold by your product and sold at the enterprise level. And large companies buy by human beings. It's going to listen to their specific needs and really break it off for them. And if you only have one, you're going to miss stuff. So absolutely, I think you want those two forces together working well. And obviously there's different stages, things work differently in different spaces, but I think when it comes to Amplitude, I think there's a huge opportunity here.\n\n(01:00:06):\nI think the key is, and that the challenge for companies that have done the sales thing and are trying to crack into the PLG thing really comes down to how you fundamentally are approaching that space. And again, your users and where they're at and the psyche of where they're at, I think a lot of companies will say, \"Well okay, hey, we're going to do this PLG stuff. Let's take that sales enterprise whatever offering that we have and let's chop it up a bit and cut access here and cut out this feature here and we're going to slap this plan out and we're going to put a price on it and we'll maybe have hours of debates over whether it's like 10 99 or $104 or 75, and eventually someone will win that battle and slap it on and then [inaudible 01:00:54].\" And anyway, the discussion of the focus is a lot around the product.\n\n(01:00:58):\nWhat are we going to do with this product? How are we going to crack it open and shift shift it in and then give it to these people, these users, these visitors? And what it's missing, I think is, and a lot of times it's easy to miss, is that when we're doing PLG and we're shifting from sales to PLG, we need to reset. We need to recognize that, again, this is sales, sales via the product. What does a good sales rep do when they're engaging? They understand what the problem is of the person in the space they're talking to. So we need the same thing here. What are the unique problems of people who are coming into our self-serve space? And I think when it comes to a company like Amplitude, a lot of the folks that will be looking to address via the PLG motion, there's a number of things we want to achieve there, but one of the primary things is to tap into the SMV market market and really give them a really startups and give them a space to land and to grow.\n\n(01:01:57):\nAnd again, you have to think what are the challenges and unique problems that they have because we're going to be using our product to settle them. We need to meet them where they're at with the problems that they've got. And I think one of the things that I've observed from being in all these startups and advising some startups is I very rarely... I don't think I've ever come across a startup where they have the right number of analysts for their needs. In fact, a lot of them don't have any. And so what that means is that the CEO is being an analyst to create their dashboards for the board and the product manager is being an analyst to figure out what the heck's going on and creating their boards for their product.\n\n(01:02:34):\nAnd that's happening all over the place is that people are in their roles and they have to be an analysts too. And I think that that's a problem that especially younger companies and early stage companies have. And so when they connect their psyche, what are they caring about? What are they thinking about when they're sending it for product analytic product or something? They're looking for something that's going to help them feel reassured they're going to be able to actually get to the bottom of the right metrics, create the reports that show things the right way. What's the best way to show churn? There's got to be a best way so many people are doing it. Guess what? Yes, there are some really good ways to do it and there are some really successful ways to set up dashboards for the board. People have done that too.\n\n(01:03:16):\nThere's a lot of that knowledge that exists in one of those frameworks that exist, benchmarking. Are these numbers even good? And so, one of the hypotheses that I have is that if we take that perspective and we understand that that is the problem, that there's a number of things that we can do to really change the way that self-serve experience works to help convert people and show them how Amplitude can make them that powerful. But the thing that I think sticks across all companies, not just amplitude making the shift, is just that, that when you're doing this, do not think this is a copy paste, but chop it for parts thing. Don't start with your product when you're building at your strategy, start with your customers, your users, your prospects, the people who are going to be coming into yourself or flow. Make sure you are understanding how their problems differ because they do from the people that you're addressing at the sales led side. And then make sure that you're orienting your experience of product around those people.\n\nLenny (01:04:12):\nIt's interesting that you almost have to start again as a product company, as a product because you may need to solve completely different problems that eventually lead to the same place. But it's interesting what you're saying that you may end up targeting analysts or PMs. I know Amplitude or has always focused on PMs, but-\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:04:32):\nYeah, it's right. And there's always nice thing about it is it's in some ways, it does feel like you're starting fresh because you do need to start with the customer again and what's their problem. But in a lot of ways, you can carry over a lot of the same knowledge. At that point you know what's working well. Amplitude for example, does have a ton of knowledge around what some of the best ways artists set up reports. There's a lot of things that they have the momentum going, like where do you choose that momentum and how do you put that and curate that in front of users and make sure that they're getting the right things. There's a ton of momentum already there. It's just a little bit about harnessing it and understanding like, yeah, where are the gaps because there are going to be gaps.\n\n(01:05:08):\nBut anchoring in a customer problem as I think the way that you start any new product, any new thing that you're releasing, should always think about the customer and the pain point. So no different than when you're doing PLG for the first time or cracking into it. You need to be thinking again, starting again with the problem, the problems they have, the psyche that they have coming to your space so that you can build something that is going to effectively make them feel like, \"Oh you can solve my problem, you get me.\" And show them how your product's going to do that.\n\nLenny (01:05:42):\nFinal question, and this is around developers. You worked at Twilio, obviously Twilio sold developers. I think Rapid where you work right before Amplitude also sold developers. Selling to developers feels like such a hot space right now. There's so many startups that are just building developer tools, such a huge market. Used to be not. Used to be like there's not a market in developers. They're not going to spend money, there's not enough of them. And now it is a big popular spot. And so I'm curious, what have you learned about building a startup and a product that sells to developers? I imagine a lot of founders building search tools would be really curious.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:06:16):\nThe first is that developers are just a very different audience from any others. I've seen so many people who have come in strong on growth really well or product really well with other audiences and like, \"Oh, I'm going to take all those learnings, I'll pivot into serving developers.\" And as it being a very steep climb because developers are so different. And let me give you a couple just fun facts that make them really different. And some of these have some interesting stories. One is developers, almost two, one, do not look at your marketing website at all. They go straight to your signup flow. So what that means is all that beautiful context that you're setting and the product aid pricing, all that stuff, very often they're skipping all of it context free and going straight to your signup. And so anytime you make an assumption like, \"Oh, well, they probably know this coming in to signup.\" Or like, \"Well, we don't need to include, that's on the marketing website.\" None of that's going to apply to this group of people.\n\n(01:07:15):\nThey're there. The analogy I have for this group is they're the IKEA buyers who when IKEA package comes, they're not opening up the instruction manual and reading in and then starting to go through, they're in there tearing open the bags and starting to pull the pieces together and trying to build it. They'll come up for context and steps and such when they get stuck if they're motivated. So that's one thing. And then another one is just the aversion to talking to sales. And I think hearing that, some they're like, \"Oh yeah, well, I hate sales too.\" When I'm sent out and get bombarded by sales, that's the worst. I totally get that. But developers are on this whole other level. There was a fang company sign up for Twilio, built a POC, launched to production, all this, and operated in that space for months without engaging once with sales.\n\n(01:08:12):\nI was trying to reach them and I ended up being the one that talked to them first because they reached out to support because there was something about their delivery that was off ,there missing a feature and they did not want to talk to sales. They ended up talking to me when I was in product marketing. And that was my first exposure of like, these people not want to talk to sales. And then there's another one where a giant retail company where the engineering team signed up with their personal e-mail addresses so they wouldn't get bombarded by sales. It was only later that we found out. Anyway. But the thing that's most important, these are fun facts, but the thing that I would say is the most important, the thing to leave with listeners here is what makes them so different?\n\n(01:08:54):\nWhy? What's the deal here? And it stems from their charter and their responsibility. So if we put ourselves in developer's shoes for a minute, a developer, if a developer is required to use your product, especially if they're the primary user, the primary builder, it's really important to recognize that they're responsible for that. If your service goes down, that's their responsibility. Not just for themselves but their team. If the pager wakes up someone because the service they bought from you goes down, that's on them. If, oh, it turns out that doesn't work with the systems that they said it was, well, that's on them. Doesn't integrate with the data the way that everyone wanted it to? That's on them. Everyone lives to developer when it's not working right and it cannot work right. In so many ways, that's their failure, it can cost them their job, it could cost them the trust to their team.\n\n(01:09:50):\nIt cost them their reputation. And that means that the stakes are very high for them every time that they're adopting something new. So they can't afford to take someone's word for it. Especially a sales rep who might have some other motivations from their perspective, they can't afford to trust your content or someone's word. They must do it. They must prove it themselves. And so that's why, for developers to be bought in, they need to do something, build something, a proof of concept at the very least, if not moving further than that. And so that means they're going to be pretty darn deep in their self-serve experience with you before they're ready to commit. And so if you are a company that is providing, that requires developers to build, you must invest in self-serve experiences in order to effectively convert your audience. And you should be thinking of them. Something akin your self-serve function and growth folks, someone akin to Salesforce because your developers are not going to accept sales coming in and trying to convert them at that stage.\n\nLenny (01:11:00):\nI love that you always come back to the psyche of the user and how in this case, developers like, here's why they're responsible for this thing. Salespeople are going to convince them this is going to work. And it's not. That's a really interesting tool and that's a really cool takeaway.\n\n(01:11:16):\nIs there anything else that we didn't cover before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:11:20):\nPlenty. I think we covered it all, man.\n\nLenny (01:11:22):\nYou got all my questions and more. So with that, welcome to the very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. Are you ready?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:11:30):\nI am so ready.\n\nLenny (01:11:31):\nWhat are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:11:35):\nI'm a big believer in happiness. Not just being crunchy or we should all be happy, but also because it helps us do our best work and we're more creative and all this. So one is Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins. I don't ignore the data, that money is something that often gets in the way of our happiness. I know so many smart people that just have not figured out the whole managing their finances thing. And this book will cover all of your basics. It's very easy to read. He's got an audiobook that he narrates himself. Simple Path to Wealth by JL Collins, he's fantastic.\n\nLenny (01:12:12):\nWhat's a recent movie... Oh wait, wait, there's more?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:12:12):\nOh, there's one more.\n\nLenny (01:12:18):\nOh, let's do it. Let's do it.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:12:18):\n[inaudible 01:12:18] Happiness, which is Atomic Habits by James Clear. If you ever want to change something about yourself or something's not quite working for you, this guy will give you a framework to change it. Guaranteed.\n\nLenny (01:12:30):\nI really enjoyed that book. That guy's killing it. He was on Tim Ferris, he had a great interview. Folks that don't want to read it, they could listen to that. There's a lot of cool tips there. Favorite recent movie or TV show?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:12:39):\nUnabashedly, the Great British Baking Show. I love that show. I love that show for all the reasons everyone loves that show. It's heartwarming and makes you feel good and uplifts you. But also because it is a competitive show. They're trying to be the best baker and they're out there helping each other. They're like a big family. Most reality competitive TV shows that I see, all of them are like cutthroat, they're sabotaging. So I'm just endlessly fascinated also by the psychology of what's happening here. I want somebody to do a research paper on it, get to the bottom of why they're all helping each other. It's wonderful though. Wonderful to watch.\n\nLenny (01:13:18):\nInteresting. I always comes back to psychology with you.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:13:24):\nI know. I know. I feel like I'm really, really sinking deep in there. And it's true though. It's very interesting to me, and I love that show.\n\nLenny (01:13:30):\nWhat's a favorite interview question that you like to ask in interviews?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:13:34):\nI love asking about a ship or release that is not cherry-picked by the person you're talking to. You can get it a lot of different ways. The thing is, everyone has a big success story. Everyone does. It really doesn't actually tell you very much to ask someone like, \"What's a great thing you released?\" Because everyone could tell that. Instead, take that away. What's the most recent ship is a really easy one because recency, time. But there's other things you can do to take that out. Just give them specific parameters for a ship that they've shared or whatever, and that will allow you to listen more and learn more about their frameworks versus the outcomes. Because if you're picking a random ship, odds are it probably wasn't fantastic. So they're going to want to talk more about how they approach getting there and that's what you want to know about to know if they're going to succeed, what their frameworks to how they approach things.\n\nLenny (01:14:24):\nThat is cool. I've never heard that one. That is a really clever idea. What are five SaaS products that you use in your day-to-day work? Can't say Amplitude.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:14:33):\nI know, right? Still learning which ones we have here. But yeah, I'll just share the ones that I like a lot that I've used elsewhere. So one is Hotjar. Hot Jar [inaudible 01:14:44] also works. Just anything that allows you to put some quick little thing in front of customers, get that qualitative feedback we talked about. It's a critical, critical supplement to quantitative data to understand what's really causing the change or not causing the change [inaudible 01:14:58]. So that's important. I will say Amplitude is a fantastic tool that I have used and I would've said that if I hadn't just joined Amplitude so I got to use it... I know. I got to use it for the first time at Amplitude and it was awesome. So again, like asterisk, because I'm like working there now, but I do actually like it. And Slack, it's boring, everyone says Slack, but I just have to hand it to them.\n\n(01:15:26):\nIt makes life so much easier and just nod their way. And then Builder, which I'll also put in asterisk on that one, but I really want to serve this. A lot of people don't know about it and it's really helpful. I do advise them so I'm in their corner. But this is another one I also say would be a powerful one. I think a lot of team gets stuck. They're relying on too much in their engineers to make changes. Again, we talk about rapid experimentation, getting these out, out, out. And Builder makes it really easy for folks to do that. Also, a headless CMS, you can drag and drop headless CMS so they do make it easy for non-engineers to make changes. So especially if you're trying to figure out how to get around that 80% [inaudible 01:16:11] that I mentioned, this builder would be a good way.\n\n(01:16:14):\nAnd then yeah, if you want one more, I'll give you Chat GPT, which is really boring and everyone's saying that, but I think I'll just say I don't have any crazy things to say about it except that I do think we all need to figure out how we pull that in to [inaudible 01:16:28] put people who don't do that are probably going to lose out or smart AI whatever bots. But that would be it for you, Lenny. But if you ask me in a few months after I've actually been an Amplitude for a bit, I'm sure I'd give you a different answer.\n\nLenny (01:16:42):\nThat's a good time to plug lennybot.com. And I wrote a newsletter or Dan Shipper who created the bot wrote a newsletter post about how he built this thing. And so you could go ask me questions using the content of my newsletter as answers. And it's very cool. Lennybot.com or lennysbot.com.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:17:00):\nAmazing.\n\nLenny (01:17:01):\nThere we go.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:17:03):\nI didn't know about that. Well, there you go. I've changed my answer. It's that.\n\nLenny (01:17:05):\nYeah, there we go. That's all I need.\n\n(01:17:09):\nTwo more questions. What is something relatively minor you've changed in your product development process that has had a lot of impact on your team's ability to execute?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:17:17):\nYeah, the be embarrassed thing, like I mentioned earlier, be Embarrassed by the first iteration. If you are not embarrassed, you've gone too far. That really speeds up ships and helps people celebrate the unpolished as opposed to feel embarrassed about it. So just embracing that.\n\nLenny (01:17:35):\nAwesome. And final question. I know you just started Amplitude, but do you have a favorite pro-tip for how to use Amplitude or maybe Hidden Feature people may not know about?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:17:44):\nYou tell me [inaudible 01:17:45], but I'll say one thing that was super cool actually that someone put together on my team at Rapid, literally before I left, he put together a video of how powerful Amplitude could be when linked up and integrated with other things like in this case Hotjar and Segment. There was a Amplitude report that someone had created and there was something that was an anomaly happening there. Users were using something in a way we didn't expect and Amplitude one of the reports surface it, but Al Kirsten, we want to know why is that happening. And so we could find out what the event is and then using by Segment, find out what that name was and look at Hotjar and actually go in and get screencasts of people doing that exact event.\n\n(01:18:30):\nAnd from that, we were able to form some really concrete hypotheses about what actually was causing it. And so obviously talking to customers is very powerful, but in this case, just that simple use of connecting and threading those technologies together could really get a good picture of that without needing to engage customers. So the tip would be how you can really amplify when you get an amplitude when you use it with.\n\nLenny (01:18:59):\nAmazing. Laura, we covered a lot of ground, career experimentation, growth, embarrassment, psychology. Thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, where can folks finding online if they want to reach out, learn more, maybe send you an appreciation or two? And two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:19:17):\nYeah, find me on LinkedIn. I don't post a lot. Yeah, I'll blame my three children. Eventually, I promise that I will. But I'm pretty good about responding to messages, so definitely link with me there.\n\n(01:19:29):\nAnd then what listeners can do, I think I'm always happy to hear feedback, suggestion, all that, but I'll just say I also know that it's a little bit crazy out there right now, especially folks working in tech. So I'm also cognizant what I might be able to do to help all of you. I know there's a few places I advise and rapids hiring. I know of a few folks that are hiring growth, strong growth people and product folks. So if you are interested in learning more about that, don't hesitate to hit me up. I want to make sure that I help as many people as I can in that respect because it's trying times and I'm sure you've heard it and read it, but if you're laid off, this is not about you, it's not your fault. It's this crazy world we're in. Things will get better. And I would be feel very lucky if I could help even one person land. So feel free to hit me up about that too.\n\nLenny (01:20:21):\nAwesome. And maybe if you share some links, we could include links to open roles in the show notes.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:20:26):\nYes. I know there's a few that don't have JDs open yet. They're that hot off the press, but I'm happy to surface a few things there for sure because I know that makes it easier for people to know.\n\nLenny (01:20:37):\nAwesome. We will do our best with the show notes then. Laura, thank you again for being here.\n\nLaura Schaffer (01:20:43):\nYeah, thanks so much for having me. This was awesome and so much fun.\n\nLenny (01:20:47):\nBye everyone.\n\n(01:20:49):\nThank you so much for listening.

That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:00:35):\nOftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.\n\nLenny (00:01:05):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast. I'm Lenny and my goal here is to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauren Ipsen.\n\nLenny (00:01:15):\nOne of the most important skills for founders and senior product leaders to develop is the ability to hire great people. You won't be able to build the best company or the best product if you can't hire the best people. And Lauren is one of the most experienced and successful people in the world when it comes to hiring product leaders. She's placed over 80 senior product leaders across tech companies and has worked with some of the biggest companies out there. When I asked a bunch of really smart product leaders who their favorite product recruiter was, Lauren's name came up a ton.\n\nLenny (00:01:46):\nIn our conversation, we get super tactical about what founders need to do to find the best product talent, what product managers should be doing during their career to give themselves the most opportunity, and we also touch on what recruiters themselves often get wrong when trying to attract great talent. This episode is rich with actionable advice for basically everyone, and I am really excited to bring it to you. With that, I bring you Lauren Ipsen.\n\nLenny (00:02:12):\nWho has an opinion on internal tools? Internal tools are something you probably don't think about until you have to, or it probably didn't even occur to you to think about them, but if you work at a big company, you probably have a bunch of one-off custom apps or dashboards that are laser focused on just one job to be done for one specific team or just one role, and they're always such a huge pain to build and maintain. And that's why I'm such a big fan of Retool, and why I think Retool is so popular. Retool allows teams as small as just one person to build a suite of custom internal apps in a fraction of the time that you think it takes. The productivity gains of custom apps is now within reach, not just for large enterprises, but for small teams as well. And as you scale your company, Retool scales with you.\n\nLenny (00:02:57):\nSnowflake saves about 26 hours a week of manual spreadsheet work with custom internal apps built on Retool. Amazon uses Retool to handle GDPR requests. Thousands of teams at companies like Coinbase, DoorDash, and NBC collaborate around custom-built Retool apps to operate with greater efficiency.\n\nLenny (00:03:17):\nMaybe you've thought about using Retool before but just haven't, and I'm here to tell you that now teams of up to five can build unlimited Retool apps for free. Get started today at retool.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:03:31):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro. Creating a product, especially one that your users can't live without, is damn hard, but it's made easier by working closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and being able to iterate quickly. That's where Miro comes in. Miro is an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours.\n\nLenny (00:03:53):\nI actually used Miro to come up with a plan for this very ad. With Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tools, even a timer to keep your team on track. You can also bring your whole distributed team together around wire frames where anyone can draw their own ideas with the pen tool or put their own images or mock-ups right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready made templates, you can go from discovering research to product roadmaps to customer journey flows to final mocks.\n\nLenny (00:04:24):\nWant to see how I use Miro? Head on over to my Miro board at miro.com/lenny to see my most popular podcast episodes, my favorite Miro templates. You can also leave feedback on this podcast episode and more. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\nLenny (00:04:45):\nLauren, thank you for being here. Welcome to the podcast.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:04:47):\nThanks so much. It's great to be here.\n\nLenny (00:04:50):\nI've been meeting to do an episode on product hiring and recruiting product people for a while, and when I asked a bunch of smart friends who should I have on to talk about this stuff, your name came up a bunch, and so I'm really happy that we're finally doing this.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:05:03):\nMe too. Absolutely. I'm grateful that you asked.\n\nLenny (00:05:07):\nSo, to help listeners get a sense of just your background and kind of the journey you've been on to get to where you are now, can you just spend maybe just a minute kind of talking through the wonderful things you've done in your career and what you're doing now?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:05:19):\nYeah, absolutely. So I started my career in broadcast. I originally thought that I wanted to be on the news and quickly realized I didn't necessarily want to be the face of sadness. There's a ton of that happening in the world.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:05:36):\nSo, made a pivot pretty early on and thought, where could I use the communication skills that I've been working so hard on and do something that's impactful in a big way, but maybe just with a little bit of a different angle? And stumbled across executive search.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:05:52):\nExec search is not really something that people major in college by any means or think they're going to end up doing. So it was something I found fascinating. I had applied to all of these different companies like Twitter and Snap and Pinterest, hadn't heard back from any of them, was a name in the resumes, and thought, well, how cool would it be if I could work with all of them and have an opportunity to play a part from a different lens?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:06:18):\nSo, got into exec search, was really focused early on on consumer mobile build outs. Was doing a lot of work with Twitter and Reddit and TaskRabbit and Nextdoor, Postmates, you name it, and that was probably 85% of the work I was doing. And then as, on the agency side, 15% was obscure, autonomous helicopters selling into the Department of Defense and then retail and robotics, and it was all very fascinating, but for me, who has wicked bad ADD, it was amazing to be able to be so stimulated by so many different industries and feel like I couldn't really master this.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:06:57):\nSo, long story short, had an awesome career at Daversa Partners, which is a boutique executive search firm, and thought I was going to be there potentially forever. Was tapped by a awesome individual, Abe Shafi, who was founding a company. I had been doing a lot of work for them. They were a client of mine at the time. Placed a couple great hires and they said, \"We're either going to kick off a head of talent search with you or you can come over and join us.\" So I was the first recruiting hire over there, built out the talent function in its entirety.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:07:27):\nI definitely think there was a part of me that I loved the operating experience, learned a ton, worked side by side some amazing people, but was really missing working with founders, and lots of them, and keeping a pulse on the market. So General Catalyst tapped me most recently, and been working here for the past couple months, and it's been great thus far, and I'm specializing in our consumer and crypto investments.\n\nLenny (00:07:51):\nAwesome. The fact that you're at GC now makes me think about another recruiter that I know who's awesome, Austin Brizendine, and it's interesting that a lot of the best recruiters seem to be heading to VC funds, and I'm curious why that is happening. Is it like a comp thing? Is it other things that are pulling everyone away into funds?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:08:09):\nIt's a great question. It's definitely not a comp thing. I'll say that. I think it could be a stability of life thing. Search is incredibly volatile, and you have to hustle so hard, and as soon as you have three wins, you've got four more things to execute on. And so, there's aspects of it that can be tough, especially in a market like right now where you really do have to chase business and you can't be selective about what you take on, so you could be pitching things that maybe you don't necessarily believe in in its entirety or what have you. So, I think that's one component.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:08:39):\nIn house is obviously difficult right now as well for talent leaders. It's really scary to take a bet on one single company right now and know what it's going to look like six months from now. And so I think those things combined might be the reason for an influx in folks leaning more towards venture, and I think it's just timeliness.\n\nLenny (00:08:59):\nGot it. That makes sense. The downside is it's hard for people to find awesome recruiters because once you're in a fund, you're just going to help those startups. And so we're going to talk later about just how do people find awesome recruiters, what do you look for? But there's roughly three things I want to spend our time chatting through today. One is for founders and hiring managers, just how to find the best talent and what they could do to be successful finding the best talent. Two is for product leaders and PMs, how to give themselves the most opportunity from the flip side. And then third is just for recruiters, what do they often do wrong? How do they miss out on the best product talent? Does that sound good?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:09:37):\nYeah, that sounds great.\n\nLenny (00:09:39):\nOkay, cool. So on the hiring front, just diving in, say you are a founder, you're someone really early at a company, and maybe you've got a couple PMs and you're starting to think about we need to hire a really senior product leader or first senior product leader.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:09:52):\nSure.\n\nLenny (00:09:53):\nWhat do you find is often the biggest mistake that founders make when they're trying to hire their first senior product leader?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:09:59):\nI think especially for founders that haven't hired for this caliber of talent in the past, it's really easy to be distracted by shiny objects and look at huge names. You want to find the CPOs of Google and YouTube or what have you because that seems like it would be such an incredible opportunity for brand recognition. And to an extent, it is. But the fact of the matter is, oftentimes those individuals are pretty far from the work and have a great team of executors that they've put into place that are actually the ones that are in the weeds.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:10:33):\nAnd so I think that's the biggest mistake I see people make, especially on the hiring front where they have limited resources, and maybe they're an early stage company and trying so hard to bring in big names is not always the best way to go about it because the fact of the matter is they need to go then hire a team. So, I think looking for someone that's a little closer to the work, maybe someone that can step up into that type of role and do so in a way where some days they might actually be operating like a PM and then other days they might be able to build from a leadership perspective, that's more of the DNA that people should be targeting.\n\nLenny (00:11:09):\nDo you think the source of the issue with that going wrong, that they no longer can do that work as well because they've been shielded away from the tactical day to day? Or is it that they're not as hungry as they used to be and they're just like, \"I already, I'm a YouTube 10 year super success, I don't need to prove myself anymore,\" and they're just not as hungry, or something else?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:11:29):\nI mean, I'm not going to sit here and say that all senior leaders aren't hungry. I think that there's some folks that really lean into the work in a different way and miss that, and often go to startups because they crave building.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:11:41):\nSo it's not necessarily that, but I do tend to lean towards folks that have a chip on their shoulder or have something to prove and want to build a name for themselves. All of that to say, there's a reason that a lot of those people got to where they are, and some of the best talent are some of the senior folks, but just maybe not necessarily the best talent for where this company is today. Right? It could be great for 10 years down the road, but the past five years of that individual's career could have been far more focused on camaraderie, team building, operational components, performance reviews, and then aspects of product vision, which just might not be the innovative AB testing type of profile that you typically look for in these pre-IPO companies.\n\nLenny (00:12:27):\nGot it. I imagine there are stories that you can share about people you've placed like that, that have not worked out. If you can share one, that'd be awesome. But maybe a side question is the general advice, just don't assume someone that's been successful at a big company with a fancy background is going to be great. Sometimes they work out, but not always, is that kind of the takeaway?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:12:46):\nYeah. I would say the general advice is who is going to be best for this specific role at this specific time, not necessarily who is the best talent in the world or in the market. Those are two very, very different questions to ask. And I think early on in my recruiting career, I was often just trying to recruit these whales of executives to try and prove myself and say, \"Oh, I got this person to entertain this opportunity, how sick is that?\" But naturally, that's not necessarily the person that actually can move the needle. And so you need to think very specifically. Just because this is the best talent, that doesn't necessarily mean they are the best talent for this role today.\n\nLenny (00:13:25):\nSo to double down on that, say you are hiring and you know you're going to start hiring a senior product leader, what is it that you suggest founders nail down and iron out when they're kicking off the hiring process, either on their own or with a recruiter? Like, in the job description, what else do they have to get right to find the right person?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:13:48):\nIt's a number of things, like product leaders can come in a lot of different flavors, and so I think it's trying to determine where this person should major and minor, where they should spike. Is this someone that's going to really lean into the design efforts? Is it someone that actually kind of needs to just operate like a very senior PM and continue to build out a team? Is this someone that really should be focused on product vision for the long haul? And then thinking more holistically about how to build the rest of the team.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:14:12):\nThere's so many different ways in which you can hire for a product leader. So I think it's trying to work a little bit backwards and think about, what is the actual outcome that we are trying to solve for with this hire? Or are we just hiring a head of product because we feel like we need to hire a head of product? That's so often what I see is the board's telling me we need to hire a head of product and I don't necessarily think that we do, or I'm not exactly sure what we need in this role. And so whenever you're starting a search in that regard, it's kind of doomed from inception, so you need to get incredibly granular on the front end around, what is this person going to be coming in to do? What's their mandate? And if we think about someone that's just absolutely hitting it out of the park and crushing it, what does that look like? So I think just trying to be really specific on the front end.\n\nLenny (00:14:59):\nI love that last piece, just what does success really look like for this person? On the first piece, that's exactly the same advice I give founders when they're looking for a PM is like, what do you concretely need them to do day to day? Not like, \"We need someone to help us with product.\" And that often helps illuminate, okay, I see. We need someone to help us ship more consistently. We need someone to help us hire engineers. Yeah, just make a list. What are they going to do in the first month or two or three?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:15:24):\nYeah, yeah, absolutely. I think those are the most important things. Like the 90 day plan is something that's overused but so necessary, and that's just the tip of the iceberg. So that component and then, okay, a year from now, what should this person be doing? Two years from now? Do we want them to grow up into a CPO role? Do we think about that in a different way? How are we thinking about the product direction today, 12 months from now, 18 months from now, through IPO? I think it's really difficult to think about things that way, and so often you're thinking about the task in front of you and just trying to iterate quickly, but that is the type of thought process that needs to be happening from the CEOs and founders.\n\nLenny (00:16:06):\nAre there archetypes of PMs, if you just bucket like here's the three maybe most common types of product leaders that founders hire, because there's an infinite list of skills and things they could do, but just to make it even simpler, like here's probably one of these three you're looking for. Do you have something like that in your head?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:16:25):\nYeah, there's platform product leaders or folks that are kind of more indexed on the infrastructure components. There's folks that are typically focused on core product, or consumer product if it's on the consumer side of things. And then you'll have folks that are really indexed and that can include UX individuals, design folks. And then there's also typically specialists, so individuals that are really hyper-focused on growth or monetization or what have you. Those are the three buckets that I would say I see most often.\n\nLenny (00:16:57):\nDo you feel like founders sometimes pick one of the wrong buckets and that's a common mistake, or is it generally it's the wrong bucket but then maybe it's not the right spikes of skills within that bucket?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:17:08):\nWell, it's kind of twofold. I think sometimes people just bring in a head of product to do everything, so that's probably not the best way to go about things. I think that ends up being a unicorn, which you hear often in the search world, and it becomes really difficult to hone in on what good looks like.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:17:25):\nAnd so I think again, it just comes back to having a clear org chart on the front end and determining, are we hiring someone specifically to build out our walled garden ads approach, or are we hiring someone to run product marketing, or are we hiring someone to help from a product perspective to build a better core user experience? Those are all very, very, very different roles, and if you bring in one person to try and do it all, the facts of the matter is, they're going to have to bring in some key lieutenants to help them, so is that something you want to do or are you more focused on bringing in someone imminently to help on the ad side of things, and then we can find that head of product to help them out down the road?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:18:05):\nThat's kind of the way in which I would architect it and think about it, is what's most imminent, and what do you actually need to hire for today, as opposed to just hiring for the sake of hiring and bringing in that leader.\n\nLenny (00:18:17):\nAnd part of the discussion there is maybe they grow up into this head of product long term, maybe not. Maybe we just need someone to ship the ads platform, right?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:18:24):\nThat's exactly right. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:18:26):\nYou mentioned this title of head of product. There's also VP of product, CPO. There's all these titles and I feel like people sometimes use them interchangeably, don't know which one to use when they're putting out a job description. Do you have any kind of heuristic rule of thumb of just, here's how to think about when to use each of these titles? Or is it not even a big deal for, say, a founder, hiring the first senior product leader?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:18:48):\nIt's a great question and it definitely leads to confusion across the board because I'll have candidates come to me and they'll say, \"I'm only looking for a CPO role,\" when I'm working with a startup where, maybe on the venture side of things, we've actually advised that startup to not hire C-level executives at this point. And so that naturally could eliminate a candidate that could be amazing for the role.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:19:15):\nSimilarly, people could feel that way if it's a VP of product role, but that in their mind is the most senior product leader within the organization running everything from end to end who they intend to be the CPO down the road but are not in a position where they're ready to hire C-level execs. So, it's tough, and it really depends on the organization and the way in which they're thinking about org charts and leveling.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:19:39):\nA lot of startups at this point are almost allergic to C titles or VP titles or are just more title agnostic than I've seen in the past, so you see a lot more of these head ofs, and that is sector leaders, up until probably C plus or D stage. And then you get to D and E, and you'll see more of the VP, director, CPO type. And I think that is the way that people should be thinking about it is, if I'm joining a company very, very early days and it's called head of engineering, that is intended to be the most senior engineering leader within the organization.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:20:19):\nThe fact of the matter though is there's good reason sometimes why they're not throwing out that C title, and could this person be layered down the road? Potentially, because maybe the talent they need right now is different than, just as we had spoken to earlier, is different than the talent that they might need from a massive CPO in two and a half years.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:20:37):\nAnd so I think that rubs people the wrong way because they want a bit of a promise that things are going to, if they join at this stage, that they'll be in it for the long haul and be that chief product officer that takes a company through an IPO. But companies are so dynamic and things change so quickly.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:20:52):\nSo, I guess a long-winded way of me saying there's different breadth and depth to each role, but I think for the most part, unless it's a very siloed company with multiple different VPs, if you're coming into a company and they say this is the head of product, the VP of product, or the CPO, that all means the same thing dependent on the stage, for the most part.\n\nLenny (00:21:14):\nAnd the other takeaway there, which is awesome, is if you're early stage startup, probably just start with head of product. Keep it simple.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:21:19):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:21:19):\nDon't over promise. Everyone understands.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:21:22):\nYeah. Because the last thing you want to do is have to demote someone. But once you get to a place of having C-level executives, like that's not going to do any good, but maybe you start as a head of product, and then as the company continues to grow, you lean into the growth side of things more, and so you become that head of growth or an SVP of growth. Like things iterate and change, but you just never know and you can't predict the outcome of a company on the front end, so.\n\nLenny (00:21:49):\nA lot of people listening to this probably aren't hiring senior product leaders right now, but plan to and will in the future, and so I wanted to ask, what should founders do when they know they will hire a head of product, say, in the next year, that could set them up for success down the road? What should they be doing ahead of time?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:22:07):\nRegardless of whether or not you're hiring, you should always be keeping a pulse on the market. That is the most important thing. And I think that should be the case for both candidates and folks that are hiring. Like, you never want to put yourself in a position where you have no idea what good looks like, whether that's from a company standpoint or from a candidate standpoint. So, both parties should always be having a good understanding of which companies are thriving, which individuals are building great things and are well known commodities in their organizations and get great references.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:22:43):\nOftentimes, I encourage founders to simply chat with what good looks like and get a really good sense of what benchmark candidate profiles could be, and who knows where that person will be in a year or what have you, but staying really, really close to really great people and using them from an advising capacity or getting them ingrained in some type of involvement in the product prior to actually having that specific need, I think, is really important.\n\nLenny (00:23:11):\nThat sounds awesome and it makes sense. How do you, as a founder, do some of that? Do you just ask folks like, \"Hey, who are some of the best product leaders you know? I just want to chat with them. I'm not hiring, just want to kind of meet people who are awesome.\" Is that the behavior you suggest or is there something else you can do?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:23:27):\nThat's a great way to go about it. And by simply saying, \"No agenda, I'm not trying to hire you tomorrow, I just want to know great people.\" And to be totally honest, people feel flattered by that, typically. Most of the time if you've been referred to someone and heard nothing but great things about them and you really don't have an agenda other than wanting to pick their brain, people are like, \"Huh, well, this is different from the day to day. This is fulfilling,\" and people want to pour their knowledge, especially into companies that they believe in.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:23:58):\nSo, I think more often than not you'll find that, not just products leaders, but executives across the board are actually really inclined to do so and want to help out because it's a little bit different from the day to day monotony of their work life.\n\nLenny (00:24:12):\nSo, the advice is keep track of companies who are killing it, who you might be able to kind of poach from in the future, and keep a list and keep warm contact with folks that are awesome.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:24:22):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:24:23):\nIt reminds me of a founder that ... or basically all founders who are really good at hiring and how far ahead they plant seeds and how they just play the long game with the best people they meet, and they just kind of keep the conversation going until they finally convince them to join a year or two later. Do you find that the same thing?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:24:41):\nYeah, 1000000%. Yeah. When I was on the executive recruiting side of things at Daversa, the VP of engineering candidate that we ultimately landed, it was a seven month game of courtship, and let's bring him in to help out from an advising capacity, let's ask him how he would think about structuring this organization, let's talk to him about the best talent that he would recommend that we're spending time with. No question that's invasive, but more so just collaborative and exciting, and you'll find that the founder and that leader will build a different level of rapport and trust by not going through a formal interview process and having it feel transactional. And then with that, magic can happen and you can land incredible people.\n\nLenny (00:25:24):\nThis all sounds like a lot of work and a lot of time. Do you have guidance on how long it should take to find, like for a early stage startup, say series A or B, to find someone awesome, and/or how much time founders should spend a week, just best practice, on hiring for someone like this?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:25:41):\nI mean, I think if you're going to search, so if you're looking for this individual, it's really so case to case. There's searches that I've been in that I call three people. I know they're amazing for this. I tell the founder and CEO, \"These are the three people you should chat with, hire one of them.\" And it's that easy.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:25:59):\nThere's others where it's a lot of trying to figure out what the person's actually looking for. If there's some ... they hit it off from an emotional standpoint. There's so many different things that come with it. I would say from a timing perspective, it's not a hard number. It's more of just put yourself in the room with great people. If you have a tremendous amount of respect for someone, continue to harvest that relationship and ask what good looks like. Find excuses to continue to touch base with people that are important in your network. If you remembered that they'd mentioned that they were going to some event and you think that you might want to hire them down the road, in a non-creepy way, show up to that event. These are things that I'm constantly doing, and I think that founders can do a better job of, but just make yourself known and relevant. And then when you reach out and timing is right, it won't feel so obscure or so transactional.\n\nLenny (00:26:55):\nThat reminds me of a time at Airbnb where we had these meetups for engineers every month or so where it was a tech talk, and then all the engineers get a target engineer that is coming to the event. Like they get their profile and their picture, and their job is to make sure they have a great time and try to convince them to join someday.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:27:14):\nOh my god. But it's so real. It's similar to college trips where you're trying to get recruited for a sport, and you have to ensure that you're, yeah, just continuing to give people the best experience possible and staying top of mind for people.\n\nLenny (00:27:28):\nYeah. But I can see it being creepy, They have no idea there's this person assigned to them, but it works. It worked great. It was a great tactic.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:27:35):\nThat's awesome.\n\nLenny (00:27:36):\nI want to come back to a question that I asked, but I feel like you'll have an actual more concrete answer to the specific piece of just, what's your guidance per week how much time you should be spending on hiring broadly, and specifically, heads of product, if that's any different. Do you have any just advice? Because I imagine it's always spend more time than you think. It's going to take a lot of time.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:27:54):\nYeah, it's definitely spend more time than you think. If you are in an actual search, then you should devote all of your time to it. I know that sucks to hear, but you should be really carving out concrete time.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:28:05):\nThe thing that's tough though is you could spend, I guess what I was trying to say is you could spend one hour on something or you could spend 10 hours on it, but it's more so around, are you doing things to be impactful during that period of time? Are you actually doing things that are going to move the needle? Are you just blindly reaching out to people on LinkedIn? Because that's not going to be the way in which you're going to find the best of the best. Some of the greatest talent, they're not even on LinkedIn.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:28:32):\nAnd so I think it's building a really strong network in advance, and then once you actually get to a place where you need to hire that person, calling all of those amazing people that you've built relationships with and saying, \"Now tell me who your favorite person is and who the best person you've ever worked with is, and could you put me on a thread with them?\" How are you going to differentiate yourself from the rest of the market? So it's less in my mind like a quantitative number of hours and more of, how are you doing things differently than the rest of the market?\n\nLenny (00:29:01):\nI want to pull on this thread. Okay, so spending one hour versus 10 hours, and your point about how you could spend one hour and get as much done maybe in those 10 hours. What sorts of behaviors and actions should folks take to make use of, say, that one hour in hiring? How do you not waste your time?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:29:18):\nI mean, I would say I've got probably five of my all time favorite product leaders in the world that I tap whenever I'm kicking off a search. And they know that whenever life brings them to an opportunity where they are going to start looking or want to lean into board opportunities, that I'm going to set them up and shout their name from the rooftop, so oftentimes they're willing to point me in the right direction of great people, make those introductions, what have you, and I'm going to know simply because of how great they are that they would never put me in touch with someone that wasn't equally as qualified.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:29:55):\nSo that I think because the quality is there, so I'm not just blindly guessing on quantity, spending a ton of time on LinkedIn, and then having to call unknown entities and ask for back channel references when they also might not even feel comfortable sharing the dirt. You know? So it comes back to rapport and people that you have around you that you know you can trust and tap into and ensuring that you're spending the time in the right areas.\n\nLenny (00:30:19):\nGot it. Yeah, so tapping your network makes a lot of sense. If you don't have that yet, I guess is it worth spending time on LinkedIn just cold messaging people as a founder, and any tips there for just cold outreach that you think work for a founder doing it versus you who are a professional at it?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:30:37):\nI do think it is worth that time. If you see someone that looks amazing, hell yeah, reach out to them, spend time with them, why not? And oftentimes, again, people are excited to see, oh, this CEO and founder wants to pick my brain, doesn't look like they're coming at me to try and recruit me, but rather just to have an open-ended conversation. For sure, and they can sense. You can definitely sense that type of interaction and feel comfortable with it, whereas sometimes the walls immediately go up when someone senses that they're trying to get poached.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:31:08):\nAnd so it's I think something that's worth them doing for sure. It's just if you are going to look for a key executive and are on a time crunch, I don't necessarily think the best use of your time is blindly reaching out to executives when you don't necessarily have the expertise in knowing which companies were thriving during that period of time, which organizations were great, and which were a little bit weaker within companies. All of those things are just the inner workings of the recruiting atmosphere and technology, and I think tapping people, if you don't have the network, talk to a great recruiter or just spend some time kind of doing some research on who's great. You can ask investors or board members in your companies as to who you should be targeting. So there's always got to be one or two people that can at least point you to another three or four.\n\nLenny (00:31:56):\nThat reminds me of a tactic Gokul shared on this podcast about one of his best tricks, as you think of, if you're hiring salespeople, instead of looking for who are just the best salespeople, you look for the company that is known for being really good at sales and then you go find people there and try to poach their lieutenant types, not maybe necessarily their head of sales. Do you think that's a good move?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:32:17):\nYes and no.\n\nLenny (00:32:18):\nOoh.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:32:19):\nYes and no, because I think if the organization is incredibly good at sales then the majority of the folks are probably amazing, but you always have weak links, and just because someone has a brand on their resume at the right time, I think oftentimes CEOs and founders will do this thing where they kind over generalize, well, Amazon's Prime team at this time was amazing or something like that. It's like, they definitely could have been, but just as any other company, there's going to be people that are breakout, top 1% type individuals, and then other individuals that get to ride the wave and reap the benefits of being at the right place at the right time. And I think that's a good starting place, but then also spending time getting a little bit deeper on who the best people are within that organization. But yeah, we always start with market mapping, so determining who the best companies are within a specific area, and then I just encourage everyone to take that a layer deeper.\n\nLenny (00:33:16):\nGot it. It just comes back to your previous piece of advice. Don't assume someone that has an awesome logo is going to be great, but sometimes they are. There's a question I should have asked you at the beginning that I'm going to ask now. How many folks have you placed? How many companies have you worked with? And then also, is there a story of just your favorite person that you've placed/company you've helped hire that comes to mind?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:33:36):\nYeah. So both great questions. I've placed probably 85 executives over the course of my career, and then lots of entry level employees when I was in house, and also some great key leaders. Yeah, probably 85 searches that I've opened and closed, so that's been incredibly fulfilling work. It's also fun too on the exec side of things because you hire the VP of engineering at Postmates and you see firsthand the product change. You know, you watch those types of things happen before your eyes, which is, it's fulfilling stuff, it's really cool.\n\nLenny (00:34:09):\nAnd delivery gets there faster too.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:34:10):\nYeah, yeah, exactly. So, that's really fun. Favorite placement of all time has got to be the VP of engineering that I placed at IRL, which is, to be completely honest, a big reason that I joined that company. Alex Strand is his name, and he is just the most incredible, atypical, high emotional intelligent engineering leader. Still super technical, but has managed teams in the hundreds, built out Amazon Prime Day, then went on to build the core messaging platform at Snapchat, called him and he was like, \"Why would I ever leave? There's a ton of financial incentive and a team that I've built that all loves me.\"\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:34:54):\nAnd we got him to ultimately make a move in two weeks, which is just kind of unheard of, although it ended up being like a seven month push for a start date, but that was a big reason why I went and joined IRL was to work side by side him and help build out his team and learn to get more deep on the technical side of things. Because oftentimes, on the executive level, as mentioned before, can be sometimes more of that people management type role. And so he just felt like this unique hybrid of an individual, and yeah, you close searches and you cross your fingers and hope for the best and feel very good about it, but he was one where I had all the confidence in the world that I could not have done better. You know? I just felt so great about that. So, that was a good one.\n\nLenny (00:35:38):\nI don't know how much more confidence you could instill in a candidate joining a company than the recruiter also then joining the company.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:35:44):\nYeah, I did say that to him. I kept saying, \"And if I were to go in house, I swear this is probably the company I would do it for.\" And then about four weeks after he signed, I'd texted him and I said, \"Well, you'll never guess.\"\n\nLenny (00:35:58):\nWow.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:35:58):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:36:00):\nAmazing. What a stamp of confidence.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:36:02):\nYeah. And a full circle life moment. I sent him a box of cookies, he sent it back and said, \"Your turn.\"\n\nLenny (00:36:07):\nAnd is he still there at IRL? Awesome.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:36:09):\nYes, he is. He's great.\n\nLenny (00:36:12):\nThis episode is brought to you by Vanta, helping you streamline your security compliance to accelerate growth. If your business stores any data in the cloud, then you've likely been asked or you're going to be asked about your SOC 2 compliance. SOC 2 is a way to prove your company's taking proper security measures to protect customer data and builds trust with customers and partners, especially those with serious security requirements.\n\nLenny (00:36:37):\nAlso, if you want to sell to the enterprise, proving security is essential. SOC 2 can either open the door for bigger and better deals or it can put your business on hold. If you don't have a SOC 2, there's a good chance you won't even get a seat at the table.\n\nLenny (00:36:51):\nBeginning a SOC 2 report can be a huge burden, especially for startups. It's time consuming, tedious, and expensive. Enter Vanta. Over 3,000 fast growing companies use Vanta to automate up to 90% of the work involved with SOC 2. Vanta can get you ready for security audits in weeks instead of months, less than a third of the time that it usually takes.\n\nLenny (00:37:14):\nFor a limited time, Lenny's Podcast listeners get $1,000 off Vanta.

Get started today.\n\nLenny (00:37:29):\nI want to shift a little bit to kind of flip to the product person's perspective and talk about, how do you be successful as a product leader in finding new opportunities and giving yourself opportunities in the space? And so maybe a first question is just generally, what should product leaders and PMs focus on to give themselves the most opportunity in their career?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:37:51):\nI think breadth is incredibly important. It's so critical, especially if someone has an end goal of wanting to step into a product leadership role to have been able to have touched lots of different components, as opposed to specializing in one specific thing. So I would say that's very important, to be able to make sure that you're maximizing opportunities for yourself down the road.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:38:12):\nAnd then as mentioned before, just always keeping a pulse on the market, regardless of how happy you are in your current company, regardless of what the project is that you're so incredibly excited about that isn't going to conclude until Q1 of next year. It's just so important that you always know the companies that are doing great things and keep those windows open for people, because you never know what the next 12 months hold, and you want to be in a position where you're never running out the door looking for what's next, but rather being able to be super selective about the things that you have in front of you. And that comes with time and network building and relationship building over years, honestly.\n\nLenny (00:38:54):\nAnd when you say breadth, are you saying things like work on the platform team for a bit, work on the user facing team, maybe the internal tools team, like different types of product, or something else?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:39:04):\nExactly that. Yeah. I think there's people that probably want to just be a specialist in growth, or want to get super deep on ads, and if that's the case, then by all means, do so. And I think there's something to be said about that as well because those types of skillsets will be needed. But if you're looking to diversify your skillset, continue to grow from a career trajectory perspective and think about potentially being in a head of product type role, I think it's really important that you touch all aspects of that.\n\nLenny (00:39:38):\nI'm really happy to hear that because that's exactly the advice I give new PMs is that a variety of experience is one of the most powerful things you can do because you also just become a better PM because you can see how different types of products are built and how different types of teams operate and it just makes you better.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:39:52):\nYes. Variety of experience, I think taking a bet on doing something more entrepreneurial, starting something, and then also joining things that are a little bit later and more established to get best practices. I think diversifying your skillset within an organization but also diversifying the work in which you're doing and the companies that you're spending time with is awesome.\n\nLenny (00:40:15):\nYeah. So on that, something I'm always weary of is folks jumping around between all the fancy companies to get a bunch of logos on the resume. \"Oh, I worked at Snap and Facebook and Netflix,\" and I feel like you're just building a resume and then your life flies by, and you forget that you should enjoy the things you're doing and work on things that are fulfilling and optimized for not a great resume. And, curious your thoughts on just how often you think you should move from company to company, one to optimize for opportunities in the future, or just generally, do you recommend people try to move around or go deeper at their company? There's a bunch of questions there, but take it wherever you want to.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:41:01):\nYeah, yeah. Okay. Sounds good. I think it's an interesting one because logo collecting is never something that you want to be known for, and the first thing you're taught, like entry level recruiting 101 is recognize patterns of candidates that jump from place to place and don't give opportunities a full chance. So, you're spot on. That is definitely not something you want to be known for if you're a prospect.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:41:27):\nThere's also something to be said about staying somewhere too long though. And I will say that. I think sometimes you find people that are almost loyal to a fault, and companies have tanked and all executives have left and the writing's on the wall, and they're holding onto the fact that they were hired by a really good guy or gal and they want to make it work because they care about the human being, and I think sometimes in your career you do have to be a little bit more selfish and think about what's going to be best for you in the long haul. And so maybe that is still keeping your head down and working hard while also being thoughtful about other things that are out there and not saying hard nos to opportunities that knock on your door.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:42:12):\nSo it's one where I would say it's an art and a science because you have to be thoughtful about taking on new things and knowing when it's worth taking a bet on yourself, but also you can't run as soon as things get hard because that is recognized, and if there's a riff or an internal dispute or a new leader brought in, and that is so quick as to make you run for the fences, that's not something that people look for because startup world is hard, tech is hard. Look at the crypto world right now. Things are incredibly volatile and difficult, and you want to be able to bring people in that are going to hang with you through the highs and lows.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:42:55):\nWe're always looking to see where people moved the needle, especially on the product side, where their fingerprints were, what they can actually point to that they did and are proud of during their time there. And so if all that they can say that they did was onboarded and moved on, then doesn't matter where you were, but it's not going to be something that I can at least stand on to cheer you on.\n\nLenny (00:43:22):\nI really like that. A lot of this comes down to, what impact have you made? And I was going to touch on that, and your point is, one, kind of heuristic for how long to stay at a place at the minimum is have some meaningful impact you can point to that you led. Does that sound right?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:43:35):\nYeah, exactly. And have that meaningful impact be something that others can speak to. I think that's huge. If you built something within the organization that you're proud of but no one knows about it, then that's more difficult to have as your stamp of approval for what you are able to accomplish there. But if you did something that cross-functional leaders were speaking to, that your team all sings the praises of, then that is something that you can put a feather in the cap and say, \"Okay, I left this place better than I found it, and that's the reason that I have decided to move forward.\"\n\nLenny (00:44:15):\nAnd I imagine part of that is reference checks. People are going to check to see if you actually were successful.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:44:20):\nAll the time. Yup. Whether you are exploratory, opportunistic, not looking at all, people are constantly calling each other, and the world of tech is so, so, so small, and no matter how fired up you were leaving a company or what went sideways, it is so critical that you try to leave the place better than you found it and do so as seamlessly as possible, because you want people to have nothing but positive to say. And oftentimes, that ... The thing that I always find too is if I call 10 people that were a part of the same organization as someone during a given period of time and they can't speak to anything they did, in that case, no news is not necessarily good news. You want to have an impact, you want to be able to say, \"I did X, Y and Z. I'm super proud of this and the reason I moved on is because I did what I came in to accomplish.\"\n\nLenny (00:45:20):\nIt's a little bit innately tricky for product leaders. I imagine you run into this, that sometimes you have to upset people as a product leader to get stuff done that needs to get done and maybe they disagree and then later it's like, okay, I see what you did. Is that true? Do you deal with that or is it generally like, oh, yeah, they're the great people everyone knows, like a hundred percent of people will say they're awesome?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:45:38):\nIt's a really good question. I think there's a way to navigate conflict without rubbing people the wrong way so that they'll say negative things. There's a way to be an impactful product leader and disagree and make change, and maybe your engineering leader and design leader and marketing leader completely disagree with the direction in which you're going, but because you have all of the data to support it and because you have gone about things in a way that feels very fact first and less emotional, it's really difficult for them to then point to why they disliked this person.\n\nLenny (00:46:19):\nYeah. This is interesting. So say you make those 10 calls, in your experience, the leaders you want to hire, are you finding 10 out of 10 are generally like, \"Yes, this person's amazing, you should hire them\"?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:46:31):\nThere's ones that are slam dunks and no one has any negative to say. That's incredibly rare. More often you find some people like to just have something negative to say, just to have something negative to say. I also take all of my back channels with a grain of salt. Maybe the person I'm calling to back channel this person with I also haven't back channeled, right?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:46:50):\nSo every single thing that you hear, you just take, make note of, and then move on and think more holistically about. But I think typically what I would say is the glaring nos are very obvious. People that are polarizing individuals or have done wrong within an organization or made bad calls across the board are, you can get that information typically pretty quick.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:47:13):\nIt's the mixed ones where it's, \"I think that person was decent,\" those are pretty tough, and you need to really find people that worked super closely with them because otherwise it's pretty difficult to say whether or not they were able to make an impact. Which again comes back to why right off the bat it's so nice to just have people that you can tap within every organization that's like an academy company or a great company and say, \"Point me in the direction of the three best people.\" I don't want to have to go through the burden of having to try and back channel all of the maybe middle 50% or what have you.\n\nLenny (00:47:48):\nYeah, most people don't have that, which is a reason to hire, work with a recruiter. You come build in with all of that network.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:47:55):\nTotally. Totally there. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:47:56):\nThere's a couple things I want to touch on that I wasn't planning to touch on, but reference calls. You do a lot of them, I imagine. And I'm curious, do you have any tips for how to ask questions on a reference call where you actually get useful advice where it's not just, \"Yes, I like them, they're great. Hire them\"?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:48:11):\nEspecially on references, provided references, I've only had two candidates where provided references have come back negative, which that's tough. Outside of that, typically references are a standard. It is important to dig pretty deep and ask the hard questions.\n\nLenny (00:48:28):\nWhat's the hard questions?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:48:29):\nYeah, why would I not hire this person? What are their biggest weaknesses? And then if they give you the typical, \"Oh, if they work too hard,\" it's like, no, tell me more. What are their actual weaknesses? What are things that we should be really cognizant of? Would you hire this person again? Would you report to this person? Would you endorse this person if you knew that your name was attached to it? Things like that I think get people thinking, and even if you just sense the slightest pause, that in itself will be enough to make you think twice. Right?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:49:04):\nSo it's a lot of reading the room and probing harder than you think necessary, which is tough. But back channel references I think will always provide a greater source of truth than provided. It's similar to an Instagram Reel as opposed to the photos you're tagged in. That's the way I think of it. It's like this is what you want the world to see or think of you as, and then these are what your peers and your direct reports and the people around you actually say about the work that you did during this time.\n\nLenny (00:49:33):\nAwesome. Coming back to a point you made about recruiter training 101, you learn how to find patterns and red flags in people's resume. What else is a red flag in your resume that you want to avoid/there's a rule of thumb of like, if you're at a place for less than a year, it's bad. Is that true? How do you feel about that? How do hiring managers generally feel about that?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:49:53):\nIt definitely depends, with regards to being at a place less than a year. If that's a recurring theme, of course that's a big red flag. Even if it's happened two or three times, three definitely. If it's happened twice, it's like, \"Huh, that feels off.\" You got to let people tell their story though and their side of things, and again, it comes back to reaching out to different people and understanding if what they're saying is true was actually the truth. And so when you have a really good pulse on what's happening in tech and whether there was a riff and the reason that person was let go was actually because they weren't prioritizing a certain part of the product or whatever, like those things, it happens. That's life, especially right now, right? If we were to X every single person that has a short stint that joined a new company over the course of the past year, that wouldn't do anyone any good.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:50:44):\nAnother thing I've found that's pretty interesting is that people will often, because they're so afraid of that narrative, they'll often not include on their resume companies that they didn't stay for a year. And in my personal opinion, that's actually almost more of a red flag because that did happen, and you don't want to just pretend like that wasn't a decision you made in your life, and usually is handled with grace. You can speak to the reason that you decided to make a bet, the reason that you went there, and the reason that you moved on, in a way that people can typically resonate with. But I've seen executives just put that they've simply been advising for two years or something like that, when in reality they had two companies that failed.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:51:33):\nAnd the fact of the matter is, I have some CFO candidates I'm talking to right now and their past three years have been short stints because they were brought in to take a company through an IPO and then that changed, or they were brought in to enter into a SPAC and then that became less of the buzz. Right?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:51:51):\nSo these things happen and roles change, and I think it's just allowing people to tell their story is the most important thing. So I would say red flag is, for me, just always be honest about when you started, when you left a company. If I see that someone still has present on their LinkedIn but they've been gone for two years and they kind of are acting like they're still there, that doesn't feel good. Just want people to give you the truth, the straight facts, so that you can support them and tell their story and represent them in a way that makes you feel like you have all the details.\n\nLenny (00:52:23):\nGot it. So basically, don't lie. That makes sense. That reminds me a little bit of people kind of upgrade their titles a little bit because maybe they don't have an official title or they just want to sound a little important. How do you feel about when people do that on their resumes?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:52:35):\nYeah, I don't love that. I also don't love on the resume when people, and some people do this and it's okay, but when people say silly, vague names like they'll say something along the lines of, \"Whatever at Reddit,\" as their title or, \"Master of blank at this,\" and it's like, okay, what were you actually doing?\n\nLenny (00:52:58):\nBut I think they do that to avoid recruiters reaching out to them.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:53:00):\nExactly. As their direct target, I'm pissed. So I feel directly attacked in that regard. So that's something that throws me off, but that could definitely be a personal thing. And I think overall, for the most part, people don't have any other things that really just throw me for a loop. And the fact of the matter is, resumes we look at less and less, especially at the executive level, and it's a lot more of allowing people to tell their story, meeting in person, talking with their different people that support them, and getting kind of more of the big picture around who they are.\n\nLenny (00:53:33):\nI want to talk about what recruiters often do wrong and what you've learned there. But before we get there, one last question: do you have any tips for a product manager in the interviewing process, how to be more successful interviewing?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:53:45):\nI've had this come up a few times when I've interviewed product folks that they'll speak down on their counterparts or say that the reason they weren't able to meet deadlines or push product in the right way was because of the engineering team or because of other components of the business and it wasn't them. And so I think that's never a good way to go about it. So it seems obvious, but you would be surprised how not obvious it is.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:54:10):\nSo thinking about things more holistically, speaking honestly about your strengths and things that you want to continue to grow and improve upon, and then being able to tell your story, like practice telling your story. So often people don't do that, especially when they're not looking for jobs, and then it's not until their 10th interview that they know how to tell their story and what they did and what they impacted and why they were someone to be missed when they moved on. Those are things that you want to know how to speak to, and unless it's something you've been doing or practicing, it's less natural. That's some advice I think just off the top of the head.\n\nLenny (00:54:45):\nAwesome. That's really good advice. One thing that makes me think about, I know I want to get to this last section, but do you think the best product leaders have their kind of story figured out in the future and work backwards from that and have a sense of where they want to end up, or just kind of take it as it goes? Because I'm the latter. I had no plan, I just went to see ... follow the path that was presented. Do you think that is generally true for folks that end up being successful, or do you recommend people think about, \"Here's where I want to be in five years, here's what I need to do to get there\"? Do you have any guidance there?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:55:18):\nI mean, for what it's worth, I'm definitely more with you. I don't know where I want to be in five years, so it's tough for me to say. But I do think that typically someone that has the end goal of being a CEO will put the pieces into place to try and get there, and so it's not a bad idea if you do have an end goal of wanting to run your own thing to inch towards that. So maybe you go from being a product specific leader to then operating in some type of GM of a business unit capacity and owning a P&L, and then although it's more of a product oriented role, you're still getting closer and closer to that end goal of COO or CEO.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:55:53):\nSo if it's something like that, then I think that naturally makes sense. Do think people can be enticed by shiny objects, so excited because it's a step up from a title perspective and things like that, and I think that's just so not important in the grand scheme of things. You could be the VP of product or a CPO of what, you know? That's so vague. If someone just says, \"I want to be a chief product officer, that's the end goal,\" I always say, \"Of what?\" You could be the chief product officer of your household. Is it of a multi-billion dollar consumer brand or ...\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:56:32):\nSo I guess what I'm trying to say is work backwards from a goal for sure, but don't allow titles or valuation bubbles or other things to derail something that feels good. If you're in a role and you feel like you're making an impact and you're learning and you're growing and are excited about the work you're doing, do not allow a title of some other company to make you feel like what you're doing isn't worthwhile.\n\nLenny (00:57:01):\nI love that advice. So many people just chase some fancy new role, new title, new logo, and end up getting there like, \"Man, this sucks.\"\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:57:08):\nExactly. Yeah.\n\nLenny (00:57:09):\nThis reminds me, I did a meditation retreat once and one of the teachings there was you don't want to be fixated with achieving a specific thing, but you want to push your cart in that direction, just like head that direction and have a general sense, but not, \"I need to be that thing and that's what'll make me happy.\"\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:57:26):\nExactly. I think that's exactly right.\n\nLenny (00:57:27):\nAwesome. Okay. Final topic is from the recruiter perspective, what do you find recruiters do wrong most often or miss when they're trying to attract great product talent to a company?\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:57:38):\nYeah, so this is one I feel especially passionate about because I do think recruiters have a bit of a reputation, and I think that it's for some good reason. There's naturally people that forget that these are human beings that we're dealing with every single day that have lives, have families, have careers, or ambitions outside of their career.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:58:01):\nSo I think it's essential that you remember that this is another human being on the other end of things and that you should treat them with the same level of respect that you would expect to be treated.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:58:15):\nThis has become even more apparent now that I have gone through some of my own recruiting cycles where I was looking for different jobs, and a transactional recruiting call just will rub you so the wrong way and will make you want to put things on your resume like I just alluded to that say things like, \"Whatever at Reddit,\" or what have you because you just don't want to deal with it.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:58:36):\nAnd so I think you have to be a human, you have to start with a relationship, find common ground, build rapport, listen to people, like actually listen, and remember what they say. So if someone says, \"I never want to do a crypto company,\" and I just am only shoving crypto companies down their throat, that's just insanely tone deaf. Or if they say, \"I have this vest that I really want to be around for in May of next year,\" and I just keep hitting them up prior to that, that's just so not receptive to what they just said.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:59:12):\nThings like that, make notes if easier, because we speak to so many people all day long so it's definitely not easy to do. But I'll have a note on my calendar that John Kim's vest just happened in March, and then I'll be like, \"Oh, okay, might be a good time for me to catch up.\" I won't say, \"Congrats on the recent vest.\" I'll say, \"You want to grab a coffee, or do you want to catch up about this?\" Or, \"Hey, I saw that you were speaking at this conference, love what you spoke about with regards to this.\" You got to find ways to connect with people outside of just shoving them into a job.\n\nLauren Ipsen (00:59:46):\nAnd so I would say something that I've learned and become very good at is starting with a foundation of relationship building, gaining trust from people, because once you have that, then people will hear you out on jobs and people will listen to you and actually trust your advice from a career direction and perspective, but that takes time to build that, and it's definitely not going to be built by just chucking things at the wall and seeing what sticks with people and seeing where you can shove them temporarily. In fact, that will make them lose trust. And once you lose trust in a candidate, it's impossible to get it back.\n\nLenny (01:00:22):\nIt's interesting how one of the recurring themes of our chat so far is just play the long game in every way, which takes more time.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:00:28):\nYes.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nKind of sucks that you have to put in all this time ahead of time before you really need to get something done, but what you keep coming back to is just that's how you end up being successful as a recruiter, as a product leader, as a hiring manager, as a founder.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:00:39):\nA million percent. Yeah. Yeah. And it's really easy when you've got a quota to hit and you've got people to provide for and a mortgage to just think about the numbers, but you have to play the long game because people aren't just a commodity. It's so much more.\n\nLenny (01:00:56):\nAnd one of the perks of working with a recruiter is they have done that already for you, and so I was going to ask, when does it make sense for a founder to engage with a recruiter like yourself and when should they not?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:01:08):\nEngaging with recruiters sooner rather than later in a proactive way is always a positive thing. It's just sometimes companies aren't at the stage where they can necessarily hire a full-time recruiter because of resources and how expensive it is to bring in an exec recruiter.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:01:26):\nSo having someone that you can bounce things off of in a more informal capacity, bringing in someone like a talent advisor that can help in a consultative way, those types of things, a million percent. Leaning into the venture firms that have backed you, which is a lot of what I'm doing right now, that is definitely areas in which early CEO founders should be leaning into that and trying to get as knowledgeable as possible. And then I would say typically series B feels ... series A, dependent on the check size, and then series B feels like a good time to bring in a couple key big players, if the company's well positioned to do so.\n\nLenny (01:02:06):\nAnd bring in meaning full-time in-house recruiters or a firm?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:02:09):\nProbably bring in a firm. Yeah. That would be my recommendation. I think you can bring in one or two recruiters in the early days like seed, if it makes sense for the company and they're growing quickly, but it's all kind of case to case.\n\nLenny (01:02:22):\nThe fact that you're kind of off the table for most founders now that you're at GC, which is a part ... And is that true? Like you basically at this point work for General Catalyst founders, is that correct?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:02:32):\nI am supporting all of our GC founders in the consumer and crypto portfolio. That being said, I spend all day every single day networking and chatting with amazing entrepreneurs, people that could be founding a company down the road and need some advice, great people that want to help in an advising capacity. So it is, I would say, 50% networking, 50% actual parachuting into portfolio.\n\nLenny (01:03:00):\nGot it. Okay.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:03:01):\nSupporting them.\n\nLenny (01:03:01):\nThat's cool. I didn't know that part.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:03:03):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:03:03):\nSo outside of that, what do you suggest founders look for when they're looking for a recruiter, and the second to last question, what are signs that this is a good firm, a good recruiter? Just what should you be looking for when you're looking to hire a recruiter, either in house or a firm?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:03:15):\nI think it's important to provide them with some direction and then see if they can recite it back to you. Tell them the types of things you're looking for and then say, \"Did that resonate? Because I'd love to hear from you what you took away from that and what you think we should be looking for.\"\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:03:32):\nAnd then kind of off the bat, ask them for a couple candidate ideas. Don't give them time to just go call other people. In real time, ask them for some candidate ideas. Where does their brain go? Who are people they would call tomorrow on this? The more that you can get that dynamic relationship formed before you even go to search, the more you can determine whether this is someone you want to calibrate with.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:03:54):\nSo yeah, I think just putting them on the spot a little bit and asking them to show their work rather than just sending over a deck of searches that could have been done by other partners or could have just been done by other people on their team. You want to actually understand who this person is. So that first question is testing their listening skills and their ability to actually hear what you're saying and what you're looking for, and then the second is, okay, now how quickly can we get calibrated on what this profile should look like.\n\nLenny (01:04:21):\nAwesome. That is great advice. Very tactical. Any final words or wisdom before we get to our very exciting lightning round?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:04:26):\nThis has been awesome, by the way. I think more generally, the advice is just treat people like human beings, build rapport, play the long game, and gain trust, and that takes time. And so those are the most important things from a recruiting standpoint, is being able to tap people and have them feel like you genuinely have their best interest at heart and that you care about their career and life outside their career. And so I think that's what makes for a really good recruiter.\n\nLenny (01:04:53):\nSimple advice, but often forgotten and easy to overlook. Awesome. All right. We've reached our very exciting lightning round. I'm going to give you six questions, whatever comes to mind, we'll go through them real fast. Does that sound good?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:08):\nOkay. Yes. Let's do it.\n\nLenny (01:05:10):\nLet's do it. What are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:14):\nThe Power of Now and You Are Here.\n\nLenny (01:05:17):\nWow. Awesome. What are favorite other podcasts that you listen to other than this one?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:22):\nI mean, there's tech ones, but Your Own Backyard because I went to Cal Poly, so that one hits a little close to home.\n\nLenny (01:05:28):\nWow, I haven't heard of that. Cool. What's a recent movie or TV show that you've watched that you've enjoyed?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:34):\nTop Gun I've watched too many times and-\n\nLenny (01:05:39):\nThe new Top Gun.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:39):\nYeah. And then TV show. Oh, it's all trash reality, so I just can't tell you.\n\nLenny (01:05:45):\nI get that. I understand. My wife has that and she can't tell anyone. Yeah.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:05:51):\nThat's my one secret.\n\nLenny (01:05:51):\nAll right. Okay, great. We'll move on, but that's great. What's a favorite ... Oh, this is interesting. What's a favorite interview question that you like to ask or maybe you've seen someone ask?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:01):\nI love the good strengths and weaknesses question. I think it's really good to see how people self-analyze themselves.\n\nLenny (01:06:06):\nWhat do you look for in their answer that's the sign that it's well answered?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:10):\nHonesty, authenticity. Can read right through a, \"Work too hard,\" answer or a perfectionist type answer. What are your weaknesses? Let's talk about it.\n\nLenny (01:06:19):\nFor real.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:21):\nSo that one I think is always a really good test of character.\n\nLenny (01:06:24):\nWhat are some favorite apps right now?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:27):\nI've been playing around on BeReal. I mean, I love Spotify, it's straightforward. And then I've been on Strava, I've been running, so that are the-\n\nLenny (01:06:34):\nThat's a good combination of apps. That's like a full life.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:37):\nThank you. Thanks so much. Trying to be.\n\nLenny (01:06:41):\nFinal question. Who else in the industry would you say that you most respect as a leader and a thought leader influence type person?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:06:49):\nMy first boss out of college, Joe Suliman, is awesome. He's always taught me to lead with that relationship-based approach and it's really so easy to say that you do that, but then to actually do it and live it out for the people that work for you, as well as the people that are in industry and speak of you, is something else. And so he's always taught me to do that, and I just learned a ton from him and he's just incredibly smart and in tune with what's happening in industry and makes great stances and opinions on how to navigate those types of things. So, he's someone that I have an immense amount of respect for.\n\nLenny (01:07:24):\nSounds like an amazing person. Lauren, this was excellent. I feel like this is going to be useful to so many people, product managers, founders, other recruiters, all kinds of other people. Thank you so much for doing this and making the time. Two final questions. Where can folks find you online if they want to reach out or maybe collaborate with you and learn more? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:07:44):\nYes, absolutely. And also, thank you. This has been so much fun. They can reach out to me on LinkedIn. I happen to be on that one quite a bit, so definitely can DM me there, can send me an email, and I can shoot you that over as well. And then the way they can be helpful is if there's people that they think the world of, shoot them my way. If they have questions around best ways to go through an interview process or how to navigate different things, please, by all means, a huge part of my job is trying to help people that are going through this for the first time. Happy to just be a sounding board or of help in any capacity.\n\nLenny (01:08:19):\nSo if you're an awesome product leader, you want to see what's out there, find Lauren on LinkedIn. Is that the best place to find you?\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:08:24):\nThat's perfect.\n\nLenny (01:08:25):\nAll right. Awesome.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:08:25):\nYep.\n\nLenny (01:08:25):\nThanks, Lauren.\n\nLauren Ipsen (01:08:26):\nThanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:08:29):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Mastering onboarding | Lauryn Isford (Head of Growth at Airtable)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLauryn Isford (00:00:00):\nAn activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.\n\nLenny (00:00:24):\nWelcome to Lenny's Podcast where I interview world-class product leaders and growth experts to help you get better at the craft of building and growing products. Today my guest is Lauryn Isford. Lauryn was most recently head of growth at Airtable. Before that, she was a product growth lead at Facebook, working on user growth, internet.org, and growth of Facebook at India. Before that, interestingly, she led growth for Blue Bottle's e-commerce business. In our conversation, we dive deep into Lauryn's favorite topic, onboarding, why it's one of the biggest and most undervalued growth levers, what she's learned about optimizing onboarding flow through her work redoing Airtable's onboarding flow, what she's seen work and common pitfalls around onboarding, plus a ton of advice around figuring out your activation metric. I could talk all day with Lauryn about growth, but we had to cut this off to keep this to a reasonable length. Enjoy my conversation with Lauryn Isford after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.\n\n(00:01:19):\nThis episode is brought to you by public.com, who want to tell you about their new treasury accounts which earn a 4.8% yield on your cash. That is higher than a high yield savings account while still being backed by the full faith and credit of the US government. Treasure yields are at a 15-year high, but buying US Treasuries is super complicated if you go to a bank or navigate an ancient government website, or at least that was the case. Now you can move your cash into US Treasuries with the flexibility of a bank account, you can access your cash whenever you want, even before your Treasury bills hit maturity. There are no hold periods, no settlement days, just a safe place to park your cash and earn a reliable yield. Public will automatically reinvest your Treasury bills at maturity so you don't have to do anything to continue growing your yield, and you can manage your treasuries alongside stocks, ETFs, crypto, and any alternative assets. Do all your investing in one place and earn 4.8%, a higher yield than a high yield savings account only with a Treasury account at public.com/lenny.\n\n(00:02:24):\nToday's episode is brought to you by Miro, an online visual whiteboard that's designed specifically for teams like yours and mine. I have a quick request, head on over to my board at miro.com/lenny and let me know which guest you'd love for me to have on in 2023, and while you're on the Miro board, feel free to play around with the tool. It's a great shared space to work closely with your colleagues to capture ideas, get feedback, and iterate quickly and easily on anything you're working on. For example, in Miro, you can build out your product strategy by brainstorming with sticky notes, comments, live reactions, voting tool, even an estimation app to scope out your team sprints. Your whole distributed team can come together around a wireframe and draw ideas with a pen tool or even put mocks right into the Miro board. And with one of Miro's ready-made template, you can go from discovery and research to product roadmap to customer journey flows, final mocks, you get the picture. Head on over to miro.com/lenny to leave your suggestions. That's M-I-R-O.com/lenny.\n\n(00:03:27):\nLauryn, welcome to the podcast.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:03:28):\nThank you. I'm so excited to be here.\n\nLenny (00:03:31):\nWe've chatted a bunch over Slacks, like all these different Slacks we're in and Twitter and emails, but we've never actually chatted real time, and so I have a million questions that I want to ask you. So, thank you again for being here.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:03:42):\nWe have never chatted real time, so everybody's getting the first conversation and I'm really looking forward to it.\n\nLenny (00:03:48):\nI know that you have this pretty spicy contrarian take on experimentation and that I think you believe people run experiments too often and maybe not everything should be an experiment. Can you talk about that?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:04:00):\nYes. So, experimentation is a really big part, growth culture, growth hacking culture, PLG culture, growth marketing culture, any kind of growth, at least in my sphere, and sometimes teams can be really, really dependent on experimentation when trying to grow a business. A great example of this would be consumer growth at scale. Think your classic big social company. I worked at one of them. I am a former employee of Meta back when it was called Facebook. When you're at scale trying to grow a social app, experimenting can feel second nature. It can feel like a necessary step in your product development process that you want to drive more signups or you want to drive better activation with new customers. So, you change some buttons, change a design, and A/B test it, and then see if numbers go up or down, and then make your ship decision based on it.\n\n(00:04:56):\nI find that there's generally two reasons why a grow team wants to experiment, and one of them is to understand more precisely the metric impact of what they're building and what they're putting in front of customers, and the other is risk mitigation where you're making so many big dramatic changes that there's some risk that while this could be really great for the business, it could also be really bad and it would be good to understand that before everybody's experiencing that in production. So, with that framework in mind, sometimes you don't need to experiment. Sometimes if the business, let's say activation, right, activation rates go up 6% versus 7%, that precision actually doesn't help all that much beyond being able to say in your performance review, \"Hey, I increased activation by 7%.\" So, it also is expensive to have folks on the ground, be it engineers, analysts, product managers, spending time understanding the results of an experiment that could otherwise be spent on road mapping, on foundational analysis, on shipping things. So, experiments can be expensive.\n\n(00:06:09):\nSo, with all that said, generally my advice is to experiment when you need to and to primarily see it as a risk mitigation tactic when you're making dramatic changes and to let the product development process do more work. So, spend more time with customers, be more rigorous in understanding precisely what problem you're solving, get mocks in front of people and see how they react, and hopefully have more conviction than you otherwise would when you ship something that it's okay if every customer sees it tomorrow and that the experiment doesn't actually matter as much.\n\nLenny (00:06:44):\nIt's so interesting hearing that from a head of growth person. Working at Airbnb for a long time, and you talked about this, there's so much value put into the amount your experiment moves the metric is so important to, like you said, your performance review, your team's status, your team's ability to show they were successful. People look at like, you drove this metric 14%, which oftentimes you add up from experiments you've ran. How do you work in a culture like that, or is it just in that culture you may as well run experiments because that's the only way you get credit for the work you do, or is there a way to just be like, \"Wow, that is how we measure it, but it's still maybe not worth running everything as an experiment\"? How do you kind of find that balance?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:07:29):\nIt feels to me like that is the default culture, especially as growth teams become organizations and as those organizations grow with companies into growth stage public company territory and beyond. However, I do think you can build a different culture, and the only way to escape the trap of experimenting everything is to have a very intentional culture about doing right by customers and doing the right thing for the business. A growth team or a growth org exists in service of improving the business and delivering results for the business, and whether or not you measure those precisely in an A/B test, you still shipped them or you didn't.\n\n(00:08:09):\nSo, the rigor around your process was either there or it wasn't. This means though that there have to be other ways to motivate, reward, retain, and develop really good talent. So, a culture around the impact you had on customers as measured by qualitative feedback or as measured by deals that were closed or deals that weren't lost, or other kinds of indicators that you did the right thing for customers is important and there shouldn't be, especially in engineering within the world of growth, a culture around having to point to numbers to demonstrate your impact because if there is, then the team will biased experiments all the time, and that's not necessarily the right thing for the business. It's a very expensive cost.\n\nLenny (00:08:50):\nWow. It's so wild hearing this from, again, a head of growth, someone that's so analytical like you. Is there an example of something you launched that maybe most people would've run an experiment and you decided not to for one of these reasons?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:09:01):\nThere is a feature, a product really, that Airtable offers called Airtable Forms. It's possible you've used it. I'm not sure if you have, but-\n\nLenny (00:09:10):\nNo, I don't think so, but I will go check it out.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:09:12):\nYou can check it out. There are some new features I'm about to tell you about, so maybe that will entice you.\n\nLenny (00:09:16):\nThere we go. Scoops.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:09:18):\nSo, Airtable Forms is much like other forms products. You can create a form and then send it to anybody to submit. The people who submit your form don't need to be a user of Airtable.\n\nLenny (00:09:30):\nOh yeah, I have used that. Okay. It's just like the turn an Airtable into a form. Yes, I've used it. Okay.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:09:35):\nExactly. So, something we noticed is that there was a gap in feature parity for Airtable Forms where the submitter could not request a copy of their submission. So, I might send my T-shirt size to Lenny for a form around ordering swag for the company and then I might want to remember which T-shirt size that I ordered and get a copy of that in my email. We created that feature which as a result was gated on creating an account with Airtable, and we just turned it on and wanted to see what would happen because we knew from rigor of a wonderful product team doing robust customer analysis and also doing the data work that this is something that people wanted, that it was a feature that would bring value to customers, and that even if it didn't move certain metrics like a signup percentage, even if it might affect the mix shift of activation rate from folks who signed up, it would be net good for customers who were using forms and who were submitting them.\n\n(00:10:35):\nSo, we did roll that one out without an A/B test. It did have a big enough impact on our signup metrics that we saw at top line and didn't need the A/B test to see what was happening. And we also were able to use attribution to make some analysis possible after we rolled it out so we could learn from what was happening to the base afterward.\n\nLenny (00:10:53):\nFascinating. That's a really good example, and I imagine that helps a lot when the head of growth is encouraging the team not to run as an experiment versus a PM on a subteam, like, \"Nah, we don't need to run this as an experiment,\" because in that case you're already acknowledging that team, \"You did a great job, look at this metric. Clearly this one moved. Clearly customers want it.\" So, to your point, basically this kind of stuff has to come top down probably for it to work well.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:11:15):\nI think it does, and it also cannot be an excuse for rigor around building well and being precise in what customers need, but overall, if you can be a results-oriented organization that just wants to do the right thing and move with urgency, then in my opinion, that's the way that you can have the most impact.\n\nLenny (00:11:33):\nCool. Okay. I didn't expect to spend that much time on that question, but there's so much there. That was really interesting. What I want to spend the bulk of our time on is onboarding. Something that I found myself, and I think you agree with a lot of this but I'll confirm, is that I've done a lot of research into the growth stories of the most successful startups, and what I find, one, is that retention ends up being the thing you got to crack. If you can't crack retention, nothing else matters. And then, two, more interestingly, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest levers to increasing retention which basically A then B equal C, onboarding ends up being one of the biggest areas of opportunity for growth teams both early on and late stage. And so, I guess the first question, would you agree with that general sentiment that onboarding is this huge opportunity and often undervalued?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:12:22):\nYes, I definitely agree. It depends of course on the shape of business. Not every business should prioritize onboarding first, but if you have some sort of self-serve element of your product, if someone can give your product a try, maybe you have a playground or a sandbox demo, if there's a premium element to your pricing scheme, if you maybe offer things totally for free and don't even have monetization yet, onboarding is that first really important choke point that from which downstream of onboarding so many important metrics and results flow for the business, from converting someone to a paid customer to closing a deal to growing, how many people in an organization are using your product. So, all of that really comes back to onboarding and if you can get that right, lots of good things will follow.\n\nLenny (00:13:13):\nOkay, great. I'm glad we agreed. I already know this, but you spent a lot of time on Airtable's onboarding flow.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:13:20):\nYes.\n\nLenny (00:13:21):\nAnd so, I'm curious just to learn about what did you do over the time that you spent optimizing Airtable's onboarding experience, what kind of impact did you see through the work that you did there, and then just any big kind of general takeaways that either you think people should know or that you'll take with you to future opportunities around optimizing an onboarding experience?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:13:43):\nWe could talk about onboarding all day. This is one of my favorite things to chat about recently. So, we did have a wonderful activation team rebuild Airtable's onboarding flow over the past 12 to 18 months. This included many projects, including several big ones. So, what you've probably experienced if you signed up for Airtable recently or what you might experience if you create a new account soon is we've built an immersive wizard that we called Guided Onboarding that helped guide you through setting up your first workflow on Airtable, and in doing that reduced the cognitive load of getting started, helped you make more progress faster, and created scaffolding that more than 90% of customers would benefit from to be able to get up and running on a product that's pretty complicated. That was the first piece.\n\n(00:14:39):\nWe also then introduced some personalization to use case on top of that. So, instead of helping you build something generic, having you build something that's relevant to you. And then we also worked on ongoing education. So, once you're in a workflow, once you've built something, how do we help you level it up to go from beginner to intermediate to advanced? One funny anecdote about this is that we actually called that project The Mole, M-O-L-E, because the design pattern in product looks like a mole. It pops up from the bottom of the screen and gives you tips as you're exploring. So, those are some of the biggest changes we made. We did retire a bunch of our tooltips which were a big part of onboarding for a really long time. So, happy to chat more about that, and then also did a bunch of more incremental optimizations as well. In general, tried to take a portfolio approach to what we did.\n\nLenny (00:15:36):\nCool. Okay. A few questions real quick.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:15:38):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (00:15:38):\nWhat were the three buckets real quick? So personalization, ongoing education, what was the first one?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:15:38):\nThe first one was guided onboarding.\n\nLenny (00:15:38):\nGuided onboarding.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:15:38):\nExactly.\n\nLenny (00:15:46):\nWhat was the impact of this work, just to give people a sense of the kind of impact you can have on conversion and then whatever other metrics you looked at there?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:15:53):\nWe were working on activation for a few years before I arrived at Airtable. There was already an awesome activation team, hard at work. Overall, the investments we made in onboarding over about a six to eight month period that included the wizard, The Mole with ongoing education, and also some personalization together drove a 20% lift in activation rate for Airtable.\n\nLenny (00:16:20):\nWow. That sounds quite impactful, especially at a company at that scale.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:16:24):\nIt's awesome. I would say celebrate any clear statistical significant improvement in activation rate. It's a big victory, and credit goes to the team that really spent many, many hours with customers and designing precisely to build something that could have that big of an impact. I think it speaks to the importance of really understanding what a user needs to be onboarded well, which is not the same as what your business wants the user to be onboarded to. So, delineating those and building carefully is really what made it successful.\n\nLenny (00:16:57):\nWhich of these three buckets would you say had the biggest impact? Because I want to kind of get a couple levels deeper to get to what exactly did you do that worked really well.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:17:05):\nI would say that the guided onboarding wizard which is the immersive wizard that helps you figure out how to get started was the most impactful thing we did.\n\nLenny (00:17:14):\nAnd it's interesting that you had tooltips and this feels like a tooltip-y thing. What is it conceptually? What's the simple way to think about the onboarding wizard versus a bunch of tooltips telling you like, \"Hey, Lauryn, click here, next go here, and then check this thing out\"?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:17:26):\nTotally. Imagine being in a step-by-step guide where you are asked question, for example, pick which kind of project you're working on, pick what kinds of things you'd like to track for this project, and then as you select from beautiful, easy-to-click buttons that require very little work on your part, something is visualized for you on the right half of the screen. So, you can see your workflow visually come to light as you do the work on the left half of the screen, and all of this is done for you in a very guided and instructive way.\n\nLenny (00:17:59):\nAre there any generalized learnings from that experience of just how to do a great onboarding experience? It sounds like probably avoid tooltips, instead just kind of ask questions and show them progress as they're going through it in kind of like an immersive experience versus here's the product, check out all the cool features.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:18:18):\nI think there is something to be said for reducing reliance on tooltips, but I'm not sure I would go so far as to say the tooltip is dead, as much as I maybe would like to because there are too many of them out there. The reason for this is that I do believe Airtable's customers had a very specific need which was that the effort required to build basic scaffolding was too much and they needed more support, guardrails, bumpers to help them through that, and this kind of guided or immersive wizard was the best mechanism we could come up with to reduce that effort required and to make them feel more supported in their journey. I'm not sure that this pattern is one that works for every product. I think it's one that works well for a complicated product, where figuring out where to go next and how to get started is actually very challenging or has a high cognitive load.\n\n(00:19:14):\nSo, I would keep that in mind, but in this case, it did work really well for us. I have seen some other products in the wild adopt similar patterns which gives me confidence that it is transferrable beyond Airtable and that there's probably something to it. That's definitely a big learning. I think one other big learning for us was that we had to meet users where they are. We have some awesome advanced features of really cool stuff you can do with Airtable, automations being a great example. However, users don't necessarily need to get that started on day one. They don't need to learn about the advanced stuff when they haven't even looked at a workflow before. So, we really worked hard to prioritize what the user actually needed and to consider what was necessary education versus what could be ongoing education and building it up.\n\nLenny (00:20:06):\nCan you talk a bit more about what that was? What did you actually do to understand the type of user, and then what did you change for them? Because we actually did something like this at Airbnb, and it was a tiny bit successful for host onboarding but it wasn't anything big. And so, I'm curious what it is you specifically did. Did you ask them a few questions and then grouped them in a group and then changed the way the rest of the flow went, or, yeah, what'd you do there?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:20:31):\nGood question. So, at the very, very beginning, we sort of said new users broadly need help. Who are they? What do we know about them? How can we help them? We spoke to a bunch of customers and also watched them get started and looked for patterns in behavior and also clusters. So, someone who is familiar with databases, somewhat technical and prefers to and has experience in building things might have a different need from onboarding than someone who is exploring a tool that was recommended to them for a project minute. With that in mind, there were some clear segments of personas or buckets of users that we could split out to give different experiences. Now that said, when we rolled out the guided onboarding wizard, it was actually just one generic onboarding that was one-size-fits-all, and while escape patches are great, we felt like we could solve, as I think I referenced earlier, more than 90% of use cases or users needs with one generic onboarding to start and then we could personalize from there.\n\n(00:21:34):\nWhen we started to personalize, generally we found bucketing customers by their learning style and their building style was more effective than more classic segmentation, like do you work in marketing, do you work in product management, do you work in operation. The reason for this is that there are many different types of building or workflows that are possible in Airtable. Some are sophisticated for use at work, some are simple for use at work, some are somewhere in between and are for a hobby use case or a consulting use case. Knowing how someone would go about building was more effective than what do you actually want to see on the other side.\n\n(00:22:19):\nThis means that something like a template which can give you an example of how to build a use case for project management can be helpful for inspiration but might not actually be the best way to teach you how to use a product like Airtable, when instead, we could learn that you're someone who needs more familiarity with databases to be able to get to the next level, or who might need a more visual learning experience instead of a more data-forward learning experience. So, we tried to segment the experience that way and found that that yielded better results on activation than some of the more traditional segments.\n\nLenny (00:22:52):\nAnd how did you decide which segment that a user was in? Was it a question you asked them right at the beginning?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:22:57):\nWe had a really awesome research team that would do some surveys and conversations with customers away from our production experience and away from individual projects. So, we had a really robust read going in to the project of who these different personas were, different building types, different learning types. That said, we do also ask folks when they sign up some questions and depending on who you are or what we might think we know about you or want to know about you, we might ask you different questions and that's in service of helping you get started.\n\n(00:23:27):\nI had some big ideas for how we might bring this to life even further that might come to life in the future, such as if somebody's there to just help out, if they're may be a teammate rather than a builder, if they're just there to work with someone else because Lenny invited Lauryn to work on her table because he needed Lauryn to do something or update a sprint, whatever. Lauryn needs really different onboarding than Lenny. So, actually getting that data in the flow is really useful because then we can route customers to a fully different experience. It's amazing how much low-hanging fruit there is to personalize and segment that onboarding experience in so many products that are out there. You just need to be really detail-oriented and precise on who you're working with.\n\nLenny (00:24:11):\nYou talked about this experience as activation, and so just digging a little bit further into that idea. One of the important kind of metrics, milestones you got to figure out when you're working on onboarding is what is an activated user, what's the activation milestone, what's the activation metric. I know you have some strong opinions and some really interesting insights into activation milestones based on your experience at Airtable. Can you chat a bit about that and just share what Airtable's activation metric ended up being?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:24:37):\nYes. So, overall, every growth team needs a north star metric. It's so important to have singular focus on what the business results are that you are working to drive in your team. On our activation team, which as I mentioned focused on onboarding, though in theory there could be other ways that you want to focus on driving activation, we had one north star metric which was what we called our team activation metric. So, this representative, a team of people were activated on Airtable's product and using it in a way that suggested they would be long-term retained. For us, that was week four, multi-user, meaning in the fourth week, more than one person on that team is active and contributing to a workflow on Airtable.\n\n(00:25:23):\nThis metric is something that our wonderful analytics team determined to be highly correlated with long-term retention. It's also a metric that holds a relatively high bar, so it requires a number of things to be true, that something of substance has been built, that people persist and continue to collaborate, that they're collaborating on a weekly cadence, and also holds a relatively high bar on exactly how they're contributing, meaning that the sum total of this is somewhat hard to achieve which means that we have a hard job and also a high bar as an activation team to achieve that for as many customers as possible.\n\n(00:25:58):\nIn general, I think an activation rate that falls in a lower percentage range, maybe for most companies five to 15%, is better than one that falls in a higher percentage range because it means that there's likely much higher correlation with long-term retention and you're really working hard to get most of your users to reach a state that they're not reaching today.\n\nLenny (00:26:22):\nI really like that heuristic. So, the idea there is when you're picking an activation metric, you want it to be in the single digits potentially because you're saying that's more likely to be correlated with retention because retention's probably pretty low long term. Is that kind of the rough idea?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:26:38):\nThat's a rough idea. Of course, the metric should be correlated with retention no matter what, but if 40% of your customers are still active at week four maybe with a metric that would be week four active rate, then only a fraction of those are still going to be active in month 12, in month 18, and month 24, and I would much prefer to pick a more specific, more precise metric that maybe only 5% of users reach, but know that those 5% of users will be with us for the long haul, and if we could get that 5% even to 6% or 7%, it would have huge downstream effects on long-term metrics for the business. So, that's why I would opt for a more specific metric.\n\nLenny (00:27:22):\nOkay. So, this activation metric, week four multi-user active is a really interesting metric. Can you talk a bit about how you actually operationalize this and put this to work on your team to help people understand what to work on and make sure they're moving the right sorts of numbers?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:27:39):\nTotally. So, one of the first things that we did when me and my team started to revisit week four multi-user active right before we started to rebuild onboarding is break that metric down into all of its component. So, if you really think about what goes into that number, how many teams sign up as a team versus as an individual, how many of them make it to week four, how many of them have more than two people invited versus more than two people who've ever been active, versus more than two people who were active in the fourth week, maybe they have one person active in the fourth week, and then what does active mean, and what are the different kinds of behaviors that constitute contribution or being active. Doing that really detailed work on the metric helped us understand what levers we could pull to have a really big impact on activation overall.\n\n(00:28:34):\nAdditionally, we actually started using more metrics. So, we didn't just use our activation rate metric week four multi-user active to make all of our decisions. We introduced a few more, and one of them with purely a retention metric for an individual. Are you week two retained? Are you week four retained? The other was what we called Build with a capital B, and this was roughly a sophistication score. So, for someone who's building something, have they reached sort of intermediate levels of use of Airtable? The reason why we added these metrics is we were building new mechanisms for onboarding that were helping users build more effectively and find more value in Airtable, but sometimes those treatments helped users become more sophisticated but didn't help them invite more teammates, or sometimes those new mechanisms made someone more interested in giving us a shot for a few more weeks, but what they built was actually not any more impressive than if they had done it on their own.\n\n(00:29:38):\nSo, this group of metrics actually really set us free. It gave us those constraints where we could actually measure success in a few different ways and think about activation as being more complicated than just a single metric and celebrate anything we could do to help on a couple of dimensions. So, I know it's a little unconventional to have a few metrics that you work with, but we did find that that was really helpful when we were making big changes.\n\nLenny (00:30:04):\nThat is actually really interesting. So, it makes it feel like the core activation metric you talked about was more of an output metric and you kind of realized here's the things we could actually be moving directly. Is that roughly how you thought about it?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:30:15):\nExactly. It also helped us grapple with some of the tensions we felt which I know a lot of teams working on activation and onboarding feel, which is picking one metric doesn't paint the whole picture of what you're trying to achieve when you help a user onboard to your product and when you educate them about what's possible. So, in having sophistication and retention and an element of team use all as part of the fabric of how we talked about activation, it made us much more well-rounded as a team.\n\nLenny (00:30:46):\nThat connects a bit to, so we worked on this post together about how to choose an activation metric and you shared part of this story for that post, and there's a little bit of a debate amongst folks that contributed their opinion on how to decide an activation metric, where it's a debate between is it okay to have a workspace activation metric where it's like how many boards somebody creates, how many Airtables somebody has created versus a user action, like user has created 10 tables or user using it two times a week. I think you're on the side of workspace is maybe a more interesting metric for a collaboration tool, and it's interesting that you end up with both in the end which I think is kind of where folks landed. You probably look at how's the company using this tool and then per user, are they using it consistently. So, I guess the question is just what's your take on user specific activation metric versus workspace level activation metric?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:31:39):\nI really like this question. I agree it is a great debate. I'm not sure there's a clear answer because it does depend on your product. In the case of Airtable, which is a product that has seat-based pricing and generally horizontal adoption, it totally makes sense to have a workspace activation measure because you want to understand in an account, in an organization how many folks are actually using a product and finding value. That can be different for tools that might look like Airtable but have different mechanisms for growth or different pricing or different vertical personas that tend to adopt it. So, I do think there is some variance. I do have a reaction to share with you that's a little spicy-\n\nLenny (00:32:19):\nPlease.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:32:20):\n... is that it's important that growth teams are agile and this means that north stars, key metrics, focus metrics will change, and if you're working on the same metric forever, there's probably some inefficiency in actually chasing the biggest impact for the business. So, I would be open-minded about if a workspace or team or account activation metric is always the right thing to focus on. Team activation looks really healthy because your growth team did some really amazing work on it, maybe user retention is the right place to focus next year. Maybe it's more about conversion. Maybe it's more about some other signal for long-term retention, and I would be open to being dynamic and changing that metric over time. Stability in metric is great, it helps with momentum, it helps with building expertise, but sometimes we overfocus on picking the perfect north star metric and by the time you feel like you've found the perfect one, it's actually time to move on to something different and work on a different opportunity.\n\nLenny (00:33:24):\nThis episode is brought to you by Eppo. Eppo is a next generation A/B testing platform built by Airbnb alums for modern growth teams. Companies like Netlify, Contentful, and Cameo rely on Eppo to power their experiments. Wherever you work, running experiments is increasingly essential, but there are no commercial tools that integrate with a modern grow team stack. This leads to wasted time building internal tools or trying to run your experiments through a clunky marketing tool. When I was at Airbnb, one of the things that I loved about our experimentation platform was being able to easily slice results by device, by country, and by user stage. Eppo does all that and more, delivering results quickly, avoiding annoying prolonged analytics cycles, and helping you easily get to the root cause of any issue you discover. Eppo lets you go beyond basic click-through metrics and then set you to north star metrics, like activation, retention, subscriptions, and payments, and Eppo supports test on the front end, the back end, email marketing, and even machine learning clients. Check out Eppo at geteppo.com, get E-P-P-O.com and 10x your experiment velocity.\n\n(00:34:34):\nIs there an example of that that comes to mind when you talk about being a little stuck on a metric? Is that something you went through at Airtable or anywhere else you worked?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:34:43):\nI've gone through it plenty of times. We actually at the organizational level on the Airtable growth award changed our north star metric a couple times which is a big deal that manifests for several teams. Roughly the arc of that change for us was shifting from being a growth org focused on revenue to a growth organization focused on user growth and customer growth. This for us was a really important moment where we decided that it was most essential in our work to grow the business to bring millions more people onto the platform, using the product and finding value in the product, because we were taking a decade's long view that they could always become monetized or converted customers later, and there wasn't really a rush. We felt that focusing on revenue led us to make some decisions that were a bit more short-term oriented than would be ideal.\n\n(00:35:39):\nThere's also a dynamic here where in the world of enterprise SaaS, the world of B2B SaaS, there's a new theme called product-led sales that's very hot right now, and this means that often in a PLG company there's some ideal end goal of handing off certain customers to have a sales conversation or to close an enterprise contract. In that case, you might actually prefer to delay revenue for months or quarters or years to manifest it later, and when that's the case, your growth team should be fully aligned in lockstep with sales and with go-to-market team and focusing on user growth is actually the right call. So, that's an example of a big pivot that we made, and in doing that, we felt more strategic clarity and were able to move faster.\n\nLenny (00:36:25):\nThat is an awesome story. How long did that process take and any advice for folks that might be going through a similar journey of maybe we should rethink our north star metric not and not be revenue? Any advice there?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:36:36):\nIn general, I would say having stability in north star metric for at least six months feels like table stakes to me and that's for the reasons that I cited before, for building momentum, for building domain expertise, and also for compounding impact in areas where you see success, where you notice growth flywheels that you can optimize. However, if you're reaching a point where that north star metric feels like it's old news, maybe you're outgrowing it, maybe you want to work on different things, I think that's great. Be open-minded about changing it up. I would generally try to start with the mechanics of the business and what you think you might be able to drive in terms of metric impact with the resources you have on your growth team. That can look different for every growth team because some of them have marketing, some are more product and engineering, some are kind of a mix of both or even something different than that.\n\n(00:37:27):\nSo, I would start with what impact do we think we could have? Where do we think the biggest opportunity is to chase? You can literally draw a funnel on a whiteboard and map it out and brainstorm together, do some analysis on the side, and when you see what opportunity feels like the most important thing to chase, try to build a north star metric that reflects the output of that work, rather than drives all of your decision-making from the beginning. A north star metric should really be a measure of what you plan to do, the strategy you plan to deliver is delivering results for the business on the other side, rather than the other way around.\n\nLenny (00:38:05):\nSo, you mentioned trials and freemium at one point and I want to spend a little time on this, and I know you also have some strong opinions about this kind of debate. Another debate people have, there's always debates in growth, between offering a trial or offering a freemium product, self-serve, and I think your perspective is you should do both, and I think maybe you call it a reverse trial because I was doing some research. So, I guess is that true?, Is that how you see the world, and then just generally, why do you believe that that is the right approach?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:38:31):\nWhat is it about all these growth people with their strong opinion?\n\nLenny (00:38:34):\nRight?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:38:35):\nI guess I have so many of them. You're educating me on my own perspectives today. Freemium and free trials. So, to get on the same page with definitions for all of our wonderful listeners, a free trial is when you can use the product for free for a limited time and then your only option beyond that limited time is to pay for use of the product. Freemium would be when there are multiple options for how to use the product and one of those options is an infinitely free version of the product. So, you can use Airtable for free forever or you can pay some amount and have access to premium features.\n\n(00:39:14):\nSo, with all that in mind, personally I'm in the camp of offering a reverse trial. Funky name, but what that means is offer a trial but also offer freemium. Do both. The reason why I like this is you get an opportunity when somebody shows up and says, \"Hey, I'm going to give your product a try today,\" to show them everything that's possible. Onboarding is a huge component of that. Help somebody get started, have those aha moments and experience initial value, but also this is your moment to showcase everything that can be done with your really cool product, and you have some limited number of days, maybe seven days, 14 days, 30 days, to showcase all of the cool things that your company is building for your customers. That is the beauty of a free trial. It's not just that someone can try your product without paying. It's that they can try even more of the product, all of the premium, amazing advanced offerings that could be possible if they decide they want to settle on a premium plan.\n\n(00:40:17):\nWhen you are deciding if this is something you want to do, I would actually take a big step back from looking at competitive pricing pages and getting into the details and reading blogs and just think about what your philosophy is as a business on monetizing customers. The reason for this is generally the reason to offer a free plan or a free trial but really a free plan, the freemium type of pricing model is if you value letting millions, tens of millions of customers give your product a try, even if they never pay you a dollar. That shows to me prioritization and value of user grab, brand awareness, and exposure of your product more than just revenue. And if that's the case, a freemium pricing structure can be really great for your product, and it give you the space to see if your product can become that household name that everybody is familiar with and can give a try and get some early value and even experience some aha moments.\n\n(00:41:24):\nOn top of that, you can offer a free trial to show what's possible with premium value and then that really can just be focused space for you to say, \"Hey, look what's possible if you pay us $5 a month, $10 a month,\" and you might even get some extra conversion out of that and some more paid customers. So, in general, that's how I think about it. I like the reverse trial because user growth is important and if you're in a long game where you're trying to grow a business for a decade or more, ideally you're trying to get millions of people onto your product and you can always have that monetization conversation later, but you only get a couple moments where you can say, \"Hey, pull out your credit card or let's get on the phone and talk about an enterprise contract,\" with a customer before you lose trust or lose patience. And so, that focus on helping them discover value and build loyalty to you is much more important.\n\nLenny (00:42:13):\nI really like this concept, a super cool name too. I'm also thinking back to some of the SaaS tools I've used that have had this where I go straight into the pro plan and then I'm like, \"Oh, I don't want to lose all these features,\" and then I actually end up buying it. So, when I'm hearing this, it sounds to me like it's a better version of the freemium approach. I imagine there's still many SaaS tools that are very enterprise-y, take handholding, maybe this goes away. I know Elena Verna who's been on the podcast is just a huge proponent of everyone will be product-led, self-serve eventually, but until that day they're still like, I don't know, I think of Retool I think is very hands-on, handhold-y, front I think is like that. There's all these tools that people don't get really quickly.\n\n(00:42:57):\nAnd so, I guess do you still think there's a need for some of these tools that need sales and customer success involvement to stick with just trial at least for now, or do you think they should all kind of find a way to get to self-serve and a reverse trial?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:43:12):\nI do really agree with what Elena said. I really look forward to the day when self-serve and freemium are possible for every product, but I also recognize that that can be really expensive to build and implement and is not for everyone. So, that's cool too. There are other options. In general, I think freemium and also free trials tend to be most effective when there's something that the person who signed up can actually do on their own without being handheld. It doesn't have to be full functionality. It can be exploring a sandbox or a demo or something they can poke around in and experience value, see that aha moment. That's great. That's a moment where you can give value to that person who's chosen to spend time with your product. If that's not possible, there are different ways to be creative that don't require having premium pricing. You can think about how to use concepts related to PLG and related to top of funnel adoption in different ways.\n\n(00:44:16):\nSo, maybe you can create custom landing pages or experiences that help showcase value without a full signup or free plan or free trial experience. Maybe you give folks the ability to sign up and while they've sort of signed up as an interested customer, they're not fully experiencing things, they might not even have the option to pay for something yet, but they can learn. There's some resources. There's some education for them to experience. Or, maybe you can think about top of funnel adoption or traffic as being most helpful for extension within customers you already. So, if you've signed contracts with a couple really large Fortune 500 companies and somebody wants to join and signs up on your website from the same email domain, then you can provide an experience for them that might feel like it helps them learn the mechanics that's actually only available to folks who are part of organizations that already have contracts with you.\n\n(00:45:19):\nIt's a different way of thinking about PLG and not necessarily something you would offer for free, they're already an enterprise customer, but some of those concepts can still have a lot of value and help you grow the footprint of an account in an organization, and those are definitely awesome things to try if you can't offer something self-serve.\n\nLenny (00:45:36):\nSo, what I'm hearing is find ways to make things some component of it self-serve so that you don't need to necessarily talk to someone immediately. They can start to understand some element of it on maybe an interactive planning page or some very simple part of the product.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:45:50):\nExactly. I think the key is to figure out what it would be like for someone to experience value when there's no human sitting next to them, and that value doesn't have to be full functionality of the product.\n\nLenny (00:46:02):\nAwesome. Coming back to onboarding, and this is my last onboarding question, I have another topic I wanted to touch on. Do you have any just general pieces of advice, either probably this will work if you're working on onboarding/things that probably won't work and are common traps that people fall into when they're trying to optimize onboarding activation flows in general?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:46:26):\nI do see a very common trap that I would love to caution against, which is that employees of a company build onboarding for customers, but they build what they think customers want rather than what customers actually want, and that manifests in an onboarding experience that's not very helpful. So, there are two patterns that I typically see. One is naming features. So, imagine you're using Airtable for the first time and you see a tooltip and it says, \"This is automations,\" and it explains what automations is to you. That's not that useful for a user who doesn't really know what's going on yet because they aren't sure if automations are relevant to them, if they're suited to their use case, what exactly the word automation entails. We've named a feature, but it's really sort of an announcement of something awesome that Airtable built, rather than an application that can help educate the user on how they'll receive more value from that feature. Try not to name features. It can be very tempting in practice, even though it sounds easy in theory.\n\nLenny (00:47:32):\nBefore you move on, what have you learned about how to actually name things in such a way people understand? Is there some you do there?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:47:39):\nOoh, naming things in a way people understand.\n\nLenny (00:47:41):\nVersus the feature name, like you just said.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:47:43):\nSo, instead of that, I think what would be more useful, given the constraints of using a tooltip that's pushing someone to try an automation would be to explain how the automation is relevant to them, or even better, to enable a one-touch turn-on of the automation feature or set up an automation to complete your workflow where we actually do some of the work and if you click into here, we will show you what value is possible and help you get it to the finish line. So, really focusing on that contextual application or helping to drive towards an outcome, rather than just educating on a name.\n\nLenny (00:48:23):\nAnd there's an element of smart defaulting, just like starting to do it for them versus do you want this or not.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:48:29):\nExactly. There's also an element here of segmentation or personalization where you should be sensible about if everybody needs to know what an automation is or if there are only certain folks who actually need to learn about it and others might not need to know.\n\nLenny (00:48:42):\nAwesome. All right. Back to your other suggestions.\n\nLauryn Isford (00:48:46):\nOh yes, there is one other suggestion which is if you're working on a SaaS product, especially a freemium product, there's probably some pricing and packaging scheme that explains which features are available for free, which features are not, how many you get, and sort of maps out usage of the product, both for free users if you offer a free plan, and then for premium users if you offer premium plans. I find sometimes teams working on onboarding will map onboarding to that pricing or packaging. So, for example, maybe automations, to use the same example of the same feature, is something that's generally premium, that if somebody uses automations they're more likely to be a paying customer. It can be tempting then for an onboarding team to try to push automations to people when they're getting started because of course, we'd prefer if customers use premium features because then they might be more likely to become premium customers, but that is not in the best interest of educating a user on how to get started.\n\n(00:49:44):\nSo, I do think it's very important to be careful that you are rooted in the customer need and rooted in helping that customer achieve maximum value, rather than sitting in the priors of what your packaging scheme might suggest or what might be in the best interest of the company.\n\nLenny (00:50:02):\nAs a growth leader, how do you operationalize that? Is it set some drag metrics? Is it just philosophically, let's make sure we're optimizing the right metric? What's worked to actually avoid that problem?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:50:15):\nI think north star metrics help because a team can be singularly focused on the most important result for their roadmap and their charter. However, guardrail metrics are equally important. So, an onboarding team that builds amazing onboarding that causes a 10% drop in revenue would need some sort of guardrails to make sure that they knew that that might not be the right trade for the business, and importantly, should have the rigor and passion to go deep and understand what caused that drop in revenue and figure out what it was about that onboarding that ultimately caused a guardrail metric to suffer. So, with that in mind, I think guardrail metrics can be very useful and are important to choose wisely. I love working with strong analytics partners on a growth team because rigor and education around how to think about guardrail metrics is something that we should always be thinking about, whether you are a data analyst in functional specialty or a PM or an engineer or a designer.\n\n(00:51:19):\nSo, that's how I kind of like to think about it. I do think guardrail metrics help and then just being well reasoned and thinking about what's best for the business and speaking about your work as being what's best for the business and the customer overall, rather than being too narrow in your own swim lanes of what you work on.\n\nLenny (00:51:35):\nGreat advice. I want to shift to a different topic and this will be much shorter. You have this really cool framework for thinking about the PLG funnel, product-led growth, and interestingly kind of trickles down to the team you build, metrics you choose, and things like that. So, can you just briefly talk about just this framework that you use to think about PLG growth in the PLG funnel?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:51:55):\nWhen I think about how to grow with PLG in a business that has some element of PLG, self-server, freemium, I usually start with a funnel that roughly maps to the same scaffolding, regardless of business. Whether I've worked on the business, whether I'm supporting the business as an advisor, I love starting with this framework. The first step is join, the second is evaluate, the third is upgrade, and the fourth is expand. This funnel represents the journey of a customer in a PLG product as they advance and develop in their lifetime of using the product. It starts with becoming a part of the account that's using the product or signing up, and you might join because you found Airtable on Twitter or you might join because Lenny invited you to use Airtable. So, there are different ways that you can join that product in the first place.\n\n(00:52:55):\nThen importantly, you evaluate if it's right for you, and that word choice of evaluate is deliberately not onboard or activate because it's about what the user needs to see that they are going to get the value that they want in using your product and in building a habit around it. Next is upgrade. Ideally, someone has gone from beginner to intermediate or even advanced in their ongoing education and in getting to know your product over some amount of time and they see premium value and raise their hand and say, \"I will convert to it.\" Now if you offer self-serve premium plans, that's awesome. They can do it with a credit card right in the product. Sometimes this means raising their hand to talk to sales and that's great too, but they upgrade to some sort of premium experience or to more value than what they have when they got started.\n\n(00:53:43):\nAnd finally expand, and vertical says this can be nuanced but with more horizontal tools. Ideally, a few folks, maybe one, maybe a few are using a tool in an organization and then many more adopt it over time, and that expansion drives net dollar retention, it drives brand awareness, it drives more usage in more pockets of the company, it is awesome for renewal rates if you're working with enterprise contracts, and ultimately then also brings new referrals into the product that loop all the way back to the beginning at join.\n\nLenny (00:54:19):\nI love it. And what's cool is upgrade and expansion kind of bake in retention. You're not going to upgrade, you're not going to expand if you're not retained. Can you talk a little bit about how you use this framework? Do you bucket? Do you have these four teams on your growth team that focus on each of these stages? Is it more of a conceptual framework? Do you come up with KPIs for each of these steps? How do you actually operationalize this concept?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:54:40):\nI think this framework is a step to abstract to represent exactly how you should structure your teams or to be represented with four metrics, for KPIs. However, it's a really good conceptual way of grounding your team or your organization in the mechanics of how machine that is the business you work on run. From there, it can become much easier to communicate with each other on where you see opportunity on specific pockets of the product that might be impactful. So, for example, you might be working on a strategy related to landing pages and be able to name that that's going to help drive joins in new organization, and that's a really awesome way to communicate why you might invest there versus investing in something related to onboarding that would help with evaluate.\n\n(00:55:32):\nSo, I love this framework because it helps everyone communicate clearly and also you can derive from it more specifically what are the opportunities that are relevant to us with this framework in mind, and then revisit it over time to gut check if you feel like maybe what you're investing in now is a bit outdated and needs a refresh, or if there are other pockets of the business that need more attention that you might be able to work.\n\nLenny (00:55:58):\nCan you talk a bit about how you structured the growth team potentially based on this framework and just generally how you thought about building the growth team at Airtable?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:56:06):\nWe had what I think is a pretty relevant set of teams. If you're thinking about building out a few in your own product or organization that focuses on sort of a PLG shape of business, we had one team working on acquisition and they were really responsible for the join. So, they mapped actually really well to this funnel. One team working on activation and they mapped pretty closely to evaluate. It wasn't a full representation of what's possible in evaluate. We were pretty focused on the self-serve business and that was different than, for example, helping an enterprise customer evaluate the right offering for them, but that activation team was most closely tied to that second step in the funnel.\n\n(00:56:50):\nAnd then we had a monetization team that worked on monetization and pricing and they mapped really closely to the upgrade part of the funnel. They did touch some other things as well. So, they worked on churn prevention and downgrades. They worked on some billing related projects, but in general, they were most thematically aligned with that upgrade step of the funnel. One area that is more emerging that's interesting is expand. So, when we got started on Airtable growth, we didn't have a team dedicated to that expand piece and it became increasingly interesting to us over time as we started to notice that larger companies were using the product. This meant that there was a bigger opportunity than there had been before to really help drive expansion and get more folks using the product in those accounts. That's an area that emerged later. That's a really good example of revisiting your priors and being resilient or agile in your org structure because it wasn't something we set out to work on initially, but it became a really clear opportunity later.\n\nLenny (00:57:53):\nYou mentioned that Airtable is thinking a little bit more about B2B growth versus just kind of B2C where I think it's been historically. Can you talk about that and just how you're thinking about that?\n\nLauryn Isford (00:58:04):\nB2B growth is an emerging space for growth practitioners and hobbyists like me because the playbook hasn't been written the same way that B2C growth or consumer social growth has been. It's a new space, and there are quite a few companies that are really excited about exploring B2B growth and how to apply the DNA and the mechanics of a growth organization to more of that B2B motion or to working with more upmarket customers or enterprise customers. So, it's very top of mind for me. It's a active conversation in the growth community, especially in San Francisco. Overall, I'm really excited to see what we can do by applying this approach to growing businesses, to new types of businesses. It will require some differences in execution model. So, in B2C or in consumer social as two examples, you can experiment at large volumes or you can make changes that impact thousands or millions of people pretty easily.\n\n(00:59:15):\nIn B2B growth, generally you're working with a much smaller set of customers and also the risk profile can be very different because smaller numbers of customers that represent larger percentages of your company's total revenue must be treated with absolute care, as opposed to a world where you might have millions of folks coming through your product every day and small changes might not have as big of an impact. In an enterprise organization, it's important to be very careful and rigorous and to prioritize that customer's needs all the time. This means that rigor, that customer conversations, that beta testing, that live prototypes and demos are significantly more important and that face time with the customer is significantly more important than it is in B2C growth. So, we'll see what happens. I'm really excited to see more folks who have given growth a try in B2C or in consumer spaces try applying it to B2B because it will become increasingly common in the industry.\n\nLenny (01:00:19):\nWell, with that, we have reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got six questions for you. I'll go through it pretty fast. Are you ready?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:00:27):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (01:00:28):\nAll right. First question, what are two or three books that you recommend most to other people?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:00:34):\nRide of a Lifetime by Bob Iger. I give this to new reports on my team. Great book to read when you're thinking about your leadership style, and Rocket Men, really fun story. I love a good story about ambition and achieving awesome things.\n\nLenny (01:00:50):\nWhat's a favorite other podcast, other than the one you're currently on?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:00:54):\nI like Fifth & Mission which is a local San Francisco podcast on local politics.\n\nLenny (01:01:01):\nFavorite recent movie or TV show that you have watched that you've really enjoyed?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:01:05):\nI really like the White Lotus Season 2. White Lotus was very fun to watch. I also, on the movie front, I'm in a habit of watching Best Picture nominees every year and last year there were a couple movies I really enjoyed, one of them was Belfast.\n\nLenny (01:01:22):\nOh man, that was an intense movie. I watched that recently. And also, if we should turn this into a drinking game, every time someone mentions White Lotus, we drink. It's an amazing show, but it's definitely comes up often. So interesting.\n\nLauryn Isford (01:01:35):\nComes up too much.\n\nLenny (01:01:37):\nIt deserves to come up often. I love it.\n\nLauryn Isford (01:01:39):\nThat's true.\n\nLenny (01:01:41):\nIt's great, but that'd be okay. We're going to do a drinking game from now on and I'll have a shot here. Love White Lotus. Favorite interview question that you like to ask people?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:01:50):\nTell me about a time that you delivered something that was impactful.\n\nLenny (01:01:58):\nWhat do you look for in an answer when you ask that question? What's your kind of a good sign and what's maybe a bad sign?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:02:02):\nI'm looking for someone to help me understand how they define impact and what it means to them. I think a good answer for growth practitioner is intrinsic motivation about having an impact on the business.\n\nLenny (01:02:19):\nHear, hear. What are five SaaS products that you use day to day, and you can't say Airtable?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:02:25):\nFigma, Miro, Slack, Gmail, and my fifth one, I need to think about it.\n\nLenny (01:02:36):\nIt's because I cut out Airtable. I got you.\n\nLauryn Isford (01:02:39):\nI know, I always say Airtable. Airtable's definitely number five.\n\nLenny (01:02:42):\nOkay. Probably number one. Okay, final question. Speaking of Airtable, what's the coolest use of Airtable you've seen?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:02:48):\nThere was a great embedded view, which is the internal term for when you put Airtable on your website in an embedded way so people can check out cool stuff, related to finding COVID vaccine when they came out, which was really awesome. I also appreciated that a similar use of Airtable has become quite popular this year in support of facilitating folks who've been laid off to help them find new opportunities.\n\nLenny (01:03:15):\nLauryn, this was amazing. I learned a ton. We got through everything I was hoping to get through which I did not expect. Two final questions, where can folks find you online if they want to reach out and learn more and to reach out to you, and then two, how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLauryn Isford (01:03:28):\nYou all can find me on Twitter. I'm @laurynisford. I love hearing about how folks with all different kinds of cool products are thinking about growth. In general, I find all of us are better at growing businesses when we study the awesome wins and learnings of others. So, please, my DMs are open. Send me cool things you're working on. I'd love to learn about it.\n\nLenny (01:03:51):\nAmazing. Lauryn, thank you. Let's go drive some growth.\n\nLauryn Isford (01:03:54):\nAll right.\n\nLenny (01:03:57):\nThank you so much for listening.

  "transcript": "# Inside OpenAI | Logan Kilpatrick (head of developer relations)\n\n## Transcript\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:00:00):\nFinding people who are high agency and work with urgency, if I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to get 50 people's different consensus. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having, and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that... People just go and do it and solve the problem, and I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.\n\nLenny (00:00:36):\nToday my guest is Logan Kilpatrick. Logan is head of developer relations at OpenAI, where he supports developers building on open AI's, APIs and ChatGPT. Before OpenAI, Logan was a machine learning engineer at Apple and advised NASA on their open source policy. If you can believe it, ChatGPT launched just over a year ago and transformed the way that we think about AI and what it means for our products and our lives. Logan has been at the front lines of this change, and every day is helping developers and companies figure out how to leverage these new AI superpowers.\n\n(00:01:10):\nIn our conversation, we dig into examples of how people are using ChatGPT and the new GPTs and other open AI APIs in their work and their life. Logan shares some really interesting advice on how to get better at prompt engineering. We also get into how OpenAI operates internally, how they ship so quickly, and the two key attributes they look for in the people that they hire, plus, where Logan sees the biggest opportunities for new products and new startups building on their APIs.\n\n(00:01:38):\nWe also get a little bit into the very dramatic weekend that OpenAI had with the board and Sam Altman and all of that, and so much more. A huge thank you to Dan Shipper and Dennis Ing for some great questions, suggestions. With that, I bring you Logan Kilpatrick after a short word from our sponsors.\n\n(00:01:56):\nThis episode is brought to you by Hex.

I'm super excited.\n\nLenny (00:03:57):\nI want to start with the elephant in the room, which I think the elephant is actually leaving the room because I think this is months ago at this point, but I'm still just really curious. What was it like on the inside of OpenAI during the very dramatic weekend with the board and Sam and all those things? What was it like? And is there a story maybe you could share that maybe people haven't heard about what it was like on the inside, what was going on?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:04:20):\nYeah, it was definitely a very stressful Thanksgiving week. I think in broad context, OpenAI had been pushing for a really long time, since ChatGPT came out, and that was supposed to be one of the first weeks that the whole company had taken time away to actually reset and have a break. So very selfishly, I was super excited to spend time with my family, all that stuff. And then, yeah, Friday afternoon we got the message that all of the changes were happening, and I think it was super shocking because I think, and this is a perspective a lot of folks share, everybody had and continues to have such deep trust in Sam and Greg and our leadership team that it was just very surprising. And we're also a very, as far as company cultures go, very transparent and very open. So when there's problems or there's things going on, we tend to hear about them. And again, it was the first time that a lot of us had heard some of the things that were happening between the board and the leadership team, so very, very surprising.\n\n(00:05:20):\nI think my being someone who's not based in San Francisco, I was, again, very selfishly kind of happy that it happened over the Thanksgiving break because a lot of folks actually had gone home to different places. So it felt like I had a little bit of comfort knowing I wasn't the only one not in San Francisco, because everybody was meeting up in person to do a bunch of stuff and be together during that time. So it was nice to know that there was a few other folks who were sort of out of the loop with me.\n\n(00:05:51):\nI think the thing that surprised me the most was just how quickly everybody got back to business. I flew to San Francisco the next week after Thanksgiving, which I wasn't planning to do, to deal with the team in person and seeing, literally Monday morning, I was walking into the office being, like expecting, I don't know, something weird to be going on or happening. And really it was like people laser focused and back to work, and I think that speaks to the caliber of our team and everybody who's just so excited about building towards the mission that we're building towards. So I think that was, yeah, that was the most surprising thing of the whole incident. I think a lot of companies would've had the potential to truly be derailed for some non-trivial amount of time by this, and everybody was just right back to it, which I love.\n\nLenny (00:06:40):\nI feel like it also maybe brought the team closer together. It feels like it was this kind of traumatic experience that may bring folks together because it was something they all shared. Is there anything along those lines that's like, \"Wow, things are a little different now?\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:06:52):\nOne of my takeaways was I'm actually very grateful that this happened when it happened. I think today the stakes are... They're still relatively high. People have built their businesses on top of OpenAI. We have tons of customers who love ChatGPT, so if something bad happens to us, we definitely impact our customers. But on the world scale, somebody else will build a model if OpenAI disappeared and continue towards this progress of general intelligence. I think fast-forward five or 10 years, if something like this would've happened and we hadn't gone through the hopeful upcoming work transformation and all those changes that are going to happen, I think it would've been a little bit, or potentially much worse, of an outcome. So I'm glad that things happened when the stakes are a little bit lower.\n\n(00:07:39):\nAnd I totally agree with you. It's like the team has been growing so rapidly over the last year since I joined. It's been crazy to think about how many new folks there are, and I really think that this really brought people together because most folks, historically, many of the folks when I joined, what kind of banded us all together was the launch of ChatGPT, the launch of GPT-4, and for folks who weren't around for some of those launches, it was perhaps step day. For folks who are on for dev day, it was probably this event. So I think we've had these events that have really brought the company together cross-functionally, so hopefully all the future ones will be really exciting things like GPT five, whenever that comes, and stuff like that.\n\nLenny (00:08:20):\nAwesome. We're going to talk about GPT-5. Going in a totally different direction, what is the most mind-blowing or surprising thing that you've seen AI do recently?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:08:31):\nThe things that are getting me most excited are these new interfaces around AI, like the Rabbit R-1. I don't know if you've seen that, but consumer hardware device, this company called TL Draw. I don't know if you've seen TL Draw.\n\nLenny (00:08:44):\nI think. You sketch something and then it makes it as a website?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:08:48):\nAnd that's only a small piece of what TL Draw is actually working on, but there's all of these new interfaces to interact with AI, and I think I was having a conversation with the TL Draw folks a couple of days ago, really blows my mind to think about how chat is the predominant way that folks are using AI today. And I actually think, and this is my bulk case for the folks at TL Draw, I'm super excited for them to build what they're building, but they're sort of building this infinite canvas experience and you can imagine how, as you're interacting with an AI on a daily basis, you might want to jump over to your infinite canvas, which the AI has filled in all the details and you might see a reference to a file and to a video and all of these different things.\n\n(00:09:30):\nAnd it's such a cool way. It actually makes a lot more sense for us as humans to see stuff in that type of format than, I think, just listing out a bunch of stuff in chat. So I'm really, really excited to see more people. I think 2024 is the year of multimodal AI, but it's also the year that people really push the boundaries of some of these new UX paradigms around AI.\n\nLenny (00:09:53):\nIt's funny. I feel like Chatbots, as a PM for many years, it feels like every brainstorming session we had about new features, it's like, \"Hey, we should have built a Chatbot to solve this problem.\" It's like the perennial like, \"Oh, Chatbot,\" or, \"Someone's going to suggest we do a Chatbot,\" and now they're actually useful and working and everyone's building Chatbots, a lot of them based on OpenAI APIs.\n\n(00:10:12):\nThere's not really a question there, but maybe the question, I was going to get to this later, is just when people are thinking about building a product like, say, TL Draw, what should they think about? Where OpenAI is not going to go versus here's what OpenAI is going to do for us. We shouldn't worry about them building a version of TL Draw in the future. What's the way to think about where you won't be disrupted essentially by OpenAI, knowing also they may change their mind?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:10:36):\nThat's a great question. I think we're deeply focused on these very, very general use cases like the general reasoning capabilities, the general coding, the general writing abilities. I think where you start to get into some of these very vertical applications... And I think a great example of this is actually Harvey. I don't know if you've seen Harvey, but it's this legal AI use case where they're building custom models and tools to help lawyers and people at legal firms and stuff like that. And that's a great example of our models are probably never going to be as capable as some of the things that Harvey's doing because our goal and our mission is really to solve this very general use case and then people can do things like fine-tuning and build all their own custom UI and product features on top of that.\n\n(00:11:17):\nI have a lot of empathy and a lot of excitement for people who are building these very general products today. I talk to a lot of developers who are building just general purpose assistants and general purpose agents and stuff like that. I think it's cool and it's a good idea. I think the challenge for them is they are going to end up directly competing against us in those spaces and I think there's enough room for a lot of people to be successful, but to me you shouldn't be surprised when we end up launching some general purpose agent product because, again, we're sort of building that with GPTs today and versus we're not going to launch some of these varied verticalized products. We're not going to launch an AI sales agent. That's just not what we're building towards. And companies who are and have some domain specific knowledge and they're really excited about that problem space, they can go into that and leverage our models and end up continuing to be on the cutting edge without having to do all that R&D effort themselves.\n\nLenny (00:12:16):\nGot it. So the advice I'm hearing is get specific about use cases, and that could be either models that are tuned to be especially useful for a use case like sales or make an interface or experience solving a more specific problem.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:12:30):\nAnd I think if you're going to try and solve this very general, if you're going to try to build the next general assistant to compete with something like ChatGPT, it has to be so radically different. People have to really be like, \"Wow, this is solving these 10 problems that I have with ChatGPT, and therefore I'm going to go and try your new thing.\" Otherwise we're just putting a ton of engineering efforts and research effort into making that an incredible product, and it's just going to be the normal challenges of building companies. It's just hard to compete against something like that.\n\nLenny (00:12:59):\nAwesome. Okay, that's great. I was going to get to that later, but I'm glad we touched on that. I imagine that's on the minds of many developers and founders. Kind of along the same lines, there's a lot of talk about how ChatGPT and GPTs and many of the tools you guys offer are going to make a company much more efficient. They don't need as many engineers, data scientists, PMs, things like that, but I think it's also hard for companies to think about what can we actually do to make our company more efficient. I'm curious if there's any examples that you can share of how companies have taken built a, say, a GPT internally to do something so that they don't have to spend engineering hours on it or generally just used OpenAI tooling to make their business internally more efficient?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:13:42):\nYeah, that's a great question. I wonder if you can put this in the show notes or something like that, but there's a really great Harvard Business School study about... And I forgot which consulting firm they did it with. Maybe it was like Boston Consulting or something like that, but it might've been one of the other ones. And they talk about the order of magnitude of efficiency gain for those folks who are using AI tools, I think it was chat GPT specifically in those use cases that they were using, comparatively against folks who aren't using AI. I'm really excited, also, just as just more time passes between the release of this technology, for us to get more empirical studies. I feel just for myself, as somebody who's an engineer today, I use ChatGPT and I can ship things way faster than I would be able to.\n\n(00:14:26):\nI don't have any good metrics for myself to put a specific number on it, but I'm guessing people are working on those studies right now. I think engineering is actually one of the highest leverage things that you could be using AI to do today and really unlocking, probably on the order of at least a 50% improvement, especially for some of the lower hanging fruit software engineering tasks. The models are just so capable at doing that work. And it's crazy to think... And I'm guessing, actually, GitHub probably has a bunch of really great studies they publish around copilots and you could use those as an analogy for what people are getting from ChatGPT as well. But those are probably the highest leverage things.\n\n(00:15:07):\nI think now with GPTs, people are able to go in and solve some of these more tactical problems. I think one of the general challenges with ChatGPT is it gives a decent answer for a lot of different use cases, but oftentimes it's not particular enough to the voice of your company or the nuance of the work that you're doing. And I think now with GPTs and people who are using the teams in ChatGPT and Enterprise in ChatGPT, they can actually build those things, incorporate the nuance of their own company, and make solving those tasks much, much more domain specific. So we literally just launched GPTs a couple of months ago, so I don't think there's been any good public success stories, but I'm guessing that success is happening right now at companies, and hopefully we'll hear more about that in the months to come as folks get super excited about sharing those case studies.\n\nLenny (00:15:58):\nI'll share an example. So I have this good friend, his name's Dennis Yang, he works at Chime, and he told me about two things that they're doing at Chime that seem to be providing value. One is he built a GPT that helps write ads for Facebook and Google just gives you ideas for ads to run, and so that takes a little load off the marketing team or the growth team. And then he built another GPT that delivers experiment results, kind of like a data scientist, with here's the result of this experiment. And then you could talk to it and ask for like, \"Hey, how much longer do you think we should run this for,\" or, \"What might this imply about our product,\" and things like that. And I think it's really-\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:15:58):\nI love that.\n\nLenny (00:16:35):\nLike you said. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just things you've heard people do just like, \"Wow, that was a really smart way of... \" So I get there's engineering, co-piloting type tooling. Is there anything else that comes to mind? Just to give people a little inspiration of like, \"Wow, that's an interesting way I should be thinking about using some of these tools.\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:16:50):\nI've seen some interesting GPTs around the planning use cases, like you want to do OKR planning for your team or something like that. I just actually saw somebody tweet it literally yesterday. I've seen some cool venture capital ones of doing diligence on a deal flow, which is kind of interesting, and getting some different perspectives. I think all of those horizontal use cases where you can bring in a different personality and get perspective on different things I think is really cool. I've personally used a GPT, the private GPT that I use myself that helps with some of the planning stuff for different quarters, and just making sure that I'm being consistent in how I'm framing things like driving back to individual metrics, stuff that, when people do planning, they often miss in our data, and then it's been super helpful for me to have a GPT to force me to think about some of those things.\n\nLenny (00:17:43):\nWait, can you talk more about this? What does this GPT do for you and what do you feed it?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:17:48):\nYeah, I forgot what article I saw online, but it was some article that was talking about what are the best ways to set yourself up for success in planning. And I took a bunch of the... I'll see if I can make it public after this and send you a link, but took a bunch of the examples from that and went in and put some of those suggestions into the GPT, and then now when I do any of my planning of I want to build this thing, I put it through and have it generate a timeline, generate all the specifics of what are the metrics and success that I'm looking for, who might be some important cross-functional stakeholders to include in the planning process, all that stuff, and it's been helpful.\n\nLenny (00:18:25):\nWow, that is very cool. That would be awesome if you made it public. And if you do, we'll link to it and we'll make it the number one most popular GPT in the store.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:18:35):\nI love it.\n\nLenny (00:18:35):\nGoing in a slightly different direction, there's this whole genre of prompt engineering. It feels like it's one of these really emerging skills. I actually saw a startup hiring a prompt engineer, one of the startups I've invested in, and I think that's going to blow a lot of people's minds that there's this new job that's emerging. And I know the idea is this won't last forever, that in theory AI will be so smart you don't need to really think about how to be smart about asking it for things you need it to do. But can you just describe this idea of what is prompt engineering, this term that people might be hearing? And then even more interestingly, just what advice do you have for people to get better at writing prompts for, say, ChatGPT or through the API in general?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:19:13):\nYeah, this is such an interesting space, and I think it's another space where I'm excited for people to do more scientific empirical studies about, because there's so much gut feeling, best practices that maybe aren't actually true in a certain way. I think the reason that prompt engineering exists and comes up at all is because the models are so inclined, because of the way that they're trained, to give you just an answer to the question that you ask. Crap in crap out. If you ask a pretty basic question, you're going to get a pretty basic response. And actually the same thing is true for humans, and you can think of a great example of this. When I go to another human and I ask, \"How's your day going,\" they say, \"It's going pretty good.\"\n\n(00:19:53):\nLiterally, absolutely zero detail, no nuance, not very interesting at all versus, again, if you have some context with a person, if you have a personal relationship with them and I ask you, \"Hey Lenny, how's your day going? How did the last podcast go,\" et cetera, et cetera, you just have a little bit more context and agency to go and answer my question. I think this is prompt engineering.\n\n(00:20:13):\nMy whole position on this is prompt engineering is a very human thing. When we want to get some value out of a human, we do this prompt engineering. We try to effectively communicate with that human in order to get the best output. And the same thing is true of models. And I think it's like, again, because we're using a system that appears to be really smart, we assume that it has all this context, but it's really like imagine a human level intelligence but literally no context. It has no idea what you're going to ask it. It's never met you before. It has no idea who you are, what you do, what your goals are. And it's the reason that you get super generic responses sometimes is because people forget they need to put that context in the model.\n\n(00:20:57):\nSo I think the thing that is going to help solve this problem, and we already kind of do this in the context of Dali, so when you go to the image generation model that we have, Dali, and you say, \"I want a picture of a turtle,\" what it does is it actually takes that description. It says, \"I want a picture of a turtle,\" and it changes it into this high fidelity, like generate a picture of a turtle with a shell, with a green background and lily pads in the water and all this other. It adds all this fidelity because that's the way that the model is trained. It's trained on examples with super high fidelity. This will happen with text models.\n\n(00:21:35):\nYou can imagine a world where you go into ChatGPT and you say, \"Write me a blog post about AI.\" It automatically will go and be like, \"Let me generate a much higher fidelity description of what this person really wants, which is generate me a blog post about AI that talks about the trade-offs between these different techniques and some example use cases and references some of the latest papers,\" and it does all that for you, and then you at the user will hopefully be able to be like, \"Yep, this is kind of what I wanted. Let me edit this. Let me edit this here.\"\n\n(00:22:02):\nAnd again, the inherent problem is we're lazy as humans. We don't want to type all... We don't really want to type what we mean, and I think AI systems are actually going to help solve some of that problem.\n\nLenny (00:22:12):\nSo until that day, what can people do better when they're prompting, say ChatGPT? And I'll give you an example. Tim Ferris suggested this really good idea that I've been stealing, which is when you're preparing for an interview, you go to chat GPT. And so I did this for you. I was like, \"Hey, I'm interviewing Logan Kilpatrick, he is head of developer relations at OpenAI, on my podcast. Give me 10 questions to ask him in the style of Tyler Cowen,\" who I think is the best interviewer. He is so good at just very pointed original questions. So what advice would you have for me to improve on that prompt to have better results? The questions were fine. They're great. They're interesting enough, but they weren't like, \"Holy, these are incredible.\" So I guess what advice would you give me in that example?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:22:57):\nYeah, that's a great example where thinking in context of who it is that you're asking questions about. I'm probably not somebody who has enough information about me on the internet where the model actually has been trained and knows the nuances of my background. I think there's probably much more famous guests where it might be that there's enough context on the internet to answer the questions. You actually have to do some of that work. You need to, say if you're using browse with Bing, for example, you could say, \"Here's a link to Logan's blog and some of the things that he's talked about. Here's a link to his Twitter. Go through some of his tweets, go through some of his blogs and see what his interesting perspectives are that we might want to surface on the blog,\" or something like that.\n\n(00:23:36):\nIt's, again, giving the model enough context to answer the question. I think, again, that prompt actually might work really well for somebody who has it, if you were interviewing Tom Cruise or something like that, somebody who has a lot of information about them on the internet. It probably works a little bit better.\n\nLenny (00:23:52):\nSo the advice there is just give more context. It doesn't tell you, \"Hey, I don't actually know that much about Logan, so give me some more information.\" It's just like, \"Here you go. Here's a bunch of good questions.\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:24:00):\nExactly. It wants to. It so deeply wants to answer your question. It doesn't care that it doesn't have enough context. It's the most eager person in the world you could imagine to answer the question, and without that context it's just hard to do, to give anything a value. If we got t-shirts printed, they should say, \"Context is all you need. Context is the only thing that matters.\" It's such an important piece of getting a language model to do anything for you.\n\nLenny (00:24:26):\nAny other tips? Just as people are sitting there, maybe they have ChatGPT open right now as they're crafting a prompt, is there anything else that you'd say would help them have better results?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:24:37):\nWe actually have a prompt engineering guide, which folks should go and check out. It has some of the examples. It depends on the order of magnitude of how much performance increase you can get. There's a lot of really small silly things, like adding a smiley face, increases the performance of the model. I'm sure folks have seen a lot of these silly examples, but telling the model to take a break and then answer the question, all these kinds of things. And again, if you think about it, it's because the corpus of information that's trained these models is the same things that humans have sent back and forth to each other. So you telling a human, \"When I go take a break and then I come back to work, I'm fresher and I'm able to answer questions better and do work better,\" so very similar things are true for these models. And again, when I see a smiley face at the end of someone's message, I feel empowered that this is going to be a positive interaction and I should be more inclined to give them a great answer and spend more effort on the thing that they asked me for.\n\nLenny (00:25:34):\nWow, wait. So that's a real thing. If you had a smiley face, it might give you better results.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:25:39):\nAgain, it's like the challenge with all this stuff is it's very nuanced and it's also it's a small jump in performance. You could imagine on the order of one or 2%, which for a few sentence answer might not even be a discernible difference. Again, if you're generating an entire saga of texts, the smiley face could actually make a material difference for you, but for something small and textual it might not.\n\nLenny (00:26:03):\nOkay, good tip. Amazing. Okay, we've talked about GPTs I think maybe might be helpful to describe what is this new thing that you guys launched, GPTs, and I'm curious just how it's going. This is a really big change and element of OpenAI now with this idea that you could build your own mini, and I'm almost explaining it, your mini open ChatGPT and then people can... I think you can pay for it. You can charge for your own GPT or is it all free right now?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:26:29):\nIt's ll free right now. It's all free.\n\nLenny (00:26:31):\nOkay. In the future I imagine people will be able to charge. So there's this whole store now. Basically it's the whole app store that you guys have launched. How's it going? What's happening? What surprised you there? What should people know?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:26:42):\nYeah, it's going great, and again, historically the thing that you would have to do, let's say for example, you have a really cool ChatGPT use case, what you would have to do to share it with somebody else is actually go in and start the conversation with the model, prompt it to do the things that you wanted to, and then you would share that link with somebody else before the action has actually happened and be like, here now you can essentially finish this conversation with ChatGPT that I started.\n\n(00:27:08):\nSo GPT kind of changes this where you take all that important context, you put it into the model to begin with, and then people can go and chat with essentially a custom version of ChatGPT. And the thing that's really interesting is you can upload files, you can give it custom instructions, you can add all these different tools. Like a code interpreter is built in, which allows you to do math. Essentially you have browsing built in, image generation built in. You can also, for more advanced use cases if you're a developer, you can connect it to external APIs so you can connect it to the Notion API or Gmail or all these different things, and have it actually take actions on your behalf.\n\n(00:27:44):\nSo there's so many cool things that people are unlocking. And what's been most exciting to me, actually, is the non-developer persona is now empowered to go and solve these really, really, really more challenging problems by giving the model enough context on what that problem is to be able to solve it. Going back to context is all you need, this is very true in the context of GPTs, and if you give it enough context, you can solve much more interesting problems.\n\n(00:28:11):\nThere's so many things that I'm excited about with this. I think monetization, when it comes to the store later this quarter, I think is going to be extremely exciting when people can get paid based on who's using their GPT. That's going to be a huge unlock and open a lot of people's eyes to the opportunity here. I also think continuing to push on making more capabilities accessible to GPTs for people who can't code is really exciting. Even for me as someone who is a software engineer, it's not super easy to connect the Notion API or the Gmail API to my GPT, and really I'd love to just be able to one click sign in with Gmail and then all of a sudden it's like my Gmail is accessible, or someone else can sign in with their Gmail and make it accessible. So I think over time all those types of things will come, but today it's really custom prompts is essentially one of the biggest value adds with GPTs.\n\nLenny (00:29:03):\nAwesome. I have it pulled up here on different monitor and Canva has the top GPT currently, and I was trying to play with it as you're chatting just to see. I was going to make a big banner that said, \"It's the context stupid,\" and it doesn't. I'm not doing something right, but I'm not paying that much attention to it because we're talking, but this is very cool. Just maybe a final question there. Is there a GPT that you saw someone built that was like, \"Wow, that's amazing. That's so cool,\" something that surprised you? And I'll share one that was very cool, but is there anything that comes to mind when I ask that?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:29:33):\nI think my instinct is the Zapier. All of the stuff that Zapier has done with GPTs is the most useful stuff that you could imagine. You can go so far with what... And I don't know how it's packaged for Zapier's GPT right now, but you can actually, as a third party developer, integrate Zapier without knowing how to code into your GPT. So they're pushing a lot of this stuff, and then basically all 5,000 connections that are possible with Zapier today, you can bring into your GPT and essentially enable it to do anything. So I'm incredibly excited for Zapier and for people who are building with them so many things that you can unlock using that platform. So I think that's probably the most exciting thing to me for people who aren't developers.\n\nLenny (00:30:20):\nAwesome. Zapier's always in there, getting in there connecting things.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:30:23):\nYeah, they're great.\n\nLenny (00:30:25):\nSo the one that I had in mind, so I had a buddy of mine, [inaudible 00:30:28], who's the CEO of a company called Runway built this thing called Universal Primer which helps you learn. It's described as, \"Learn everything about anything,\" and basically, I think, it's kind of this Socratic method of helping you learn stuff. So it's like, \"Explain how transformers work in LMs,\" and then it just kind goes through stuff and then asks you questions, I think, and helps you learn new concepts. And I think it's the number two education GPT.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:30:53):\nI love that. [inaudible 00:30:53] is incredible, so...\n\nLenny (00:30:54):\nYes, it's true. Let me tell you about a product called Arcade. Arcade is an interactive demo platform that enables teams to create polished, on-brand demos in minutes. Telling the story of your product is hard and customers want you to show them your product, not just talk about it or gate it. That's why Product Four teams such as Atlassian, Carta and Retool use Arcade to tell better stories within their homepages, product change logs, emails and documentation.\n\n(00:31:23):\nBut don't just take my word for it. Quantum Metric, the leading digital analytics platform created an interactive product tour library to drive more prospects. With Arcade, they achieved a 2X higher conversion rate for demos and saw five times more engagement than videos. On top of that, they built the demo 10 times faster than before. Creating a product demo has never been easier. With browser-based recording Arcade is the no-code solution for building personalized demos at scale.\n\n(00:31:50):\nArcade offers product customization options, designer approved editing tools and rich insights about how your viewers engage every step of the way. Ready to tell more engaging product stories that drive results? Head to arcade.software/lenny and get 50% off your first three months. That's arcade.software/lenny.\n\n(00:32:11):\nI want to talk about just what it's like to work at OpenAI and how the product team operates and how the company operates. So you worked at... Your two previous companies were Apple and NASA, which are not known for moving fast. And now you're at OpenAI, which is known for moving very fast, maybe too fast for some people's taste, as we saw it with the whole board thing. And so what I'm curious is just what is it that OpenAI does so well that allows them to build and ship so quickly and at such a high bar? Is there a process or a way of working that you've seen that you think other companies should try to move more quickly and ship better stuff?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:32:48):\nYeah, there's so many interesting trade-offs and all of this tension around how quickly companies can move. I think for us, again, if you think about Apple as an example, if you think about NASA as an example, just older institutions, lots of... Over time, the tendency is things slow down. There's additional checks and balances that are put in place, which drags things down a little bit. So we're young and a new company, so we don't have a lot of that institutional legacy barriers that have been put in place.\n\n(00:33:18):\nI think the biggest thing, and there's a good Sam tweet somewhere in the ether about this from, I think, 2022 or something like that, but finding people who are high agency and work with urgency is one of the most... If I was hiring five people today, those are some of the top two characteristics that I would look for in people because you can take on the world if you have people who have high agency and not needing to either get 50 people's different consensus, because you have people who you trust with high agency and they can just go and do the thing, I think, is one of the most... It is the most important thing, I'm pretty sure, if you were to distill it down.\n\n(00:34:04):\nAnd I see this in folks that I work with. Folks are so high agency. They see a problem and they go and tackle it. They hear something from our customers about a challenge that they're having and they're already pushing on what the solution for them is and not waiting for all the other things to happen that I think traditional companies are stuck behind because they're like, \"Oh, let's check with all these seven different departments to try to get feedback on this.\" People just go and do it and solve the problem. And I love that. It's so fun to be able to be a part of those situations.\n\nLenny (00:34:35):\nThat is so cool. I really like these two characteristics because I haven't heard this before. Those are the two, maybe the two most important things you guys look for, high agency, high urgency. To give people a clear sense of what these actually look like when you're hiring, you shared maybe this example of customer service. Someone's hearing a bug and then going to fix it. Is there anything else that can illustrate what that looks like, high agency? And then a similar question on urgency other than just move, move, move, ship, ship, ship.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:35:01):\nI think the assistants API that we released for dev day, we continue to get this feedback from developers that people wanted these higher levels of abstraction on top of our existing APIs, and a bunch of folks on the team just came together and were like, \"Hey, let's put together what the plan would look like to build something like this,\" And then very quickly came together and actually built the actual API that now powers so many people's assistant applications that are out there. And I think that's a great example of it wasn't this top down, oh, someone's sitting there being like, \"Oh, let's do these five things,\" and then like, \"Okay, team, go and do that.\" It's like people really seeing these problems that are coming up and knowing that they can come together as a team and solve these problems really quickly. And I think the assistants API, and there's like 1,001 other examples of teams taking agency and doing this, but I think that's a great one at the top of my head\n\nLenny (00:35:55):\nThat makes me want to ask. Just how does planning work at OpenAI? So in this example is just like, \"Hey, we think we need to build this. Let's just go and build it.\" I imagine there's still a roadmap and priorities and goals and things that that team had. How does road mapping and prioritization and all of that generally work to allow for something like that?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:36:14):\nI think this is one of the more challenging pieces at OpenAI. There's so many. Everyone wants everything from us, and today, especially, in the world of ChatGPT and how large and well-used our API is, people will just come to us and say, \"Hey, we want all of these things.\" I think there's a bunch of core guiding principles that we look at. One, going back to the mission, is this actually going to help us get to AGI? So there's a huge focus on there's this potential shiny reward right in front of us, which is optimize user engagement, or whatever it is. And is that really the thing? Maybe the answer is yes. Maybe that is what is going to help us get to AGI sooner, but looking at it through that lens I think is always the first step of deciding any of these problems.\n\n(00:37:03):\nI think, on the developer side, there's also these core tenets of reliability like, \"Hey, it would be awesome if we had additional APIs that did all these cool things like new endpoints, new modalities, new abstractions, but are we giving customers a robust and reliable experience on our API?\" And that's often the first question. And I think there have been times where we've fallen short on that, and there was a bunch of other things that we've been thinking about doing and really bringing the focus and priority back to that reliability piece because, at the end of the day, nobody cares if you have something great if they can't use it robust and reliably.\n\n(00:37:37):\nSo there's these core tenets. And I think, again, we have very, other than all the principles about how we're making the decision, I think the actual planning process is pretty standard. We come together. There's H1 Q1 goals. We all sprint on those. I think the real interesting thing is how stuff changes over time. You think we're going to do these very high level things and new models, new modalities, whatever it is. And then as time goes on, there's all of this turmoil and change, and it's interesting to have mechanisms to be like, \"Hey, how do we update our understanding of the world and our goals as everything the ground changes underneath of us as is happening in the craziness of the AI space today?\"\n\nLenny (00:38:22):\nIt's interesting that it sounds a lot like most other companies. There's H1 planning. There's Q1 planning. Are there metrics and goals like that that you guys have OKRs or anything like that? Or is it just, Here we're going to launch these products?\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:38:33):\nI think it's much higher level. I actually don't think OpenAI is a big OKR company. I don't think teams do OKRs today and I don't have a good understanding of why that's the case, whether or not. I don't even know if OKRs are still the industry. You're probably talking to a lot more folks about who are making those decisions. So I'm curious. Is that something that you're seeing from folks? Is it still common for people to do OKRs?\n\nLenny (00:38:55):\nYeah, absolutely. Many companies use OKRs, love OKRs. Many companies hate OKRs. I'm not surprised that OpenAI is not an OKR driven company. Along those lines, I don't know how much you can share about all this stuff, but how do you measure success for things that you launch? I know there's this ultimate goal, AGI. Is there some way to track we're getting closer? What else do you guys look at when you launch, say DPT Store or assistants or anything that's like, \"Cool, that was exactly what we're hoping for.\" Is it just adoption?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:39:20):\nYeah, adoption is a great one. I think there's a bunch of metrics around revenue, number of developers that are building on our platform, all those things. And a lot of these, and I don't want to dive... I'll let Sam or someone else on our leadership team go more into details, but I think a lot of these are actual abstractions towards something else. Even if revenue is a goal, it's like revenue is not actually the goal. Revenue is a proxy for getting more compute, which is then actually what helps us get towards getting more GPUs so that we can train better models and actually get to the goal. So there's all these intermediate layers where even if we say something is the goal, and you hear that in a vacuum and you're like, \"Oh, well OpenAI just wants to make money,\" and it's like, \"Well, really money is the mechanism to get better models so that we can achieve our mission.\" And I think there's a bunch of interesting angles like that as well.\n\nLenny (00:40:12):\nI don't know if I've heard of a more ambitious vision for a company, to build artificial general intelligence. I love that. I imagine many companies are like, \"What's our version of that?\" Before we leave this topic, is there anything else that you've seen OpenAI do really well that allows it to move this fast and be this successful? You talked about hiring people with higher agency and high urgency. Is there anything else that's just like, \"Oh wow, that's a really good way of operating?\" I imagine part of it's just hiring incredibly smart people. I think that's probably an unsaid thing, but yeah, anything else?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:40:45):\nI think there's a non-trivial benefit to using Slack, and I think maybe that's controversial and maybe some people don't like Slack, but OpenAI has such a slack heavy culture and it really... The instantaneous real time communication on Slack is so crucial. And I just love being able to tag in different people from different teams and get everybody coalesced. So everybody is always on Slack, so even if you're remote or you're on a different team or in a different office, so much of the company culture is ingrained in Slack, and it allows us to really quickly coordinate where it's actually faster to send someone a Slack message sometimes than it would be to walk over to their desk because they're on Slack and they're going to be using it.\n\n(00:41:27):\nAnd I saw, if you saw, the recent Sam and Bill Gates interview, but Sam was talking about how Slack is his number one most used app on his phone and, \"I don't even look at the time thing on my phone anymore because I don't want to know how long I'm using Slack,\" but I'm sure the Salesforce people are looking at the numbers and they're like, \"This is exactly what we wanted.\"\n\nLenny (00:41:46):\nI also love Slack. I'm a big promoter Slack. I think there's a lot of Slack hate, but such a good product. I've tried so many alternatives and nothing compares. I think what's interesting about Slack for you guys is one of the... You don't know if someone in there is just an AGI, that is not actually a person that's just there working at the company.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:42:01):\nI know there are real people. There is no AGIs yet. But I think, yeah, even Slack is building a bunch of really cool AI tools, which I'm excited to... And that's why there's so much cool AI progress. And at the end of the day, it's so exciting, from being a consumer of all these new AI products. Google's a great example. I'm so happy that Google is doing really cool AI stuff because I'm a Google Docs customer and I love using Google Docs. I like a bunch of their other products, and it's awesome that people are building such useful things around these models.\n\nLenny (00:42:33):\nHow big is the OpenAI team at this point, whatever you can share? Just to give people a sense of the scale.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:42:38):\nYeah, I think the last public number was something around like 750 near the end of last year, 780 or something like that near the end of last year. And we're still growing so quickly, so I won't be the messenger to share the specific updated numbers, but the team is growing like crazy and we're also hiring across all of our engineering teams and PM teams, so folks who are interested, would love to hear from folks who are curious about joining.\n\nLenny (00:43:03):\nMaybe one last question here. So you're growing, maybe getting to 1,000 people, clearly still very innovative and moving incredibly fast. Is there anything you've seen about what OpenAI does well to enable innovation and not slow down new big ideas?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:43:19):\nYeah, there's a couple of things, one of which is the actual research team, who seed most of the innovation that happens at OpenAI, is intentionally small. Most of the growth that OpenAI has seen is around our customer facing roles, our engineering roles to provide the infrastructure for ChatGPT and things like that. The research team is, again, intentionally kept small and there's all of this talk. And it's really interesting. I just saw this thread from one of our research folks who was talking about how in a world where you're constrained by the amount of GPU capacity that you have as a researcher, which is the case for open AI researchers, but also researchers everywhere else, each new researcher that you add is actually a net productivity loss for the research group unless that person is up-leveling everyone else in such a profound way that it increases the efficiency.\n\n(00:44:12):\nIf you just add somebody who's going to go and tackle some completely different research direction, you now have to share your GPUs with that person and everyone else is now slower on their experiments. So it's a really interesting trade-off that research folks have that I don't think product folks... If I add another engineer to our API team or to some of the ChatGPT teams, you can actually write more code and do more. And that's actually a net beneficial improvement for everybody. And that's always not the case in the case of researchers, which is interesting, in A GPU constrained world, which hopefully we won't always be in.\n\nLenny (00:44:46):\nI want to zoom out a bit and then there's going to be a couple follow-up questions here. Where are things heading with OpenAI? What's in the near future of what people should expect from the tools that you guys are going to have in launch?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:44:58):\nYeah, new modalities. I think ChatGPT continuing to push all of the different experiences that are going to be possible. Today, ChatGPT is really just text in, text out or, I guess three months ago, it was just text in, text out. We started to change that with now you can do the voice mode and now you can generate images and now you can take pictures. So I think continuing to expand the way in which you interface with AI through ChatGPT is coming.\n\n(00:45:24):\nI think GPTs is our first step towards the agent future. Again, today when you use A GPT, it's really you send a message, you get an answer back almost right away, and that's kind of the end of your interaction. I think as GPTs continue to get more robust, you'll actually be able to say, \"Hey, go and do this thing and just let me know when you're done. I don't need the answer right now. I want you to really spend time and be thoughtful about this.\"\n\n(00:45:48):\nAnd again, if you think back to all these human analogies, that's what we do as humans. I don't expect somebody, when I ask them to do something meaningful for me, to do it right away and give me the answer back right away. So I think pushing more towards those experiences is what is going to unlock so much more value for people.\n\n(00:46:06):\nAnd I think the last thing is GPTs as this mechanism to get the next few hundred million people into ChatGPT and into AI. So I think if you've had conversations with people who aren't close to the AI space, oftentimes you talk about, even if they've heard of ChatGPT... A lot of people haven't heard of ChatGPT, but if they have, they show up in ChatGPT and they're like, \"I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with this blank slate. I can kind of do anything. It's not super clear how this solves my specific problem.\"\n\n(00:46:35):\nBut I think the cool thing about GPTs is you can package down like, \"Here's this one very specific problem that AI can solve for you and do it really well,\" and I can share that experience with you and now you can go and try that GPT, have it actually solve the problem and be like, \"Wow, it did this thing for me. I should probably spend the time to investigate these five other problems that I have to see if AI can also be a solution to those.\" So I think so many more people are going to come online and start using these tools because very narrow vertical tools are what's going to be a huge unlock for them.\n\nLenny (00:47:07):\nSo in that last case, a classic horizontal product problem where it does so many things and people don't know what exactly it should do for them. So that makes a ton of sense. Just being a lot more template oriented, use case specific, helping people onboard makes tons of sense. A common problem for so many SaaS products out there. The other ones you mentioned, which was really interesting, basically more interfaces to more easily interact with OpenAI voice. You mentioned audio and things like that. That makes tons of sense. And then this agents piece where the idea is, instead of just it's a chat, it's like, \"Hey, go do this thing for me.\"\n\n(00:47:42):\nKind of along those lines, GPT-5, we touched on this a bit. There's a lot of speculation about the much better version. People just have these wild expectations, I think, for where GPT is going. GPT-5 is going to solve all the world's problems. I know you're not going to tell me when it's launching and what it's going to do, but I heard from a friend that there's kind of this tip that when you're building products today, you should build towards a GPT-5 future, not based on limitations of GPT-4 today. So to help people do that, what should people think about that might be better in a world of GPT-5? Is it just faster? It's just smarter? Is there anything else that might be like, \"Oh wow, I should really rethink how I'm approaching my product?\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:48:22):\nIf folks have looked through the GPT-4 technical report that we released back in March when GPT-4 came out, GPT-4 was the first model that we trained where we could reliably predict the capabilities of that model beforehand based on the amount of computes that we were going to put into it. We did a scientific study to show like, \"Hey, this is what we predicted and here is what the actual outcome was.\" So it'll be, one I think, just as somebody who's interested in technology, but interesting to see does that continue to hold for GPT-5, and hopefully we'll some of that information whenever that model comes out.\n\n(00:48:56):\nI also think you can probably draw a few observations. One of them, which is GPT-4 came out. The consensus from the world is, \"Everything is different. All of a sudden everything is different. This changes the world. This changes everything.\" And then slowly but surely, we come back to reality of like, \"This is a really effective tool and it's going to help solve my problems more effectively.\"\n\n(00:49:21):\nAnd I think that is the, undoubtedly, the lens in which people should look at all of these model advancements, like GPT-5 is surely going to be extremely useful and solve some whole new echelon of problems. Hopefully it'll be faster. Hopefully It'll be better in all these ways, but fundamentally, the same problems that exists in the world are still going to be the same problems. You now just have a better tool to solve those problems.\n\n(00:49:44):\nAnd I think going back to vertical use cases, I think people who are solving very specific use cases are just now going to be able to do that much more effectively. I don't think that's going to... People have these unrealistic expectations that GPT-5 is going to be doing back flips in the background in my bedroom while it also writes all my code for me and talks on the phone with my mom or something like that.\n\n(00:50:06):\nI'm like, \"That's not the case.\" It's just going to be this very effective tool, very similar to GPT-4, and it's also going to be become very normal very quickly. And I think that is actually a really interesting piece. If you can plan for the world where people become very used to these tools very quickly, I actually think that's an edge, and assuming that this thing is going to absolutely change everything, and in many ways I think it's actually a downside, is the wrong mental framing to have of these tools as they come out.\n\nLenny (00:50:39):\nKind of along these lines, you guys are investing a lot into B2B offerings. I think half the revenue, last I heard, was B2B and then half is B2C. I don't know if that's true, but that's something I heard. What is it that you get if you work with opening AI as a company, as a business? What does it unlock? Is it just called OpenAI Enterprise? What's it called and what do you get as a part of that?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:51:01):\nYeah, so I think a lot of our B2B customers are using the API to build stuff. So I think that's one angle of it. I think if you're a ChatGPT B2B customer, we sell Teams, which is the ability to get multiple subscriptions of ChatGPT packaged together. We also have an enterprise version of ChatGPT. There's a bunch of enterprise-y things that enterprise companies want, around SSO and stuff like that, related to ChatGPT Enterprise.\n\n(00:51:25):\nI think the coolest thing is actually being able to share some of these prompt templates and GPTs internally. So again, you can make custom things that work really well for your company with all of the information that's relevant to solving problems at your company and share those internally. And to me, that's like you want to be able to collaborate with your teammates on the cool things you create using AI. So that's a huge unlock for companies. I think that those are the two biggest value adds. There's higher limits and stuff like that on some of those models, but I think being able to share your very domain specific applications is the most useful thing.\n\nLenny (00:52:00):\nI think if you're a company listening and you think a lot of employees are using ChatGPT, basically the simplest thing you could do is just roll it up into a business account with single sign-on and that probably saves you money and makes it easier to coordinate and administer.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:52:14):\nYeah, there's also a bunch of security stuff too, like if you want to control. You don't want people to use certain GPTs from the GPT store because you're worried about security or privacy and stuff like that. You don't want your private data going in places. It makes a lot of sense to sign up for that so that you have a little bit more control over what's happening.\n\nLenny (00:52:29):\nOkay, got it. There's a launch happening tomorrow, I think, after we're recording this. Can you talk about what is new, what's coming out? I think this is going to come out a couple weeks after recording, but just what should people know that's new that's coming out from OpenAI tomorrow in our world?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:52:45):\nYeah, updated, so there's a few different things. A couple of quick ones are updated GPT-4 Turbo model, updated the preview model that we released that dev day. There's an updated version of that. It fixes this, if folks have seen online people talking about this sort of laziness phenomenon in the model. We improve on that and it fixes a lot of the cases where that was the case. So hopefully the model will be a little bit less lazy. The big thing is the third generation embeddings model. So we were talking off-camera before recording about all of the cool use cases for embedding. So if folks have used embeddings before, it's essentially the technology that powers many of these question and answering with your own documentation or your own corpus of knowledge. And like you were saying, you actually have a website where people can ask questions about recordings of the podcast.\n\nLenny (00:53:34):\nLennybot.com. Check it out.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:53:35):\nYeah, lennybot.com. And my assumption was that lennybot.com is actually powered by embedding. So you take all of the corpus of knowledge. You take all the recordings, your blog post. You embed them, and then when people ask questions, you can actually go in and see the similarity between the question and the corpus of knowledge and then provide an answer to somebody's question and reference an empirical fact, something that's true from your knowledge base. And this is super useful and people are doing a ton of this. It's like trying to ground these models in reality, in what they know to be true. We know all the things from your podcast to be at least something that you've said before and to be true in that sense, and we can bring them into the answer that the model is actually generating in response to a question. So that'll be super cool.\n\n(00:54:20):\nAnd these new V3 embeddings models, again, state-of-the-art performance, the cool thing is actually the non-English performance has increased super significantly. I think historically, people really were only using embeddings for... It only worked really well for English, and I think now you can use it across so many new languages because it's just so much more performant across those languages and it's five times cheaper as well, which is wonderful. There's no better feeling than making things cheaper for people. I love it. I think now it's like you can embed, I'm pretty sure, it was like 62,000 pages of text for $1, which is very, very cheap. So lots of really cool things that you can do with embeddings and exciting to see people invent more stuff.\n\nLenny (00:55:07):\nWhat a deal. Final question before we get to a very exciting lightning round. Say you're a product manager at a big company, or even a founder, what do you think are the biggest opportunities for them to leverage the tech that you guys are building, GPT-4, all the other APIs? How should people be thinking about, \"Here's how we should really think about leveraging this power in our existing product,\" or new product, whichever direction you want to go.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:55:34):\nYeah, I think going back to this theme of new experiences is really exciting to me. I think consumers are just going to be... You are going to have an edge on other people if you're providing AI that's not accessible in a Chatbot. People are using a ton of chat and it's a really valuable service area. It's clearly valuable because people are using it. But I think products that move beyond this chat interface really are going to have such an advantage. And also, thinking about how to take your use case to the next level. I've tried a ton of chat examples that are very, very basic and providing a little bit of value to me, but I'm like, \"Really this should go much further and actually build your core experience from the ground up.\"\n\n(00:56:20):\nI've used this product that allows you to essentially manage or view the conversations that are happening online around certain topics and stuff like that. So I can go and look online. What are people saying about GPT-4? And what I just said out loud, \"What are people saying about GPT-4,\" is the actual question that I have. And in a normal product experience today, I have to go into a bunch of dashboards and change a bunch of filters and stuff like that. And what I really want is just ask my question. What are people doing? What are people saying about GPT-4? Get an answer to that question in a very data grounded way.\n\n(00:56:55):\nAnd I've seen people solve part of this problem where, oh, they'll be like, \"Oh, well here's a few examples of what people are saying and, well, that's not really what I want. I want this summary of what's happening.\" And I think it just takes a little bit more engineering effort to make that happen. But I think it's like that is the magical unlock of like, \"Wow, this is an incredible product that I'm going to continue to use,\" instead of like, \"Yeah, this is kind of useful, but I really want more.\"\n\nLenny (00:57:21):\nAwesome. I'll give a shout-out to a product. I'm not an investor, but I know the founder, called visualelectric.com, which I think is doing exactly this. It's basically a tool specifically built for creatives, I think specifically graphic design, to help them create imagery. So there's like Dali, obviously, but this takes it to a whole new level where it's kind of this canvas, infinite canvas, that you could just generate images, edit, tweak them, and continue to rate until you have the thing that you need. Visualelectric.com.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:57:48):\nI'm going to try that out. Is it similar to Canva?\n\nLenny (00:57:50):\nIt's even more niche, I think, for more sophisticated graphic design, I think, is the use case. But I'm not a designer, so I'm not the target customer. But I will say my wife is a graphic designer. She had never used AI tools. I showed her this and she got hooked on it. She paid for it without even telling me that she was going to become a paid customer, and she created imagery of our dog and all this art. And now it's like on our TV. The art she created is now sitting... It's like we have a frame TV, and that's the image on our TV. So anyway...\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:58:21):\nI love that. What was it called again?\n\nLenny (00:58:23):\nVisualelectric.com. Anyway, anything else you wanted to touch on or share before we get to a very exciting lightning round?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:58:31):\nI've made this statement a few times online and other places, but for people who have cool ideas that they should build with AI, this is the moment. There are so many cool things that need to be built for the world using AI. And again, if I or other folks on the team at OpenAI can be helpful in getting you over the hump of starting that journey of building something really cool, please reach out. The world needs more cool solutions using these tools, and would love to hear about the awesome stuff that people are building.\n\nLenny (00:59:01):\nI would've asked you this at the end, but how would people reach out? What's the best way to actually do that?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:59:06):\nTwitter, LinkedIn. My email should be findable somewhere. I don't want to say it and then get slammed with a bunch of email. You should be able to sign my email, if you need it, online somewhere. But yeah, Twitter and LinkedIn is usually the easiest place.\n\nLenny (00:59:18):\nAnd how do they find you on Twitter?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:59:21):\nIt's just Logan Kilpatrick, or I think my name shows up as Logan.GPT or-\n\nLenny (00:59:21):\nLogan.GPT?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:59:26):\nOr official Logan K.\n\nLenny (00:59:28):\nYeah. Awesome. Okay. And we'll link into it in the show notes. Amazing. Well Logan, with that, we've reached a very exciting lightning round. Are you ready?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:59:34):\nI'm ready.\n\nLenny (00:59:35):\nFirst question, what are two or three books that you've recommended most to other people?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (00:59:39):\nI think the first one is one that I read a long time ago and came back to recently, is the One Room Schoolhouse by Sal Khan. Incredible. Yeah, I don't want... It's the lightning round so I won't say too much, but incredible story and AI is what is going to enable Sal Khan's vision of a teacher per student to actually happen. So I'm really excited about that. And the other one is, that I always come back to, is Why We Sleep. Sleep science are so cool. If you don't care about your sleep, it's one of the biggest up-levels that you can do for yourself.\n\nLenny (01:00:14):\nWhat is a favorite recent movie or TV show that you really enjoyed?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:00:18):\nI'm a sucker for a good inspirational human story. So I watched, with my family recently over the holidays, this Gran Turismo movie, and it's a story about someone who, a kid from London, who grew up doing SIM racing, which is a virtual race car, and did this competition, ended up becoming a real professional race car driver through some competition. And it's just really cool to see someone go from driving a virtual car to driving a real car and competing in the 24-hour Le Mans and all that stuff.\n\nLenny (01:00:50):\nI used to play that game and it was a lot of fun, but I don't think I have any clue how to drive a real car, race car. So that's inspiring. Do you have a favorite interview question that you'd like to ask candidates that you're interviewing?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:01:03):\nYeah, I'm always curious to hear what people's... The thing that they so strongly believe that people disagree with them on.\n\nLenny (01:01:12):\nWhat do you look for in an answer that seems like, Wow, that's a really good signal?\"\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:01:17):\nOftentimes, it's just an entertaining question to ask in some sense, but it's also... It's interesting to see what somebody's deeply held strong belief is, I think. And not to judge whether or not I believe in that, but just curious to see why people feel that way.\n\nLenny (01:01:35):\nWhat is a favorite product that you've recently discovered that you really like?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:01:38):\nOn the narrative of sleep, I have this really nice sleep mask from this company called... Not being paid. I just say this, but it's called Manta Sleep or something like that. It's a weighted sleep mask and it feels incredible when I... I don't know. Maybe I just have a heavy head or something like that, but it feels good to wear a weighted sleep mask at night. I really appreciate it.\n\nLenny (01:02:01):\nI have a competing sleep mask that I highly recommend. I'm trying to find it. I've emailed people about it a couple of times in my newsletter for gift guides.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:02:09):\nYeah.\n\nLenny (01:02:09):\nOkay. My favorite is called the Waoaw Sleep Mask, W-A-O-A-\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:02:15):\nWhat do you like about it?\n\nLenny (01:02:16):\nW-A-O-A-W. I'll link to it in the show notes. It makes a lot of room. It's very large and there's space for your eyes, so your eyelashes and whatever eyes aren't pressed on, and it just fits really nicely around the head. And my wife, we both wear eye masks at night. It just, speaking of sleep, really helps us sleep. [inaudible 01:02:37] It doesn't have the weight-ness piece, so it might be worth trying, but everyone I've recommended this to is like, \"That changed my life. Thank you for helping me sleep better.\" And so we'll link to [inaudible 01:02:51].\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:02:17):\nLook at that.\n\nLenny (01:02:50):\nLook at us. So adult. Two more questions. Do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to share with friends or family, either in work or in life?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:02:58):\nYeah, I've got it. It's on a Post-It note that I... Right behind my camera and it's \"Measure in hundreds.\" I love this idea of measuring things in hundreds, and it's for folks who are at the beginning of some journey. I talk to people all the time, they're like, \"Yeah, I've tried this thing and it hasn't worked.\" And if your mental model is to measure in hundreds, \"I measure in hundreds,\" the five times that you failed at something, you failed and tried zero times. And I love that. It's such a great reminder that everything in life is built on compounding and multiple attempts at stuff. And if you don't try enough times, you're never going to be successful at it.\n\nLenny (01:03:38):\nI love that. I could see why you are successful at OpenAI and why you're a good fit there. Final question. So I asked ChatGPT for a very silly question. \"Give me a bunch of silly questions to ask Logan Kilpatrick, head of developer relations at OpenAI,\" and I went through a bunch. I have three here, but I'm going to pick one. If an AI started doing standup comedy, what do you think would be its go-to joke or funny observation about humans?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:04:06):\nI think today, I think if you were to do this, I think the go-to question would be something along the, \"So an AI walks into a bar,\" and likely because, again, it's trained on some distribution of training data, and that's the most common joke that comes up, and that's probably... I wonder if you came up with a joke right now, whether or not that would show up in one of the examples.\n\nLenny (01:04:31):\nI love it. What would be the joke though? We need the joke. We need the punchline. I'm just joking. I know you can't come up with amazing-\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:04:37):\nThat's what we have ChatGPT for.\n\nLenny (01:04:41):\nWe're already irrelevant. Amazing. Logan, thank you so much for being here. Two final questions, even though you've already shared this information, but just for folks to remind them. Where can folks find you if they want to reach out and ask you more questions? And how can listeners be useful to you?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:04:55):\nYeah, Twitter and LinkedIn, Logan Kilpatrick or Logan.GPT on Twitter. Please shoot me messages. I get a ton of DMs from people and it's always really, really interesting stuff. I think the thing that I would love to have help on is if people find bugs and things that don't work well in ChatGPT, I oftentimes see people be like, \"This thing didn't work really well.\" And the key, and I think we as OpenAI need to do a better job of messaging this to people, but having shared chats or actual, tangible, reproducible examples, are the two things that we need in order to actually fix the problems that people have. The model laziness was a good example where it was hard to figure out what was going on because people would be like, \"Oh, the model's lazier,\" but it's hard to figure out what were the prompts they were using. What was the examples, all that stuff? So send those examples as you come up on things that don't work well and we'll make stuff better for you.\n\nLenny (01:05:49):\nAmazing. And I'll also just remind people, if you're listening to this and you're like, \"Oh, okay, cool. A lot of cool ideas for OpenAI and ChatGPT,\" what you need to do is actually just go to chat.openai.com and try this stuff out. There's a lot of just theorizing, but I think once you actually start doing it, you start to see things a little differently. And at this point, every day I'm in there doing something, like asking for ideas for questions, doing research on a newsletter post, and it's just a tab I'm always coming back to. And I know there's a lot of people just talking about this sort of thing, and I just want to remind people. Just go. Sign in. Play with it. Ask it questions on something you're working on and just see how it goes and keep coming back to it. Is there anything else you want to share along those lines to inspire people to give this a shot?\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:06:34):\nI love it. I think the phrase of people being worried about humans being replaced by AI, and I've seen this narrative online, that it's not AI that's going to replace humans. It's other humans that are being augmented and using AI tools that are going to be more competitive in a job market and stuff like that. So go and try these AI tools. This is the best time to learn. You're going to be more productive and empowered in your job and the things that you're excited about. So yeah, excited to see what people use ChatGPT for.\n\nLenny (01:07:01):\nAnd then you can expense your account. I think it's 10 or 20 bucks a month. A lot of companies are paying for this for you, so ask your boss if you can just have it expensed and make sure you use the latest version. Anyway, Logan, thank you again so much for being here.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:07:16):\nThis is awesome, Lenny. Thanks for having me in. Thoughtful questions. Hopefully those weren't all from ChatGPT.\n\nLenny (01:07:20):\nNope, only the last one. I did have a bunch of others I had in the belt or in the pocket. I don't know what the metaphor is. In the back pocket, that's the metaphor, but I did not get to them because we had enough great stuff. So no, that was all me. Human AI.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:07:35):\nThank you.\n\nLenny (01:07:36):\nThanks, Logan.\n\nLogan Kilpatrick (01:07:37):\nLenny.ai.\n\nLenny (01:07:39):\nI love it. Lennybot.com, check it out.
