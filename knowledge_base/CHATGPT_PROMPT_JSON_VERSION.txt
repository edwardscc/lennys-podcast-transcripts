I have a JSON knowledge base with 269 podcast episode transcripts from Lenny's Podcast. Each episode contains:
- id: Episode identifier
- guest: Guest name(s)
- title: Episode title
- transcript: Full transcript text
- metadata: Duration, views, YouTube URL, etc.

I want you to create a comprehensive, searchable knowledge base from all these episodes.

## Your Task

Analyze all 269 episodes and create:

1. **Master Episode Index**: Complete catalog with guest, title, main topics, key frameworks, and top insights for each episode

2. **Topic-Based Knowledge Base**: Organize all insights by topic (e.g., Product-Market Fit, Growth Tactics, Team Building, Prioritization, etc.) with:
   - Which episodes discuss each topic
   - Key frameworks from those episodes
   - Best practices
   - Common pitfalls
   - When to apply

3. **Framework Library**: Extract and document all frameworks, methodologies, and models with:
   - Source (guest and episode)
   - Description
   - When to use
   - Step-by-step application
   - Examples from the transcripts
   - Related frameworks

4. **Guest Expertise Map**: For each guest, document:
   - Their expertise areas
   - Key contributions
   - Episodes they appeared in
   - What to reference them for

5. **Cross-Reference System**: Connections between:
   - Related episodes
   - Related topics
   - Related frameworks
   - Guest expertise overlaps

## Output Format

Use clear markdown structure with:
- Headings and subheadings
- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for frameworks/steps
- Tables for comparisons
- Links between related content

## Processing Instructions

1. Read through the episode data systematically
2. Extract all significant insights, frameworks, and actionable content
3. Maintain accuracy - only include what's actually in the transcripts
4. Create clear connections between related content
5. Focus on practical, applicable insights
6. Use consistent terminology throughout

## How I'll Provide the Data

The knowledge base is split into **269 individual files**, one episode per file:

**File Organization:**
- `knowledge_base_chunk_001.json` - Episode 1
- `knowledge_base_chunk_002.json` - Episode 2
- `knowledge_base_chunk_003.json` - Episode 3
- ... and so on through chunk 269 (episode 269)

**Each chunk file structure:**
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "chunk_number": 1,
    "total_chunks": 269,
    "episode_range": {"start": 1, "end": 1},
    "episodes_in_chunk": 1
  },
  "episodes": [
    {
      "id": "episode-id",
      "guest": "Guest Name",
      "title": "Episode Title",
      "transcript": "Full transcript...",
      "youtube_url": "...",
      "duration_seconds": 3600,
      "view_count": 10000,
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```

**Processing Workflow:**
1. I'll provide files one at a time (starting with chunk 001 - episode 1)
2. You process each episode completely before moving to the next
3. Build the knowledge base incrementally - add to it with each episode
4. Maintain cross-references across episodes (topics, frameworks, guests)
5. Update the master index, topic organization, and framework library as you go

**I can provide:**
- Individual chunk files (recommended - one at a time)
- Multiple chunks at once
- Reference to specific episodes within chunks

Please confirm you understand the task. Once confirmed, I'll provide the first file (`knowledge_base_chunk_001.json` - episode 1) for you to process and begin building the knowledge base.
