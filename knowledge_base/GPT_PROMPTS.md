   relevant = [ep for ep in kb['episodes'] 
               if 'product-market fit' in ep['transcript'].lower()]
   
   # Include in your prompt
   context = "\n\n".join([ep['transcript'] for ep in relevant[:3]])
   ```

2. **Use specific episode content**:

   episode = next(ep for ep in kb['episodes'] 
                 if ep['guest'] == 'Marty Cagan')
   
   # Reference it in your prompt
   prompt = f"Based on this transcript from {episode['title']}:\n\n{episode['transcript'][:5000]}\n\n[Your question]"
